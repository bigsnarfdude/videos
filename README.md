## Market Problem & Opportunity

### The Hidden Crisis in Academic Access

The global academic community faces unprecedented barriers to research participation:

**Travel & Visa Barriers (Primary Driver)**
- Academic conference visa requirements create substantial barriers, with B-1 business visas needed for most conference attendance and rejection rates varying significantly by country
- Over one-third of academic scientists (35%) experienced project delays due to visa issues, unable to visit collaborators in other countries
- Over a third of student visa applications were denied in 2022, with African students experiencing over 50% denial rates
- Despite recovery efforts, visa interview wait times still target 90 days, creating planning uncertainties for academic events

**The Re-watching Phenomenon**
Your key insight reveals that researchers increasingly rewatch recorded presentations because they:
- Cannot obtain visas to attend in person
- Face timezone conflicts for live participation  
- Experience travel budget constraints
- Need to revisit complex mathematical content multiple times
- Want to share specific segments with colleagues who also cannot travel

**AI Discovery Revolution**
- Nearly 90% of notable AI models in 2024 came from industry, but academia remains the top source of highly cited research
- AI for Science represents a paradigm shift where AI becomes a meta-technology that redefines discovery itself
- AI-powered video content analysis now enables automatic subtitling, translations, and intelligent summarization
