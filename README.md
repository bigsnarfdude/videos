## üéØ Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
The Banff International Research Station (BIRS) hosts 17,000+ mathematical lecture videos spanning 2003-2025, representing one of the world's largest repositories of mathematical research content. Currently, these videos are stored as a raw Apache directory listing at videos.birs.ca, making them effectively **undiscoverable and unusable** for researchers, students, and educators.

### Solution Overview
Transform the video archive into a modern, searchable platform that enables users to quickly discover, filter, and access relevant mathematical content through an intuitive web interface.

### Success Criteria
- **90% reduction** in time to find specific lectures (from minutes/hours to seconds)
- **100% content coverage** - all 17,000+ videos discoverable through search
- **Mobile-first responsive design** accessible on all devices
- **Sub-2-second search response times**

---

## üîç Problem Analysis

### Current State Pain Points
1. **Impossible Discovery:** Users cannot find specific lectures without knowing exact workshop codes and dates
2. **No Metadata:** Video files have cryptic names like "202408271401-Levine.mp4" with no context
3. **Poor User Experience:** Raw directory listings provide no browsing or filtering capabilities
4. **Mobile Unusability:** Directory listings are not mobile-optimized
5. **Wasted Content Value:** World-class mathematical content is effectively hidden due to poor accessibility

### User Impact
- **Researchers:** Cannot find relevant work in their field
- **Students:** Cannot discover educational content
- **Educators:** Cannot locate specific lectures for classroom use
- **BIRS:** Reduced value and impact of their significant content investment
