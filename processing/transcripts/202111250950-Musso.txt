Is uh isotopic curves in the complex quadric. Okay, and I wanted to start with an animation, but does not work because I don't see the where it is. Just okay, so I just move now on the uh uh on my iPad because I cannot show you the I cannot show you the animation right now. Just another second, please. Resume. Okay. Okay. Very well. Now I am here. So the I will speak about isotopic curves in the complex quadric. These are, as I told you before, are very classical topics in differential geometry. And more or less, what I would like to do is to apply the method of moving frame to analyze the geometry of this tropic. Of theseotropic curves in the complex quadric. This is a joint work with Lorenzo Nicolordi, which is a collaborator of mine. And you can find more or less all the contents of my talks in the paper, Conformal Geometry of Isotropic Curves in the Complex Quadric, which has been posted one month ago, more or less, on the archive. And also, I recommend, I strongly recommend for people that want to understand a little bit People that want to understand a little bit better the algebraic geometry part of the theory to consult these survey paper by Robert Bryan, which is, I don't know, it's never been published, I think, but is available on the archive. So you can consult. Then the motivation. Motivations are, I mean, personal motivation. Are I mean personal motivations are coming from three papers that have been published over the years and which are the first one is of 2001 and the second one is about that was about the Mavis geometry of surfaces of constant mean curvature in a parabolic space and then other two papers the last one is more recent and you can find on the archive it's been posted in Archive has been posted in July of the 2020. So, organization of the talk. The organization of the talk is the following. There are two first background material. Okay, the background material will concern first the definition: what is the three-dimensional complex quadric. Then I will go to isotropic curve. Will go to isotropic curves and their interrelation with the surface theory. I need to say also something about the projective structure on a Riemann surface and say something about the sympletic group Sp to C and the reducible four-dimensional sympletic representation of the unimodular group SL to C. Now, the second Now, the second part is more on moving frames. So, I will apply moving frames to investigate the basic differential invariant of isotropic curves. Then, I will distinguish between isotropic curves of general type and conformal cycle, which are, let's say, the trivial one. Then, after having at the end the differential invariance. The differential invariance of entropy curve, we can state and solve the equivalence problem deformation and rigidity. As an application, I will analyze the compact isotropic curves with constant bending. And at the end, I will state the, I will define the concept that I would like to investigate in the future. That is the conformal. That is the conformal Gusa transform and analyze a few examples. Okay, the complex quadric. So I will consider C4 with the standard symplectic form omega, which is represented by the matrix J, okay, the skew symmetric metric J and And then if I have two linearly independent vectors x and y, I denote by square x wedge y, the two-dimensional linear subspace which is spanned by x and y. If omega x and y is equal to zero, then the two-plane is said a Lagrangian plane. The Casmania. Uh, the Gazmanian of the Lagrangian planes is denoted by Q3, is a compact three-dimensional complex manifold. And if you use the standard Pluker map from the Grasmanian of the two planes in C4 into CP5, you get an embedding of Q3 as a quadric of CP4. So Q3 is just a smooth quadric of CP4. A smooth quadric of CP4 is another model for the quadric of CP4. Next, I want to introduce two charts that I will use in the SQL. The first one is the affine conformal chart. So the affine conformal chart goes from C3. You see, you take a vector of C3 with coordinates, zeta 1, zeta 2, zeta. with coordinates zeta one, zeta two, zeta three, and you send this vector in the two plane spanned by the vector e1 plus zeta one e3 plus zeta two e4 wedge e2 plus zeta two e3 plus zeta three e4. Also the image they denote by a of this map is a Zariski open subset of the quadric and actually is the complement of a singular two-dimensional quadratic Two-dimensional quadric in Q3. Now we can consider on we consider on C3 the standard holomorphic quadratic form, dzeta1 square plus dzeta two square plus dzeta three square. And we can use the inverse of my affine chart to pull back these quadratic form. This quadratic form on the quadrat, Q3. Actually, this is defined only on the open set A. And this one originates a holomorphic conformal structure on the quadric Q tree. There is a difference between the complex situation and the real situation because when you consider conformal geometry in the real case, In the real case, there is always a quadratic form globally defined which represents the conformal class. This is not anymore the case in the complex case. There are not holomorphic quadratic forms non-degenerate which can represent globally the conformal structure on the quadric. And if you have any question up to now, doesn't seem so I can go. Doesn't seem so I can go now. I need to define and I will use another why on that last page what's the what's the obstruction to the global uh oh simply uh simply I think there are there are no uh no uh non-zero holomorphic Non-zero holomorphic quadratic form on the quadric Q3. Okay. I think it's just a question of basic algebraic geometry. Okay. And compactness or something, right? Yeah, because I know on the quad, I use the quadric. The fact that it's the quadric, and there are some, I mean, and this is give the abstraction. And I think that. And I think that beside the tori, the complex tori, there are no complex manifolds, okay, which admits a globally defined holomorphic, for sure, not in the compact case. So I need a second to use a second chart, which I call the unimodular conformal chart. And this chart goes from SL2C into. L2C into another Zariski open set of the quadric that I denote by U and the map that I denote by five of U sends X, which is a two by two matrix, into the Lagrangian two plane spanned by the vector x11e1 plus x21e3 plus e4 wedge x12e1 plus e2 plus x22e3. X22E3. And okay, you can put in SL2C, all right, which is not compact, the quadratic form which arise from the Killing form of its Lie algebra. Well, this map is conformal. So this is a unimodular conformal chart of the unimodular group SL2C into the risky open subset U. The risky open subset U of the quadric. U now is the complement of a non-singular two-dimensional quadric embedded in Q3. Let me say something about the hyperbolic space. So the hyperbolic space in this context, which is denoted by H3, is realized as the set of all 2 by 2 Hermitian matrices with the terminal 1. With the terminal one. So this will be my model for the hyperbolic space. The set, the submanifold of two by two emission matrices with the terminal one. So it's intersection of SL2C with the space of remission two by two matrices. And then you can put on H3 the Riemannian metric, which is induced by the non-degenerate quadratic form on the vector space of Vector space of remission matrices, which is simply given by the determinant, and the inducer metric is as constant sectional clue to one. So now I have defined my spaces and I want, I need to introduce two vibrations, all right? Two vibrations. Now look the first vibration. Actually, pi of w is not defined on the wall of q3, but it's just defined. Q3, but it's just defined on A, on the Zarinsky open set A. This map is defined the following way. You take a point P in the quadrant Q3. Then you take the pre-image of P by the affine chart and you get a point in C3. And you take the real part. So you get a map from A to R3. Similarly, you can define another fibrillation of Another fibrillation of the quadric, more to be precise, this second fibration which I call p of pi of u pi of b is simply is defined on the Drisky open set U. And this map, you take P, a point in the quadric, then you compute the pre-image of P by the unimodulous affine chart. Affine chart. So you get two matrices in SL, you get a matrix in SL2C, and then you get this matrix times the complex transpose conjugate by himself. And you get an element in H3. These are two fibrillations from this of the risky open set of the quadric into R3 and onto the hyperbolic. At onto the hyperbolic space. The first one is a vector bundle with fiber R3, and the second one is a principal fiber bundle with the fiber SU2. Now I can define the isotropic curves. An isotropic curve in the quadric is simply a non-constant holomorphic map F from an even surface. From a Riemann surface S into the complex quadric, Q3. S is a Riemann surface, and this map does the following job. When I pull back the conformal structure of Q3, I get zero. I exclude from my discussion the trivial case of the pencils of the gendarian plane passing to a fixed line of C4. Excluding this case, Exclude in this case, we can go with the theory with the application of the moving frame. Now, I want to state two classical theorems which motivate my interest in the isotopic curves in the complex quadric. The first one is odd. It's simply the N-ne-per-Beiestras representation formula for minimal surfaces. For minimal surfaces. And the second one is a theorem proven in 1987 by Herbert Bryan. So we start with an isotropic curve in the complex quadricu-tree. Then, starting with an isotropic curve, I can build up two maps in R3 and in the hyperbolic space. The map in R3, which I call WF, is simply given by the composition of the fibrillation of the Of the fibrillation of the Q3 over R3 with F. And this map is a branch conformal immersion with H is equal to zero. So it's a minimal surface. And so essentially, if you start with a minimal surface in R3 and then you build up the isotopic curve via the Weperweisus formula, then you get essentially Then you get essentially these isotropic curves in the quadric. Similarly, if I take my F and I compose F with the vibration of Q3 over the hyperbolic space, I get a branch conformal immersion with constant H is the mean curvature, with H is equal to one. I say that W F and B F are. WF and BF are obtained by my isotropic curve F. You can ask yourself: is the converse of this theorem true? Yes, it's true, but you have to pay a price in the sense that you must have minimal immersion or constant equal to one immersion in the Euclidean space and the parabolic space, defined on a simply connected Riemann space. Riemann surface. Now, this theorem has been generalized in many other contexts. For maximum space-like surface in the Minkowski space, also for this class of immersion can be obtained by projection via order vibrations from isotropic curves in the complex quadric. Then, space-like surfaces into the sitter space. Into the CTES space with H is equal to one, again, can be built up in the same way. And this has been proved by Li in 2005. Isotropic curve also appears in the study of supraminal inversion in the fourth sphere. These are two papers by Chern and Bayon, but there are many other references. Wilmos surfaces in the three-sphere, especially like Wilmos surfaces. space like Wilmos surfaces in the Minkowski space and the conformal compactification of the Minkowski space. Then, using not the esotropic curve, but what is called the associated curve, which is a curve, a contact curve in CP3, one can generalize this game to obtain surfaces in a parabolic space with Gaussian curve to zero and surfaces with Gaussian curve to zero. Surfaces with Gaussian equivalent to zero, which are space-like into the sitter space. So you have many different applications and contexts where isotropic curves do appear. Now, I need to say something about projective structure on a Riemann surface. So I take, I denote by SL2C1 the group of unimodular upper triangular two by two. upper triangular two by two matrices. Now I take a Riemann surface S and a projective structure on S is simply a holomorphic fiber bundle with total space P over S with the structure group given by S L 2 C1. So the structure group of this bundle is given by the upper triangular two by two matrices and and I also And I also require that this bundle P is equipped with a holomorphic cation connection eta, which take values in the Lie algebra of the SL to C, of the unimodular group SL to C. Up to now, nothing new. This definition can go in any dimension, essentially, replacing that obviously SL2C1 with the appropriate subgroup. The appropriated subgroup of S, L and C. But what is specific of the two-dimensional of the one-dimensional case is the fact that the existence of an adapted complex chart. So a complex chart u zeta on my Riemann surface S is said to be adapted to my projective structure P and eta, the principal bundle and the cation connection eta. Uh, cation connection eta, if there exists a holomorphic section of my bundle such that when I pull back the my cation connection eta, this can be locally expressed by this formula. Okay? Very well. Now, the proposition is the following, that if I take a projective structure on a Riemann surface, then S admits an atlas of adapted charts. Of adapted charts. And the second fact, the transition function of these two charts of this atlas are related by a Meribius transformation. So the Atlas of the adapted charts give you a covering of holomorphic charts with transition functions and maybe transformations. In addition, every projective atlas on S can be built in this way, as the built in this way as the atlas of the data chart for some projective structure on the surface s. In the literature, projective structure are usually defined just giving a holomorphic atlas on your Riemann surface S whose transition function are Mobius transformation. Now there is a very rich literature on projective structure on Riemann surfaces. On the Riemann surfaces. I just want to recall this nice theorem of Ganning, 1967, that the projective structure on the Riemann sphere is unique. The projective structure on Riemann surface genus 1 are affine, so essentially toroid. While if you go with the Riemann surfaces of genus G bigger or equal than 2, then the projective structure are parametrized by the Are parametrized by the complex vector space of dimension 3 times g minus 1. Okay, now I state a proposition. I quoted myself and Lorenzo, but probably this is known in the literature. Simply, I don't know where to find a good reference. So if I take a projective structure given by my principal fiber bundle P and the And the Katan connection eta. And if I denote by M of P the sheaf of the Meromorphic form of the grid P, then I can define a second-order differential operator that I call D, that goes from Meromorphic differential of degree 4 to Meromorphic differential of degree 2, which is defined by this following formula, D, locally, in terms of a projective chart. Of a projective chart. So I fix my projective chart u zeta. I consider aquatic differential given by the product of H dzeta to the power of 4. H is an holomorphic function. And D acts on this holomorphic quartic differential by this formula. This is a reminiscent, okay, somehow of another differential operator that one can define. then one can define on Riemann surfaces with projective structure, which is a Schwartzian derivative. The Schwartzian derivative goes from functions to quadratic differential and is a differential operator of order three. This one is a differential operator of order two. Finally, finally, and then almost finished with the preparatory material. I don't know how much. Material. I don't know how much time is left, but so sp to c is the group is simple, it's the linear symplectic group of my symplectic form omega. It acts transitively on the quadric Q3 in obvious way. And the action of SL SP2C on the quadric preserves the conformal structure. Actually, if you take the quotient of sp2c by each Of sp2c by its center, you get the automorphism group for the conformal structure on the quadric Q3. Now you have the obvious map from SP to C into the quadric. I take A, a two by two matrix, which belongs to the symplectic group, and then I take the Lagrangian plane span by the first two vector of these bases of this matrix. And these are two plane going. And these are two-plane going Q-tree. This is holomorphic principal fiber bundle, and the structure group of this bundle is simply the isotopy subgroup of the Lagrangian two-plane spanned by the first two vectors of the standard basis of C4. The last piece of information is the irreducible four-dimensional simple representation of SL. simple representation of S L to C. Now, I take the standard four-dimensional irreducible representation of SL to C. Okay, usually how you get this representation? You take the polynomial of degree three into homogeneous polynomial of degree two into variable, which is a vector space of dimension four. And then you let SL to C acts on SL to C acts on the space of this polynomial. Well, this representation is symplectic. So it originates a monomorphism of SL2C into the group SP2C. I will identify SL2C with its image in the symplectic group. Just notice that if you take the intersection of SL2C viewed as a subgroup of SP2C with Of SP to C with the isotropy with the structure group of my fibration of SP to C over the quadric, I get the group of upper triangular two by two unimodular matrices. Okay, one has to be a little bit, pay a little attention because there are many non-equivalent copies of SL2C in the symplectic group SP2C. So the Lynn. So, the Lie algebra now of the symplectic group can split as a direct sum of the Lie algebra of the unimodula of SL to C plus its orthogonal SL to C perb, which is the orthogonal complement of the subalgebra SL to C with respect to the killing form of S P to C. So we have this splitting. Well, finally. Finally, we come to the moving frame. All right. And I take my isotropic curves for my Riemann surface as the quadric Q3. And I consider F0. F0 is just the pullback. So I have the vibration of S P to C, this vibration, and I pull back this vibration by F. This vibration by F. I get the F0, which can be realized as the pair given by a point on the surface A, which is an element of S P to C, such that F of X is given by the projection of A on Q3. Then I take phi, which is the restriction to F0 or the Marikart transform of SP2C. And I also consider. And I also consider the tautological maps from F0 to C4. Simply, so the element of S0 given by a point X on my Riemann surface A, which is a matrix in SP to C, and I send XA into the case column vector of A. Very well, now I can state my theorem. I take a isotope. I take a isotropic curve in the complex quadric, then away from the point of a divisor, I can define a reduction that I denote by pi f s of my bundle f0, while structured group is given by the upper triangular matrices in SL2C. Then what I can do? Then, then what I can do? I can take phi, okay, phi, and I take the component of phi in the Lie algebra of SL2C with respect to the splitting of the Lie algebra of S P 2 C. And I get a one form which takes values in the Lie algebra of S L to C. Very well, this one form eta is a Cartan connection, and therefore I get this. And therefore, I get this F equipped with this S L to C value one four is a projective structure on S. So the first piece of information is this. So I just split the Marikatan form in a part which stay in SL to C, and then there is which originates the Akatan connection. And then I can consider the remaining piece. The remaining piece of phi. And using this, I can construct a Meromorphic quartet differential that they call delta F, which can be defined as follows. If you look on the right-hand side, I have holomorphic form, which are defined on F. Okay, I take A4, the transpose of A4, J, the differential of A3, and I get allomortic. A3 and they get allomorphic one form on F. Similarly, if I take A1 transpose of A1J, the differential of A2, I get holomorphic one-fourth always on the total space of my bundle. And I take the power three of this. So on the right, I have meromolomorphic form of degree four. Very well, this form is projectable. This form is projectable and projects to a quadratic differential delta F, which is not holomorphic but is meromorphic. The fact that it's meromorphic depends on the fact that my bundle F is in fact defined only on the complement of a divisor. Now, so this is the first basic differential invariant of a isotropic curve in the quadric Q tree. In the quadric Q-tree. The second differential invariant is obtained from delta using my differential operator D. So using delta and my differential operator D, I can define gamma, which is a quadratic differential. If you go through the step of the construction, delta F, the quadratic differential, is a differential invariant. Is a differential invariant of all the six, while gamma, which is the quadratic differential, is a differential invariant of all the eight. Okay, can you somebody tell me how much time is left? About 10 minutes. Very well. Okay. Now I take my entropic curve, I construct. Curve, I constructed these two invariants, delta F and gamma F, the quartic differential and the quadratic differential. And I said by F is a general type if the quartic differential delta is not identically zero. When the quantity differential is identically zero, I will call my curve a conformal cycle. If your tropic curve is of general type, then you can consider the ratio of the quadratic differential to the power 2, gamma to the power 2, and divide by delta F. So you get a neuromorphic function on S, which is called the conformal bending of F. Okay, now obviously, two isotropic. Now, obviously, two isotropic curves in the quadric are conformally congruent. I can, if there exists a linear simpleton transformation such that F is equal to A acting on F. Okay, now I can characterize the conformal cycles. The conformal cycles are congruent to the twisted cubic of C3. The twisted cubic of C3. Okay, if you look here on the right, you have the curves of C3, which is one-third z to the power three minus one-half z to the power two z. And then you take, you using your affine coordinates, you go in the quadric and you get this f. So essentially, f is a twisted cubic when you express f using When you express F using the affine coordinate system that I defined at the beginning of the talk. Now, the conformal cycle are the orbits of the SL2 action on the quadric. And if I consider the Euclidean projection of this cycle, I get simply the n-napress surface, a minimal surface, which is the n-appress surface. Which is the n-upper surface. Actually, the conformal cycle are the maximally symmetric isotropic curve. They are invariant by a three-dimensional group of conformal transformations. Okay. Now I can say theorem B. This had two isotropic curves. said the two isotropic curves, F and F in the quadric Q tree, are conformally congruent if and only if they have the same quadratic and quantity differential. So a quadratic and quantity differential is a complete set of local differential or differential holomorphic differential invariant for isotropic curves in the quadric. Now I want to apply Apply the moving frame to discuss the deformation problem. I just simply recall the definition. I take two holomorphic maps, F and F, for my Riemann surface into a complex homogeneous space G over H. Obviously, this definition can work more generally in the smooth category. In the smooth category, these two maps are said to be kthord deformation, each of the order. You can find an holomorphic map A on S star. S star is simply S minus a divisor on G such that if I fix any point P in S star, In a star, and I consider F hat and AP acting on F, these two have analytic contact of order K at the point P. The deformation itself is said to be trivial if it is conformally congruent to M. Very well. Now, each isotropic curve of general type has locally non-trivial fourth order Non-trivial fourth-order deformation, all of them of general type. And this deformation depends on an arbitrary Meromorphic function. While we have rigidity at order five, in the sense that you have my isotropic curve, which is of general type, and the fifth-all the deformations of F are trivial. Conformally congruent to F. So we have, let's say, deformability up to order 4 and then we have rigidity at order 5. Okay, now I want to close with this example, which is very classical. I consider, okay, the Okay, a class of isotropic curve, which is known as W curve, is a classical subject. And I define again to define these isotopic curves, I use the affine charts. So essentially, it's better if you just contemplate the definition on the right-hand side. And so I take a rational number, m over n, which is. Number m over n, which is bigger than one, and it's different than three. Then I denote by epsilon of q is this epsilon of q is simply one if n plus n is even and is two if n plus n is odd. And then using q, I can define these isotropic curves that was the definition is the following one in terms of the affine coordinates. of the affine coordinates is given by n plus n divided n minus n zeta to the power to n multiply epsilon of q so to one or the zeta m or zeta to m depending is if epsilon q is one or two the second one is two i square root mn divided by m minus n theta to the power n plus n multiply epsilon q divided by n n multiply epsilon q divided by 2. So this epsilon q divided by 2 is exactly one half when m plus n is even and is one when m plus n is odd. And finally, the last component of my curve is n plus n divided by n minus n theta n to the power epsilon times epsilon. The power times epsilon of q. This is an isotropic embedding and is called the standard W curve with parameter q. More generally, a W curve with parameter Q is any isotropic curve which is congruent to F. Okay, first, the W curve with parameter Q has constant bending. And here it's just a computation. You compute the constant bending, you compute the You compute the bending, and you find this constant. It's a negative constant, which can be expressed in terms of this rational parameter Q. But what is important is if I take a compact isotropic curve with constant bending, this is congruent to W curve. All other curves with constant bending are not compact. The only one are those which are congruent to the W curve. Are those which are congruent to the W curve? And I think that I can squeeze the example and just finish my talk, okay, with the definition of the conformal Gusa transform and then perhaps to explain very shortly where I want to go with my project. So I consider two. So I consider two surfaces, phi and phi h, in artery or in the hyperbolic space, which are either minimal or with constant equal to one. And I suppose that f and f are tamed by isotopic curves f and f. I say that these two surfaces are conformal Gussat transformation, each other if the isotopic curves If the esotropic curves F and F are congruent with respect to the symplectic group, this definition generalizes the classical notion of Gusat transformation of minimal surfaces in R3 and also generalize the concept of hyperbolic Gusat transform for constant equal to one surface in the hyperbolic space. Okay, now what Okay, now what will be my goal in the future? It's the following. First, I would like to express gamma and delta, the two holomorphic differential invariant of an isotropic curve in the quadric, using the Riemannian invariant of the surfaces in a tree or in a tree. Surfaces in R3 or in the hyperbolic space that I obtain projecting my F into R3 or into the hyperbolic space. And once this computation is done, I want to use this computation to understand directly when two surfaces or minimal surfaces in a tree or CMC1 surfaces in H3 are good transfer. Are goods that transform each other. Another possible issue is the following: minimal surfaces and constant mean one surfaces in H3 are the basic example of integrable system in differential geometry. And they possess a very rich transformation theory. There are several transformations, the About transformation. Transformation, the Abu transformation, the T transformation of Gianke, and the Christoffel transformation. Anyway, I would like to understand this transformation, which take place into R3 or in the hyperbolic space, using the isotopt in the quadric Q3. So I would like to see if it is possible to say something about this transformation for surface. Transformation for surfaces in a tree or in a parabolic space using transformations for isotopic curves in the complex quadrature Q-tree. And I think that that's all. I apologize because I don't find my pencil, so my exposition has been a little bit missing of something, but I think this is. I think this is all what I want to say. So, thank you very much for your attention. Any questions for Emilio? Well, if there's no other question, then let's thank Emilio one more time. Thank you very much. And wish a good Thanksgiving to everyone. Okay? Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you very much. So now the man is to have a 25-minute coffee break until 11 a.m. at least mountain time.
