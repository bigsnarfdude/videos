 Where's frozen here? It's that window you were putting. There we go. I don't think I have to tell folks why insulin is important. It's a circulating hormone that's responsible for energy homeostasis in the body. Turns out sugar is actually toxic to people if it's in the blood. So getting too much sugar in your bloodstream is a bad day. This is ketoacidosis. So insulin is the hormone that helps remove sugar from your bloodstream and get it into the cells where it's useful and not toxic. One of the interesting things about insulin, as with a number of circulating hormones, Insulin, as with a number of circulating hormones, is that it is highly titratable. So, when you look at the pancreas, the pancreas sees blood sugar and responds by secreting insulin in a very tightly controlled dose-dependent way. You put a little bit of sugar in, you get a little bit of insulin out. You put a lot of sugar in, you get a lot of insulin out. So there's been a lot of work over the decades doing kind of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics sort of modeling of insulin at the systemic level, the whole organism level. That's not what I'm going to be talking about. That's not what I'm going to be talking about. I'm going to be talking about kind of zooming down to the level of an individual cell in the pancreas, the beta cell, and looking at how the beta cell regulates insulin. So this is a picture of the inside of a beta cell where each of these granules, each of these dark spots, is a package of insulin. So when you think about secreting something, typically secretory cells don't just secrete protein, they secrete packages of protein. They package them up into a vesicle. Here we're going to call Into a vesicle. Here we're going to call it a granule. That's the basic lingo in this field. And then they exocytose the granules so that they can ship out a lot at one time without having to shuttle every individual copy of a protein out. So these dark spots are insulin packages. They're insulin granules. For reference, the scaled bar down here on the left is a half micron. So they're about 200 to 300 nanometers in size. It's kind of the prototypical size of these. And when you start to think about that from a size scale, that's pretty big for. That's pretty big for you know for at the size of a cell. So big, in fact, that these vesicles really don't move on their own. They're not going to diffuse under basic thermal fluctuations, or they're going to do so with extremely long time scales. So we're going to be interested in looking at the trafficking problem, how these things are trafficked around the cell. Now, the end goal of this field is to understand insulin secretion, but secretion is a Insulin secretion, but secretion is a complicated process. There's extracellular signaling, basically, you wash the cells in glucose. There's a lot of intracellular signaling, in particular, there's a lot of calcium-based signaling. There's exocytosis, but in order for secretion to happen, a precursor is that you have to actually get insulin close to the membrane and you have to allow that to physically dock to the membrane by something like a SNAR protein. So, what I'm going to be looking at here is trying to understand how cells Understand how cells regulate the physical localization of insulin within the cell. And what we're really going to be interested in is how do they control how much is kind of close to the membrane. That's the available stuff. Anything that's in the interior of the cell, it doesn't matter what you do to the cell. It's not going to secrete that stuff. It's going to secrete the stuff that's kind of hanging around near the membrane and ready to go. And this is a trafficking problem. This is regulating where this stuff is. At the end of the day, these packages. Of the day, these packages are constructed in the Golgi, in the interior of the cell. The Golgi, for those of you that aren't familiar, I certainly wasn't until I kind of got into this, is the Amazon warehouse of the cell. It's where basically secretory vesicles are packaged up for the most part. But they're in the interior of the cell. And these vesicles, and just like any other vesicle for that matter, eventually has to get to the boundary, has to get to the membrane. And the question is, how is that regulated? And it's been known. And it's been known, so that's the question we're going to be looking at. What regulates the intracellular insulin localization, insulin, intracellular insulin localization and availability for release? So we're not looking at the exocytosis problem, we're looking at the localization problem here. And it's been known for 50 plus years that microtubules, which of course are involved in trafficking, have a significant role in insulin regulation. Role in insulin regulation. So the three papers on the left here are from the 70s, 2015, 2012, and a bunch in the middle. The point here is that it's been known for roughly 50 years that if you manipulate microtubules in pancreatic beta cells, then you substantially alter insulin secretion. What hasn't really been known is why. So, you know, you're all familiar with images like this. Microtubules are catnip for physicists and mathematicians. For physicists and mathematicians and people that like to study active matter and nonlinear processes. So, you know, if you look at images like this for most of your life, you can say, hey, you know, these are structured networks, and oftentimes these structured networks are utilized for transport. So kind of the hypothesis that hung around for a while is that, okay, you're constructing these packages in the middle of the cell. You have to get them to the parameter. So yeah, microtubules, they must be a structure array that facilitates transport. Structure array. Transport. Structure array that facilitates transport. The problem is that while, yes, microtubule networks look like this in a lot of cells, in pancreatic cells, they're a mess. It's completely random. You can look at angular distributions at different points, and angular distributions are uniform. There's not really any structure. So there's not a structured array. And furthermore, you can do single particle tracking, and sure, there are ways to get directed transport on random networks. Transport on random networks, but you don't have that here. If you do single particle tracking, it's random motion. It's sub-diffusion, basically. The second problem is the basic premise that you need trafficking. So if you look at an image like this, and then you go dig out some numbers and do a little bit of napkin math, you can find that roughly 25% of the entire volume of a beta cell is occupied by insulin. That's the total volume, it's not the available volume. You throw out the nucleus, you throw out various other organelles, and you start. The organelles, and you start to realize that a large chunk of the cell is actually occupied by these things. There are thousands of these vesicles, they're 200 to 300 nanometers in diameter. It's not hard to work it out. There's a lot of. So sure, they're not going to move around under random diffusion, but steric effects just bumping into each other, making space as they get built, would probably distribute these things fairly well throughout the cell. So the basic premise that you would even need transport is. Even need transport is questionable. So there's a bit of a conundrum here. So insulin is randomly trafficked on a seemingly random network of filaments. It's everywhere. There's a lot of it. You don't really need to traffic it necessarily. And yet, if you perturb microtubules and you perturb trafficking, you strongly perturb insulin secretion. So this is what got me interested in this question, is that this is not just vanilla transport from point A to point B. There's something a little odd. There's something a little odd going on here. And that was what I've been interested in trying to understand. So I'll say all of this work is joint work with Kavarina's lab in cellular developmental biology. I'll be talking about some experiments in this talk. All of the experiments were done out of her lab. So in order to try and get at this, what we did is we developed a family of models. So I'm only going to talk about one of them, but we basically developed two-dimensional agent-based models, three-dimensional agent-based models, continuum PD models. Models, continuum PD models, they all show basically the same thing. So I'm just going to keep it simple here and talk about the talk about the agent-based model. So what we have here is a trafficking problem. There are a couple of elements. You can have trafficking on microtubulus, motor-based trafficking. You can have actin-based trafficking. We know that if you knock out the microtubulous cytoskeleton, you do still get active transports, actin-based active transport. So we're going to kind of include both of those. We're going to kind of include both of those. We're going to include the fact that motors can bind and unbind from microtubules. We're going to include the fact that when these cells are stimulated with glucose, docking molecules in the cell membrane become activated. So, you know, membrane docking, it turns out, is a fairly important thing. That's a precursor to exocytosis, by the way, so it's something that's of interest. So we're kind of incorporating all these things. Now, as with any model, there are a lot of details. Model, there are a lot of details. And some of the important ones, kind of to caveat up front here, is we are working with a dynamic microtubule network, like individual filaments, but we are not working with dynamic individual filaments. So for the thousands of filaments in this picture, we're kind of destroying and rebuilding them in a dynamic fashion, but we're not doing the full dynamic instability of every filament. It's just not necessary. I looked at it later. It doesn't make a difference. So we're nucleating filaments, but we're not actually doing. Filaments, but we're not actually doing like the polymerization, the full polymerization dynamics of each filament. Actin, we do have actin-based transport, but we're not putting an actin network back there. It's just not feasible for whole cell dynamics. There's also no reason to believe that doing all of, at the level that we're looking, that modeling every individual actin filament is going to help you because actin-based transport is a random process here. It does not look ballistic. Which brings me to another caveat. Which brings me to another caveat. This is obviously motor-based transport. We've got hundreds of thousands of vesicles, we've got thousands of microtubules. Each of these vesicles is probably decorated with multiple motors of different types that have different properties. That's a very difficult problem if you wanted to try and do individual steps. Also, I'll come back, but if you look at mean squared displacement, nothing looks ballistic in this. It's all sub-diffusive, it's not super-diffusive. It's not super diffusive. You can't see the properties of individual motor motions in this data. If you start looking at fine-grained tracks, you might be able to see, you know, a couple hundred milliseconds at a time that might look ballistic, but the gross behavior is not processive transport. So when we talk about transport, microtope-based transport, we're not modeling every individual motor and the tug-of-war and competition between motors. We're really looking at random transport processes. At random transport processes along the filament network. I'll also say we don't actually even know where the plus and minus M's are. Our collaborators working on that. The difficulty is that all of the data in order for this to be particularly relevant has to come out of pancreatic islets. So these are not cell lines. These are actually excise tissues that are plated, excise tissues from a mouse that are plated and image. So it's all just more difficult experimentally. So I know that there's good ways to tag plus and minus ends. Ways to tag plus and minus ends, but it doesn't necessarily translate as easily to mouse models. So we don't even know where the plus and minus ends of the microtubules in imaging actually are yet. I think we'll get there in the next year or two, but that's not my business. So fortunately, we actually have a lot of information about the transport process. So there's actin-based transport, there's microtubule-based transport. You can knock one of those out and you can look at the other selectively. And you can knock the other out and you can look at one selectively. So what we've got here. So, what we've got here is we've got basically mean square displacements for control. The different shades are just glucose-stimulated, glucose-unstimulated. And then we've got, if you just knock everything out, get rid of actin, get rid of microtubules, you'll notice that there is no motion. So, I mean, again, that's just the reflection of the fact that these vesicles are huge on relative cellular scales, and they just are not going to move around under thermal fluctuations. But then, you've got the green curves, or where you're not going. Green curves are where you knock out actin and you get fast transport because it's all microtubule transport. And then you knock out microtubules and you get slow transport because it's all actin transport. And then you'll notice the kind of the blue curve here, the control curve, sits in between. This actually allows us to calibrate the characteristics of these models quite nicely. So we can calibrate the, this is called cytoplasmic, but it's really just actin-based diffusion. We can calibrate the actin-based diffusion properties. We can calibrate the microtubule. Properties. We can calibrate the microtubules. And by looking at, if you think about the mixed mode where you can move under both selectively, it's kind of an interpolation between the two extremes. So by looking at that interpolation, you can actually get some information about residency time. So what fraction of the time do you spend undergoing these different types of motions? So you can effectively calibrate everything that you want to do to know about the trafficking. So if you're talking about sub diffusion, you've got. So if you're talking about sub diffusion, you've got basically you've got a couple of parameters in that model, and you can calibrate those parameters quite nicely. But anybody that's put a model together, you'll know that there are always many things you have to take into account. There's the ones that you want to put in and you think are important, and then there's the ones like, well, this is just something in order to actually get the model up and running on a computer, you have to deal with. You think of this kind of nuisance variable, so to speak, that you have to deal with. You just got to make sure that. You have to deal with. You just got to make sure that what you're doing doesn't affect the outcome. One of those variables here was: okay, we're growing a microtubule network in these cells effectively. Again, we're not doing like the dynamic instability of polymerization, but we are kind of building a dynamic network in a sense, kind of a mean-filled dynamic network, if you will. What does the structure of that look like? Well, on the interior, we know it looks random. But what happens when the microtubules interact with the structure? Let's say the cell membrane in the cell? At the end of the day, Membrane in the cell. At the end of the day, what we're going to be interested in here is what regulates the amount of insulin at the membrane. So it's important to understand, or it's important to account for what the structure of that microtubule network might look like near the membrane. Unfortunately, we have no data about this. And you can imagine a couple of scenarios. Let's say a microtubule runs into the membrane. One scenario is that it can, well, three scenarios, catastrophe, stall, or continue to grow in an alignment. Or continue to grow in an aligned way with the cell membrane. All are reasonable. And of course, it's not one, the other. You could have some probabilistic outcome where when you reach a boundary, you have probabilities of these different outcomes. But you can imagine that you could have a very kind of weakly aligned network. So when I say aligned, I mean aligned relative to the membrane. Or you could end up with a fairly highly aligned network. And we had no idea what this network was. And we had no idea what this network looks like at the periphery. We only had data for what it looked like in the interior based on the imaging data that we had available at the time. And it's random in the interior, so there's no big deal there. I didn't necessarily think this is going to be important, but again, it's one of those things, like you have to put a line of code in that says what this is going to do and what it's going to look like, and you have to make sure that what you do there doesn't make a difference. Unfortunately, it does make a difference. So, what we're looking at here is we're looking at So, what we're looking at here is we're looking at the amount of insulin at the periphery of the cell. So, what we're doing is we're drawing a 250 nanometer band around the silico cell and we're calculating how much insulin is in that 250 nanometer band. That's the band where something would be available to dock to the membrane and be secreted. As a function of basically that nuisance variable that I was talking about, which is kind of how well aligned that microtubule network is near the periphery. And what you find is the more aligned it is, the more of a deficit of Is the more of a deficit of insulin you get at the membrane. We're really interested in quantifying the amount of insulin. I see the look. We'll get there in a minute. We're interested in quantifying how much insulin shows up near the membrane, and it looks like this is pretty important. And the more microtubules you put in the system, the worse it gets, basically. The worse that alignment effects becomes. Like when you don't have many microtubules, this gold curve, the level of alignment doesn't really matter that much. But if you put a lot more microtubules in, the level of alignment matters. Microtubules in the level of alignment matters a lot more. More microtubules makes this effect even stronger. So, we wanted to take a look at what's going on here. So, insulin in these cells can be trafficked in two ways. They can be trafficked along a microtubule network, or they can be trafficked independent of the microtubule network. We're calling it actin, but for the purpose of this model, it's essentially just a microtubule-independent trafficking mechanism. It's actin, but again, we're not modeling all the actin filaments. We're not modeling all the actin filaments. So it turns out that what's going on here is that when you have all of these microtubules at the periphery, what it's doing is it's serving as a sponge and it's soaking up unbound insulin. So basically, when you get more microtubules near the periphery, just sterically, it's more likely that you're going to bind to a microtubule. But it does not increase the amount of bound stuff. It just decreases the amount of unbound stuff. So the fact that, oh yeah, you're just going to bind more of this stuff, that makes Going to bind more of this stuff, that makes sense. But the fact that you don't increase the amount over here, that you don't increase the amount of bound insulin, is actually a little weird. And what's going on here, and this took us close to a month to figure out what was going on, is if you take a look at the radial distribution of these different populations of insulin, the stuff that's being actively trafficked by microtubles and the stuff that's being trafficked independently of microtubles, they basically form counter-propagating gradients. What do things do? Propagating gradients. What do things do? They flow down gradients. So, what you have is you have this blue gradient near the membrane is the gradient of stuff that's being trafficked independently of insulin. So, effectively, stuff is flowing towards the cell membrane when it's unbound, and it's flowing away from the cell membrane when it's being trafficked by microtubules. Now, that's a little weird because the hypothesis kind of originally was that microtubules would help get stuff to the membrane, whereas Stuff to the membrane, whereas what we're saying here is it's actually taking stuff away from the membrane. So basically, if you could think about the life cycle of an insulin molecule, like you're riding along on an insulin molecule, you're kind of mosing on along, you're not on a microtubule, but you're flowing down a gradient, effectively, towards the membrane. You get towards the membrane, you encounter this aligned bundle of microtubules, you bind to it, but now there's a gradient pointing in the opposite direction that causes you to predominantly flow in that direction. Alright? Now, this is. Now, this is a little out there, but so the basic hypothesis is that the peripheral organization of the microtubule network matters. If you have this kind of alignment, that alignment is going to lead to a scenario where microtubules are predominantly removing insulin from the cell periphery, leading to a deficit of insulin at the cell periphery. Now, there are a number of things that we can look at here. There are a number of things that we can look at here. And there are going to be four pieces of supporting experimental evidence. The first is: okay, is there even a structure to the peripheral network? Okay, so our collaborators went back, they did some really nice imaging, superres of fixed eyelets. So these are actual islets. These are not cell lines, they're eyelets from, you know, they're excised from the mice. And what they're going to do is at different points, they're going to pick points in the interior of the cell, and they're going to pick points within 500 nanometers of the cell. Points within 500 nanometers of the membrane, and they're going to take every microtubule and they're going to quantify its alignment relative to the nearest patch of membrane. When you look in the interior, so this is looking at points in the interior of the cell, you see a uniform angular distribution. It's random in the interior. We already knew that. But when you look near the periphery of the cell, so zero degrees is aligned parallel to the membrane, 90 is perpendicular, you see a two and a half fold enrichment of microtubules that are actually aligned parallel to the membrane. Microtubules that are actually aligned parallel to the membrane. So the basic kind of hypothesis there is that if you have a structured network near the periphery, kind of an aligned array of microtubules that sit in that sub-membrane region, then something interesting will happen. Well, we do have that structure. Another really cool experiment that our collaborators did is, unfortunately, when you apply something like nicotazole, you just, it's gross effects on the cell. So, what Irina did is she performed some experiments that Performed some experiments that selectively manipulate the microtubules that are sitting kind of in that submembrane region. A particular molecule, tau, which hangs around on membrane in these cells. Tau stabilizes microtubules, predominantly those that are near tau, that are sitting under the membrane. So what they did is they quantified the radial density profile of insulin in both the control cell and in the cell where they have effectively turned tau off, which is going to Tau off, which is going to semi-selectively at least destabilize microtubules in that kind of important region. What you see is in the control case, the gray curve here, you have a deficit of insulin at the membrane. Again, those microtubules are soaking stuff up and removing it from the membrane. You see that deficit in the control condition. But when you get rid of those, you see an enrichment near the cell membrane. Basically, the slope of that curve changes. So when you remove that peripheral kind of So when you remove that peripheral kind of set of microtubules sitting under the membrane, but predominantly leave the ones in the interior of the cell intact, so that you don't just grossly affect the morphology of the cell, what you see is you see a flipping of this peripheral deficit to a peripheral enrichment, which is what you would expect if that population of microtubules were predominantly pulling stuff away. You can also actually just look at the kinetic rates. So, what they did here is they took So, what they did here is they took islets and they performed turf imaging. Again, you're interested in what's happening near the membrane, put it on a cover slip, do turf imaging so you can see what's going on near the membrane. What they're doing is they're looking at the appearance and disappearance of bright spots, bright spots being insulin. So you can actually look at the rate of arrival of insulin to the cell membrane and the rate of withdrawal of insulin from the cell membrane. Again, the hypothesis here is that microtubules predominantly facilitate Predominantly facilitate withdrawal. Of course, they're going to facilitate arrival, but they're going to facilitate withdrawal even more because there's going to be a net flux away, basically. So control, deplymerization of the entire microtubular cytoscope, the nicotazole. What you'll see is in control, your imbalance, the homeostasis, and when you ablate the microtubule cytoscales, everything slows down. This isn't that surprising. Microtubule transport is the fast form of transport. You get rid of them, you just slow everything down because all you have left is out. You just slow everything down because all you have left is actin-based transport. But what's interesting is while you get maybe a 25% reduction in the arrival rate, you get a 50% reduction in the withdrawal rate, which suggests that in fact these microtubules are predominantly having an impact on the removal of insulin from the periphery of the cell. Of course, you know, you take them away and you slow down the arrival as well, but that's just because you're slowing the kinetics of the entire system down. And this is more than just an academic exercise. Just an academic exercise. So, if you look at the microtubule network and diabetic mouse models, I mean, so you have a normal mouse over here and you have a diabetic mouse. I forget the exact number, but you're looking at something like a 1.8 or a two-fold increase in the number of microtubules in a diabetic mouse. So, again, what's the working hypothesis here? More microtubules lead to more withdrawal. If you go back to that first curve, I said if we take a look at the curve. Draw. If you go back to that first curve, I said if we double the number of microtubules, the microtubule depletion at the periphery actually gets worse, not better. Well, diabetic mice have roughly twice as many microtubules as normal mice, which would make you think that it would actually lead to even more of a deficit near the periphery. In the interest of time, I'm just going to skip through this. Well, so what's the moral of the story here? Microtubules are effectively acting like a sponge. Effectively acting like a sponge. They're soaking up insulin near the periphery of the cell and then they're removing it. That's a form of negative regulation. I'm going to skip over it in the interest of time, but it turns out that they're also negatively regulating the availability of the stuff that's left over. Again, if you think about it, if you have this kind of submembrane bundle of microtubules, most of the insulin that's near the periphery of the cell is going to actually be bound to a microtubule. To the microtubule for most of its life because there's just more stuff there. And it's going to have traction forces that those motors are applying to it. Well, you might think that those traction forces might prevent the stable docking of these things to the membrane. And we don't have direct imaging to support this, but we can look at how different combinations of manipulations, so different titrations of glucose, different titrations of nicotazole, how they interact. Caudazole, how they interact. And what you can do is using modeling to demonstrate, at least indirectly, that it appears that insulin that is actually bound and being actively transported by the microtubule network are less able to stably dock to the cell membrane. So the microtubules are doing two stuff, two things. They're soaking up a bunch of insulin and taking it away from the cell membrane, get rid of it, get rid of it. And then the stuff that's left over, they're actually making it hard for that stuff to actually dock to the membrane. That stuff to actually dock to the membrane, which is a precursor to secretion. So, two forms of negative regulation. So, kind of, this is the picture. You've got this kind of peripherally structured array of microtubules is creating this kind of counter-propagating phenomenon where stuff predominantly is carried to the membrane by non-microtubule transport and removed by microtubule-based transport. And there's quite a lot of indirect and direct supporting evidence of that at this point. But these microtubules are all. But these microtubules are also preventing the stable docking of insulin to the periphery. Now, this all sounds like negative regulation. Everything here is trying to make sure that insulin doesn't get out. And it's kind of the opposite of what people had thought for quite a while microtubules might do, which is kind of the standard trafficking problem. And when you really think about it, this makes a fair amount of sense. What I told you is that there's tons of insulin in these cells. What I didn't tell you is that. Insulin in these cells. What I didn't tell you is that almost none of it ever gets secreted. So if you take a cell and you wash it in sugar, even non-physiologically high levels of sugar, they'll secrete somewhere between 1 and 5% of their insulin. 5 being a very high estimate, more than likely 1 to 3 percent. So if you're talking about physiological conditions, you've got a ton of insulin, almost none of it ever gets secreted. You don't need positive regulation. You need negative regulation. You need to make sure not too much of it gets out. And what we're Too much of it gets out. And what we're seeing here is that microtubule-based trafficking, just through the basic structure of the network that's arising and the way that network interacts with the membrane, is providing multiple forms of negative regulation that help reduce how much of this stuff gets out. Now, in normal circumstances, maybe that's a good thing, but when you start looking at diabetic mouse models where you amp up the number of microtubules, maybe you overdo it. Microtubules, maybe you overdo it. We're not sure about that, but that's kind of the working idea here. And we've done a lot of work. I'm not going to go into it. We've done a lot of work in looking at how these microtubulal networks are constructed. It turns out they're really interesting networks because they're not nucleated from the microtubulal organizing center. They're actually nucleated from the Golgi apparatus and they have quite distinct properties. So there's a lot of interesting stuff there that we're going into now. We're also looking Into now. We're also looking at the actual secretion process. It turns out that insulin secretion appears in kind of like puncta along the cell membrane. We're trying to understand what leads to the formation of those puncta. So it's not just secreted everywhere. You might secrete 15 granules, but seven of them were right here, sort of thing. So there's a lot of interesting avenues that we're looking at here where trafficking seems to be particularly important in regulating insulin. But I will call the day there. But I will call the day there, skip over a bunch of slides, and thank the folks that were involved. So, all of the experiments that were done here were out of Arena's lab. These are the postdocs and students in her lab that did all that work. And just a shameless plug, I'm looking for two postdocs, one working on this sort of stuff and one working in more general kind of computational systems biology. So I will call it there and take questions. There and take questions. All right, I don't see any particular reason to do this in any sort of order, and I see some hands up in the virtual side. So Veronica, do you have a question? Can we get the mic switched over? Yeah, that's the reason. That has to turn remote. That has to turn in. All right. Well, how about until that? Uh, an interesting question. Um, Bill, you've got these huge granules inside a cell, and you've got all this actin and multitudines. Doesn't all this mesh work prevent granules from being able to get anywhere? Yes, on short time scales. So on short time scales, you do see kind of continuous time random walk sorts of trapping. Time random walk sorts of trapping. When you look on kind of longer time scales, like when you look on kind of steady-state time scales, that stuff sort of works itself out because the really hard problem here is that this is a very dynamic microtubule network. So the microtubules are being dragged around by other microtubule motors. So the microtubules are sliding around all over the place. They've got imaging of this. We really want to look at it. That's really hard. At it, that's really hard to model. So, modeling like this: the actual steric effects are just insanely complicated in a system like this, which is why I was asking about that Medain system, whether they could do anything with vesicles. So, yes, they do get trapped. You can see small sections of time where their mean squared displacement kind of stops and then kind of moves along. So, you see little sections of trapping, you see small sections of ballistic motion. Sections of ballistic motion, but if you look on sufficiently long time scales, most of it just looks like sub diffusion. So that's what we're working with at the moment until we can do better. Sorry, I hate to eyes in the back of your head. I was just curious about something like type 2 diabetes. Do you see a change in the microtubular ray? Because there it's a problem with the release of the With the release of the answer. So, my understanding is: so, there are multiple presentations of diabetes, even within the types. There's source problems and then there's sink problems. So, the source problem is the beta cells are a problem. The sink problem is that the insulin in your bloodstream can't get into muscle cells, basically. Type 2, my understanding is that a lot of the presentation of that is actually a sink problem. It's not a production of insulin problem necessarily, but it can be a A problem of insulin basically basically the cell are getting clogged up and it's hard to get insulin into the source or into the sink cells. So the short answer is no, I don't know about because I'm not aware of imaging of type 2 diabetic mice. You presumably could just do that, just feed them a really crappy diet for a long time. And I'm pretty sure they've done that. They just haven't necessarily done the imaging. But the longer answer is that. But the longer answer is that I think type 2 can be a little bit more complicated because it's not necessarily always a problem with the beta cells, but can be a problem with the receiving cells. Are there pathologies that are involved with release of insulin? Yeah. Yeah. And again, do you know if the microtubular rate is perturbed in those cases? Is that a structure? Well, so the diabetic mice that I showed you, those were diabetic mice that secrete way less insulin and they have twice as many microtubules. Insulin and they have twice as many microtubules. Yeah, so a lot of the experiments that I showed you have also been performed in these diabetic mouse models to demonstrate that it's not just a microtubule perturbation, but it's a microtubule perturbation that leads to a reduction in secretion. So I was just wondering trying to infer like fluxes from steady-state distributions just made made me wonder like it's consistent with I wonder, like, it's consistent with what you're saying, but can you actually visualize the fluxes? And I guess the main thing I was thinking about is actually measuring insulin secretion when you make these perturbations. Oh, yes. So I didn't get into it. So first of all, yes, you can measure fluxes. That's the turf imaging. So it's flux into the field of view and out of the field of view. But yes. And then that matches up with insulin secretion, too. Yes. Okay. So. Yes. Okay. So let me get my slide here. So what we had here is: okay, so this is: you ablate the microtubular side of skeleton, you see a lot more arrival than you do disappearance. And what you see is if you look at tervimaging, you get an actual accumulation of insulin. And I don't have the data in here, but basically when these things come out, they've got a fluorazine tag. So that when the insulin gets released, there's a bright spot of basically, there's another bright spot. There's another bright spot that appears upon secretion. So, this is your glucose plus nicotazole right here. You get a drastic excess of insulin in the turf field. And then if you look at an actual measure of secretion, you do get considerably more secretion when you have considerably more insulin. Okay. Yeah, I was pointing out the risk of interpreting fluxes from death. Irina is very careful. Yeah, okay. Is there an idea of how this discovery? Is there an idea of how this discovery could help with diagnosis or treatment of diabetes? Because it's not like you can go in and double the number of study, study, study, study, study. So that's a tough answer. I mean, going to clinic is always a tough thing. What I will say is that it does open up the possibility of trying to think about another pathway for drug targets, which is things that manipulate trafficking. So we've actually gone down another route of trying to look at. Down another route of trying to look at how is this microtubule constructed, and can we figure out for all of the various molecules that impact it, can we figure out what exactly those molecules change about the construction of the network? So that was the second part of this talk that I didn't get to. But yeah, we started looking at, for example, the construction of the network, and we started trying to do like model-based parametric inference to try and figure out what the effects of different molecules are on the kind of like the structure of the network and everything. But so, yeah, is it going to get into clinic? I have no idea. But it does provide a pathway to say: okay, we know trafficking is important, and we now have tools to kind of look at how different molecules affect the construction and the dynamics of that network. And maybe someday somebody will find a use from that. Okay, we've got three questions, and it looks like the audio is switched over, so Veronica asks. Veronica asks you. Yeah, I was wondering, Bill, about if anything is known about the actin that work in the pancreatic cells, is it everywhere? Is it localized next to the periphery? In some cells, it is localized next to the periphery. So at first, I thought maybe in your system there's sort of a handoff from microtubules to actin there and it gets anchored in some way. And I know you had membrane tethering in. And I know you had membrane tethering in your model, but maybe that's not the case. So it's been a while since I've looked at that particular imaging. Yeah, actin's kind of throughout the cell, and whether there is an alignment near the periphery, I don't know. That sort of angular analysis in these whole-mounted eyelets, I'm not sure that's something that's available at this point in time. So, yeah, no, actin is not just localized. So if you ablate Just localized. So, if you ablate the microtubule cytoskeleton and you look at the motions of particles in the interior of the cell, they are still undergoing actin-based transport, and that transport looks more or less the same if you look four microns into the interior of the cell versus two microns into the interior of the cell. Now, if you were to get into that half-micron region, not really sure. Okay, let's do Melissa first and then Oliver. Okay, so I don't know if I just missed this, but with the outbound flow, what down the concentration gradient, how is that executed if the granules are too large to diffuse? So what's driving that outbound flow? So it's so the detailed answer is that when they're bound to the microtubule network, they are being moved along that network. That network. But if you were to look at the radial distribution of that insulin that is actively bound to the network, it happens to form a gradient that points away from the membrane. So the motion itself is still motor-driven, but the reason it's moving away from the membrane is because the motor-driven motion happens to be occurring along a gradient that points away from the boundary. So it's effectively diffusive. It's effectively, yes, it's effectively diffusive. It's effectively, yes, it's effectively diffusive. It's not thermally diffusive. It's just, it's motor diffusive rather than thermally diffusive. It just happens to be that there are two forms of diffusion, and one of them forms a gradient that points this way, and the other one forms a gradient that points that way. So you get this kind of cycling at homeostasis. Hi, how does the dinosaur go? Um how does the time scale for the dynamics of microtubules compare with the uh transport time scale, uh, say from the volga to the membrane? Well, so the transport time scale is quite long. Um so if we were to go back to for example uh this This data, you're looking at mean square displacements of one and a half microns after four minutes, right? And that's the fastest. In control, you're looking at one micron after four minutes. The microtubule dynamics are almost certainly faster than that. We did play around with the time scale of microtubule dynamics. It doesn't really matter that much, it turns out. So we cannot think of. So we cannot think of the microtubule network as stationary during this 240-second time skip? No, and we're not modeling it as stationary either. As I mentioned, we're not modeling the actual polymerization, but we are going in and having these things like a microtubule will selectively go poof and disappear, and anything that was bound to will unbound, and then we'll build a new microtubule somewhere else. So we are definitely accounting for the dynamic nature. We're just not. For the dynamic nature, we're just not accounting for like the full dynamics. So it's not stationary, and it wouldn't be reasonable to model it as stationary. Although, to be honest, if you were to make it stationary, I'm pretty sure you'd get the same results. Thanks. All right, let's thank the speaker.
