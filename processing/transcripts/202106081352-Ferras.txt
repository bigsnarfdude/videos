Waiting until now to see the presentation. So, the title of my presentation is Fractional Distributed Order Derivatives and Viscolasticity, Theory, and Numerical Methods. This is a joint work with Professor Luisa Morgado from IST University of Lisbon and Professor Magdal Robello from FCT, also from University, now in this case, from the new University of Lisbon. So, I'll start my presentation. So I'll start my presentation by showing you the motivation of this work and the objectives. Then I'll present some brief and simple definitions on viscoelasticity. And in this topic, I will also talk about fractional derivatives. Then I will introduce the new distributed order viscoelastic model. And I'll finish the work with some numerical results for simple, really simple flows and the conclusions. So the objectives and motivation of this work. objectives and motivation of this work are we want to develop a model for viscoelastic materials that show an algebraic decay like this one t to the power of alpha in this case alpha varies from zero to one and also for that new model we want to derive the storage and loss moduli functions uh of the new model and to perform feed to experimental data to see how this model behaves and and also to in order to further understand um these models since analytical solution These models, since analytical solutions are not available, we develop a simple numerical code to study the 1D transient coette flow. So, now some really simple definitions. Okay, I'll start with the classical models. You will see just the Maxwell model and then I will introduce the fractional models. So, this is something that you are used to see. So, we have here a spring, a dashboard. We combine these two elements and we obtain a spring and a dashpot, which is the Maxwell model. Dashbot, which is the Maxwell model as we know it, and it can be written in this differential form here. So the Maxwell model can be written in a differential form, but it can also be written in an integral form. Here, more explicit, you can see the jump discontinuity in strain plus the integral part, or as we usually see it in books, it's an integral that goes from zero to t. And we have here the relaxation modulus and the rate of deformation. The rate of deformation. So it is common to use this kind of relaxation modulus with this negative exponential, and then we'll see the difference for the case of fractional models. One generalization that it's really common to use in simulations or in analytical studies is to use a generalized Maxwell model where we assume that, for example, we can have a portion of material with different regions, where in these regions we have different relaxed. Where in these regions we have different relaxations of the material. So we can combine these different Maxwell models and use different parameters so that we can fit, for example, the experimental data. So now in order to introduce fractional viscoelastic models, I'll just make a brief presentation for fractional derivatives. It's just, it's really simple. It's just to get the idea what a fractional derivative is. So it all started. Is. So it all started a long time ago with this symbol from Leibniz, where we have the nth derivative of this function f, where L'Hopital replied, asking what does it mean when n equals, for example, one divided by two? So basically, the idea is what does this symbol mean if n is not an integer? So one way to understand how can we obtain this path between derivative of all Between derivative of order 0 or derivative of order 1. We can have, for example, derivative of order 0.3, 0.4. One way to easily understand this is by starting with the fundamental theorem of classical calculus, where we have a function, capital F function, which is defined by the integral centered in A of this F function here. We all know that if we apply the derivative to this function, we obtain the integrand function. function we obtain the integrand function f so now let's now define the operator j and j subscript n where we it means that we are applying um um integration n times to a certain function okay it's an n-fold integration or the d sub superscript n where we are applying the derivative n times so there's a really really useful lemma that says that if we want to integrate a certain function We want to integrate a certain function n times, we can write this using just one symbol of integration. And this formula is given by 1 divided by n minus 1 factorial times the integral of x minus t to the power of n minus 1. So we now can, we would like to generalize our derivatives to fractional derivatives, but now we have an integral. So let's start with the integral. If we want to generalize this integral to non-integer values, because this n is an integer value. Because this n is an integer value. What do we need to do? Here we don't have any problem, but here we have a problem because we have a factorial. So we need to use something that generalizes this factorial function. And the solution, of course, is Euler's gamma function, where we have a continuous variation of this continuous extension of this factorial. So we already have a generalized integral, which is given here, and I'm using Which is given here, and I'm using now the parameter alpha. Now, this is called the Riemann-Louville fractional integral. So, we have an integral that works for alpha. We can, for example, integrate 1.7 or 1.6 or 1.1 or 0.7. But now we want the derivatives, not integrals. So, there are more than two solutions, but two possible solutions are we apply the derivative the times we want until we obtain the order. The times we want until we obtain the order of the derivative we want, which is the solution proposed by Riemann and Leoville. So we apply the derivative to our integral, to our generalized integral, or there's another solution where we first perform the differentiation and then we apply the integral. So it's the only difference between these two. It's not the only difference, but there are more differences. But in this case, as I'm showing you, this is. But in this case, as I'm showing you, these are the only differences. And this one is known as the Caputo fractional differential operator. There are many operators. So basically, what they do is that they create a path, a continuous path between a derivative of order n and a derivative of order n plus one. So which model, which operator should we use? It depends on the application. It depends on the application. But most of the times for engineering applications, we use this Caputo. Applications: We use this Caputo derivative, which is the one I'm using here. So, now let's assume that we have different fluids that do not follow that negative exponential decay that I showed you before, but that we have some type of fading memory, like this one that I'm showing here. For example, for a critical gel, this S is known as the power of the gel, and we have a T to the power of minus alpha, where alpha. Of minus alpha, where alpha varies from zero to one. So we have this algebraic decay. Now assume that this s is given by this expression here, where this v is a parameter of the model. So if we use this kind of relaxation modulus, if we insert this relaxation modulus in our Boltzmann or Maxwell equation that I showed you before, we obtain the fractional derivative, the definition of fractional derivative of Caputo derivative that I Of Caputo derivative that I just presented, using, I'm using here a different notation, where we have this sigma, the stress, equals a parameter times this whole symbol represents the fractional derivative, where the C stands for caputo, fractional derivative centered in zero. And we have the derivative of the deformation. And here is the definition of the caputo derivative that I just presented you before, so we can see this new notation. This new notation. So, these models were used in the literature and are still used in the literature. And the mechanical analog for this kind of model is this geometry that I'm showing you here, which is known as a spring pot, which is a combination of dash pots and springs in this manner, the way I'm showing you here. At least at a limiting case, this is how the model behaves. So, the idea that came after this was: okay, Maxwell model uses two elements. Maxwell model uses two elements, a spring and a dash pot. So, here we have a spring pot. So, if you want to create a fractional Maxwell model, we're going to join these two spring pots. And we obtain by doing the same derivation as we do for the Maxwell model, we obtain the fractional Maxwell model, which allows a very good fit to experimental data. So, in this work, the idea is to present a more generalized model. It doesn't mean that it It doesn't mean that it's better than the fractional Maxwell model, but it's a new model that we are still studying and to see how the model behaves. So let's see. So in order to introduce this distributed order risk elastic model, I must first introduce the definition of distributed order fractional derivative, and then I'll present the properties of the model and fit to experimental data. So what is a distributed order? You just need to focus on the fractional derivative. On the fractional derivative. Here we have the fractional derivative that I presented before. So we have a single order derivative of order alpha. What the distributed order derivative does is that it sums all the orders of alpha that goes from zero to one, but not just to sum. So it's a weighted sum with this C of alpha function here, which is a sort of a problem to define this. A sort of a problem to define this in order to create a model that fits experimental data. Okay, so basically, if this C of alpha function is the Dirac delta function, we can obtain a single order, a fractional derivative of the order we want, depending on the function that we use for the delta Dirac function. Okay, so this is the distributed order. You see that we have an integral that goes from zero to one, we have the weighting function, and we have single. function and we have single order fractional derivatives so if we expand this this expression we obtain an integral of another integral okay so now assume that our relaxation modulus can be written as a sum of different algebraic decays let's say that the material can be can can represent the relaxation of that material relaxation models of the material by combining different algebraic decays Different algebraic decays here. Now, notice that this is going from 1 to until n. Now, assume that we make n to go to infinity, covering the open space that goes from 0 to 1. What we obtain is a continuous version of this proposal here, which is the integral that goes from 0 to 1 of this s function that depends on alpha and times t to the power of minus alpha. So basically, if we insert this term This term in our Boltzmann or the integral version of the Maxwell model here, we obtain directly the distributed, what we call the distributed order viscoelastic model. Notice that now we don't have here a parameter that we are used to see because this parameter is hidden in this function here, s of alpha, which we'll call c of alpha here. So now just now the question is: what C of alpha, what should we use for C of alpha? Constant one, alpha, e to the power, an exponential, negative exponential, depending on alpha, a power of alpha. So I'm just representing here the functions and comparing them, the relaxation functions and the relaxation modulus and comparing it with the relaxation modulus for a single Single order fractional model. You can see that we can represent a different type of relaxation. And what happens is that we just need to think like this, that C of alpha goes, alpha goes from zero to one. When alpha is zero, we are near an elastic, perfect elastic behavior. When alpha goes to one, we have a representation of a Newtonian fluid. A Newtonian fluid. So, depending on the function that we use that we assume in our model, we can have different behaviors. The idea is that this C of alpha function should represent, well, the material. Okay, let's say that we have a material divided in different regions, and some of the regions are more proeminent, so we should give a bigger weight to this region here, and smaller weight to this region here, which is difficult to do. Region here, which is difficult to do a priori. So, like you know, we can obtain G prime and G double prime very easily experimentally and analytically, the expressions analytically. So, we wanted to do the same for this distributed order viscoelastic model. So, this can be easily done. And the expressions for this distributed order viscoelastic model are given by this. The risk-olastic model are given by this integral, it's a weighted integral as we were expecting. Now, the thing is, we can obtain a closed form solutions for G prime and G double prime depending on the expression we are using for the function C of alpha, for the weights. For example, I'm just giving an example. In this case, where we have C a constant and times negative exponential of alpha, we obtain, for example, this G prime and this G double prime. this g prime and g this g double prime if we change the function we obtain a completely different g prime and g double prime and so i i didn't think about it but it's so it becomes difficult to obtain a characteristic relaxation for for this kind of fluid but it's something that i need to think in the future um so now we wanted to perform a fit of experimental data to see how the model behaves and the experimental data comes from and the experimental data comes from a paper from Professor McKinley and his research group. So the experimental data is for bread dough and we have here a fit to the G prime and G double prime using a Maxwell model. Of course we were expecting this, we were not expecting a good fit because this is a solid-like behavior. And we have a fit, very good fit with a fraction model that I showed you before. Model that I showed you before, and we have here a fit with the distributed order risk-elastic model. Now, the question is: okay, in order to use this model, we need to use a weighting function. What we did is that we knew how to perform a fit with a fractional Maxwell model, and we observed that a better fit was obtained when we used an alpha value of 0.2. So, what we did to perform the fit with distributed order viscolastic model was to use a weighting function. To use a weighting function that resembles a delta Dirac function. It approximates Delta Dirac function as we change the values of A. And what we did is that we also use delta Dirac function centered in the value of one divided by five, which is 0.2, which is the alpha value used in this fit. But now we allow the model to capture more modes around. To capture more modes around the 0.2. So it captures some influence from the alpha 0.21, 0.22, 0.23. So, but this was just, we just guessed this function, this weighting function based on the fractional maximum model. You will see later in the conclusions that the fit to this data was better with the distributed auto-viscelastic model because of the better fit on the G prime. So, next step, since the model So, next step, since the model is quite complicated to work with, so we try to implement it numerically just for a really simple flow, a 1D transient coefficient flow. Okay, for the 1D transient coefficient flow, the governing equations are given by this equation that comes from the momentum equations, and this one that comes from the constitutive equation. Of course, you can see that this is okay. This is okay, XY is the shear stress. So we can substitute this expression here on top, and we obtain an equation just for velocity, which is this one here. So we obtain this equation and evolution in time with a classical derivative. And then we have these two integrals and the derivative here. With some assumptions on our velocity profile and velocity function, we can interchange derivatives and integrals. And integrals. Two minutes. Sorry, two minutes? Two minutes, please. Yeah. Okay, okay, okay. So I will wrap it up. So we wanted to solve this system of equations. So basically, we solve this equation first, which only depends on velocity. And then with the results from velocity, we can compute the stress. These are the boundary conditions. We assume that the lower wall is fixed and the top wall moves with a certain velocity. And these are the initial conditions. Certain velocity, and these are the initial conditions. So, I will skip the numerical method used. And so, we implemented it numerically using finite differences, and we used a uniform mesh for the divisions in the integral of alpha for time and space. And this is just an imposed analytical solution. So we wanted to see if the method was converging for the analytical solution, which is, and we obtained really small errors. We obtained really small errors. This was just to find a trade-off between the computational accuracy and computational time. So, our case study, so we wanted to study the 1D transit quiet flow, as I told you before. So, what we did is that we imposed on the upper wall a velocity profile, which is given by this pulse here, and we just moved the upper wall by 50 milliseconds. 50 milliseconds. We got this from experimental data. And so basically, this function is again similar to a Dirac delta function multiplied by the distance that the upper world travel. And I'm just going to show you some final results. So we tested three different weighting functions, a constant, this function here, which is represented here. So it's giving more importance to elastic behavior. To elastic behavior and less important to a Newtonian fluid. And we use this linear function here. As you can see, when we give more importance or more weight to the Newtonian behavior, we see that the material, this is the pulsar, the material, the stress increases and then it starts to decrease. So we see that when we give more importance to the Newtonian behavior, the rate of decrease. behavior, the rate of decrease of the rate of relaxation is higher for that kind of materials. For example, here you can see that we're giving in this function here, we're giving more importance to the elastic part. And you can see here in these zoom fields that the rate of relaxation is the highest of the three. So just to finish, conclusions. So a generalized model for small deformations was derived based on Boltzmann theory. The new model as a Um the new model has a more general relaxation and it may allow for a broader range of uh for modeling a broader range of visco acid materials. This is the feeding error that I should have shown you before and you can see that the error with the Maxwell is really high, the error with the fraction Maxwell model is really good, and the error with the distributed order viscolastic model is better than this one. Although I think the fraction Maxwell model, it's quite better for fitting details. For fitting different experimental data. And this model is only valid for small deformations, and it requires more studies to understand how these weighting functions should be derived. And also, the model was implemented and studied numerically for a transit correct flow. Okay, thank you for your attention. Thanks, Yuish. I've just got a couple of quick questions then. So you've compared it to a single mode Maxwell, but I mean, is that really a fair comparison? And then how many modes from a Maxwell? How many modes from a Maxwell model would you need to get a comparative fit? For this particular material, we tried with six modes and it was impossible. But I think it was because of this particular material, the breadth, though, the rheology of this material, because it depends on the material. For example, the fractional maximum model is in between one model and the other, and it's really good to fit. To fit experimental data that comes from polymer solutions, from red dough, or from more elastic or more liquid materials. But I'm still studying the distributed order viscelastic model. I'm still finding a way to see how it behaves in more generalized materials. But we tested with the Maxwell model, and for this kind of material, for this bread dough, the Maxwell model was not good to fit these. Not good to fit this data. Mike, Graham had a quick question. Okay. This is kind of related. So the nice thing about the Maxwell model or multi-model Maxwell model is there's theory, you know, Rouse genes and et cetera, that give you that kernel. Is there a fractional derivative that comes from an exponential kernel or from a kernel that's a Kernel that's a sum of exponentials. Right, these power law. No, no, no. I think you're saying that, okay, we obtain the fractional derivative by generalizing, for example, some negative exponentials or something like that. What I've seen in terms of fractional derivatives, the term, it's always a t to the minus alpha. It's always an algebraic decay, not an exponential decay. Is there any way to do it with an exponential decay, or is that just? Decay, or is that just, yeah, you part of the structure? You can you can choose, yeah. I think we need to distinguish here two things. Okay, we have the definition of fractional derivative, and for the for that, you need to use the t to the power, you need to use t to the power of minus alpha, but of course you can go there and you can use whatever you want, but then you don't you you're then you start missing the theory that you already have for these fractional derivatives, but of course you can use different functions, and I think that the solution, the solution. The solution, in terms of finding a good fit or representing or better representing some kind of material, it's something in between this t to the power of minus alpha and an exponential function. For example, the relaxation function you obtain for this step strain for a fractional Maxwell model, it's a t to the power of minus alpha multiplied by a Mitag Lefler function, which is a generalized. Which is a generalization of an exponential function. So, the combination of the two, like one multiplied by the other, I think it gives the better things from both worlds. I see. Thanks. Thanks, Louis. Nice answer. We've got one more question from Esteban. Yes. Hi, Louis. Really nice presentation. Interesting work. I've been thinking of as well doing some fractional derivative work. And I wonder, really, now that you have... And I wonder really, now that you have your model, what would be the form, the shape of the standard steady state or uniaxial extension viscosities, for example, or normal surface points? So it should be the first thing that I should do to study the model, but I didn't do that. I didn't see how it behaves. If it goes to study of it, if it doesn't go, I really don't know. I need to study further this model. Yeah, maybe I know some sheer thinning and thick. Maybe I know some sheer thinning or thickening or something strange in extension. I mean, what is it apart from the usual Maxwell response? That's my question. Yeah, okay. I believe that I think you're asking if we can reduce this to the Maxwell model and if we can have some part of this model that runs along like Maxwell model. Along like Maxwell model. But I'm not sure about that because even fractional Maxwell model, depending on, for example, fractional Maxwell model, you have alpha and beta parameters. And if you use a beta value different from one, in some cases, you obtain a model that cannot be used to model fluids, just solids. So I really don't know what to expect, for example, in a long time. Okay, let's run a simulation. For example, if I can do this for simple For example, if I can do this for simple flows and see how the model behaves, I didn't try that, it would be good to see how it behaves. But if we don't have that option, then we need to try numerically to see how can we use this model for more complex flows, of course. But I really don't know how to answer your question and just saying that, okay, this model behaves like the Maxwell model for in this regime or iron. Okay. And have you published some of these? And have you published some of this data? Maybe I missed it. I published, but I didn't have the time to put here in the presentation because it was a last-minute presentation, so I forgot. But I can send you if you want. I can put totally. I will be interested to see it. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Nice talk. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.
