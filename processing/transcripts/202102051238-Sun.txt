What we want to talk today is the Bogmani equations on R3 with non-singularity. So, just a quick review. I'm sure you heard a lot of this during this conference about the Bogmoni equation. So, the Bogmoni equation, what I mean here is specific to the SU2 case, the simplest case, that you have a SU2 connection on R3 whose curvature is. R3 whose curvature is F, and you have a section of the adjoint SU2 bundle that is called the Higgs field. And then the Pogmoni equation is written as the curvature equals the star Hotdeal of the dA of phi. And typically we assume some asymptotic conditions such that the curvature goes like one over R square. like one over r square and phi converges to one at phi and infinity. So the configuration space satisfies those asymptotic conditions. The connected component of that can be indexed by the multiple number k. So basically k just from the, if you consider a large enough r and then phi can be viewed as And then phi can be viewed as a map, almost a map from S2 to S2. And then that map has a degree, and that degree is basically the module number. So even if you don't necessarily satisfy the Bogmoni equation, you can have the multiple number if you have the symptomic condition. And Donathan has a very well description of the modular space of the regular. Of the regular solutions of the SO2-Bogmoni equations, the R3, which says that there is a circle bundle over the modular space of charge K, such that the circle bundle can be identified with regional maps from Cp1 to CP1 with degree K, and it maps the infinity to zero. So, in particular, the dimension of the circle bundle is Of the circle bundle is 4k, and the dimension of the modular space of the Bogmoni equation up to a gauge transformation is 4k minus 1. And I'm sure you know that Dannis's result is based on a study of the numbers equation over the interval. So it becomes the ODE equation and can be solved. And the relationship between the numbers equals between the Norm's equation and the Bogman equation have different ways to establish, can be established in different ways. So I guess one way is the Norm's transform. So that's an example of the Names transform which maps the Yang-Meyer equation on 4 minus K dimension, which has a 4 minus K dimensional invariant to K dimensional invariant. invariant to a k-dimensional invariant young-measure equation and the bogmoni equation is the one-dimensional invariant version of the young-measured equation on four dimensions and the numbers equation is the you can can be viewed as a three-dimensional evaluant version and another interesting way to establish the relationship between the Bogman equation and the Norm equation is patient's artifact geometry method. Basically, I just I just very briefly review what he said. It says that consider the modular space of orienting lights in R3 and that modular space is TCP1 because you can specify a direction which is a point in the CP1 and then consider a point that the line passes through the point. And you can always assume that point is perpendicular. Always assume that point is perpendicular to the line direction. And so if an oriented line has an L2 solution to the ODE equation, then all such lines form an algebraic curve on the T of CPY. So that curve is called the spectral curve. And I believe patients studies the spectral curve if it comes from a If it comes from a solution to the Bogmoni equation and find that the certain algebraic constraint can be certain if the if the spectral curve satisfies certain algebraic geometry constraint, then it's correspondence to the solution to the Bogmoni equations. So that's how to describe the Bogmoni equations in algebraic geometry way. algebraic geometry way. Well, the only reason I mentioned it is because it would be interesting to see, to ask whether or not if there is a non-singularity, whether or not I can still use the algebraic geometry method. If that is possible, then it has the potential to bring out into algebraic geometry. For example, I think that maybe you can think about the think that maybe you can think about the the oriented line that doesn't doesn't touch the knot and consider the spectral curve there. I don't know. I don't have much knowledge of this part, but I think it's interesting. So another reason to consider the non-singularity is it's actually trendy now to study gauge theoretic PDEs with a non-singularity. And as far as I know, I have at least two I know I have at least two examples. So, one example is that Kohammer and Mokas study on the standard floor theory with not singularity, and they found the relationship between the noticing, the standard floor theory and the Kovanov homology of the North. And also, there is a Witten's proposal to study the Kaplan equations with certain Nord similarities. Certain non-similarity that is also conjectured to have some relationship with the covenant hormonal. So maybe a simpler proposal is to study the moduli space of the Bogmoni equation with a non-singularity. And so, what can we say about that? And so, currently, I do not have much to say about this modular space. The only thing I can say about this. The only thing I can say about this is obtained by adoption of Taubes analytical method. So I will briefly introduce this method. So Taubes have studied the modular space of the Bogmoni equation using an analytical method in his PhD thesis. So basically, suppose A and phi is a configuration. So A represents the connection and phi represents the Higgs field. I represents the Higgs field. And let L be the linearization of the Bogmoni equation with an extra gate fixing condition. And let Q be the quadratic form in the Bogmoni equation. So roughly speaking, the Bogmoni equation is L plus Q, something like that. It's a quadratic equation. And suppose I call S to be the zero form. SU2 value zero form plus the one form SU2 value one form. Well, if and then because it's just in R3, so it's naturally can be equipped with a pre-fold multiplication. And if I read it in terms of that, then the linear addition can be written as the The following way. So basically, it looks like a direct operator that twisted by A and plus the Higgs field, plus the B bracket of the Higgs field. That's how the linearization looks like. And then, so you have a Wittenberg type of formula if you do the integration by part and then And basically, you have this kind of formula. And so, if you define the Hilbert space to be the first two terms, so that is adapted, definition adapted to the fiducial configuration here. So, and then because the third term here, because we have the asymptotic conditions at the beginning, and it can be proved that the third term is the first. And it can be proved that the third term is compact relative to this H norm defined here. So immediately you know that L is a flat home operator from H to L2. And moreover, because the dagger version of the Wittenberg formula, here the redundant term goes to zero when the Bogomoni equation is satisfied. So in particular, if the configuration is If the configuration is a solution to the Bogmoni equation, then the core kernel is zero. And in fact, so this adapted Herbert space basically is if you think of the phi at a large distance and consider your configuration to be divided into two parts, the parallel part, which parallel to the Higgs field, and the perpendicular part. Then this basically Then this basically says that it's the norm of the first order and plus the perpendicular part. So you only have the L2 of the perpendicular part. You don't have L2 norm of the parallel part. So that's basically what it says for this norm. And so if you have the and the quadratic part is a bounded map for is a bounded map from the h times h to l2 here because you can write phi as the parallel part and the perpendicular part and it turns out that the quadratic part if if you have two it the quadratic part basically looks like a lee bracket of something of the phi one right with fat two that and so if you consider the part If you consider the parallel part of the quadratic part, then it goes to zero. So you can, for any phi one and phi two, the quadratic part can be written as without loss of generality that the second one has only perpendicular part. So by sublime embedding and the phi one can be invited into the phi one is in L6 and the phi two of the per because we have the L. Phi 2 of the perm because we have the L2 norm as given and by sublifting battery is also in L6. So if in that case, you know that the quadratic term is bounded by the H times H. And if the quadratic term is bounded and you know the linearization is right-home operator whose co-kernel is zero, then you know that basically by an implicit function theorem, the modulus space has Theorem, the modular space has a manifold structure. That's basically what Topps did in his proof. And so when there is a naught singularity, then the integration by parts does not go through because the boundary term near the naught doesn't vanish. And in fact, if you compute a model example near the naught and use some forward decomposition to compute. Forward decomposition to compute the linearization concretely, you will notice that the co-kernel is infinite dimension. So it's very likely that the linearization is not fragile because it has from the ordinary H to L because it has an infinite dimensional co-current. So one way that I use to make the adaption is consider, so add a weight. Consider add a weight near the knot. So, suppose rho is the distance to the knot and let n be the epsilon neighborhood. Then I make the following adaption. So, near the knot, I add a width, which is the distance to the north to the definition of H and L. So, in that case, and so given this definition and there Give me this definition, and then I can define what it means by a solution with not singularity, with monogamy, gamma. Gamma is an unreal number. So yeah, basically what I mean is, so near the naught, I have a model solution, which is phi gamma for each gamma. And this model solution means that the connection is just a flat connection with gamma monogamy. And here, omega is the generator of the H1. is the generator of the H1 of R3 minus the naught. And sigma is just a constant term in Su2. So the Higgs field is covariantly constant and that is the model solution. Here actually I forgot a subscript gamma. Anyway, so this is the model solution. And if a solution up to a gauge transformation, if a solution is closing If a solution is close enough to the model solution near the naught, that means their difference lies basically lies in the, it looks like lies in the H norm that I defined, near the naught. So I had a weight here. So if that is the case, then I call this solution, I call this configuration has a non-singularity with monogamy gamma. That is my definition. And you can check. And you can check that if you use SO3 gate transformation, you can change gamma by any half integer. So it may be assumed that gamma is from 0 to 1 half. Okay, so I have a regularity theorem that if the configuration satisfies the syntactic condition and suppose the curvature and curvature and the dA of phi have bounded the adapted L2 norm, then the only possible singularity is a non-singularity. So the reason for this for this regularity theorem holds true is because I just near the naught if I add a weight to the L2 space near the naught and it's pretty much look like the Pretty much look like the four-dimensional case. And I can shrink the neighborhood to be small enough to make the curvature small enough. And then I basically use the Woodenbig type of argument. So I consider a small neighborhood, a small open set, and consider the Woodenbig, the Woodenbak gate on that, consider the trivial connection on the Trivial connection on the SU2 bundle and then consider the Woodenbig gate in that small open set. And I consider all these gates all around the meridian of the knot and glue them together. So in the end, when you go back, you can glue them all the way until the last one to make a global gauge that almost that A and 5, then A is almost. And 5, then A is almost a flat connection. But until the last one, there might be a monogamy there. And then you can prove that a stipulo goes small, and the monogamy converges to some fixed version of monogamy. And if you take this at different places, it goes to the same limit. So basically, that's how the proof. So basically, that's how the proof is done. In fact, there might also be a monogamy. If you consider only the neighborhood of the knot, there might also be a monogamy at the longitude of the knot. But if it's R3 minus the knot, then in fact, in my definition of the singularity, not singularity, that monotony doesn't count as a singularity. So that's where. So that's why the only possible singularity is monogamy along the meridian of the knot. Sorry, in your assumption, does the knot carry any magnetic charge density? Well, I don't know what it means by magnetic charge. If I integrate trace phi f over a surface containing part of piece of the knot. Part of piece of the knot, you mean a cipher surface as one cross an interval take a circle? Yeah, boundary of a tubular neighborhood of some piece of the knot, yes. Okay, as one cross an interval, you need to make it a little longer, so something like that, yes. Like that. Yes. Okay. Well, I don't know. I mean, it's pretty much looks like it should look like a flat connection. Yeah, the knot, but I didn't thought about what this means. So to interrupt again, could you explain again what the singularity is that you said the holonomy is not around the knot, but the holonomy is along the knot? No, the monotony is along the meridian of the knot. That's nothing I expected. All right, okay. So it's so I have a model so. So, it's so I have a model solution for each non-trivial monogamy along the meridian. So, what I mentioned along the node is that when you prove the regularity theorem, it comes out that there might be a monogamy along the node, but that doesn't count as a similarity in my definition. Okay. So the drawback of adding a weight to that is that the code A rate to that is that the co-kernel is not guaranteed to be zero. Because if you take the integration, you don't have the second integration for the L dagger. There comes out some extra term from the weight. And that redundant term is going to affect that. It's not so easy to argue that whether or not the coconut is zero. So that's the drawback. I think luckily enough that let me see so luckily enough that the quadratic term is still bounded enough. Well, anyway, it doesn't really hurt the arguments here because it's a point-wise argument and doesn't consider the integration by part. So the quadratic term is expected to be bounded and it is in fact true to be bounded map. bounding map from the h times h to l2 and what i can say is that if gamma if the monotony is not very it's not very large enough then l is flat hold so if gamma lies in the interval from 0 to 1 eighth and union from 3 eighths to 1 half so in this situation the only thing i can say that Situation: The only thing I can say that is that the modulus space has a local analytical structure. Basically, that's because if you have a flat hole map, you don't know that whether or not the coconut is zero. That's the only thing you can say about the local structure. And the proof is that I basically the same as before, just two integration by parts. One is in the North neighborhood and another is outside of the north. And another is outside of the node neighborhood. So you have the two versions of the integration by part. And it turns out that here the dotted term is the dot dot dot terms are all compact terms relative to the H1, so they are not important. And the boundary term, it turns out that two copies of the boundary term A plus one copies of boundary term B is compact rather than. Boundaton B is compact relative to the H norm. So if I add two copies of the inside part and one copy of the outside part, then I can prove that it's greater or equal than some constant times the H0 minus some relatively compact terms. So that tells, and the same inequality holds true for the L dagger. So this too will imply that L is right home. Is fragile. So that basically what I can prove. And so the question is whether or not L is also thread home when the monogamy is not in this interval. And this is really annoying assumption, but I cannot get rid of it. And also I conjectured that generically L has a zero local kernel. L has a zero local kernel. For example, if I pertupe the metric, then if I can prove that L has zero co-kernel, then I know that the modular space has a manifold structure. Maybe I can pertube the metric a little bit to make it generically have a zero coconut, but I don't know. That's something to work in the future. So, when you're saying generically, you mean general. Generically, you mean generically in gamma or generically in something else? Anything could be work. My thought is that maybe a generic metric, I can perture the metric. I'm using the standard metric in R3. That doesn't have to be. So you're saying if you change the, of course, what you're looking at is not necessarily on Euclidean R3. On our Euclidean R3, and you could do this in other settings. But if you look on R3, then for this one, you don't know, but you suspect if you modify the metric, you should get this. Yeah, that's what I suspect. And maybe if you for a generic gamma and in certain circumstances, I don't know that. But is the proof, is the proof you have was working also in other metrics? Was working also in other metrics? Well, do you know this theorem there on this page for the Euclidean or for more? I can't guarantee, but I think probably if it changes a little bit, it still goes through. I didn't really use anything that's specific to the standard matching. I don't, I can't quite 100% sure. Sorry about that. So I have some examples that, in fact, in this example, that L has a serial core kernel. So it has a manifold structure nearby. So this example comes from Gluing. So to start, so one way to describe the process model, that is just the regular monopole with chart one, the very standard version. And so you can have a direct You can have a direct region like this on R3, and you can, under a gauge transformation, make this monocle look like A is almost flat and phi is almost covariantly constant. So in fact, if you allow a singular gauge transformation, you can make it a direct array. But I don't like singular gauge transformation. So typically, what I use is the consider a direct array. Considered a direct region, and outside the direct region is basically a flat solution to the Bogmoni equation. And in fact, Topps has a gluing theorem for the suppose you have a lot of different percept semi-field monopoles, and suppose the direct region are far away from each other, then outside their direct regions. Outside their direct regions, they all look like the flat connection and a constant Higgs field. So there, if you use a cutoff function to glue them together, it's pretty much the same as before. And then it's almost an approximate solution to the Bogmoni equation. And then you can argue that the co-kernel of that is zero, and the L is right home. And so basically. At home, and so basically, you can find solution solutions, the actual solutions nearby. So, that's how you glue a number of one monopoles together. So, you can do the same thing if there is a node similarity. So, suppose I have a node that's far away from all these direct regions. And also, I consider the model solution with a monogamy gamma around the node that I mentioned before. And suppose they are all. Before, and suppose they are all far away from each other. Because if you're far away from the knot, then the model solution looks like a flat connection with a constant Higgs field. So you can glue any number of the one model into this picture. And then basically you can do the same thing. But here, but you have some trouble with the argument because you do not know that the cocoa. know that the coconut of the flat hope of the linearization is zero of your approximate solution so you cannot say that there is a solution nearby but what i noticed is that if you shrink the so if you fix this uh one multiple solutions and then fix this knot and if you shrink this knot to make it small enough then in my argument before that uh i should say this is the this is the this is the dagger version of L dagger I have the inequality that is greater or equal than some constant the L2 norm of L phi is greater or equal than some constant times the H norm of phi minus some relatively compact term so if it's relatively compact it's of course bounded above by H norm but you don't know the coefficient but in the case that if the knock is shrinked That if the knock is shrinked to be small enough, then in that situation, I can say that the relative compact term can be bounded above by any small constant times the H norm. So in particular, if I assume it's smaller than a half of C times the H norm, then I can show that the co-kernel of the alpha is zero because it's greater or equal than the half of C times the H norm. Half of C times the H0. So in this situation, I can glue them together and to get an X-true solution. And I know that nearby this X-ray solution has a manifold structure. So that's the only example I can say there is a manifold structure. So maybe it's only a start, and there's a lot of things to do that I do not know. For example, whether or not I can Whether or not I can get rid of the constraints that ignoring constraints of the monogamy, and whether or not PAL is generally has their local kernel. And also, as I mentioned before, that whether or not this non-singularity of Moni equation can also be studied by algebraic geometry method. But I think it's an interesting topic to study. Yeah. I don't have anything more to share with you. So could you go back to the last slide, please? This one? Or this one? No, the one where you had the shrinking the knot. Okay. So, do you know anything if you have two knots or if you have a link? Two knots, or if you have a link. Maybe not, doesn't matter here, in fact. Yeah, that's true. In my argument, not doesn't matter. As long as they are far enough, it can be early. All right, let's thank Waitangi for a question. And I was going to say that if you have questions, then please proceed. No, forgiving you. Then please proceed. No, forgive me. Okay, let's thank him and then we'll go. Thank you. Thank you for listening. Any questions? So we think, I'm not sure I caught it. So do you have a non-trivial example of a solution with a not singularity? Well, I do not have a concrete example, but I can say that there are some examples from Glui. That's the only thing that I can see. It's not concretely written down. It's not concretely written down. You just basically find an approximate solution and say that by an implicit function theory is nearby. I'll ask you about that in particular. Okay. Sorry. Well, maybe another way of asking Ray's question. If you have this model solution, and then you take the monopole, Prasad Zommerfeld monopole that you glued in, and then carry it directly. Then carry it directly toward the line of the knot. Yeah, that's what happened to that solution. But I don't know. I try to think about that, but I don't know. Because if it's not far away from each other, then the gluon method doesn't go through. It's even true for the, if there's no non-singularity, if just consider multiple number of the direct Multiple number of the direct one monopoles is easily. But in that case, we know that they form a nice modulus space. Yeah, but still, in that case, the Gluonian argument doesn't go through if they are not each other. If you have rational holonomy, you should be getting things at least holomorphically on the branch cover over the NOAA. And possibly the scattering, you know, you can sort of use things on the scattering. You know, you can sort of deduce things on the scattering from that. Because the holomorphic scattering looks kind of interesting. I mean, you're getting presumably some sort of holonomy that's coming in, square roots or nth roots or whatever it is, as you're sort of shining light through a, basically through a knot diagram, right? I mean, it's a projection of the knot onto various planes. So it should be, I mean, I'm not sure if it's holomorphically useful. I'm not sure if it's holomorphically useful, but it's holomorphically interesting anyway. Yeah, actually, I suspect that the most interesting case is when gamma is one-fourth, the middle case. But that is the case that I can say least about anything. It's less in the, well, I do not have anything less in the region. So gamma one-fourth would be a square root? That's it? Or? Yeah, so it's going to be if you consider the double branch cover. Yeah. That's what you mean. Yeah, that's what you mean. Yeah, that's what I was. I think, yeah, I suspect that that's going to be the most interesting case, but I don't know. I do not have much to say about that. I mean, metrically, of course, the branch cover is, you know, it doesn't quite work. I mean, because it's yeah, it has a single metric. It's not quite the same thing. Oh, it's kind of the opposite side of a symmetric monopole. In a symmetric monopole, you fold by Zn, but here. You fold by Zn, but here you kind of take the usual monopole and you unfold by Zn. Sorry, I didn't get that. Well, think of like Donaldson map, that that was a rational map from, let's say, Z to F of Z. But now you say that you are mapping from that your Z is W to the N? Square root of W? Or W but then if I understand Jacques's comment correctly, maybe one can recycle what we know about monopoles, but we understand Z not to be coordinate on the physical plane in R3, but it's nth root. It's a pretty twisty n-root. It's not all knotted up. No, no, of course, before one understands the knot, you just understand the straight line. Than a straight line. There's examples of instantons with these holonomy singularities along a sphere, which is maybe a. Well, maybe I don't know. I mean, there's some explicit examples of instantons with these singularities on the sphere, and they carry non-zero topologies. And they carry non-zero topological charge, which is far from being a knot, but at least some people have got that part done. Where? I think it was Forgash and other people. And the title was something like instantons with charge three over two, because the holonomy feeds into the charge. The the channel. The Simners had a paper on the analysis of these things. It was quite a few years back. In fact, I should say that my regularity argument was adapted from signals argument in his four-dimensional case. It's pretty much the similar. If you add a weight, it's just a four-weight type of argument. Ultimate type of argument, neither not. It's pretty much similar to signals argument in the surface, you have a surface similarity for the young youth in the four-dimensional case. All right, thank you all for listening. Any more questions? Other questions? Remember, you started the talk with You started the talk with saying something about the algebra geometric description of non-singularity. What have you got there? Well, I don't have anything to share with that, but I think it would be interesting if it can be studied by algebraic geometry. But at this point, I do not have anything to say. Other questions? Other questions? If not, then let's thank the speaker once more. Thank you.
