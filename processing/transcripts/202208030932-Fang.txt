And also, thank all organizers for kind invitation. I'm going to talk about the non-local model with time delay and its propagation dynamics. So, I'll first talk about the question and mainly focus on the Many focus on the background of this problem. Finally, I will mention the result. Okay. So the equation of interest is the following. This is a scalar equation in the whole line. So the derivative respect to time is A decay, a linear decay, and plus a non-local term. So, this non-local term here, f is a time periodic function in t and u. And u here is, we have a delay here. This delay, we use tau to denote this delay. And the non-local kernel is G. This is. Is is g this is the green function of this non-local dispersal equation. So by PCAT classical PCAD iteration, we can have the explicit form for this green function actually in this series form. So here J sub n is defined by this recursion. Recursion. So, in the following, I will call this unfold convolution of J. Okay. And in particular, when n is zero, it is defined by the direct measure. So, in other words, so this g, the first term of this g is that is the direct measure. And then you back to the equation, we will see that this non-local term actually consists of two parts. The first part is the F actually. Part is the F actually itself. And then the second term is really non-local. Okay, so this also suggests that the solution of this equation have very limited regularity due to the presence of this direct measure. Okay, so this is the download term here. Let's mention quickly the other Quickly, the other assumptions here. This first, the second assumption is the periodicity that F is periodic and the delay is also periodic. And the third one is the monotonicity that is the derivative of respect of F respect to U is non-negative. So this is often called the positive feedback in a delayed equation. Okay, and this also will give us the comparison principle for this equation, for this equation. The fourth assumption is the derivative of toll is less than one. It is equivalent that t minus toe of t is increasing in time. And this is related to the feedback. I mean, the toll is the delay. So we call this is the So we call this the ordered feedback. In the next slide, I will show why this is important. Okay. And the last one is we assume this equation has the so-called KPP structure. That zero is always a solution which is linearly unstable and the non-narity is kind of the sub-linear. Is kind of the sublinear. Okay, our question is: what's the spreading dynamics of this doubly non-local equation? In particular, when the solution has the compact supported initial values. Okay. So next I move to some background of this problem. So here is So here is a background from the ecology. Let me just use two slides to derive such an equation quickly. So let low be the density of population with age A and at time T and the location X. Assume that the total population can be ideally classified into two groups by age. We call it adult and juvenile. Uh, adult and juvenile. So at time t, an individual belongs to adult group if and only if its age exceeds tall. And this tall depends on time. Okay. Then we can define the total density of adult. It is nothing but integration from top. From tau to infinity respected through age. Okay. Then following the Grouse law, the Grouse law reads like, so the changing time of this death is nothing but minus rho is the death when age is greater than tall. When age less than tall, there is a diffusion. There is a diffusion there, okay? It's a long-range diffusion there. So, for such kind of growth law, we usually use the plant to illustrate it. Okay, so ideally, we have this kind of growth law. Then we can derive the model for the total adult density u. So let's U. So let's remember this integration and then we do the derivative of your for u respect to time, then we will get the two terms here. So the first term is the because here I have tau of t and second one is become rho has a dependent time. Okay, then we will see that the derivative of u equals two terms here and And the second term is row evaluated at tau. The first term is still there, integration, and we use the growth law to replace it by the other two terms. Then we go on, we continue to integrate it, and then we have this the following terms. The first one is minus use the decay, and the second one is the infinite limit. Is the limit at infinity? Okay, limit at infinity, the age at infinity. Okay, and the third one and the fourth one, they combine together. We have the factor here, one minus top prime. Okay, and this one will relate it to the assumption that order the feedback. Okay, then this is row evaluated at tau. Tau. Okay. So if we know, if we can express this two terms rho and rho tau t by u, then we will have a closed form for the total adult. Okay. So for this limit, actually, we have the, we can assume it is zero because biologically, ecologically, no individual. Psychologically, no individual leaves forever. So this is naturally assumed to be zero. Okay. And the remaining unknown is row evaluated at the top. This is actually newly adult, newly added adults at time t. Okay, they must be a part of those newborns at time t minus tau. So there is a relation. tall so there is a relation between between the newly added newly added adults at time t and the newborns at time t minus tau so they must have a relation and this relation is obeyed by the following evolution problem this is ninea actually is from the growth law uh mentioned in the previous slide okay then okay Then, okay, we also assume that the newborns are given by adults. Then there's a relation using this birth function. Then we can combine these relations to obtain an equation for u. It reads the following. So the derivative with respect to time is minus u plus. is minus u plus this is uh called the newly added newly added adults at time t it is uh it is a part of the uh the survival part of the uh new bones at time t minus tau but subjected to a redistribution due to the diffusion during this uh during the maturation process so this So this model, if we here we denote the F by like one minus tau prime, this is survival, and then B, then we have, we obtain the first the model in the first slide. Okay, so this is a derivation of this model from so next. So, next, I will mention some related works. The first one is about the here, here there's something missing. So, there's a note that is S does not depend on time, Tau does not depend on time, and also. Not depend time, and also if we continue to assume that the solution does not depend x, then we will 10 the famous Nicholson blow fly model. If we choose f is the RICA type function, then we have this ordinary differential equation with time delay. For this model, I refer to this very in 1980. For the new for the blowfly, they find that this equation describes the blow fly very well, okay, in their okay. So the second one I mentioned that if g is the Gaussian, so g is not the green function for the non-local dispersal equation, is g is actually the Gaussian, then this is the model proposed. A model proposed by So Wu and Zhou in 2001, and they also showed that this model has a finite minimum speed for traveling waves. And later on, team and Zaw showed that this minimum speed, wave speed, is also the spreading speed for push problems. Okay, so if G So if G changes to be this kernel, like to have the polynomial decay, then there were no traveling waves. The spreading speed is infinite. Okay, this is, we can see it from the work by Winberg in 1982. This is 1982. This is a celebrating work. Okay. And also, in a joint work with Gregory Faye in 2016, we obtained a rough upper bound and a lower bound for this accelerating spreading based on this inequality for the kernel G. But here L is sufficiently large. Here AOE is sufficiently large. This is the reason that we obtain the rough upbound, not optimal. So this is for the case that it does not depend on time. When it depends on time, there is a work by Ing Li Pen. Uh, Ingli Pen. He's my former student, and after graduation, he went to Leming University to do the postal with Yuan Lo, and now he's a faculty there. Okay, so this in this in his thesis, he studied the special seasonality scenario that these species reproduced only one. Only once in the year, and these newborns reached the maturation in the same year. So we call this the yearly generation, yearly generation. With this spatial structure, we can see that the period map can be expressed in an explicit form, like An explicit form like the following here. It has two parts. The first part is due to the survival of the initial data here. And the second part is the newly adult, newly added adult in the end of this year. It's the kind of non-local. And due to this explicit form, he can investigate several problems. The properties like the influence of seasonality on spreading speed, and also the monastable and bi-stable dynamics. Even the growth is not monotone, it's of unimodal type. They can ask some questions there. Okay, so now I like to turn to another background. Uh, background is a sharp bounce on the accelerating propagation dynamics. So let the E kappa T is the level set of the solution. Okay, just only consider the right part. The left part is similar. We just consider the right part. Okay. In a work by Jimmy Ghani in 2011, he made an important progress. Important progress on this non-local dispersal KPP coefficient. He pretended lower bound and an upper bound for this level set. It turns out that the lower bound is optimal, but the upper bound is not. Okay, and in another work, Garnier and his collaborators in 2018 obtained this. They obtained this sharp upper bound. Okay, so their main idea is based on the homogenization idea and then reduce the problem to a Hamid Jacob equation. For this reason, so the J need to be smooth and the J also has a fat tail at infinity. Okay. So this is the Jimmy Ghanias. This is Jimmy Ghania's work. And the second one I want to mention is by Cabre and Rokshov in 2013. They studied this fractional ablacian KPP equation. They also obtained the sharp bound for this level set in this line. They also considered the high dimension, so N is the dimension. The high dimension, so n is the dimension of this media. Okay, so in this work, they proposed a general idea from the evolution viewpoint. If we know very, we have a very good understanding for this fundamental solution of this fractional Laplacian operator. Okay. So, okay. Okay, so okay. So the third one I want to mention is in a free boundary setting by Professor Du, Li, and Zhou in 2012, 21. They showed that big tail of J may also result in accelerating propagation, but in some different ways. So in my intuition, that the free boundary problem, so in the boundary, in the moving boundary, Boundary in a moving boundary, we have some loss there. So, actually, in many situations, the dynamics of the free boundary problem with KPP non-linearities are similar like the bi-stable equation for the Koch problem. But for this non-lucal problem, we will see that actually this is some, there are some differences because of the non-lucal. Differences because of the non-lucal coupling there. Okay. So, this is the work that I want to mention, but there are also some other works due to the time limited. So I will mention only this. So the next I will state the main result. So recall that our equation is like this. Equation is like this. So the level set is like this. Here, we replace the one by the here. This is the because the time periodical version, so we have the unique positive periodic solution, u star. Okay, but essentially, it's similar. Okay, let's define mu star is the absence of this conversion of this integer. Of this integral. Okay. So if mu star is bigger than zero, and possibly it is the infinity, then this kernel, you see that this kernel decays quickly. So usually it is called a light, have a light tail. The kernel have a light tail. If mu star is zero, If mu star is zero, then usually the kernel j has a heavy tail. Okay. So then we proceed with these two cases. If mu star is positive, also it's possibly plus infinity, then the level set will eventually lies between these two linear functions in time. function in time and c star is uh have is determined by linear equation in the in this way lambda actually is some uh uh is a eigen principal eigenvalue of some related periodic linear uh equation with time delay okay i i i did not put it here okay but this just does the relate to some principal eigenvalue problem Relate to some principal eigenvalue problem. Okay. And the C star here is also the minimal speed of periodic traveling waves connecting this periodic solution to zero. Okay. This is the situation when J has a lighter tail. When J has a heavy tail, then the level state actually is level state actually is bigger than any linear function. Further, if these two limits hold, then the level set of level set will eventually lie between these two guys. Okay, the inverse of J evaluated these two guys here. So I just want to So, I just want to mention the conditions here. These two conditions are related, but both of them measures how heavy it is, how heavy the kernel it is, but one cannot imply the other. Intuitively, the second one is stronger, but they cannot imply the first one. The first one. We have two examples for this. Okay. So the reason that why we have these two conditions is because we need to use them to obtain an estimate for the unfold convolution Jn. This is essential in our analysis. Okay, so let J be symmetrically non-increasing. Symmetrically increasing, assume there's two limits, then we have an estimate for this unfold convolution in this way. Jn over J is lies between these two guys here, eventually, eventually. So as we know that the convolution of J at the end convolution of gen. J at the end convolution of J as n increases guy will become flatter and flatter. So the tail looks like bigger and bigger. So here just given an order that they increase, this tail increases within the order less than this guy. And in between, like in any finite interval, Jn becomes. Jn becomes smaller and smaller. And the other part measures that how small it is, actually. So such an estimate for the n convolution of J is highly motivated by the Kistan bound in probability theory. With this estimate, we then can give, we then can have a good understanding. Then we can have a good understanding for the Grund function for the non-local dispersal equation g. Then we can also use this property to analyze the linearized equation of this model at zero. More precisely, we can have more information on the generalized, on the general solution for this linear non- Linear non-local equation with time delay. Then we can proceed with the idea by Cabre and Rokshov, the evolution viewpoint, and we can obtain the estimate for the level set. Okay, so I think time is already up. Say, stop here. Stop here. Thank you. Other questions or comments from here or from people online? Not a question, but a very clear presentation, and I'd like to thank you very much. Very nice talk. Thank you, Professor Matano. So I just wanted to, so can explicit examples where this condition on J, so it's What kind of decay this last condition, this blue condition? Some examples where this condition is fulfilled. Yes. So like the density of the Kerscher distribution, then you can verify it's easily these two conditions. These two conditions are easily satisfied. So, for those like you have the decay x minus 2 alpha, then this kind of decay is fine. But if we choose the density function for the log normal distribution, then the second limit will be infinity. Sorry, not infinity. Second limit should be zero. Yeah, the log normal distribution. Yeah, and also we can construct some discontinuous kernel that the first one is not one. The first limit is not one, but the second one is still positive. Positive. So, and in those in the case where this condition is not fulfilled, do you expect the conclusion not to be true? I don't know. I don't know. Because when we have the smallest one, like J prime equals the high order of J, then I think these two conditions are fulfilled in general. So this is the So, this is the two conditions that actually measures how heavy the kernel it is. Yeah, in more details. Actually, this new star zero is just only said the kernel is heavy, but did not say more about the heaviness. Yes. So, there could be some intermediate behavior when the mustard is zero, but the tail is. Are zero, but the date is not that heavy. Yeah, yeah. It's a very good question. I don't know, don't know the answer. For example, I even do not know if J, like if J is the log normal distribution density function, then I don't know the answer. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Luca. Are there other questions? So if not, let's If not, let's thank in again. So, there is a coffee break now.
