Oh, we have about a minute. So you're muted, Christopher. I thought you should have 40 minutes. Okay, good. You have 40 minutes, the same number of minutes as Ingo. Okay, yeah. All right. My talk will be about a certain class of non-semi-simple TQFTs and mapping class group. TQFTs and mapping class group actions. This is joint work with Marco Dorenci, Nathan Geer, Vitra, Tromiran, and Ingo. And it will be sort of a continuation of Ingo's talk. But let me start briefly with what is a 2QFT for me. It's a symmetric monodal category from a certain category of 2 plus 1 cobordisms to vector spaces. So it's sort of a linear representation of the category of cobordisms. And here I mean. Um, and here I mean uh with the standard uh the category with the standard uh monoidal structures. Uh, so the tensor product of objects is just a joint union. Um I think most of people know this formalism quite well, so I don't spend much time. So the the point for me, uh, my talk will be concentrated on mapping class group representations. Uh, so any ETQFT of this uh of this sort Of this sort allows us to represent special types of coborgism from surface to surface, which are mapping cylinders. So we start with a certain F, F is element in the mapping plus group of a surface. So I take its class, so it's orientation-preserving diffeomorphism modulusotopy. And if I have TQ of T, such catch it gives me a linear map on a vector space. A vector space corresponding to the given surface. So, how it works? To my diffomorphism, I construct combordism from surface to itself. And combordism, it has identification of input boundary with a cylinder via decomorphism F. And on the other side, it's identity. So, I have such a combination, non-trivial cabordism, and QFT should give a linear map. And this should be a representation. Should be a representation, linear representation of such a group. And let me spend a few words on the semi-simple side of this story. It goes back to Turai's book, where Turaiv explains us how to construct a 2 plus 1 TQ of T starting with a semi-simple fusion category with certain extra structure of. With a certain extra structure of ribbon category and extra property called modular. And this is, of course, based on the work of Lichitikin and Drive, and which is inspired by Wheaton. So we have such a nice construction. And examples of the input data are so-called, so they're coming from representation theory of quantum groups. And Koyer Stikin was discussing them in. Tikhin was discussing them in his talk. So, you start with, in my case, you can start with a small quantum group at a certain root of unity. It's a finite, non-semi-simple category, and then you remove so-called negligible morphisms. And this way, you get a modular fusion category, which is then a good input for what is construction. Another example of these modular fusion categories are coming from a sort of Categories are coming from a sort of physics or quantum field theories. And here I mean two-dimensional rational CFTs, where the input might be a representation category of rational DOAs. For example, lattice VOA or minimal Virasoro or affine SL2 represent integrable representations at positive integer level. So these are nice examples of also model effusion categories. And as I said, As I said, so the TQFT of Turif produces invariants of HTTP Turif and projective representations of mapping plus groups of surfaces. And what is spectacular about this TQFT, if I, it's what's called modula Velinda formula in the context of representation categories coming from the OA. At least in genus one, for the Toros case, it was proven by Huang. By Huang. And what is spectacular about this is that if you start with the VOA category, on one side, I have, for example, in genus one, I have a modular group representation on certain vector space of modular forms coming from VOA. On the other side, what was proven by Huang, such categories are modular fusion categories. So I can insert them into the gadget of Turayev and construct a Q of T and calculate mapping plus. TQ of T and calculate mapping class group representations from that TQ of T. And in genus one, I get another representation of modeler group. And the spectacular fact is that they agree. So this is a very deep fact about VOAs and the corresponding TQFTs. And let me mention some properties of such theories: is that this representation of mapping class groups, they always Groups, they always, for all the entry section, they have finite order. And as a consequence of these of finite order, some length spaces are not distinguishable by Rich Stickhen derived invariants. And the natural questions which were raised several times during this conference and also by Polysticken, that can we avoid the quotient declaration by negligible morphisms? Could we just keep the category non-semi-simple? And if so, will we get? Simple, and if so, will we get new, maybe better invariants? And indeed, Lyubashenko in 1994, he gave an answer, at least on the level of mapping class group representations of surfaces. So first, he gave actually two sort of important constructions. One is invariance of three manifolds that were mentioned briefly also by Ingo. And this is sort of generalization. And this is sort of generalization of Henning's construction. But for my talk, important is Lybashenko's construction of projective representations of modular groups for surfaces. And for Lybashenko, the input algebraic data is not the modular fusion category, but modulo tensor category. I will distinguish these two notions. And modular tensor category, it's generalization of trips, modular fusion category. Model of fusion category in the sense that we want to keep category finite as a category, it's equivalent to representation category of a finite dimensional algebra representations. But we don't require that it's semi-simple. And let me give a cheap definition of Ryubashenko's definition was different, but due to some results by Shimitsu, I can give a cheap definition of model tensor category. cheap definition of model tensor category so as i said it's there is finite condition but uh it should be librant category which means i have rating and the important uh property that it should be factorizable and factorizable means the following that uh the definition of factorizable uh involves a notion of transparent objects so uh let me uh say that object in my category is transparent if uh if i braid it with every object of the category why twice if i Y twice, if I consider double braiding, the morphism is just equal to identity map. So, which means that I can, so sort of respect to braiding, x is transparent. And we call category factorizable, braided categories factorizable if saying that x is transparent implies that it should be isomorphic to a direct sum of tensor units. So, in other words, factorizable if and only if the only The only decomposable transparent object is a tensor unit. So, in short words, model tensor category is a ribbon category with no degeneracy condition on the breaking, which means absence of transparent objects. And category, if category modular in this sense and simple, semi-simple, then it's also modular in the sense of derive. And the examples of non-semi-simple modular tender categories, which are Simple modulator categories, which was also a basic example for Lubashenko, they're coming from small quantum groups for a simple Lie algebra G for Q odd root of unity. And we consider a category of fine-dimensional representations of such small quantum groups. These are examples of model attensor categories, which are non-semi-simple. Okay, as I said, starting with such Such categories, Lyubashenka defines mapping class group representations. And let me briefly describe Lyubashenko's construction. So the spaces where mapping plus group acts on, I will call them for briefly like Lyubashenko spaces, they are these home spaces. There are these home spaces in the category from if it's surface of genus G, I take J's G's power of certain object L and consider all coin variants or morphisms from this object to the tensor unit. Where L is the coiant, a certain canonical object in the category, which appeared in many, many talks before, as object of C, it's a certain universal object. Sort of universal object to every dynatural transformation of this bifunctor when you take two objects, take one dual and tensor them to any constant bifunctor. Or topologically, that means that every C-colored bottom two, zero tangle can be factored through a morphism from this object to one in a unique way. And when you specify this morphism, And when you specify this morphism, to specify this morphism, it's important to keep in mind that L is not just an object, but it's equipped with canonical the natural transformation, or from canonical the natural map x star times or x to L. And another important fact is that in braided case, this is my setting that categories ribbon, that L is a hop algebra in category C. So, just one way to characterize it is that it's such a Hop algebra so that the category of modules over this Hop algebra internal to the category C is equivalent to the derivative center of C. In the case of Hop algebra, so when the category is a representation category for Hop algebra, for say, yeah, any Hop algebra with a braiding. Fine-dimensional hop algebra, of course, the co-int as object is just h star or co-adjoint representation. And hop algebra structure is not the hop algebra structure on h star, because l is not a hop algebra in vect, it's a hop algebra in h modes, but it's a transmutated version of hop algebra structure on h star. It's where multiplication is co-product is the same as in each star, but multiplication is changed. Is changed it involves components of the braiding. So, and using this hop-algebra datum of L and universality of this object, Lybashenka defines very explicitly action for generators of mapping plus group. So, he hints he also with punctures, but for the moment I will discuss only surfaces without punctures. Surfaces without punctures. He considers generation generation. He considers presentation of these groups via generators and relations and defines very explicitly actions of these generators on these Lubashenko home spaces. And he proves that they satisfy relations. So it's abstract construction, but quite explicit. However, he does not provide a TQFT. He does not provide a TQ of T. So, the definition is abstract, so that if when the category is semi-simple, it gives you back a Torif's construction. And let me give an example. So it's very explicit. In the case of Hop algebra case and the Taurus for genus one, mapping plus group is SL2Z, and SL2Z action on this torus space, which is coinbound. Which is coinvariance of the coiants, and this space of coinvariance of the coiant is canonically isomorphic to the center of Hopalgebra H. So Lubashenko's action for in the C2Z case, it's just certain action of S and T matrices on the center of a hop algebra. And the formulas are very simple. So you start with central element and S matrix send it to, you need two gadgets first to use. First, to use. First is a monogramy matrix. Because my hook algebra is quasi-triangular, I have braiding. So I can define double braiding, which is I call monogramy. So just r to one times r. And lambda is a unique right integral of Hop algebra H. And then S transformation is that what you do, you insert inside your integral the central element and first component of the monogamy element. You get a scale. You get a scalar and you multiply with the second component. So it's actually typically a sum over indices which enter your monogamy matrix. And T-transformation is just multiplication with inverse Ribbon element. Right. And I will give more examples, more examples of action for Genus G later in the talk. G later in the talk. But the point is that it's quite explicit. And let me mention that this Rybashenko, let me mention a connection with logarithmic conformal field theories. Again, as in the rational VOA case, in logarithmic case, we have many examples of model tensor categories, which are non-semi-simple. And the first basic The first basic family is against symplectic fermions category, which was this SF and beta. Beta, they're just force root of unities, and n is some one, two, three, four, etc. It's some natural number. N means n pairs of symplectic fermions. So these are categories discussed by Ingo in the first talk. Then there is a triple W algebra from so-called one, P logarithmic CFC models, and so on. So we have many, many C-to-Co finite V. Many C2co finite V a's which have rigid categories or conjecturally rigid, and they give a nice input for Lubashenko construction. But to construct, to use a Lubashenko construction, you have to understand the coin. And from the OA point of view, it's not clear what is a coin. But there recently was some progress with understanding these categories, and many people contributing to that. Many people contributing to that. The point is that these VOAs, the category of representations, can be realized via certain quasi-quantum groups or certain factorizable Ribbon quasi-Hop algebra. So that the two categories on the OA side and on quasi-Hop algebra side, they are River equivalent. In some cases, it was proven now. For example, in triple W algebra case, we proposed a We proposed a quasi-hop algebra with Thomas Kroitke in Grumple in 2018, and recently it was proven by Terry Gannon and Chris Negron. So now it's a theorem. For symplectic fermions, in some cases, it's again for n equal one, it's also proven, but for general and it's still a conjecture. But I believe they are very reliable conjectures. And what we observe in all these cases. And what we observe in all these cases is that Lyubashenka miping class group representations, at least in Toros' case, for genus one, they agree with miping class group representations that come from the OA side. So from the OA side again, we have certain type of modular forms, and we can calculate SL2Z action on this model of forms, and we get certain representation of SL2Z. And at least in all examples, we were able to understand. We're able to analyze these representations agree with Lybashenka construction, with Lybashenka action of C2Z. So in the case of symplectic fermions, this was computed in my paper with Ingo and our student Parsat. And recently it's still unpublished. It's based on the paper with Thomas Krotzich and Inger Runkel. We used that quasi-hop algebra. We used that quasi-hop algebra, and with our student Berger, we computed the corresponding Lyubashenko mapping class group representation. So, the idea is basically: when you have the realization of VOA in terms of quasi-Hop algebra, you can use similar formulas. The formulas in quasi-Hop case are more complicated. They involve components of co-associator, but the idea is basically this, that you can control everything, the coand, you know explicit formulas for generators of mapping class groups. For generators of mapping plus groups, and you can just do calculations in a basis. And surprisingly, they agree with VOA side. And this is one of the motivation for us with Rubashenko construction, because this allows to explore a logarithmic version of model-de-linde formula and sort of. And sort of to better similar to what we had in rational CFT, similar to the result to the result of Huang. And to so one of the motivation of TQFT constructions for us is, at least for me, is to better understand algorithmic version of modula Velinde result. And that's how we come to this natural question. We have this. Question: We have these mapping class group representations which are really correct and good, good from physics point of view, they are good representations because we see them on logarithmic CFT side. And the natural question, can we extend them to a TQFT so that these MCG representations would be part of TQFT? And here there are problems with initial Lubashenko variance. That's what also Indigo mentioned. Invariants, that's what also Ingo mentioned. It was observed in the 90s that the invariants that Lybashenko proposed, they are open zero if first petty number is positive. In particular, that means that if TQ of T extending Kriboshenko invariant would exist, then it would associate a zero invariant to surface times S1. To surface times S1, and that means that the dimension of the corresponding TQFT vector space would be also zero. So, this is abstraction, and a way to resolve this problem is to use projective objects in the category, in non-semisimple category, and use so-called modified trace. And in the case of invariants of Of ribbon graphs and three manifolds, this is all the idea. So, the idea of using modified trace goes back to Gir, Petro, Miran, and Turaev when they started modified dimensions. Then the theory was developed by Kujava, Gira and Petiro. And since then, many people applied it to construct invariance of manifolds, in particular to the known CGP invariance. Invariance. And so at this point, we are going to replace, we are not going to use Lubashenko invariance, but we are going to use renormalized Lubashenko invariance. This is what was introduced in Ingo's talk. So we disregard empty manifolds, three manifolds, closed manifolds. We only consider closed three manifolds under... lost three manifolds under certain conditions. So they should have embedded ribbon graph with a projective color edge, because at least in this case, we can use modified trace and construct some non-trivial environment. Okay, I will skip the definition of the modified trace because it's appeared quite a few times and And so, as I said, we start with a model that category to construct a G of T. So, again, for the invariance, we don't need modular tensor category for invariance of three manifolds. And as Ingo discussed, we could consider just at least on the generate unimodal categories and even consider any tensor ideal in that category if it has a modified trace. Category, if it has a modified trace, one can construct maybe interesting invariants. For TQT construction, we need modularity. And in model tensor categories, we know that always modified trace always exists and it's always non-degenerate. And this non-degeneracy is important property for TQFT construction. Okay, the idea of a reconstruction is to use universal construction. So we have this family of invariants. So, we have this family of invariants that use modified trace the invariants for admissible closed manifolds. I will denote them L prime sub C. So, C means it's my model center category, the invariance depend on C. And L prime is just to distinguish from Lybashenko's invariance. And the idea is to extend this family of invariants to a TQFT functing the universal construction of. Using the universal construction of Blanché and collaborators, and then to calculate the corresponding mapping class group representations that are coming from this TQFT construction. And as Indo said, we can indeed do that, but the source of this TQFT is a category of cobordisms under certain conditions. They are conditioned cobordisms, which is not surprising because closed manifolds are. Surprising because closed manifolds are also conditioned. The combordiums should be also conditioned. But the objects, the point that the objects in this combo category, they are standard objects as in torrent constructions. So they are punctured surfaces with labelings by any object in the category. But morphisms, which are three-dimensional comportities between surfaces, Surfaces, they should satisfy some admissibility conditions. That a component disjoint from the incoming boundary should contain at least one edge, which is covered by a projective object. And if category is semi-simple, then the two cobordisms are essentially the same. So if category is non-semi-simple, this cobordism will check its. Tensor subcategory, non-rigid tensor subcategory in COP. And in 2019, with Marco Dorenzi, Guillerm Peterot and Runkel, we have proven the following theorem for every model that tensor category over algebraically closed fields that there exists a 2 plus 1 tq of t, or there exists a symmetrical node of functor from such a category of admissible combordism to category vector spaces. To category vector spaces, and which extends both a re-normalized Lubashenko invariant. And in 2020, so in the previous year, we wrote another paper when we proved, we calculated the corresponding mapping class group representations, and we proved that mapping class group representations of this TQFT agrees with mapping class group representations of Lubache. So, which means that Which means that you keep T state spaces for surfaces or for objects in the category, they exactly Lubashenko's spaces. And despite the admissibility condition, the Mappic cylinders, the combojesome from sigma to sigma, they don't have to satisfy because there is a non-trivial incoming boundary of such cobalt. Incoming boundary of such comboism osmatic cylinders. They don't have to satisfy the missibility condition. So, every mapping cylinder is in the category. That's why these two QFTs are interesting because they provide RNS mapping positive representations. Of course, projectives, projective mapping positive representations. And the two classes, the two series agree. Let me first, before explaining the idea of this proof, Of this proof, let me first say about certain properties, at least what we were able to prove in certain examples based on quantum accelerator roots of unity, that then twist action for every simple closed curve on a surface, any genus, has infinite order. And this proof involved the TQFT construction. So, this is already an interesting feature of such TQFTs. And also, as it was clear from IngoStock, Also, as it was clear from Ingo's talk, that these invariants, normalized Bashenk invariants, they do distinguish lens spaces, which is a big difference from a stick-in-derived invariance. And so what we can conclude that topological information carried by this TQFT is not contained in the one carried by TQFT when we replace non-semi-simple category by semi-simple quotient. It was very clear in symplectic fermions because in symplectic fermions, this C-bar. Because in symplectic fermions, the C-bar quotient was just a spectrum. Okay, about the construction. So the universal construction works this way that we first start with a pre-vector space spun by generated by all possible coordinates from empty sigma. And we consider also the pre-vector space that at the Also, the pre-vector space that I denote B prime from sigma to mt. And so these are huge vector spaces. And then let me consider the bilinear pairing of these vector spaces. So we take a pair of cobordium of type M prime and M. We glue them because they are gluable. And the composition of such cobordiums is cobordium from empty to empty, so it's closed manifold. closed manifold and we we can evaluate uh because uh this one the first one is admissible uh it will be closed manifold again admissible and i can evaluate uh our renormalized invariant and this is a number a scalar so this gives a pairing and this pairing is very much degenerate of course and what we will call tqt spaces uh they are quotient spaces of uh such uh huge vector spaces by Huge vector spaces by right and left radical of the pairing. Okay, and in our case of renormalized Lubashenko invariance, it turns out that these spaces are finite dimensional. Okay, this is how we define vector spaces, how I define a linear operator for my cobordisms, for amorphous in the cobordism category, for sigma to sigma prime. So again, elements in Elements in TQFT spaces, now they are classes of cobordians from empty to sigma. This is what I denote by my elements. And now, in the quotient, I take the corresponding class. And linear map now is defined that this class is sent to the class for the composition of M sigma, which has a target sigma, with M, where M is my coordinate from sigma to sigma prime. So this composition is a coborg. This composition is a cobordism now from empty set to sigma prime, and I take the corresponding class in the quotient, and I get an element in V of sigma prime. So this is a linear operator. And similarly for V prime, at this point, we define just two functions from Cobaltian category to vector and from opposite of Cobortian category to the vector. And the theorem The theorem, okay. A few words about B and V prime. They are in a sense dual to each other or adjoined to each other with a pairing I defined using Mars-Bashenko invariant. They satisfy this property that V prime can be flipped with V in this way. And the crucial, the central and the hardest part of the theorem I mentioned. hardest part of the theorem I mentioned about this existence of TQFT is to prove that the functors we construct they are monoidal functors. So in particular that a natural morphism which is an embedding on tensor product of vector spaces into vector space corresponding to disjoint union of surfaces. Corresponding to disjoint union of surfaces, that is isomorphism. And at this point, modularity was a crucial step. It uses this cutting lemma that's in dimensions. So this was the hardest part to prove monodality. And this is the case. So we have this symmetric monodal categories. And let me describe you state spaces. So it's not only existence we know, but we have. Existence we know, but we have explicit identification of state spaces. So I start with a surface, with a punctured surface covered by objects and genus G. And these quotients of the huge spaces by the radical of that bilinear form that I introduced using Lubashenko invariance, Remember Bashenko invariance. As I said, the TQT state space in our construction are fine-dimensional vector spaces and we. Uh, we've proven that as a vector space, it's just isomorphic to Lybashenko space when you take g's power of Lybashenko coin and tensor with your colored objects, and you consider co-invariance of that. And we have explicit basis in that in the integrity state spaces in terms of comboisms, that's important for marking plus group representations calculations. So So, as I said, before state spaces, they are cobordisms from empty to surface. So, and we choose as cobordism handle bodies. So we have handle body, and for a given element x prime in this home space, I construct you a bichrome graph living in that handle body. So it has a coupon from L g power of L. From L g power of L tensor V1 Vm into one, and here there are some of these special byrom coupons which corresponds to the natural transformations of the co-iant and these red loops. Okay, so this is a Bichrom graph embedded into handlebar. It's a perfect logoism. And the statement is that all state spaces are of this form. Okay, and let me say now Say a few words about calculation of mapping class group representations. I will skip the definition of mapping class group representations. The point is that we are going to consider action of special type of cobordism called mapping cylinder. I described them at the beginning. So, for every diffeomorphism orientation preserved of a surface, I can associate corresponding cobordism from surface to surface, a cold matic cylinder. Cylinder. And let's see how dent twists, and I will consider the action of dent twists of a surface. So, dent twists for a surface, this is a part of a piece of a surface corresponding to a closed curve alpha. It acts this way. You cut the surface, then you twist along the curve alpha to P degrees, and then you glue it back. So, after this diffeomorphism, then twist diffeomorphism corresponds to alpha. The affomorph is corresponding to alpha, the curve that was parallel, it gets twisted this way. So, this is the action of my dent twist. And let me introduce another cabordism. So, and I have mapping cylinder corresponding to this diffeomorphism. And let me introduce another cabordism, which is cobordism with underlying manifold sigma cross I, so just cylinder, but inside this cylinder. Inside this cylinder, I put this red unknot with framing plus one. Also, I have minus one. And the crucial part of our construction is that, okay, let me right, as I said, we have by T5T construction for every DPI mortgage, it's represented projectively as a representation of Mappix cylinder. And the corresponding dentist is represented, and it class agrees with this cobordism that I just introduced. So the mapping cylinders, they're in the same class as, so instead, yeah, in the same class as cobordisms corresponding to insertion of this red unknown. And that's a crucial step. Yeah, let me briefly say about Briefly say about generators of mapping class group. So we consider mapping class group that preserve decorations. So on decorations, we have braidings if the VIVJ colors agree. We have pure braid group action. We have twists. And then we have this. So here is a picture of a state space, which is represented by this backrom graph. And then we have four more generators than twists along several different sides. Along several different cycles. And what we are going to do, we are going to use this result that instead of calculating mapping cylinder, you can just calculate this very simple cabordism. So basically, instead of, you just have a curve alpha and you push alpha inside the handle body and replace by this red unknot with remaining plus or minus one. And the calculation is actually quite simple. Quite simple when you have this. So, in this slide, on the left side, it's a Lyubashenko mapping class group representation, Lyubashenko's representation of a generator SJ, so which is written here gamma beta gamma. So it's like gamma beta and then again gamma. So this diffeomorphism. And on right side, it's a TQFT construction we have. So as I said from the definition, So, as I said from the definition, right, from the definition, I have to have three curves, gamma, beta, gamma. So I have to push them inside my handle body and replace by red unknot with framing. And here you see this picture. So there are three unknots. So this is a piece of my T5T state space. And then I have a gamma, which is around my state space. Then I have beta, and I have again gamma. Then I have beta and I get gamma around it. So, this is a representation of in terms of Bichrom graphs. I get a new Bichrom graph, it's a new state. So, at this point, we already calculated the action, but I need to rewrite it in my initial basis. And this can be done via using sliding property of red knots. And the calculation is quite simple. In the end, we get this bychrom graph. get this bichrom graph uh which is which is can be replaced uh via just sort of endomorphism of the coils and and that's exactly uh the definition of um of of lybachenko's representation so in this example we just see that our tqt reproduce the action of this s matrix uh let me finish uh um so at this point uh we proved so and the idea of the proof that um we uh checked Checked, so we've calculated for every generator of mapping plus group for every genus, we calculated the action of generators in this state space and compared them with Lyubashenko's representations. And so generators by generator, we just saw that they agree. And let me conclude with another interesting observation about these TQFT state spaces. Two QFT state spaces. This is a joint recent joint work with Marco and Ingo. There is another interesting action on these 2QFT state spaces. It's the action of the symmetry group of the category. So let G be the group of braided tensor after equivalences of C that commute with ribbon twists. Or in other words, it's a group of ribbon after equivalences. So what does it mean? You take set of all ribbon after equivalences of C, any mod R. Of C and mod out by Ribo-Nitro transformations. This way you get a group, you get a group structure on this quotient space. I call it symmetry group. And this group is analog of group of outer automorphisms of an algebra A. An important observation, which is not very difficult, is that such a group acts on Lubashenko spaces or on our TQFT spaces. Here is for simplicity without functions. We have a very natural action of this group. And let me give some examples of such groups. If C category is finite and semi-simple, if it's a fusion category, then the groups are always finite. If it's finite and non-semi-simple, then the group is often a Lie group, at least in examples we know. In the case of small quantum group at odd order of root of unity, this group Of root of unity, this group is PSL2C. In the case of symplectic fermions, category in which we were discussing a lot, it's a huge group. It's SP2NC, symplectic group of matrices 2n times 2n. And what we proved with Ingle and Marko is that the action of this group on TQFT spaces commutes with the action of mapping plus group for every genus. So So these groups, it means that these groups are also symmetries of the TQFT, at least of the part of TQFT that is responsible for multiple plastic group representations. Because I'm out of time, I will skip the definition of the action of the group G on TQFT space, state spaces. But believe me, it's quite natural action, which is described by certain simple commutative diagram. Certain simple commutative diagram. And again, the proof of the theorem is just direct check with generators. So we have explicit action on GQT state spaces, we have explicit action of mapping plus group, and we just check that they can use it. And I want to finish that with a hope, this is a risk problem I'm working on, that maybe this result is a sign of even better picture. Of even better picture. So maybe we have a TQFT, we can get a TQFT where the target category is a representation of this group G. So probably we have a refined TQFT in a sense, which is symmetric model functor from this admissible comboisms to the category, symmetric model category of representations of this group G. And in non-semisimple cases, it's very interesting because, for example, in symplectic fermions, it's representations of It's a representation of sp2n, and such that our TQFT, initial TQFT, non-simpliciple TQFT, is factored through this refined TQFT via forgetful factor from RevG to ref2 spaces. Okay, this is something we're still working on, and I stop here. Yeah, so thank you very much for this nice talk. Talk and we've time for one or two quick questions. Because let me announce this once again that there will be a continuation of this discussion session of yesterday afternoon today. So, Sergei. Hi, thank you for the talk. So, I have a quick question/slash comment about symplectic fermions. So, I believe on Neptune. So, I believe in that case, the underlying background or structure that's actually what I mentioned on Monday should be spin C structure. So, I believe TQFT depends on spin structure. At least that's what we see from a physics construction for galactic fermions. So, it's not exactly just G, it's leafed to spin C. G mean this group G. G mean this group G? Yeah, yeah. Right. So it's part of the declaration data, but there is also spin structure. So it's a refinement of this G. In a sense, it's refined because spin C structure will be what will be spin C structure in separate Fermi case? It shows Kartan of this SP2N. It's a huge. SP2N, it's a huge carton. And leave that by spin. So basically, it's going to be many copies of spin C structures. I mean, it's easy to write the sequence of classifying spaces that involves B spin as well as BG. GG is your group. And that is basically going to be analog of spin C structure for this. Analog of spin C structure for this G. So spin C would be analog if a group is just U1, but you can do the same from classifying spaces for any G. This is, for example, described in this recent paper with Francois, but I also mentioned it on Monday. So I would be surprised if you don't need spin structure in this case for symplectic fermions because they are fermions, and that's the basic reason why. The basic reason why can I add a quick comment on that? So it's a sort of we are sort of misusing language slightly here. So this symplectic fermion category, because we want a modular category, not some spin modular category, what we do on the VOA side is we take the symplectic fermion VOA, and then we delete all the odd parts of it. So you just take the even part. And then we use its representation theory to be able to get an oriented 3D TFT rather than a 3D TFT rather than a spin 3D TFT. Okay, then you're doing some kind of bosonization or all the way. Okay, yeah, sorry. I was commenting about usual symptoms. But that's an important point to address. So we have to add the spin structure to work with the complete syntactic function. That's right. Renat, you have another question. Yes, so I'd like to ask I'd like to ask if I want to actual calculations. So, for example, if I want to calculate, given a knot in S3, and I want to calculate the invariant of the end cyclic covering of And cyclic covering of its complement. What would be the recipe? You need to first find the representation of this manifold. Is there a recipe for that? I mean, start from the given diagram. I want a recipe to arrive at the invariant. But it is involved of what? Of a complement of a knot? You take complement and take n cyclic cover. And you can add the note, it will be closed three metric. But in our construction, we start with surgery representation. So, okay, if you give me a surgery representation of this closed three manifolds, and also first of all, in okay. First of all, in okay, there are two things: this is Rybashenko's invariance. And here I talk about this renormalized Rubashenko invariance. So the closed manifolds have to be admissible. So they should contain certain Ribashenko. Yeah, okay. Is it admissible? So given a figure 800, tensically covering, is it admissible? But it will be closed manifold with it will be non-it will be with empty closed manifold. It will be closed manifold without Without an admissible Riemann graph. So it will be non-admissible in that case. So, okay, you can still calculate a non-semi-simple invariant, Lubashenko's invariant. It might be zero. I want to calculate your invariant. For my invariant, you need consider closed manifolds with embedded ribbon graph. For example, unknown, you take a node, color by projective color of tensor unit. By projective color of tensor unit, for example. So I need to consider, I can consider only closed three manifolds with embedded, for example, notes or unknowns, but colour to protect. Yeah. And let's
