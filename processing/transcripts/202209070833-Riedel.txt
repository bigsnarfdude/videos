Organizers for organizing this workshop and for giving me the chance to speak here. And I apologize for those who attended the conference in Berlin because this is more or less the same talk I'm giving today. Okay, so it will be about random dynamic systems and a rough part. Okay, so let's start. So this is the rough topic. So I'll give a motivation. Random dynamic systems hostochistic development. Dynamical systems for stochastic debate differential equations. Then I will talk a bit about rough path and new results. Yeah, so where fields of Banach spaces come into consideration and then finally I come back to this delay equations I started with in the motivation part. Okay, so what we aim to do is we'd like to Do is we'd like to study some sort of delay, stochastic delay differential equation. So, a delay equation is something where the dynamics depend not only on the presence of the system, but can only depend on the past of the system. So, this is a typical delay equation here. And you see that in the coefficients v in sigma, there is also the term xt minus tar, which means that you evaluate the solution, the possible solution. Evaluate the solution, the possible solution at time t minus r. And there's the Brownian motion. So there's a stochastic term coming in. And if you want to solve this equation meaningfully, you have to give yourself not only a point in space, but you have to give yourself as an initial condition a path segment. And this is the zeta here. I'm not so precise about what the zeta is, but About what the zeta is, but this is, yeah, this is a path that starts a bit in the past. And yeah, so if you want to solve this equation, you have to give yourself such an initial condition. Okay, so what we want to do here, well, you can study this equation with ITU theory, but what we aimed for is actually to study this equation, so the long time behavior of this equation. Behavior of this equation, and if you want to do that, there is a nice theory called random dynamical systems. This is a very close, so this theory is very close to the theory you might know, the dynamical systems theory, which gives you some tools to study long-time behavior. So, the growth rates or detracting sets and these kinds of things. Unfortunately, Unfortunately, if you want to use this theory, what you need is a pathwise solution theory for a stochastic differential equation. So in particular, what you would need is some sort of flow property. So a stochastic, you would need a stochastic flow, which means that you have the flow property you know from ordinary differentials. Property you know from ordinary differential equations on a set of full measure. But this problem was studied by many people in the past and they found that there's actually no space of initial conditions. So this is the X here you can choose such that this equation defines a stochastic, a continuous stochastic flow. Continuous stochastic flow. And from this, it follows that you cannot define an object that is called a co-cycle. The cosycle is something like a stochastic flow, but this is a fundamental object in this theory of random dynamical systems. Okay, so what goes wrong? So there is a counterexample that people found, and this is exactly this equation here. So in the first line, a very simple one. First, line a very simple one, it's just a linear equation. And if you think about it a bit, then you see: okay, the only reasonable solution should be is actually explicit. And this is this Xt here, that involves, so this stochastic integral where we just integrate the initial condition with respect to the Brownian motion. But so, what you would like to have in order to define here is stochastic. Have in order to define here a stochastic flow would be um, yeah, so a stock you would have a stochastic flow in case you plug in here a path segment, you integrate it, and what you would like to have is then again the path in the same space. Now, for example, you could plug in here a continuous path and integrate it, you would get a continuous path as well, but you would like to have that on a set of full measure. On a set of full measure. And there is a counter theorem saying that there is no space X on which, which is first of all large enough so that can we find a Brownian motion on it. And second, what this map to be continuous almost surely. So these are two conditions and both apparently contradict, so you cannot have both. Have both. But what we know in rough path theory is that actually, if you fix a trajectory, omega, say, then you can define this rough integral here. So you fix the omega, and then there are random spaces, the dbx here. So these are the spaces of control path, such that this map here for fixed omega is meaningful, first of all, and it is continuous and much. Continuous and much more regular than you need. So, this is something which will work, but okay, see, notice the difference here here. We fixed some Bannard space and what we do here, we do not fix a particular Bannard space, but we go to random spaces here. This is the price you have to pay. And this was the idea why, so this was our idea to solve this. So, this was our idea to solve these equations or to study these delay equations with RAF part, because it seems that there is a way out of this counter-example of this phenomenon that you maybe can define something like a weak form of a co-cycle when you go to random spaces. Okay, so let me introduce or say a bit a few words about rough path theory. I think that probably. Yeah, so most of you heard about that, but still. So, what is a rough path theory? Or say, what is the motivation? And one motivation, at least for me, is that you would like to study these kind of controlled equations here, where this X here is a rough path in the sense that it is a non-smooth path, meaning that there is no, you cannot form a derivative here. Cannot form a derivative here. So this is a continuous path, usually, but not a differentiable path. So you would like to give a meaning to these kinds of equations. So this theory was invented by Terry Lyons. And so he realized that actually equation two, so I wrote it down here, is ill posed. So just having some path here, you cannot. You cannot give a reasonable meaning to a solution of this equation, but instead, what you have to do is you have to have some more information about the part. And these more information are actually iterated integrals. If you have these iterated integrals up to a certain level, up to a certain level which depends on the regularity of the path, then he realizes that you can give a precise measure. That you can give a precise meaning to this equation and solve it in a robust way. Robust, I mean here, continuous in particular in the driving path here. So then the solution map will be a continuous map in that case. Okay, so this was Terry Lyons definition. So what is a rough path? Well, it is just a Herder continuous path together with iterated integral maps. Iterated integral maps. So these are objects that somehow play the role of iterated integrals. So they are not just Fieman sums or limits or Freeman sums, but they behave like iterative integrals. And if there is some lift over a given Elar path, then we call this a rough path of X. So you can now ask about the existence and uniqueness of these lifts. And uniqueness of these lifts, and it turns out that the existence can always be assured. So there is always a lift for a given holder part, but uniqueness fails. This is reasonable that it fails, but okay. So the choice of the lift you have to do actually depends on the model you would want to consider. So the model you want to study, there's just a parameter. The lift is also a parameter. The lift is also a parameter of the model somehow. Okay, so then this was Lyonsberg, and then there was a so then there was another contribution. This is very important for us. This was done by Kubinelli. So Kubinelli defined spaces of controlled, so he called them controlled path. They depend on the rough path. So this dx here has a sub-index x. They depend on They depend on the rough path, but these bases are very nice in the sense that they are good integrals. So, given some path x, so both x here, all elements here in this path, in this space here, can be integrated with respect to rough path. And the nice thing is that when you vary here the t, then this is again a path and it's again a controlled path. So the integration. So, the integration defines a linear map from the space of controlled path to itself, bounded linear map or continuous linear map. Okay, so he defines these spaces. And what I would like to talk about now is a bit more of the question we had at some point. Can we say a bit more? So, for every x, we define a space, a Banard space of control prime. Space and Banach space of controlled path, but is there something in common between these Banach spaces? Or are they just isolated spaces? Like for every X, we have an isolated space. Can we say a bit more? Is there a bit some structure for these spaces of control part? And indeed, there is, and this is a recent result I'd like to present here. So you can show the following. The following. So, the spaces of controlled paths here. So, you index them. So, these are all Banner spaces. You index them by alpha Holder rough path here. And they define something what is called a continuous field of Bannock spaces, even separable continuous field of Bannock spaces. So, if you don't know what it is, I will explain a bit on the next slide. So, what is a So, what is a field of Banach space? So, it is indeed a weak form of an infinite-dimensional vector bundle. So, it's not the spaces of control paths, you cannot really ask for them being a vector bundle because the space of rough path do not form a manifold. So, this is not a reasonable thing to ask. Okay, so let me give you the definition now. What is a general continuous feat of Bannards? In general, a continuous field of Banard spaces. So you start with some topological space. In our application, this will be the rough path space that is even a metric space. So you have some space here, and then for every element here in the space, you have a Banach space. So in our case, this would be the spaces of controlled power. And then a continuous field of Banach spaces consists of a set of sections, gamma hat here. Gamma hat here. So, what is a section? A section is a map from x to the union of all these Banard spaces with the property that if you evaluate this function at some point x here, then you end up in exactly the Banach space, so the value of this map stand exactly an element in EX. So, this is a section, and this section should satisfy. Section and these sections should satisfy certain properties. First of all, you ask them to be a linear space of all sections. Second is you ask that for every fixed x, you look at this set here. So what do you do here? Well, you fix the x and then you run through all gammas in in in this set of sections. So these are all elements in Ex by definition, first of all. By definition, first of all. But what you want further is that they form a dense set in EX. So this is important, so a dense subset. And the second important property is that now when you fix the gamma and you look at the map x mapping to gamma x, so here you take the norm in the express, so then put an index here, but this would be an element ex, so take the norm. So this is then a map for. One. So, this is then a map from X to R, and you ask this map to be continuous. Okay. Furthermore, if there is a countable subset here of these set of sections, so this is then not a linear space, it's just a countable subset such that still this density assumption here holds. Then you call this the separable continuous field of Banach spaces. Okay. Okay. Okay, so I told you that we can prove, so I will not talk about the proof today, but we can prove that these exactly are properties that hold for the space of controlled path. Let me give you now an application why this is a useful structure. So we know that rough integration is a bounded linear map. So for every x here, you have a bounded linear map. For every x here, you have a bounded linear map of a space of a space of control path to a space of control path. So, this is a bounded linear map. And so, you can consider also the operator norm of this map here for every fixed x. So, this quantity can prove that this operator norm is actually bounded. So, that's why it's bounded in the map. And but if you now want to plug in a stochastic process, and this is what often And this is what often you have to do in the applications. Then, this operator norm here is a random quantity, of course. And you see here that suddenly you have the supremum over elements here in a random space. And so in this may gives you is a bit complicated now because if you would like to say something about this quantity, say, for example, some integrability assumption, the first question you should answer. The first question you should answer here is the question about measurability. So, what about the measurability of this quantity here? And this is something, this is why we actually found the structure. This was a question we had to answer. And if you have the structure, you can answer this question quite easily. So, let's look at the following proposition. Let's take At the following proposition. Let's take the set of sections given in the definition of a continuous field Fanard spaces. So these are now exactly the sections for the spaces of control path. So assume that for every rough path, we have a bounded linear map here. So we can be a bit more generous, but you can think of the rough integration map if you want. And we need a property. So for every G here in this set of sections, we want that. We want that this map here x mapping to the norm here. So, this is then a map also from x to r is continuous for every gene. So you can, for the rough integration map, you can prove that. So you need a measurable lift of the rough part, but this is almost always given in applications. Then you can prove that the operator norm here I define. The operator norm here, how I defined it, is indeed measurable. Okay, so how do you prove that? Well, okay, so the first equality here is just the definition. Okay, and then the second equality, there you crucially use all the properties we had. So, in particular, you use the continuity here and you use the density. And then you can, instead of taking the supremum here over these. Here over these spaces here, you can instead take the supreme over all g in delta. So, note that you fix the omega. And when you do that, well, then by assumption, you know that these for every fixed g, this is a measurable map. And since the g here, since the sorry, the delta is the countable set, you have actually a supremum of countably many measurable mappings. Mappings and these are measurable. Okay. So, and as a corollary, you see that the operator norm of the rough integration is indeed measurable. Okay. So let's go back to the singular stochastic delay differential equation or to the stochastic delay differential equation. Okay, so here is our theorem. So, okay, I didn't define what is a random dynamical system, but what you would Dynamical system, but what you would need is kind of a measure-preserving dynamical system. What you would need is a two-sided Brownian motion. You have a shift here, theta. This is like taking a trajectory and shift, pulling it back. This is what it does here. And then we have a co-cycle. So the co-cycle map is induced. So this is the solution map of this equation. This is the solution map of this equation. So zeta is the initial condition, then we have an omega. Initial condition, then we have the omega trajectory of the Brown motion. So we look at the solution at time t. The solution is a path segment, yeah. And one can prove that this actually is the continuous map of the space of control path to the space, another space of control path, where here we apply the shift theta t here, so we shift back the trajectory. And furthermore, and this is the important thing, we have to come. Important thing: we have a kind of flow property here, so it's called in this context the co-cycle property. This holds for every omega, so or at least on a set of full measure independently of S and T and the initial condition. So, this is then indeed a random dynamical system, but defined on random spaces. So, this is the thing we have to, the price we have to pay here. Okay, so the reason the question now is: can we really make use of this structure? Because it looks a bit complicated with these random spaces. Actually, it's true, so we can use it. So the first thing we had to do was to prove a multiplicative ergodic theorem, which then provides a specific Gives you some sort of spectrum of compact linear co-cycles. So, for example, solution maps of linear equations. So, an assumption we need here is the integrability of the log of the norm of this net here. This is exactly where we also need these where we need that we have a field, a continuous field of Banach spaces, because here you really need the measurability. Is because here you really need the measurability. So, we even asked for interpretability, but what was first important here is that you have to show the measurability. So, this is a common assumption, but then you can prove that there are these Lyapunov exponents, which are somehow the discrete spectrum. In our case, since we have Banach spaces, they're infinite, so they're countably many. And there are also spaces called oscillator spaces. called oscillat spaces where yeah somehow you they are they are characterized by the growth rate of the of the solution so this is the characterization here the growth rate the exponential growth rate is just given by the um by this yapunov exponents so there's a kind of splitting of these spaces so this is when you know a multiplicative ergodic theorem this is very you probably know You probably know what you can expect here, and this is exactly what you can expect. So, there are some remarks here. So, no injectivity is assumed. This is important because when we look at delay equations, we want to solve them forward inclined and not backwards. So, injectivity, you cannot assume. And also, our measurability assumption seems to be weaker even than the METs that are proven for single-band spaces. So, we do it for fields, which are more general, but even for single-band space. More general, but even for single banner spaces, I think this is interesting. Okay, last thing is not so important. So, then finally, what we can do now is: okay, when you have a couple of minutes to yeah, this is the last slide, so I think it's okay. Okay, so what we can prove are stable and unstable existence of stable and unstable manifolds about stationary points. So, this is something we do in dynamical systems as well. As well, so and how you do it is well, you have a non-linear equation, a stochastic delay equation, you look at the linearization, so you take the derivative in the initial condition, then you get the linear equation, you apply the MET, you get these stable and unstable spaces, these oscillated spaces, some are contracting, some are expanding, and then you go back to the non-linear equation and so around. And so, around these, say, stable and unstable subspaces, you obtain then some sort of manifolds, where you have exactly the same behavior, so stability or unstable directions. Okay, so here are the references. I think they're not maybe not so important, but yeah, so then I'm done. Thank you very much.
