Okay. Okay, so it's my pleasure to introduce Anna Roches from Paris. I'm JPRG. Anna was previously in Barcelona, I think, and is working on random hyperbolic three manifolds, which we'll hear about now. Okay, so thank you very much to the organizers for inviting me to give the talk here in this conference. It's been very interesting so far, so I hope I can keep up to the level. So, as he said, I'm going to Um so as he said, I'm gonna talk a bit about random hyperbolic three manifolds. So I wanna start by giving you a bit of motivation of why it's just something interesting to study. So there are many reasons one can be interested in hyperbolic 3-manifolds. One of them, for instance, that you can think of is if one aims to study the topology of two manifolds. So as you may probably know, there As you may probably know, there is no topological classification for three manifolds. And somehow the result that strongly result that goes towards it is what it's known by third-party menstruation projector, which was proven later by Ferman in 2006. And what this theorem says is that in very big lines, that every three-manifold, if you're nice enough, meaning closer into. If you nice enough, meaning closer intervals three manifolds, can be decomposed into some canonical pieces, and each of them emits a geometric structure among the eight possible geometries that there are in 193. So what happens is that, except from a hyperbolic geometry, the manifolds admitted in the other type of geometry are by now somehow well understood. And what are they, what are the properties? What are they, what are their properties, etc. But for the class of manifold-emitting hyperbolic metric, we still know very little. And this class is supposed to be the largest class of three manifolds. So all of this to say, even if we only care about the quality of three manifolds, trying to study hyperbolic manifolds would help us understand a bit better this theorem that I just mentioned and maybe go towards something, knowing something more. Something knowing something more about so when you say there's no classification, you mean it's just because there isn't a list of all everlasts? Yeah, for instance, in dimension two, there's this classical theorem which tells you that every closer interval surface is ethereomomorphic to the surface, to the sphere, to the torus, or surface to the G. We don't have that in the context. So, okay, so that's a multiple. So, okay, so that's uh motivation. And um so we want to study hyperbolic manipuls and one way to do that is to try to study the geometric invariants and how these geometric invariants behave if we increase the complexity of the manifold. So in this case, for instance, we can measure the complexity of the manifold by the volume. So we can ask questions such as what's the behavior of the geometric invariants when the volume goes in. And we can try to search for different behaviors. So, just before this morning, we listened to questions regarding extreme hold behaviors, and we can ask also some other questions regarding typical behaviors. So, what's the average geometry of a hyperbolic 3 manifold if the body moves? So, this is more or less the kind of questions I'm interested in. And so, in particular, I want to talk to you about the typical behavior of one of the geometric invariants of hypolytrie manifold, which is the n spectrum. And so, about this nanospectrum, what we know so far is the following. So the length spectrum of random compact have rolling three money forward with boundary. Convergence and distribution when processed on the basket grills with computable intensity lamp. Okay, so I am aware that there are some things in this statement that I haven't really described or explained. So actually the m the the main goal of my talk will be to try to explain and introduce all the concepts that appear in the statement so that we can understand a bit better what is here in the statement Understand a bit better what is here. Let me just write it down. My goal for this start would be to explain the following. And then, if I have time, let's say maybe say a couple of things before we add. Okay. Okay. So in order to explain this, then we start with the basic object of study, which are these random hyperbolic three manifolds. To start with explaining what these are. So in dimension 2 we have heard that there are several models for random surfaces. Also in dimension 3 we have several models for random 3 manifolds. The three principal ones, let's say, the most known is the one called random hero splittings, which was introduced by Donfin and Thurston. There is another also important model which is called random mapping theory, which was explained in the previous talk. Just the construction of it, just that this diffeomorphism that we were taking for is just taken at random, so with some random walk in the market. That was also introduced by Dampil and Thurson. And finally, the one that I'm gonna use for my Use for my that I'm using for my research and that I'm going to explain in this talk is the one called random triangulations. So let me start with this. So this model was introduced by my advisor Ram Petri and Jean-Rambeau in 2008. And Jean Rambeau in 2020. And the idea, so the general idea of the model is the following. So we want to construct three manifolds by randomly gluing polyhedra together. Gluing polyhydra together on faces. So that's that's that's the basic idea. So consists of a random gluing polyedra on other faces. So in here the first thing that comes The first thing that comes to mind that actually would be the natural choice of ask polyhedral to do this procedure would be the three simplex, which is the cytohedra. But if we try to take this as our building block and glue titrahedra together along the faces, well, this won't work. So, what have So, what happened here? What happens is the following. So, if we take, for instance, XM to be the complex made of antidahedra, then it was proved by Dominion and Thurston that the probability that this complex will be That this complex that we consider here is the same M. So what happens is that as the number of T to V that we consider goes to infinity, the probability that what we obtain, the complex that we obtain, is actually manipulative. And this is due to the fact that And this is due to the fact that typically the neighborhood of these vertices are not homeomorphic. So they should look like spheres, but they typically don't. Okay? So we have this problem of the vertices. What can we do? Maybe we can try to take some easy approach. Easy approach and say we have some problematic spoil, let's take the points out and see what happens. And so we do that, and instead of considering tetrahedra, we consider truncated tetrahedra. The problem we had actually goes away. And so we take this as our building blocks and we glue this truncated ethereal along these examinal faces. So the faces So the face is curing green. What we obtain is a manicle, and in particular, what we obtain is a compact three-manifold with R. So the boundary comes from the The boundary consists of all these triangular faces that appear when we take the vertical map. Okay, so what I've just explained sounds like a very deterministic It sounds like a very deterministic process. So, where is the random here? So, the random comes from the fact that this gluing that we do here is made at random. So, at the end, what we are doing is we are taking n copies of a truncated qualibra. So, we are gluing these n copies to the exalton faces. So, at the end, each of the truncated equilibria has four exalted faces. So, we have a set of four n exalton faces. Example faces. And what we do is we pair these 4n exact faces into 2n pairs. And we do that uniformly at random. So we take the uniform probability and then we pair them. And then not only that, but then once we have the pair, we have three possible orientation preserving gluings that we do. So again, we choose uniformly at random one of the three possible orientation preserving gluings in each. In each of the pairs, and that's why the resulting manifold is random. Okay, so so far that's very good. We have obtained with this procedure a compact three manifold. But as I said at the beginning of the talk, I'm interested in studying hyperbolic manifolds. Well, it turns out that the manifolds that we construct The manifolds that we construct in this way are going to be hyperbolic with probits and so this is a result that was proven by the same author model. So testing on one more precisely you can say as the volume goes to infinity, so what the number of pieces. The volume goes to infinity, so the number of pieces, but the number of truncated goes to infinity. The probability that Mn admits a hyperpolymetric with totally genetic boundary. Alright. So that tells us in particular that this model of consortion of random manifolds is a suitable model for studying properties of hyperbolic models. Okay, the closed ones. Yeah, no, you can get closed I mean, you can get closed ones if you consider two copies of this. Consider two copies of this and then you glue them through the identity map through boundary. But of course, they will have this extra symmetry that appears when doing this one. When you get boundary components that are spheres, you cap those off with balls in order to get this. And if you get boundary components that are tori, are you making those costs? So actually the what we know about the boundary is that there's only one boundary, there will be everything I'm saying is. Be everything I'm saying is almost really 101. There's only one boundary component and it will be a surface hybrid. Okay, so the fact that this admits a hyperbolometric is not something that we can see from the topological construction I've just explained. So one way to see how they can get to that is by doing the following Is by doing the following the following construction. So you see how so how do we say this? So the first thing is that if we take Truncated tetahedra, and we can see there the interior edges and we contract all these interior edges, then we have the So the hexagonal faces that we were gluing along become triangular faces. And so this whole cohedra becomes another whole cohedra, which does anyone want to guess? I've heard the right answer somewhere there. Okay, that's Answer somewhere there. Okay, that's precisely that's very correct. So the so this, once we collapse, all the interior edges became the equahibra. So we do that with every truncated etihetra that appears in our MM. We construct another three-manifold that I'm going to refer to by my M, which is again. Refer to by n, which is again a ceramic probi boundary, but made of octahedral. Alright, and now we use a bit of hyperbolic geometry. So we want to put a hyperbolic geometry. To put a herbolimetric on this yn. So that we can do using the following. So we can consider we have H3 model by the conquerable. We can consider some lists in H3. polyhedron that lives in H3, which is called an ideal right-angled regular octahedron. So an ideal right angled regular octahedron is an octahedron in a street in such that every vertex is the point that it's at infinity, so it's in the boundary of a street. That's where the ideal word comes from. And right angle is just because the angles between the faces Just because the angles between the faces is this. So this is just a convex set in A3, so this back obstruction has a high quality metric, which is unique up to isometry. And so what we can do Is we can end up each of the octahedron that appears here with a hyperbolic metric of an ideal right-angle octahedron. And so if we do that, then this yn that we had before That we had before becomes a complete finite volume hypervolume three manifold with totally genetic power. And so now that we have constructed this other hyperbolic manifold, what we can try to do the last step is to try to recover the MN from the beginning. From the beginning, which is the one we are interested in, because among other things, because it's compact. So we want to recover NN in this yn that we have constructed, and we do that using some templates. Okay, so Jessica Burcell explained a bit how the damping worked. So in this case is somewhat particular case of damping. I'm gonna try to explain with the drawing. So I'm sorry it's going to take a bit long, but I hope it's going to be a bit small. I don't know if you start to see what I'm trying to draw, but a priori it's supposed to be seven factor kits going around. Alright? So the damn killing that we just done here is the following. So we consider Is the following. So we consider. So here we have this is a piece of the boundary. And this is a bus. So what we do is consider for a spherical neighborhood of this cusp. It is going to be just an honest open cylinder. Open cylinder, and we take this cusp neighborhood out, and then we fill the hole that appears. So, if we want to relate it with torus, if we take the double of this manifold that we construct, here instead of a cylinder we will have a torus. So we will be taking the close neighborhood and we will apply, we will put in, filling the hole with the solid torus. So there's just kind of a half of a dangerous. So we So we do this down filling and then we tried to control the change in geometry when doing the desk filling using some results of Switzerland, whether cell and slimer that gives us enough control of the data. Control of the geometry when doing all the specific prime. So, with these three steps, we can see that the hybrid metric that was on Yn can be transferred to the Microsoft Yn. So, I'm saying all this story, first because I think it's pretty interesting, and second, because both the Micro Yn and this compactification procedure take a role on the proof of the theorem that I did at the top. Okay. So it's there is there any questions so far? If not, let me continue with the statement. So far, we have explained what are these random compact modules that are in the statement. And so the next step would be to explain what is these two. What is this geometric variant that I'm talking about? So this is probably quite known for most of you, but just in case I'm gonna recall it. So we consider M a hyperbolic manifold. then the length spectrum, which I'm going to denote by L of M is nothing else that the multi-set because it has some multiplicity of the length of all the closed geodesic circuits. of all the closed geodesics that are in and that appear in R. Of of the length of on close G and uh for those who are not very familiar with this object, this might look a priori uh somehow like like a huge I mean like a mass. like a huge I mean like a mass. But isa it is actually a countable set. And that uh comes from the fact that comes from the fact, the standard fact for pyrolyt geometry, that in every pre-homotopic class of essential closed curve, so essential meaning non-trivial, non-homotopic to a cut for the round component. So in every Component. So, in every free MOTOP class of this essential closed curve, there is one single geodesic which minimizes the length of the motop class. So, we have a countably many multi-p classes, and then we have a countably many geodesics, and so countably many of them. So, this is the set we're gonna be interested in. And just finally, the only thing The only thing remaining is just recall what was uh first I mean process. So as a general definition, we can consider for instance some pick some measurable face and then you can Because the point of which process as a random countable subset Set S of X, which satisfies two conditions. So the first condition is that we consider any subset A of X and we define the random variable NA as a number of elements that lie. As a number of elements that lie in A intersection this random subset S, then the random variable in A will behave like a Poisson random variable with parameter unit A. And the second condition is that for any A1 AK Aka fair way to join subset of X then the vector form that this random variable A with n of A1 N of A is a vector of independent random variables. Okay so so this is the definition in the in the general case so we knowing now these two conditions we can we can re-read the following the statement that I mentioned at the beginning as follows. At the beginning, as follows. So the length spectrum of random compact hydraulic 3-manophobic boundary, just the length spectrum of this Mn that constructed with the model I mentioned, this is a countable random subset of the positive fields. And as a countable random subset of the positive reals, Random subset of the positive fields converges in distribution to another random subset of the positive fields that satisfies or that verifies the two conditions of what we have. Okay. So if there are any questions so far? Is there any questions so far? If not, let me just. I actually have a question. Yeah, so I guess the length spectrum is discrete, right? Our products, and I guess consequently, I mean, the PowerPoint process on R plus, this is sort of almost surely discrete. Get a counter set, but I guess it's almost surely discrete one, is that? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so for instance uh Yeah, so for instance uh so the the intensity that that one uh obtained here is it's uh this measure is an awareness measure I think some of the direct densities Okay, so let me uh let me explain a bit uh how how uh the proof goes, if there is no other question. If there is no other question. Okay, so the first thing that I want to mention is that in order to prove the result, I somehow reinstate it in some more geometric terms. So, what I do actually is the following. So, we can encode the length spectrum using Using the following random variable. So we would take some positive L, and you can see there some AB, some positive numbers. We can define for any AB positive, we can define. A B positive, we can define the random variable C of A in A B of M N as the one that counts the number of closure designs in N M of length. Between A and B. And what we can do is we can try to study these random variables. And so if we do that, then this statement that is here can be restated in terms of the random variables following. So we can prove that for any A1, B1 A t V T the reals and the vector of random variables by C of A one B one from N C of A T B T T B T and N converges joining distribution to a vector of independent random variables of parameters. From parameters depending mainly on the length. So on the interval that we have to find the random variable. So that's the first thing. So actually I'm looking at that result in these terms. But what I tried to do is I studied these random variables. Um and now uh the the big uh the big uh structure of the group goes into steps. proof goes in two steps. The first step is that we actually prove that theorem for the manifolds y n that we have described before. And the second big step is that what we do is we check that after the dam filling that I mentioned before the result which The result which holds for yn still holds for 1 plus m. So in order to prove it for y n we rely on the following idea. So we have this complex made up of theta and then we consider the dual graph of the complex. The dual graph of the complex. So the dual graph is made, so we put a vertex on every article and we join them whenever they have a pace to be screwed. So we do that. We see that the rural graph of this complex is actually a Is actually a four random for regular graph. So once we consider this little graph, we observe that the curves that are inside our manifold can be almost two paths in this little graph. And so basically in order to count flow geodesics, we can count paths in the world. So we transfer, let's say, we transform the geometric problem of counting flow geodesics. geometric problem of counting flow geodesics of purple length of counting uh purely combinatorial problem of counting uh paths and so on. And finally, just for the Poisson convergence that appear in the result, we use a classic method in probability, which is called the macro moments. We use the method balls. So these are the somehow the steps that go into the proof of the result for the microphone yn. And once we have that, as I said, the final The final second big step is to see that after compactification also holds for one for them and and to check that it comes it comes down to basically check two things the first thing is uh to see that the after this compactification process the length of the of the geodetics don't change too much. Don't change too much. And for that, as I said before, we use As I said before, we use, among other things, but principally, we use the same result in a different way of fetter-processance line work, which under some condition on the topon normalized sense of the cusp gives us some bilips the equivalence between the thick parts of the manifold Yn and the manifold Nn. And uh with that we can control this uh change in band. Control this change of belt. And the second thing is just to check as well that any two close geodesics that were non homotopic in YM become homotopic when we lead to the cover. Okay, finishing in one sentence. So, asymptotically, my sugar, any sweet. So another topic that is MYM become in And that we can do using some geometric argument using cover covered topology. I have to stop here, so thank you very much. Okay, questions. So, how does the intensity of the limit is different? The intensity of the limit distribution looks like? Computable intensity. But yeah, I didn't say anything about this because so computable means that I have an explicit expression for these parameters that appear here. And so you can be using a computer, you can compute. Using a computer you can compute, for instance, the probability that we have k closure that is the length between A and B. But it's computerly hard. I mean probably not that hard for some of you, but at least for me that I'm not very familiar with programs yet. It's a bit hard. But it it is explicit, so a pure woman can compute. What can compute Think it'd be possible. Can I ask? Back when you were doing the random three manifolds and you were randomly blue and you had a truncated tetrahedron, is connectivity a problem? Like, is it somehow with probability one can you get it connected? Yeah. Okay. Such a stupid question. More questions. From Zoom? In which case, um thank you uh thank you again. I'm gonna have a short break and we'll be back to pop out for the short talks. They're only going out to the circle. Maybe describe it takes quite a little bit of time to at least because everything's working and all of a sudden they're all the same.   I guess there's probability one number of opportunities around the planet that you have because you need that. And then also everything stays in the middle. I mean, I guess actually inside everything stays in part of your construction. Sure, let me over here. That was the first minute. That was the first time. They can online go up here and see part two. They enter the C part, even though they enter the C part. So they're moving it down. Yeah, and the key part is they will come up with when there are key parts for the maximum that we will have.
