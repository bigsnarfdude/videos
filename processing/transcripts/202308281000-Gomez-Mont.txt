 Okay, moving. Pierre 10 connections with me. Okay. Thank you very much to the organizers for. To the organizers for inviting me to give this lecture. Thank you very much to you, the participants. We hope these meetings will continue in person in near future because personal contact is very important. We have to remember Roberto Callejas, who was a very close friend to all. Who was a very close friend to all of us. And unfortunately, he's not here with us. We hope Wiffy arrives to heaven. And also, we will be missing the artistic and spiritual person, Tere Pepe's wife. We sincerely miss them both. And so, I have been recently involved in understanding something which has been known for a long time, but I'm trying to look at it a closer look. That's why I say a closer look to the closer look to something which is familiar to all of you. In principle, the problem can be stated. Can be stated in n variables, but I will state it in two variables because there is much more information. And even in two variables, I have not obtained the final result I am aiming at. This is a joint work I have been doing with several people, including Christian Bonatti from France and González Villa from Italy. From Simat and other people. So the basic object is a germ of an analytic function in two complex variables. And on the one hand, we have the geometric picture coming from this. Coming from this, and on this board, I'll put the algebraic the algebraic part. And so from the geometric part, so here we have the disk of radius R in the complex plane, and over here we have what's called this Milner tube. A Milnor cube, Milnor cube. And so over the point zero, we have the singular variety, which I think it will have several irreducible components. So this is the factorization of the function f in the ring in the germ ring of germs of holomorphic functions having different. Functions having different irreducible components. And so, topologically, so C T zero, we will denote the set of points where F is equal to T zero. So, C zero is topologically a union of R disks at zero. At zero. The only thing is that if we view them from the point of view of the sphere, so each of these will intersect the sphere in a complicated knot, depending on the nature of the components F, and the different components will be so this is, and then the thing looks like a cone over this. Over this, so that's the fiber over zero, and the miracle is that if we put C T zero for T zero different from zero, then from this singular point emerges a big bang and there is this topology coming out of this little point. And so what people in So, what people in singularity theory want to understand this is then, so here comes out this thing like this. And so, this CT0 becomes a compact surface with R boundary components connected, connected. A connected, connected compact surface with her boundary components and some genus G. And I guess from the time of Euler, one pictures this, so you have this boundary. So, you have this boundary, and then things look like this. And here is the genus coming out. And so, here we have our point T0. And if we go around, so Milner's theorem says that outside of zero, this is a fiber bundle, a locally trivial fiber bundle. And so this is. Fiber bundle, and so this is classified by what's called the holonomy map, which is the map which you have to do to glue. You know, you cut over here and then you have to reglue again. And so you get a holonomy map here. H is a homeomorphism, which is the identity on the boundary on the boundary and is unique up to isotope. And it's unique up to isotopy. So it's not a unique map, it's unique up to isotopy. So we don't have a now. So from time of Euler, you put the genus like this. Now, what I want to convince you is that that's not what's happening here. This is for a topologist. Topology sees the surface like this. Like this. A geometer does not look at the surface like this because, in here, there is no difference between the different genuses. And so, I want to convince you that there is a difference between the different genuses, these genuses, and that they are assembled in a very nicely way. And the monodrome, so you have this. So, so you have this thing over here, and so this induces a map which goes from the first homology group of C of T0 with integer coefficients into itself. So, this is called the algebraic monodromy, and this one over here is called the geometric monodrome. So the famous monodromy theorem says, which is perverted by linear algebra, that so if we here put the complex numbers, we can put so this is defined over the integers, but if we define it over the complex numbers perverted by linear algebra. By linear algebra, the monodromy theorem says that the eigenvalues of these are roots of unity and that the size of the Jordan blocks is at most of size two. That's the statement. Now, when you look closer at the monodromy theorem, at some point they say something like this. This H star is maybe written Is maybe written as a semi-simple part times a unipotent part. And so here are concentrated the eigenvalues and here are concentrated the Jordan blocks. But of course, I've taught linear algebra many times, but I was dissatisfied with this statement. I don't like linear algebra overcoming this geometric picture. Coming this geometric picture. So, I would like to convince you that there is a geometric version of the monodromy theorem, which will be a statement of the following form. So, I will decompose for you this CT0 into a union of Of different so this will be the these are so this will be Riemann surfaces with boundary but the holonomy map map will be restricted to these components. We'll be permuting the components and at some point they will be periodic. So I will choose a representative of the holonomy map in such a way I will partition this surface into different pieces in such a way Different pieces in such a way that the monodroming map will be permuting them. So, actually, that they are eigenvalues, its eigenvalues are roots of unity. It is seen because it's a permutation. If you have a permutation group, the eigenvalues are roots of unity. So, in that sense, one says, ah, roots of unity, of course, it comes from a permutation. So, there will be this permutation. This permutation, a geometric permutation, it will be permuting. So, that's one option. And a second option is that some of these surfaces S T zero J will be rings. So, rings or annuli. And this, so so and in in here, the whole In here, the holonomy map, the geometric holonomy map, then when you raise it to a power so that they are already fixed, so since these components are periodic, these ones will be the identity on the boundary of the rings. So here we have this ring, and the holonomy map on these rings. These rings will be what's called a dent twist. So it will be twisting. So geometrically, the holonomy map will be permuting these pieces. And these pieces, there is this ring. And this is what's causing that the map is not periodic. Not periodic. See, it's periodic on these parts where you can see the roots of unity. But on this part, since it is twisting, if I apply twice, it will twist twice. And again, three times, four times. You never twist in the opposite direction. Okay? So this explained the Jordan blocks. So in some sense, here it one explains. It one explains the roots of unity, and here one explains the Jordan blocks. And magically, to understand this, we will use the polar curve, the polar curve to show this. Now, even on top of this, so this space, which a topologist might just view like this, is a high. Like this, is a highly structured, if you will, over the complex number, a vector space. This means, so I've been motivated in understanding this by this mixed Hodge theory of the link. So we are going to apply mixed Hodge theory to this situation. And so what the Link tells us is that the invariant is not only. That the invariant is not only a vector space or a C module. It's a flag. What does this mean? So, this means that we have some vector space, but we have a family of sub-vector spaces, and we have a map which is preserving the flag. So, in that sense, not all homology groups are the same. There's a difference between the different. There's a difference between the different homology groups, and these are organized in a way of a flag. That's one difference. Another thing, which is relevant here, is that this is not only a C module or a vector space, but it has a bilinear form. So we have a bilinear form, and this is the And this is done because if we take a homology class and we take another homology class, so we take alpha and beta, we can take the intersection product of the two, which counts the number of times they are intersecting and with a sign depending whether it's orientation preserving or orientation reversing. So this is Is a C module finite rank, which has an anti-symmetric bilinear form, which is degenerate because these loops over here intersect zero the other ones. But once you put a disk on each one of these, you obtain a compact surface with no boundary. Surface with no boundary, and by Poincaré's theorem, this becomes a non-degenerate bilinear form. So, this cop product is a degenerate bilinear form, but once you cut by the aniculator of the form, you get a non-degenerate bilinear form on an even-dimensional vector space, an anti-symmetric bilinear form. So, we have and so. We have we and so on this partition that I'm going to show you, then the co-products. So the annuli don't give any participation to the homology. The homology is concentrated in these pieces where it's a permutation. And then the different pieces will give an orthogonal decomposition. Composition. So this means that if you take a loop, a closed loop in one and a closed loop in the other, then they don't intersect. That's because they are disjoint. So I'm interested also in understanding how to break up the vector space, but with the bilinear form, with the bilinear form. And so, and then using this description, Description: The algebraic monodromy map, then on each piece, restricted to the homology on each piece, so H1 of S T0 said, it will be a permutation. So the matrix looks like this, plus there is one term which is the identity. So it will be a permutation, and so the And so the picture, the picture in each of these pieces looks like this. So we have this thing which is going around. So this is this, and then we have these pieces which go like this. So I will construct some graphs. So this is like a graph. The one I put in the center, it doesn't exist. The center doesn't exist. These will be the generators of the homology. Then the map will be only moving by one. And you can see the periodic part. Where do I get this picture? From the polar curve, from the polar curve. And actually the partition from the polar curve. I will explain this part of the polar curve. And here we have this permutation. We will find... We will find generators of the homology where the monodromy map is just a permutation. And then the bilinear form restricted to each of these ST0J's have a form. So it's anti-symmetric, so it has some zeros. So it will have some rows like this, where it's plus or minus one. One also on the other side. And of these, there are only three because this will be well in this picture. There's only two because this one intersects this one and this one intersects this one. But in a more complicated situation, it can intersect three. So that's going to be this. So that's why I call it a closer look. So this is the picture. So, this is the picture you get from Milner's book. But if you look closer, there is this distinction. This is not just a C module, but it has this direct sum decomposition. This direct sum decomposition, one can figure out that the holonomy map is a permutation, so one can see the roots of unity. And then the The Jordan blocks will be the following. We construct the graph. So let me see. I get this eraser. So erase here. So we will construct a graph. So, construct a graph where the vertices are these components S T zero j and then if if a boundary a boundary of S T zero ST0J1 intersects a boundary of STJ2, you put an arrow. So this means we will have something like this. So this is intersecting these guys, or so this is intersecting these guys over here, and then These guys over here, and then so we will have things like this. So, this will give new homology classes. So, we will have the following description. We have zero. We have here the direct sum of the homology of the pieces. We have here H1 of the CT0 set, and then in the quotient, we have the In the quotient, we have the homology of the graph. And here we have the age. Here we have this periodic part. Now, over here, we will induce a map over here. And this is also a periodic, this will also be periodic. So this is periodic, periodic, and the non-periodic part are just these then twists. Are just these dent twists, and we can assemble all these dent twists to form a positive definite bilinear form. So, in that sense, we are so we want to cut up the surface into finer pieces using geometry, not using topology. For a topologist, everything looks the same, but for a geometer. But for a geometer, we will see that there are these different pieces, and this partition is made in such a way that all this happens. Now, before I rush and also So let me see. Yeah, so there is this famous y squared minus x cubed, and then you have y squared minus x cubed times x squared minus y cubed. This a Campo example. example this this this this would be this this the this this this example so in this case there is only one component this is irreducible and so here we have something like this so for this the Milner fiber looks like this this looks like this now in the partition we're going to make this will be written as something like this Something like this, but it has two holes, has two holes, and then so this would be one piece, and then the other piece would be the two holes, the two holes. And so this, this, and then in the Acampo example, what we have is two pictures like this. Pictures like this. So we would have something that comes like this. So we have something like this. And we have something which comes like this. And so here are the tubes. So here are the annuli. Here are the annuli. This is, so here we have one, two pieces of this type. Of this type. And here we have two pieces of this type. And then if you, so they have to be the identity on the boundary. So this fixes these two things, but it's doing some homology over here. So on this part, so it will be only, it does something. There is it's not the identity, the holonomy map on these pieces, but it will be. It will be permuting. So, in this part, I will show it looks like this. So, this component is isotopic to the following situation. One, two, three, one, two, one, two, one, two. So, this surface over here, this one over here is. Over here is isotopic to this, and what we are gluing in this other case is a disc over here, a disk over here, and so we get this picture. And when we have two copies, so each one of these, so the construction will produce a graph. A graph is just vertices and aristas. And Aristas. And we will produce a graph for each of these pieces. And the graph will be of the following form. So you put on a circle, you put many points, and then you take, you skip N and you skip M and then you And then you skip minus n, you skip minus m, and then you do the same thing at every point, and you construct a graph which only contains points of valency 4, which is symmetric. And these pieces are isotopic to this graph. To this graph. And in here, you can see the basis of the homology because you go N, then you go M, then you come back minus N, and then you come back minus M, and you have a closed loop. That's the basis of the homology. So these pieces, each of these pieces is a homotopic. A homotopic to a graph like this, to a graph like this, and in here you can see the homology basis, and you can see how by rotating this thing over here, you obtain this periodic part. So, in that sense, the polar curve construction will produce for us several of these graphs, each one for each of these components. Each of these components and some rings which are gluing together the different components. Is that more or less clear? Any other question? So in that sense, the miracle is that the polar curves The polar curves come and give some organization of this situation. But here I didn't mention the algebraic, the research which is motivating this is that on the algebraic side, so this is the geometric part, which I'm going to explain in more detail in a moment, but just to say In a moment, but just to say some words about the algebraic part. So, in the algebraic part, we have this which is called the Jacobian algebra or the Milner algebra, which is the ideal generated by the ring obtained by quashing by the partial derivatives of the function. And so, the theorem, which is classical, but also Milner. Classical, but also Milner has it in more dimensions: is that the dimension of H1 of CT0 C is the same as the dimension of this algebra AF. So this gives an algebraic procedure to compute this topological number over here, but there is no map. There is no map. It's just these vector spaces are, let's have the same dimension. But you might, what about giving me an isomorphism, a canonical isomorphism? That doesn't exist. So what is? How come that these two spectral spaces are the same, but there is no canonical isomorphism? So if this space over here has this finer structure, This finer structure, then this other vector space must also have this finer structure over here. And now, who is the bilinear form? That's the first. Who is the bilinear form? So, fortunately, we have been having these geniuses recently. So, we have the Ling, which introduced this mixed hodge structure and introduced lots of Lots of interesting objects, which unfortunately don't have a geometric interpretation, it's just an algebraic definition. And we have this residue formula, which is called Grottendieck residue, which you can find in Griffith-Carry's book, unfortunately in page 600. So you have to So, you have to be rather curious to arrive to page 600. But anyway, and it does something like this. So, this is a bilinear form which goes from AF cross AF into C, which is a symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form. The other one was anti-symmetric. This is symmetric. And it's defined in the following way. You take 2g1, G2, and this is 1 over 2 pi i square, the integral over f1 equal to norm of f1 equal to norm of f2 equal to 2. And here you put g1, g2. G1, G2, DC1, X0, DC2, and you divide by F1, F2. So if G1 is a multiple of F1, then you can cancel this. And then by Stokes' theorem, this integral becomes zero, just by Stokes' theorem. And so this means. And so this means that this bilinear form will be zero if G1 or G2 belong to the ideal generated by F1 and F2. And this is a non-degenerate bilinear form. Now, one might say, there's a relationship between that bilinear form and this bilinear form. And you say, I don't believe this. That's anti-symmetric. This is symmetric. So that one is degenerate on the boundary component. One is degenerate on the boundary components, and this is not a non-degenerate bilinear form. So, what's the relation between the two? So, this is a theorem of Varshenko that says that there is a relationship. Okay. So, I want to understand this relationship. And at first, I, for dimension, n, all this goes in dimension then. I said, I have this conjecture. This should be like this. It didn't work. So, I have been forced to go down to the smallest dimension. Go down to the smallest dimension, dimension two, where we have more information to see if there I can understand something. I haven't understand very much, but we're understanding something. So then, as I mentioned, the algebraist, if you look at Steenbrink or other books, they say They say you take n is equal to the logarithm of the unipotent part. So, and then they consider the following object. You consider this bilinear form, this, and here you put the n and you do like the analysts do. The analysts do once you have this L2 norm, then they put a symmetric operator. They put a symmetric operator or anti-symmetric operator, and they construct another bilinear form using this thing. So, here you put alpha and beta, and then instead of doing intersection product of alpha and beta, you do, you apply n to the beta, and then you intersect with the alpha. And this is a bilinear form. And so this one over here does not only have one bilinear form. Not only do we have one bilinear form, but there is another bilinear form which is now symmetric, which is produced from coproduct and from the logarithm of the unipotent part of the logarithm of the unipotent part of the monodrome. I'm not an algebra, so you know, when I see this, I say, what's this? I don't like the logarithm of the unipotent part of the monodrome. So I say, what's the geometry underneath this? Geometry underneath this, that's what I was searching over here. So it turns out that this N has the following geometric interpretation. See So N is the following map. So here you take, this goes from H1 of SQ. I'm going to use rational coefficients. And here it goes to H1 of SQ. And so you take here. And so you take here an alpha, and then you're going to send it to the following situation. So here we have our surface. Looks like this. And then we have here some, see it's passing through these rings where we're doing this twisting. So we have these rings. Have these rings where we're doing the twisting. So we take the alpha, you're doing something like this, no? And then it closes. And so to the alpha, you're going to choose, you choose at each of these rings, a guy like this. So So, a generator of the fundamental group of the ring. So, you call this beta i's, these ones, then you do intersection product of alpha with the beta i's. Then, you, so this is measuring how many times your loop is passing through the ring, how many times, but then you wait with. But then you weight with beta i, and this belongs an element in the first homology class. And here you put a weight, so here you're going to add up over the different eyes. And here you're going to put some weight, which depends on how much twisting you did. So there is a map which goes, so this is rational number. So, this is a rational number. So, this rational number depends on how much you have to iterate to become periodic, to be the identity, to be the period, to be the identity, and the amount of twist that you did in the annuli. And then you wait. So, to a class, to a homology class, you're going to associate the number of times you pass through this ring. And then, but you're see if you. Then, but you're seeing if you just act like this, this is a number, but we don't want a number, we want a homology class. And so you wait with the beta I. Now, the image of this map, it's only supported on this, but these things have intersection zero. So this lies in the part where the bilinear form is degenerate. So the bilinear form in the image is zero. Is zero. So this gives, you know, I felt satisfied. You know, I don't need to take the logarithm of the unipotent part of the monodrome. I didn't like that. I said, what's this? And so this is this. This is measuring this. And so the bilinear form, this one over here, if you take alpha and then you take n beta, this bilinear. This bilinear form, what is it measuring? This is measuring the sum of the weights Qi, and this is the common times that alpha and beta passed through the same through the same the through the same annuli. To the same annuli, so you have you you you you you you take two paths and they say how many times did they pass here alpha three times and beta two times so it's three times two six times the weight and then you sum over this this is a non-degenerate positive definite bilinear form once you have killed the aniculator so one of our theorems So, one of our theorems, which is published, and you can find it in archive with several co-authors, is that this bilinear form is a positive definite bilinear form. So this gives a geometric meaning to this bilinear form, which is obtained from the links mixed Hodge structure. So, what we're trying to do is to put the mathematical objects which The mathematical objects which are generated by mixed hot structure, there is this Steinbrick book on mixed hot structure of singularities. Also, you can find many of the things which I'm mentioning in this Kulikov's book on mixed hot structure on singularities. So what I'm doing is putting in some geometric flesh on this algebraic nonsense. So that's that. So that's that. Any question? I'm confused enough. Not enough? Okay, so let me pass now to the polar curve part. So in here, you can see from this over here that the partial derivatives of the function are playing a role. The partial derivatives of the function are playing a role. So we have a ref now we choose we choose coordinates So that the projection to the first factor, when you restrict it to this curve CT, CT into C is in general form. So a generic projection. We don't want a special projection. We don't want a special projection, generic protection, it's in general form. And so, what do we see? So, here we have a disk in the C1 variable. And over here, we have the CT. This map then is a D to one branch. One branched covering where D is equal to D1 plus DR. These are the, so we had the F was decomposed as F1 times FR. And so the multiplicity of F1 is D1, the multiplicity of FR is DR. So the multiplicity of F is the sum. So this is a DQ. F is the sum. So this is a D to 1 branch covering. And then if we choose the T sufficiently small, the critical values will be a bunch of points over here. The genericity assumption implies that for each critical value, there is only one critical point. It's a Morse function. We have a Morse function. And so if we take a disk sufficiently take a disk sufficiently, an annuli sufficiently large, over this annuli, we will have different annuli and then for each component we will have an annuli which is covering d1. The next one an annuli covering d2. So we have our annuli each covering d1 up to dr and this is outside of the set of critical values. Critical values. Now, one knows from general topology that there is a representation. So, if I choose a point over here and I take a transversal, here I have V points. So, there is a representation from the fundamental group of the disk minus lambda. Let's say lambda are the critical values into. Into with base in the base point over there into the permutation group of the elements. So the surface over here is completely, the information is completely contained from a represent, you know, I take a path over here, go around like this. And so this gives me a permutation of the things over here. And I can recover who CT is from this. Is from this representation. Now, the thing is that these sets of points look very wild, this representation and this looks very wild. And this is a very unfortunate situation because for algebraic topologies, it works very nicely, but for geometer, it doesn't work very nicely. And so I am going to convince you that this is. Convince you that this is not the case. This is not the case in the sense that these things are not random points. The number of critical values, so number of critical values is the intersection number of f with partial of f with respect to c1. And here we begin. And here we begin to go into a very interesting round, which is what's the relation between f and the partial derivatives of f? So here we have a map, which is d to one, which is completely controlled by the multiplicity of the original function. Here we have the number of critical points in some relationship between f and the generic partial. And then And then we have to understand this representation. And so this could be, in principle, a very complicated representation. So, but fortunately, the geometry organizes the thing. So I'm going to show you that the critical values, so, or let's do. So, or let's do it like this. So, big picture like this. So, here is this disk in the C1 plane. Zero is a regular value. So, this means that over here we have the disks, right? Because, so here the Here, zero will be a regular value. So, these are this is a D to one covering. So, we have these D disks. Now, the critical values are not a mess like I put over there, but if you make the T sufficiently small, they will organize themselves in a circle and they will. And they will be in different circles. And so you can put a ring around each of these circles. And so you get the covering over this ring. And this will give these surfaces, which I explained. In the rings where there are no critical values. Where there are no critical values, then above, you have annuli, you have different annuli. That's the annuli. And so the critical values are not this number of random points in the disk. No. They are organized. And who does the organization? Where do you get the organization? Well, you take partial of F with respect to C. Partial of f with respect to c1 and you factor it into its irreducible components. Before we factorize the f now we are factorizing the partial of f with respect to c1. And so we get this these numbers. And so for each one of these components, we're going to have different. So the thing is that, see here. See here, this is equal to the sum of the intersection numbers of F with the different GJs. So this means that the critical values are organized according to this way, how you are going to intersect the irreducible components of the F. And this, I was hinted by the theorem of Merle. Hinted by a theorem of Merle that says that in the case of an irreducible function, the number of Poissot exponents in the expansion, there are as many irreducible components of the partial derivative of the polar as there are different polar as different Puissot exponents. As different puissot exponents of the function. Now I'm dealing here with the case where there are different irreducible components. So there are each irreducible component has its pushot exponents, but you have different pushot exponents. And so now, so you have this. Now, so we're going to concentrate on one of these annuli. Okay, so let's see. So I have to convince you of this. To convince you of this, that the critical values are not random points, but are organized points. And these organized points, they are organized in a circle. Why in a circle? Well, the thing comes from the fact, well, let me begin to give some details of the proof. So So the following diagram is somehow complicated, but it's not too complicated. According to a conference that I heard that Gromov was saying, that the difference between a mathematician and an ordinary person is that an ordinary person cannot follow an argument which gives two steps. They're lost. They're lost. Mathematicians, according to their ability, can see several steps and don't get lost in the steps. So I'm going to here give an argument that has, I think, three steps, which already is complicated, has taken me a lot of time. So it might take you also some time, which is the following. So here we're going to have the T plane. Here we have zero, and here we're taking a circle. So these points are of the form R0 e to the i theta. Over here, we're going to have the C2, but here we're going to have the different irreducible components of the polar curve, not of the function. So this will be the polar curve. G1 up to GS. And so I take the factorization into irreducible components. I shrink. Every time I shrink, very small. I shrink. Now, the map, so let's call it PJ is equal to GJ equal to zero. So this is an irreducible component of the polar curve. This is the polar curve. So we're going. So we're going to lift. So since this is an irreducible polar curve, this may be parametrized by a disk. So by the normalization theorem, any irreducible component is normalization. There's a map from the disk to it, bijective, which is only collapsing this point. So from here, let's. So, from here, let's call this alpha curve. We're going to bring it over here and we're going to mark a point. And here, the map, which goes like this parametrization, and then this is the projection. This is W to the to the to the A1 to some number. So, this is a holomorphic function. So, this is branching to some order. To some order. So the inverse image of this circle is a circle over here, and this point now has A1 points. A1 point. So the lift of this on the polar curve are A1 points. And I do the same for each of the irreducible components of the polar curve. So that's what. So that's one step. One step is you lift the circle in the T variable. Now, here, what's good is that each one of these points is in C T, not the other ones. The other ones are not in the CT. They are in another Milner fiber. But here I have A1 points on the same CT. Here I have A2 points on the same CT. Here I have A3 points on the same CT. points on the same city. Now, this I project now. I'm sorry. So this I'm sorry. This is this is the F. So we are lifting the circle to the polar curve using the F. F restricted to the polar curve is not constant. It's some function. It's this function. Now, here I'm going to project to pi one. And so And so this one, then, again, will be if I use this parametrization, so this will have some multiplicity. So this will be W to the Bi. And so here I will have a circle, almost a circle, which is winding around B one times according to. Times according to which is the order of branching of this, and on this I have A1 points. Okay, so this is one step, two steps, and now I'm going to lift this to C T. So here I have this C T here here I have C T so here here I have C T. So here I have Ct, and so this is alpha. This is, I have alpha, F minus one of alpha, one step, two steps, pi one of I minus one of alpha. And then I'm going to take, so this is pi one t, so and then pi one t inverse of f of pi. Of f of pi one of f minus one of alpha. So this now becomes so assuming that each of the branch points is a point of order two, then here I will obtain a graph which contains these points of order two. So it will be something like this. So I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So, at each of these branch points, so here I have one. So, if I view this as a graph, this is a graph which all its points have valency two. But now, since at these points is branching of order two, then its inverse image has valency four. So, here I have something which looks like this, and then this goes over and goes like this, and this goes over and goes like this, and so I obtain a Like this, and so I obtain a graph. And then, if you think a little bit and are smart enough, fortunately, one of my co-authors is smart enough, you realize that the graph you obtain over here is this graph I explained to you, which is something like this. You put on the circle. So, these are these points. And then, what happens is the following. So, you start lifting this. So, but when you lift this to C. You leave this to Ct. See, on Ct over each one of these points, there is one point which is a branch point, but the other ones are not branch points because it's a Morse function. So when you start moving over here, you start from a branch point, you lift, and then when you reach at the next point, perhaps you're not going to be passing through the branch point. You pass through a point which is not the branch point. So you figure out how many times do you pass until you arrive? Times do you pass until you arrive to the next branch point? That's the M on one branch, and then you take the other branch, then that's the N. But then there is a symmetry using the holonomy map. So the graph, which in principle is a very wild graph, is not a very wild graph. It's a very simple graph. So in that sense, that's how we use the polar curve to obtain the pieces. Obtain the pieces, we obtain that each piece has a homotopy type, which is simple. We can, from the graph, see what's the holonomy map. We can see the basis of the holonomy. We can see the holonomy map. We can see the intersection form. And then with this other picture here of this other bilinear form, we are more like, so that's a closer look to this homology. To this homology, we have not completed what the relationship with the algebra, with the Milner algebra. That's what we would like to understand. And after we understand this for two variables, hopefully we will be able to go to three variables and etc. Thank you very much for your attention. Very nice, yeah. So I was wondering whether your construction was not available. So what's the problem at the end of the call? Uh-huh. Okay okay, it it's what it's called. Okay, uh so so okay so uh so this is as I mentioned by Euler all surfaces of genus G are the same. So in that sense, when you view from the point of view of topology, so as you mentioned, we don't expect this to be We don't expect this to be a topological invariant. For the function f for the function f for the function f, I mean, not for the partials or what? No, I mean that we can find examples of two functions which have different polars, which have different which are topologically equivalent, but they do have different polars. So, in fact, polars, for instance, one has reduced. instance one has reduced polar and the other one has irreducible polars and so we expect that this is a finer this may give a finer invariant right okay and also if you look at the weighted homogeneous case maybe uh it's interesting it's possible to make a relation uh in your construction with the weights and uh degrees And degrees of weighted homogeneity. So these are two questions. First question: Thank you very much for the reference, I mean for the idea. So in that sense, it's not a topological invariant because polar curves, the number of irreducible components of the polar curve is not a topological invariant. So in that sense, this partition breaks down. It would be interesting to understand how. To understand how, when you move in parameters, how these polar curves behave and whatever. Thank you very much for that question. For the other case, we have begun to understand the quasi-homogeneous case, but I don't have a precise answer to your question. So here, classical. You know, classically, one assumes that the F is irreducible, and then you have Puissot exponents and blah blah blah. And then we are dealing with so in the case that there is only one irreducible component, then the N doesn't appear, and we're not interested very much in that case because I didn't mention, but in the case of the algebraic case, But in the case of the algebraic case, the n is given by multiplication by f in the Jacobian ring. So, in that sense, we don't have a complete picture of what's happening in the quasi-homogeneous case, but of course it's an interesting case to be settled. Yeah, just a final remark. It seems interesting that this is similar in some sense to and Paduzhinsky's construction. Construction for the Lipschitz invariant for functions because they look at the restriction of the function to each irreducible component of the polar. And it would be nice. So in that sense, also, I didn't mention, but in this picture, I didn't have time to explain this. But the thing is that, so we have this circle, and over here, we have this. We have these branch points which are over here, like this. So this is on now, but when we leave this, we go like this, and when we go far away, and then we come back here, this gives us the M. So in that sense, that's related to what you're saying in the sense that these points might be very close together in the ambient metric, but they are very far apart in the intrinsic metric. Are in the intrinsic metric. So it seems that reasonable to expect the relationship between this construction and the construction of Lipschitz geometry. Thank you very much for your questions. Is there any question, more questions? I don't know if online No question. Well, thank you very much, Javier, for this illuminating conference. Thank you very much.
