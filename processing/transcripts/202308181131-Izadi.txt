We can see what's going on? We can see the slides and then on the side we can see is now we can just see you. Before you just push something, we could see more people joining the Zoom call. We can also see mirror our room on the screen. All right, thank you. So, shall I start? Yes, yes. Yes, yes, it is. Okay, alright, so our group has been working on what my title says, hypercar manifolds on the continent foundations. So I wanted to start by explaining a little bit what hypercancers are and why are we interested in them. So it all goes back to actually the wrong photos. Unfortunately, I don't have a way of pointing things out on the screen. Pointing things out on the screen. I hope that I'm gonna try and speak slowly enough so that you guys can follow what I'm saying and read by the same part. But please let me know if there's a problem. Okay. Indeed, if you don't see what I'm talking about, well. Anyway, so a Riemannian manifold. So it goes back to Riemannian manifolds. So what are Riemannian manifolds? These are same UNP manifolds endowed with special metrics. And what is that? It means that you have what we call a 2-zero tensor. I hope people of you who have a physics background are familiar with this kind of technology. In C infinity of the dual of the tangent bundle square. So basically what this is, it's a binding force on the tangent space of m at every point, which varies, when you move the point, it varies in a single way. And in fact, we want to also only And in fact we want those only to be symmetric, meaning that a priority this guy acts on a pair of vectors, which means that if you swap the order of the vectors, it doesn't change. Okay, so it's a symmetric binary form on the tangent model. And we also ask that it it should be positively definite, meaning that whenever you apply G to V D, this you apply you V D, because you plug in the same vector V into the two slots in G, then you get something that's positive provided that your vector is not zero. So that's positive definite, like being positive definitely. So these are, you know, these are, yeah, these are Riemannian manifolds. And there is a fundamental result of Riemannian geometry, which says that actually whenever you pick a CN book, it's seen with Riemannian. Because the end would fixing if you might call, you can put the remote in metric on it. So these things always fix this. And actually, some hard problems have to do with how many of these techniques fix this influence. But anyway, I'm not getting into that on that. Differential geometry. So and it turns out that Regolds have got, maybe I can Maybe I can actually use my pencil and then on the wrong pencil just to do this stuff. Okay, so it turns out that the Riemannian manifolds have canonical connections on their tangent bundles as well. These guys, we call them levitudical connections. If you don't know what a connection is, a connection is basically a way of differentiating things. So if you you know, if you live in Euclidean space, you know how to make the sky. But if you're not in Euclidean space, if you are in a general manifold, you don't know how. Basically, on a general manual, we're going to make filters. The connections are a way of allowing us to take both of these, even though we're not moving frequent space. And usually, connections actually are on a tangent level, which means that you actually take vertical fits. Well, what you're doing really, you're taking derogatives or vectories in various vector directions. Anyway, so that's what the connection is. And these Riemannian manifolds have got these special connections which are compatible with the Riemannian vector. And so it sort of means that basically And so it sort of means that basically when you take the derivative of the Riemannian metric using this connection, your Riemannian metric is actually a constant. It's a constant metric with respect to this connection. And that more or less characterizes the connection. Anyway, so once you have a connection, you can also talk about something called the holonomic group. The holonomic group is a group of transformations, again, which acts on the patch. Again, which acts on the tangent spaces of your marriage, right? So the holonomy group naturally embeds in the group of automorphisms of the tangent space at every point. And what is this? It's, you know, I'm giving you the definition here. It's a group generated by parallel transport along loop space at x. It sort of means that, you know, you take a vector, which is trying to double time x, then you take a loop. Then you take a loop and then you sort of try to move the vector along the loop in a way which is constant for the direction. So again, you want the vector to be zero with respect to this connection. So when you move along the loop, you come back to the point x. The thing is that usually you're not going to get back the same tangent vector based that you started with. You get another tangent vector. And that's the transformation. That's the action, and that's the transformation. So, and you can show that actually if you change the point, you get the same group up to conjugation. So, then we can just talk about the holonomy group without having to specify the point. It's kind of like a fundamental, you know, group. You have to normally specify a point, but most of the time it has an address, so it often could not be discussed. And we also have this that this polynomial group, you know, you can acclude it on the According to the metric G, and because everything is interconnected, the mononomic group also leads to the metric more. So, in fact, it's not just a subgroup of the general linear group, it's a subgroup of the group of linear transformations which preserve the metric, which we call SORG. Okay, and Durham has got a famous theorem about the minimum. this theorem about the Riemann manifolds if n is a remaining complete under the next manifold that means that the relatively common terminology I'm sorry about that and you assume that it's simply connected meaning the final group is not trivial then you can show that mg can be is a product of Riemannian manifolds in this way so the first guy the first factor n0 is just The first factor N0 is just the ingredients space. And the other factors are things that are what we call irreducible, meaning you cannot decompose them to four factors. And this decomposition is unique up to the 1 m10. So this is the decomposition that Durand did. And then Berger has got a further classification theorem. He says, okay, take all of these irreducible guys that Durand is talking about, right? Suppose that it's not symmetric. Suppose that it's not symmetric. Not symmetric means that basically it's not a group quotient. It's not the quotient of some group. And then it's complete again. Well, if you like, complete means that basically all the geodesics can go to infinity. And you want it to be connected, and of course it's remaining. And then if you have something like this, then it tells you what the holonomic group can be. And actually, well, you take the connected component of the identity. The connected component of the identity of the whole group, which is just this whole zero. And so he has a list of seven possibilities. And the first possibility is that the volume group is the full or polynomial group for the metric. That's what we call the generic metric. Well, this guy's just generic. I don't know what else to say about them. The second possibility is. The second possibility is that the dimension of the reminiscent manifold is even, so our beta little n is the dimension of n equals to 2 times n. And it has to be at least 4. And in that case, our possibility is that this whole zero group is isomorphic to a U of L, which is the group of transformations which preserve permission. And it naturally events inside SON, and these are what we call Klan. And these are what we call careless. So that's kind of nice. Then the third possibility again is even dimension, at least 4 again. And in that case, the holonomic group is SU of M, so this means the terminal one and inside U of M. So then, and these guys are Clavia and Jay. That's what we call this guy. I think they'll be. Would be fourth, right? I think maybe many of you are interested in this drawer. And the fourth possibility is n is actually 4 times a multiple of 4, then the whole zero is this group S P of R. This is the group of transformations which gives a quaternionic permission to measure in y. So this is a smaller group than the previous ones. Each time we do it, the group is getting smaller. And these are what we call hypercarl. So these guys are, in fact, So these guys are, in fact, you know, these are, if you want really, if quality is something for irreducible, well, they are irreducible, actually. Irreducible hypercale. Okay? And these are the guys that were interested. And so these are one of the cases in this classification of holinogy. And there are also, you know, if you're interested, there are three other cases. Hol0 can be this SPR SP1. This is like some kind of a weird group generation thingy. We have SP1. Generation thing, we have SP1 and SPR, and then you have one for battery function. We do some kind of a semi-wait forever. And then these are what we call quaternionic KLA. This group, I said the group always gets smaller, this time it's getting bigger. So these guys are actually more general than finalized. They're actually not minor. And then 6 and 7 are exceptional. So the holonomy group is kind of just one holiday. There's just one possibility, it's just kind of like it. Any questions before I continue? I hope I'm not going too fast. That's the danger is writing, but that's not I don't see any questions. Not so far. Okay, so like I said, so then you know, this is this is part of so the first reason why we eat the microcalers is that this is this. Believe in microcalis is that this comes from the classification of model market clothes. That's why we're interested in them. So, and now there are lots of results known about multiple channels. They're very special manifolds. And they have a lot of special properties. So, all of these things you can find them in the literature. I don't have a complete list of references. I'm very far from it. I'm just mentioning a few things here. I'm just mentioning a few things here. So the one thing that you do know is, for instance, that when you look at H2 over hypercale, then the H20 piece is one-dimensional. Here I pretend it as being generated by one element. That's what I mean. Still, omega generates H20 omega. And this guy is what we call the syntactic form. In fact, it turns out you can show that this syntactic form gives you a natural map of wedge 2 of the tangent on the... From wedge two of the canches onlooked into the sheet of regular functions. And in fact, it's non-degenerate in the sense that if I kind of take if I take this wedge 2, I think of it as being inside T, and then I move one of the T's to the other side, where I get an induced path like this, and omega gives you an isomorphism between the tangent bottom and the full co-patch. Okay, and then there's something There's something, again, H2 is quite special. There's a quadratic form. This is the Looking Landbook model. There's a non-degenerate quadratic form on H2 of M with values in C. And there are various ways of, there are a couple of ways of defining it. And you can rescale it so that it actually plays integer columns. And then the signature is, when you test the real numbers, the signature comes out 3 V2 minus 3 V2 is the dimension of H2B. Then is the dimension of H2 with coefficients of C over C. And you can also show that this guy is basically like an nth root of the cop product. So if I take an element of H2 and I raise it to the power 2n, here 2n is the dimension of my manifold. My manifold has a real dimension which is divisible by 4. So here m is my complex dimension which is divisible by 2. Which is the visible by 2, right? So 2 is the dimension of m over c. 2n is the dimension of m over c. If I take a cosine h2, I can raise it to the power of 2n, and if I integrate that, then I get a number. And so what you have, what you can prove is that you can find a rational number such that when you 1 minus product 1 with a power n by the rational number, you always get this 2n power of these two points. Of these two points. And also, if you apply it to the omega, the generator which is equal to effect zero, if you apply it to omega plus omega bar, the non-text contributor, you get something that's positive. Maybe that will make you know I get it. And um and this this um this guy is called This guy, this quadratic form, allows you to do something very nice, which is to construct a period domain for these size. So, what's the period domain? Suppose we have a lactist which is by definition, a free abelian group of finite rank together with a non-degenerate quadratic form. Here I'm calling my free abelian group of congregate gamma, my non-degenerate quadratic form of conjugate q gamma, right? And then you can And then you can form the period domain, which is by definition this Q sub gamma, big Q sub gamma around right here. What is this? You want to think of this as being inside the projectivization of your lattice tensituate complex numbers. So this now is just a finite dimensional complex vector space, and I can projectivize it, like at a projective space. Inside this projective space, you know, I can extend my quadratic form by linearity, and inside the quadrature, I can look at the zero. Inside the quadratic, I can look at the zeros of my quadratic form, which is this q gamma bar. My q gamma bar is the zero set of little q gamma. And then inside q gamma bar, I have a real analytic open set, which is this guy over here. And I'm taking the alphas, of course, where q r alpha is zero, but I have this positivity condition, which gives me an open set, which is not open in the sense of topology. Not open in the service cryptology, but it is open in the open function. So that's what we call the period domain for a lattice. Now, if you take a hypercale multiple, as we said, this H2 of NZ has got a natural productive form which is not degenerate. And we can think of this here as an abstract lattice. I can forget that this came from M, right? And then I can define this abstract lattice as being basically the same. Lattice as being basically the same lattice, but I got a transfer. I take a re-Ideal group of rank equal to the rank of H to the length C, and then I can transfer my quadratic form to it, right? Now, if I can look at this abstract categories, and then a marking is an isomorphism between HQ and CQN and gamma together. And if you have, you know, if you take the modularized case of marked hyper-gamma manifolds, Hypergian manifolds for this particular lattice, then you have something called a period map which takes a manifold and sends it basically just to HP. Sorry, it sends it to the class of the omega, to the generator. You send the manual to the generator of H2C1. So this guy is here in the syntactic form. We know that the form, we know that the quadratic form vanishes on the sympathetic form, and we also know that what a quadratic form evaluated at omega plus omega bar is positive, so that we can send the manifold to the line span by its syntactic form. So this is what we call the period map. And you know there are various nice results known about this period map. It's a local isomorphism. It's a local isomorphism and it's globally of degree 1. I mean after you do some adjustments Okay, so we have this period domain and so hypogenomyoplasm I was saying are very special. So another special property that they have is that whenever you if you look at a map from a hyperloss If you look at a map from a hypocrite line to something else, then if you assume that the map is not trivial, doesn't just go to a point, which means the motion of B is positive, and if you also assume that the map does not go to something of the same dimension as M, so here we want the dimension of B to be strictly less than the dimension of M as well. This is what we call a vibration usually. If you assume something like that, then it turns out that actually every smooth fiber of this guy is an abedian right. So this is the combination of various partial results that are obtained by different people, but the end result is that the fiber is an abedian right. And the person who started it is Matsushita, which is where him, as I said, a lot of people have also contributed to this. This. And it turns out also that these fibers are what we call Lagrange. What that means is that if I take my syntactic form omega and I think of it as a bilingual form of tangent space, and if I restrict that to the tangent space of my fiber, then I just get zero. So my bilingual form vanishes on these fibers. And that's what we call a Lagrangian sub right here of a of a of a manifold with a syntactic form. Of a manifold with a syntactic form. So, okay, and you can show that this is the existence of these Lagrangian vibrations is just one condition. So, the set of all hypocritical manifolds with Lagrangian vibrations is a union of co-dimensional 1 subsets, complex co-dimensional 1 subsets, of both the marginalized space and the theory coming. And the view on it. So, okay, and also there's a nice result that I just wanted to mention here is that conversely, each time you take a Lagrangian subright with the manifold and you assume that it's half its torus, you can actually prove that it is really, it is, it turns out there exists a Lagrangian fibration such that this torus is a fiber of that fibration. Okay, so this is another So this is another very nice result. And another result is that whenever you have a vibration and if the base of the vibration explodes, that base is actually asking which I explain. So now, as I said, these guys could mention one subset in the modular space. And also it is a result of Kamanova, Rubitsky, and also Matsushirova's other contribution here, that the union of these co-dimensional multi-profits is actually dense in the modulus. Now I'll come back to this in a second. So, okay. Now for this, so I'm going to just digress slightly to K3 surfaces. slightly to K3 surfaces. K3 surfaces are two-dimensional, are the two-dimensional hypocritical manifolds. So any two-dimensional hypercanner manifold is a K3 surface. And having a Lagrange configuration for K3 surface means that it is what we call ellipic, right? In this case, the fibers are one-dimensional elliptic correctness, which means that they're elliptic colors, generically. And you can, there's a theorem that says that if you have a projected K-proof surface, then it's elliptic if I'm surface, then it's elliptic if and only if it has a non-zero divisor whose square is zero. Square here I mean just intersect the divisor with itself or apply the quadratic form Q. I mean for K3 surfaces the quadratic form Q is equal to the intersection format. So okay and then so then the question is you know is this can this be general? The question is: can this be generalized from higher dimensions? And this is a big, big conjecture, which people don't know how to crack yet. There are some partial results, which I don't have time to get into. But the conjectures, I want to mention some conjectures, which are reformulations of the conjecture of strongly radial acid, which is a lot more general, which compared to the bit of a bit which were a while ago. But in the case of hypercaders, it kind of gives you a couple. It kind of gives you a couple of conjectures. The first one is that you have there exists electronic corporation, if I know if there exists again a non-triple concept, which is what we call NEF. NEF means it's numerically effective. And numerically effective means that whenever you restrict your device to an actual cover, then you get a non-negative one. So you have a divisor which is not trivial, meaning not trivial, not linearly equivalent to the zero divisor. It is in F. And also you ask that the code form applied to this device. The device only has a class in H2, so I can take that class in H2 and I can apply my code form to a device. So that's what I'm doing. So this conjecture says, okay, well, we know that it follows relatively quickly that if It followed relatively quickly that if you have an administrative fibrillation, then you do have such a device. You basically put back a line from your projected base space, hyper base side, from the PN, it gives you a device that has stitched, which will have this property. It would be left, it won't be trivial, and it will be overlined. I mean, the fact that we could have performed this neural net, we can use this result for Rubisky, but I think it's actually easy to apply. Alright, so we're asking whether this is true. As I said, this is the big conjecture and it will be again. There's another conjecture, which is kind of similar. Again, you're saying suppose that you have a device, which is not trivial. Now I'm I'm dropping that I'm not keeping the numerically effective condition anymore, but I am keeping the condition from the zero. The condition of the co-manipul is zero on it. Then this conjecture says that you can find a macro, another microcanal manifold, which is bi-rational to n, such that this guy that's bi-rational to n does have a legal direction. So the idea is that basically you have a device there which is not in m and what you can do, you can do some birational transformations, you know, if you like, you can do some surgeries on n and come up with a new hyperkeli manifold which is birational fluid, such that basically Such that basically by doing those surgeries you kill all the curls on which B is linked. So now this new guy, your divisor would be marketably effective. And then, well, Q equal to zero doesn't depend on the birational class. So that will be also true. And then you can... And then it's similar to the previous contraction. Okay. So looking at this, so, you know, as I said, these conditions are kind of mean that basically having Conditions are telling me that basically having an anti-fibration is very close to having a device or where the quadratic is zero. And okay, so then if you can look at the, here I have a diagram, you know, with the marginalized space and also the period domain, right? So inside each of these, I have some low sign. So I have this, I'm calling, I'm putting this. I'm calling this isotropic subscript here. What I mean here, I'm looking at the loci where there are devices where the quadratic one is bigger, meaning that they are isotropic for the quadratic one, right? And then here I have graphs. What I mean by this is that I have a rational Lagrangian vibration. By that I mean what I have here is that I can find something that's birational to n. Something that's birational to n such that that guy that's birational does have a Lagrangian vibration, right? So the locus of this birational Lagrangian vibrations is contained in the locus where you have the visors that are isotropic, right? So that I have to get to these obvious inclusions. And then the last one is the losses where I have the regular Lagrangian vibrations, meaning that it's end itself that has a Lagrangian vibration, not just something that's bilateral. That's my rational. So you have these losses that are contained in each other. And then, as I said, there is an example that sense by Camille McCover, which is Schutter, who says that M-rank and Q-rank are gaps in M. Okay? And what we wanted to do was to generalize this, because this is on the entire modular space. And what we wanted to do was to do this for arbitrary terms. To do this for arbitrary families of hyperchain and monopolies. And so basically, for arbitrary subdomains of the much less space of the period of time. So this could be very useful, you know, because what it means, if you have the dense, it means that each time you pick a family of microcalers, then there's a dense subset of things that have Lagrangian structures. And we can basically specialize any microcalor to a Lagrangian one, and then we can hopefully prove various interesting. Hopefully, it proved various interesting things about it. So, we're not there yet, but what we have proved so far is that if we look at the, oh, I have a mistake here. This guy here is this isotropic. This is isotropic. What we have proved this week is that I'm almost out of time. So is that the when when I look at the the isotropic locus, the isotropic locus is dense in any family of hypergeneral manifolds. Family of high-level kinetic manifolds. So, whether you're looking at the periodical net or you're looking at the Marshall space. And then, so, what we would like to do, as I said, is actually to prove it for the radial level of GM focus. And that's kind of what we have kind of approached on it. And I will stop here. Thank you for the lovely talk. Are there any questions? Are there any questions? No, let's thank the speakers again for you. And is Anna online there someplace? Oh, yeah. I should have.
