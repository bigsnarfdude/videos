In other words, I get it, I get it. In other words, let's say you have a circle, let's say you have a volcano on the plane and people are observing it. You have these volcano scientists observing the volcano and the volcano is observed from all sides. Kidneys observed from all sides, then you can actually get rid of all the scientists but four. And then maybe you will have to move them further away, but those four will suffice. So in other words, the talk is about firing scientists because there is no need for them. And yeah, so here are seven scientists around a volcano. Excuse me? Which two are mad scientists? Well, so this is this. So this is just which three. Yeah. Oh, you just beat AI in counting. So this image was generated this morning by some AI engine. And what is happening? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the thing. Okay, so Euclidean quantitative stein is. Euclidean quantitative Steinitz theorem. Now I want to tell you how large the ball is going to be that will be contained in the convex hull of those 2D selected points, provided that originally your set of points contains the unit ball. So Q is your set of points which contains, whose convex hull contains the unit ball. And now you want to select 2D points Q prime so that their convex hull contains Conduct hull contains still a ball of some positive radius. And the question is: Is there a radius depending on the dimension only independent of Q with which it holds? And Barra and Kochowski and Pach, they proved a result that says that, yeah, you can give such a bound on the radius. So the question is clear, right? question is clear, right? Okay, and they ask whether you can make this bound, whether you can improve this bound. So if you can, so they approve the bound of order d to the minus d. And can you have a polynomial bound? I guess there is a minus here. So it's c times d to the to the minus one half. I mean, they gave actually this particular bound as a conjecture. And so there were results on the plane which I Results on the plane, which I am not planning to talk about now, but with Grigory Ivanov, we proved the first polynomial bound. So, where you put a polynomial in here for this R of D. And also, we give a lower bound, which shows that the conjecture, if true, it's sharp. So you really cannot go beyond one over square root of d. Uh, one over square root of damo. That's the that's Marton Massodi. That's yeah, yeah, uh, and uh, I should have, yeah, yeah, yeah, um, yeah, so um, to actually give this this uh lower bound, uh, well, I'll show you a stronger result, slightly stronger result, which says that the Which says that the following. So, first, let me just read this result for you and then explain the connection. So, take unit vectors, and the result says that if you have only a few unit vectors, then their convex hull or absolute convex hull, so even if you are allowed to take plus and minus of them, is not going to contain a big bot. Okay, that's what the result says, right, here. Right here. So now, what's the connection to here? That means that take many, many vectors that are, let's say, just slightly larger than unit vectors, so that their convex hull contains the unit ball. Okay, so their convex hull is essentially the unit ball. You can actually take infinitely many, it doesn't matter. So then if you want to select 2d of them, well, then n is 2d, but it could be constant times d. constant times d the the the same thing will hold it says if you just select n equals constant times d of them you will not contain the ball of radius roughly one over root d okay so so that's that that shows that that indeed uh you cannot get get better than this in uh uh in order of magnitude okay um so so this this this is actually a dual version of a of an earlier Version of an earlier paper or an earlier result that we had with Grisha. Okay, so, and let me just advertise this problem. This is not my conjecture. I actually don't know whom I should attribute it to, which is just similar in flavors. So it's not, how to say, not directly related to the problem. But it says that if you have 2D unit vectors, 2D unit vectors, and you take their, well, they're dual, the dual of the polar of this set of 2D unit vectors. So in other words, what is it? It's, well, in general, it's a polytope with 2D facets, right? So you take this polytope with 2D facets, which is circumscribed about the unit ball, then it will contain a point of. A point of norm square root of d. So that's just a conjecture that interestingly has been open for quite a while. Okay, so let me prove our upper bound first. So now what's my goal? We have a convex polytope, Q, which contains the unit ball. And I want to select few vertices, 2D vertices, so that their convex. So that their convex hull contains this ball of radius one over 6d squared. That's the goal. That's what I want to prove. Okay. And now I'm going to use the result that Gerge, I guess, advertised on Monday, which is the following. So it's a result due to Amendra, Hernandez, Ambrush, and Kendall. And Kendall. So, given a convex polytope, which is in a position, in a particular position, so that if you take minus lambda times this polytope, then it will contain L. So for some lambda, for a certain lambda. Then you can pick 2D vertices so that what you get will so that you lose a factor. That you lose a factor D essentially in this containment above, right? That's the result. And now, in fact, you can actually always achieve lambda to be at most D by taking any of your favorite points of center for the convex body. You can take the center of mass or centroid, you can take the center of John's ellipsoid or the center of Leusner's ellipsoid or. Lewner's ellipsoid or the Santa Low point, whichever you like, you will be able to put lambda equals d here, right? So I'm going to use this result. And the idea will be simply to do duality, to apply duality twice, but the second time we apply it smartly to a translated image. So what am I going to do? So I introduce this notation whenever you take a This notation whenever you take a vector v, it may be a unit vector or not. Then, then I just define this half space determined by v this way, or I have this notation. And I will take the dual of the problem. So originally, I had points and their convex hull contained the ball around the origin. Now, instead, I take the polar of these points, and that's what I'm going to call k. And that's what I'm going to call k. And instead of the ball being contained in the convex talna by polarity, I have that this polar, q polar, is contained in the ball. And so notice that what is q polar? It's just an intersection of a number of half spaces. That's polarity simply. And now, what's my goal? So, in the dual language, my goal is. So, in the dual language, my goal is to select 2D of these half spaces up here so that their intersection is contained in a ball of radius rafi d squared. I just repeated the original question in the dual setting. And now the idea is that we, so here's the problem. The problem is: why can't we just apply directly without any duality? Directly without any duality business. Why can't we apply directly Gerger's result? The problem is that if you take the convex hull of Q, the origin may be poorly placed, right? So we cannot assume that in our setting, the origin is the centroid of the convex hull of Q or the central point or whatever. It could be somewhere close to the boundary of Q. Somewhere close to the boundary of Q, in which case you can't apply it. But so now that we went to the dual, we can take a point up there in the dual world, C, such that we have this containment. So take the centroid of K, for example. And then you have this containment with lambda equals D. And now you can apply Gaga. apply Gerge's cooperative result. And you get a number of you get 2D vectors whose conducts hull will contain this L. So don't forget this L is the polar of K. So it's not quite Q, but it lives in the same world as Q does. And then essentially you take polar again. Let me not go through the Let me not go through the points one by one. You have to check, you have to verify that when you take polar, everything works and things do. So I'm not going to bore you with the details here. Any questions so far? Bit of a hypocrisy to ask at this point now that I've just skipped most of the proof. Yeah. All right. So now how about the lower bound? So, now, how about the lower bounds? So, I promise you that I will prove that if you have a few unit vectors only, n unit vectors where n is not large enough, then their convex hull or absolute convex hull, so you have plus minus up there, their absolute convex hull is not going to contain a ball which is larger than radius square root over n, square root n over d. That's the promise. And essentially, here the And essentially here the heavy lifting is not done by us, it's done by Keith Ball and Prodromu, who showed the following. So let's say I have a tight frame. So I have, if you don't like or don't use this word, so I have set of vectors so that if you take VI tensor VI, then Vi, then you sum them up, you get the identity. Okay, so this Vi tensor Vi, it's just a dyadic product. So if you think of them as column vectors, so if Vi is a column vector, then it's Vi times Vi transpose. So it's a D by D matrix. And you sum up these D by D matrices, and you get the identity. Okay, so suppose you start from a set of vectors that have this property. If you're not Have this property. If you're not very familiar with it, the geometric idea behind a tight frame is that it is some sort of second order condition or property to say that the Vi's are nicely balanced. Okay, so you have some sort of nicely balanced set of vectors. And then you take a positive semi-definite operator T and And you consider a point, and then the statement says that then there is a point which is in the intersection of these strips, right? So these VI's, each VI defines you an origin-symmetric strip. And so you can take the intersection of these n origin symmetric strips. So you get this. So you get this polytope with 2n facets in general. So then there is such a point for whom this scalar product is a trace of T. Okay, that's their statement. And so let's use their theorem to show that result up there. So first of all, we may assume that. We may assume that. So, again, what do I want to prove? I have a set of unit vectors. So, now the UIs are unit vectors. And I want to show that their absolute convex hull won't contain a too large ball. In other words, I want to show that their absolute convex hull, that there's going to be a point and a point of not too large norm. Point of not too large norm which is not contained in the absolute convex hull, right? So, first of all, I can assume that the origin is in the interior of the absolute convex hull of these vectors, or in other words, that they actually span Rd, otherwise the whole problem is lower dimensional and it's easy. And I take the polar. So the polar is going to be this. Be this set, the polar of these points and their negatives. And then, so in the polar language, what do I have to show? So, in the original language, I have to show that the convex hull of the UI plus minus UI is not contained in the ball. In the polar language, I have to show that the polar does not contain a certain A certain ball. In other words, there is a point. Sorry, the polar is not contained in a certain ball. In other words, there is a point in the polar which is not in the ball, which is of large norm. Okay, so that's just the dual language. And now comes the idea how to translate our question to the ball promoter question. Well, we take this. Well, we take this matrix, the sum of these dyadic products, and now this matrix, well, it's obviously a positive semi-definite matrix, right? Because these are positive semi-definite matrices. You add them, you get a positive semi-definite matrix. But since our points are, but because of this condition that this plus minus uy, they contain the origin in the interior, you get that this is actually a positive definite matrix. It's invertible, okay, not just. matrix. It's invertible, okay, not just positive semi-definite. And then we do a substitution. So we replace each Vi or we set Vi to be this a to the minus one half ui. So we get this new set of vectors. And the Ball-Promadreux theorem says that there is a Theorem says that there is a point which is in the intersection of these strips, such that this scalar product is at least the trace of A inverse. And then what does it mean? So if I take Q to be, so now I want to bring back the problem to our world and not the ball from a world. So if I set Q to be this point. To be this point, the inverse image of P under this map that translates between the two worlds. Then I get what? So P is in intersectional strips. In other words, for every UI, I have this. I didn't do anything. I just wrote the definition of Vi there. And then you expand everything, and you get that Q is in. And you get that Q is in K. Now I just have to show that this point has a large norm, right? That's the only thing that remains. And well, let's compute the norm of this Q. Well, Q is by definition this point. And then, so its norm here, it's obviously at least the trace of A inverse. And then if you. Of A inverse, and then if you since the trace of A itself is N, why is that? Why is the trace of A N? Huh? Anybody knows that? Who can tell why the trace of A is N? Let me go back because I. Yeah, so this was the definition of A. Yeah, it's the sum of the traces, right? UIs are unit vectors, so each one, so each diad. One, so each dyad has a test trace one, you add them up, you get trace n, and then you just apply the Cauch-Schwartz inequality. So that's our lower bound. Any questions so far? Okay. But then if you think about it, volcanoes don't exist on the plane, they are on the sphere, so we need to give a sphere. We need to give a spherical quantitative Steinitz theorem. So I'm just going to phrase it. I'm not going to give you the proof step by step. So what we showed is the following. So you have a subset of the sphere, C, and the spherical convex hull contains a cap. So, oops, I should have put D here, not D minus one. So it contains. So it contains, so we are D-dimensional sphere, that means we are in R D plus one. So, and you take the North Pole, and there is some cap of spherical radius rho. And so your set, the spherical convex hull of your set, contains this cap of radius rho around the North Pole. Okay, that's what we start with. And then, well, we want to stain it's like theorem, so that means we're looking. It's like theorem, so that means we are looking for a subset of size 2D, so that its spherical convex HA contains, well, maybe not that large a cap, but a cap whose radius is at least gamma times rho for some positive gamma, right? That's our goal. And we can show that just simply having a Euclidean quantitative Steinitz theorem with some Rd, Some Rd, we can prove that this gamma of d up here is at least half of it. I'm not going to give you a proof. The idea is actually somewhat similar to the previous one. You do need to take polarity twice, once on the sphere and once on the north hyperplane, the hyperplane touching the ball around the north pole. So So I'll just skip through it and move over to the second topic of the talk, which is quantitative heliotype theorems and to what extent are they combinatorial? That's going to be the philosophical question. So first, let me start with the result of Pablo and Sarkar. And Sarkar, how do I pronounce it? Chu, Su Shwe, Shwe. Okay, thanks, thanks. So, Sarkar, Shwe, and Pabl and Soberon. So, so they proved the following. Maybe this is not how you phrased it, but it can be rephrased in this way. So, I'm looking for a quantitative, quantitative, colorful Halley theorem. So, colorful Halley says you have. The colorful Hali says you have a certain number of color classes, and if for any colorful selection your intersection is not empty, then for some color class, the intersection is not empty, right? Quantitative would mean that, let's say, the volume of these intersections has to be not too small. But now, instead of talking about volume, it's much better to talk about the largest volume ellipsoid contained in the intersection, because the largest volume and ellipsoid. The largest volume in ellipsoid essentially captures the volume of your body by John's theorem. We know that the largest volume ellipsoid in a body is at least one over d to the d, has volume at least one over d to the d times the volume of the body. So if you don't care about factors of one over d to the d, and when you deal with volume, you don't, you're kind of forced not to care about such minor factors, then you're happy to just see. You're happy to just see volume through ellipsoids. And so they say that, so quantitative means that instead of finding a point, now we want to find an ellipsoid. So if for any, so now the number of color classes is roughly D squared. So you have roughly D squared color classes. And if for any colorful selection, the intersection contains an ellipsoid of volume one, then for one of the color classes, the intersection. Color classes that the intersection contains the male soid of volume one. Now, how can you obtain a fractional, a quantitative fractional Halley result? Okay, so I'll tell you what a fractional Halley is, even though we've seen it in Susanna's talk. But so there is this result that was mentioned there, that if you have There, that if you have a colorful heli, no, it wasn't, or did you know you may not have that? The colorful heli implies, no, you didn't talk, you didn't mention colorful. Yeah, so so you could add to that beautiful diagram the following result by Holmeson, that if you have a colorful Halley theorem in an abstract setting, then a fractional Halley type theorem follows, right? Type theorem follows, right? It was, he presented this result. We all remember four years ago, it was in training, but yeah. So now you can just take that fact and apply it to this theorem, and you get a fractional helicopter result. What's the hypergraph that you have to use? Because, well, in order to speak about it in this abstract combinatorial language, you need to define. Combinatorial language: you need to define a hypergraph, so you take the index set and/or the set of set of actually, maybe it shouldn't be the index set, maybe it should be actually the convex sets themselves. So the base set will be the convex sets, and the hypergraph will be defined by you have a hyper edge if the intersection contains an ellipsoidal volume one, and then it all works. So you get a quantitative fractional. A quantitative fractional Halley theorem. But now, what if you want to decrease the number of color classes? So, what if instead of roughly d squared, you only have constant times d color classes? Remember, when you have a colorful Helly theorem, the fewer color classes you have, the stronger the theorem is, right? So, saying that I have a colorful Hallith theorem with these square color classes, it's a weaker thing than saying that I have a colorful Halley. Than saying that I have a colorful heli with 3D color classes. Okay, so what if you have fewer colors? Now, the problem is that it's not going to be true that in this case, you can get the same ellipsoid. So you cannot say that if I have, let's say, 3D color class, oops, it actually should be 3D plus one. It's no, no, no, no, sorry, it's 3D. So if I have 3D color classes, you can. Have 3D color classes. You cannot say it's not true that if for any colorful selection the intersection contains an ellipsoid of volume one, then one color class will contain, the intersection will contain an ellipsoid of volume one. It's just not true. It's not too difficult to show. But if you have, but if you require less and you say that I just want the intersection to contain an ellipsoid of some positive. Contain an ellipsoid of some positive volume depending on the dimension. So if you allow the volume to drop, then we have this result. Okay, so on the one hand, we have fewer color classes. On the other hand, we don't get an ellipsoid of volume one, only an ellipsoid of d to the minus d squared. Okay, so that's that's a, well, it's an old result. Four years ago, it was presented here. But then the question is, the question the question is okay how can you combine this result and holmzen's result which says that if i have a quantitative colorful helley then sorry if i have a colorful heli i have a fractional heli and the answer is no you cannot just apply this result because you don't have one hypergraph you have two hypergraphs so in the previous case you had a hypergraph which was that you put the convex sets are the vertices of your hypergraph The convex sets are the vertices of your hypergraph. So, so what I wrote here is it's not correct. So, the convex sets are the vertices, and a set of subset of these convex sets, a family of these convex sets, is an edge of the hypergraph if the intersection is of, let's call it, ellipsoid volume one, right? That was the game. And we were looking at this single hypergraph. But here, in this new story, you have two hypergraphs. One hypergraph. graphs. One hypergraph is you get an edge if the intersection is an it has ellipsoid volume at least one. And then there is a finer hypergraph, a hypergraph with more edges, which is when you have ellipsoid volume at least d to the minus d squared, right? It's two hypergraphs, and Honzen's result is about one hypergraph, so it won't work. And so, what we did? Yeah. How about this 3D? It is a what is a yeah, good good question, good question. No, there. So, if you look at this theorem, forget all this story about fractional healing and all that. Just look at this theorem. There are two open problems here. One is, why isn't this 3D 2D? It should be 2D, or at least there is no reason. 2D, or at least there is no reason for it to be 3D, or we don't see it, but nobody managed to beat it. Even 3D minus one, we don't have with any bound here. And the other question is, why is it d to the minus d squared? Why isn't it d to the constant d? So both are interesting. If you ask me, I would say it's much more interesting to press this 3D down to 2D. Yeah, exactly. It's a technical reason. But yeah. But yeah. So, but if you can, bless you, if you can have 2D here with a terrible volume bound, that would be very interesting, I believe. Okay, so now what we did was we tried and we didn't manage. So we just gave an independent proofs and that's joint work with Dr. Ila Jung, who was my master's student. Now he's doing his PhD at Budapest University in Budapest. At Budapest University in Budapest. So, we proved a quantitative fractional Halley theorem, how to say, directly, geometrically. We didn't use the colorful Halley, but managed to prove it. I'm not going to read it because I can see I'm running out of time. But you understand a quantitative fractional Halley theorem. It's exactly what you think a quantitative fractional Halley theorem should be. And actually, using similar ideas. And actually, using similar ideas, you can prove a quantitative PQ theorem as well. But then the question remains, could we get it from a Holson-Holmson type argument? And the idea is that, in fact, you can, but you have to somehow modify Holmsen's argument and also the language to be able to talk. To be able to talk about two hypergraphs, not just one. So, and to do that, I'm going to define not two hypergraphs but infinitely many because that's easier. So, I'm going to define you a hypergraph chain. This is, we chose this name for lack of a better one. So, what's a hypergraph chain? So, you take a base set V, it's the same base set, it's not going to change, and I will define simply it just says. Will define simply, it just says that you have one hypergraph, second, third, et cetera. And they are all, as they progress, they are refinements of the previous ones. So you have a rough hypergraph, then a finer one, an even finer one, and so on. Okay, so you keep refining. That's what it is, like the sequence of refinements of a hypergraph. And what would be the colorful alley number of a hypergraph? Of a hypergraph chain. So the colorful Helli number of a hypergraph chain is K if whenever you have K color classes, K finite subsets of the base set. And you take this tensor product, it's just a funny notation to say that all colorful selections. Okay, this is all colorful selection. And you take. Colorful selection, and you take any colorful selection and it's in the hypergraph at level L, then for one of the color classes, one of the color classes has to be in the hypergraph of level L plus one. Okay, so why is this funny definition? It's exactly because of the previous motivation. Imagine that I have hypergraph L is the set of those K2. Those k-tuples of or set of those tuples of convex sets whose intersection is at least volume one. And then the next hypergraph, L plus one, is those whose volume where the intersection is of volume at least d to the minus d squared. So it's a finer hypergraph, right? It has more edges. And this is what we can achieve in our colorful Halley theorem. So the colorful Helly theorem. Helly theorem. So the colorful Helly theorem I showed you says that if you take convex sets, then for the hypergraphs that you get here, it's going to have colorful Helly number 3D. That's how if you rephrase that theorem in this abstract language. And similarly, we define We define the fractional Halley number of a hypergraph chain. Okay, I'm not going to read it for you. It's really if you more or less understand the definition here. So again, the trick is that when you say that if such and such thing holds for a hypergraph, then something else is a member of the next hypergraph. Okay, not hypergraph L, but then the thing that you can select is a member of the next hypergraph. Is a member of the next hypergraph of hypergraph L plus one. Okay, that's that's the idea behind it, and you understand the motivation. Um, and uh, and and Attila showed the following that, in fact, using more or less home sense approach, but one needs is quite a bit of care there, you can show that if you have a hypergraph chain that has colorful held number k. Full held number k, then you can take, well, not quite the original hypergraph chain, but the hypergraph chain where you make bigger jumps. So, if I don't know, k is five, then you take the hypergraph chain where you start with number one and then six and then 36 and then whatever comes next. So, you take this other hypergraph chain, and then that one will have fractional head number k. So, in other words, Holmes and Holmesen's result does extend to multiple hypergraphs. And thus, you can actually get quantitative fractional Halley theorem from the quantitative colorful Halley theorem. And you even manage to replace this 3D plus one, which we had in the quantitative fractional Halley theorem with 3D. But actually, when you apply this Holmesen's algorithm, it's going to... Algorithm, it's going to, you get a terribly large loss in the volume. And so finally, in the remaining minus one minute and a half, let me just discuss one more question that came to my mind during Susanna's talk. So, okay, so what's the moral of the story? The moral of the story is that it's all combinatorics, right? You can do things combinatorially. Combinatorially. So maybe you can just do topologically. So forget this whole colorful and fractional business. Forget it. Just think about quantitative Halley. So is the quantitative Halley theorem true for, well, instead of convex sets, take open covers. Okay, that was defined. So is it true if you just say it's all about topology, right? After all? What's your guess? What's your guess? So, who guesses that it's true? There is a topological Q, Halle. Who guesses no? Yeah, so it's not true, but I'll leave it a secret why. And thank you. Maybe one quick question? Uh t you know, you're oh you're talking about Steinitz conducted theorem. How about karate ordering? Can you use some deep passion? So I couldn't quantify, I couldn't make so in a way Steinitz itself is the quantitative form of paratheodori. So I don't have a better idea how to Have a better idea how to. I mean, maybe, maybe you could say that quantitative karateodory would mean that the weights that you put at the vertices of your simplex are not all, none of them is too small. Maybe some. Maybe give some. So I so in any case, I don't even know how to phrase the question. With Q stein, it's obvious how to phrase. Okay, then it's thankful.
