So abelian is there because we will be talking about abelian varieties. And so just for the benefit of those of you who maybe don't handle complex abelian varieties in their day-to-day life, let me just recall very briefly a fact which goes way back, already known to Eman, the fact that any To Riemann, the fact that any complex opinion variety is biomoised into a complex toils toilets. And what does that mean? Well, that means that, for example, but not for example, so that means that if the dimensional If the dimension of A is G, then there exists a discrete subgroup of rank 2G of C to the G. So there exists, let's say, lambda, a subgroup of C to the G of rank two G such that uh A is isomorphic to C to the G multiplexer. To C to the G morph. And so, yeah, so this is a group homomorphism, that's also biomorphic. And so, yeah, so that gives us this compact structure of MA, which is very, very good to use for problems such as this one. And so, in particular, this implies that there exists a complex realm of Which I will call X sub A from C to the G, control A such that the kernel of this X A is the subgroup lambda. So if you've seen, for example, Lamma's cluster outside, then you already know the fairly standard example, which is the one in which, so we'll say example. So we'll say example if the dimension of A is one then A is an equal curve. So basically what's going on is that we have the complex numbers here and we get a subgroup of the complex numbers of rank two. So you know that means you take the points and then you sum them and you take the full address that Take the full atlas that is fine, etc. And then, when you take the quotient of this thing, what you get is going to be something that doesn't look like that because I can't draw very well. But hopefully, you've seen this before. You know, it's a complex torus, so we identify the sides of the identify the sides of this quadrilateral, then we get a torus, then yeah, and we play with that a bit. And if g is greater than one, it's similar. And if g is greater than one, it's similar. So you have to imagine what this would look like in higher dimension. But basically, I very often just think of some boxes. Okay, so this is, like I said, a very brief recall of something that most of you probably know very well. But so basically, the main important thing is that here we have an exponential map. And so we kind of want to play with it in the same way in which we have been playing for the complex exponential map. Have been playing for the complex exponential function for the last couple of days. And so, in particular, there is a conjecture, I will call it conjecture one, which I think appeared first in a paper of Michael Bates and Jonathan Kirby in 2018, but I guess which was sort of implicit in various things that appeared before that. Various things that appeared before that, uh, such as Zilberg's paper. And so, the the conjecture says that if you take one of these exponentials, so constant GA, B exponential of the variety A. And then, if you take the graph of this exponential function, so let's say Of these exponential functions, so let's say gamma squared, then the conjecture predicts that the structure plus minus times 0, 1 with this graph is positive. Okay, and so at this point, at the third day of the conference, you are probably aware of what quasi-minimum means. So every definable substitute of C, no definable set, is supposed to be countable or co-countable. As of course, if you think about this picture here, maybe you see already there's a countable set, which is the kernel of the exponential, which is thought to play kind of a similar role. Tangled a similar role as the kernel of the complex exponential does in the case of x. And then, as Jonathan was saying in his talk the other day, basically the idea is that once you accept the fact that the kernel exists and that you can't get rid of it, essentially the defined resets should still have some good geometric behaviour. Maybe this is not a very precise statement as of yet, it's more of a guiding philosophy, but yeah, that's uh But yeah, that's essentially what this quasi-minimality conjecture is sort of suggesting to us. But then, as again, this has also been mentioned before, to prove this quasi-minimality statement, the only way in which we are actually trying to do it is by proving these exponential algebraic closeness things. So now I'm going to define exponential algebraic closeness once again. I'm going to tell Once again, I'm going to try to stress the things that we change audiences stress yesterday so that it becomes a bit complementary to what he said. I hope nobody gets bored. But I'm also going to do it in a slightly different way than I usually do. So even if you know what's about to happen, please pay attention, because I will ask for your feedback later. Okay, so let's start with the definition. So let's say that X X is an algebraic subvariety called C to the G times A. Okay, so what can we say? We are going to say that x is horizontal if it has the form So, which one is horizontal? That is the question. I guess horizontal should be something in C to the G. So, let's call it X sub C to the G times A for some subvariety X C to the G, which lives completely inside C to the G and some A and A. Okay, so basically its projection to A is just one point, and then in the same way, we can say that it is vertical E to Z times X power A for some Z E C E G. In CPG and as a sub-variety or so maybe you're, I don't know, if you if you understood how this kind of EAC problems in which you want to find points, exponential points and algebraic varieties work, then you might already be seeing how this horizontal and vertical behavior might be an abstraction. Because if I only have one point or one of the sides of my variety, then I don't know my expectation. Variety, then I don't know, it doesn't have a lot of freedom, I'm not going to have probabilities for an exponential point there. So that's not the full story. So now that we've done this, let's say that we are going to denote for every avian subvariety B of A. B of A, so that's an algebraic subvariety that's also a subgroup. The projection which goes from C to the G times, that's C to the G times A onto both from C to the G times A onto C to the G minus the dimension of B times A r B by A rho B pi B. Okay, so B is an ambiguous subvariety of A, so B also has got this complex toilets that it is isomorphic to, so it also has this exponential, and we can actually see it as an exponential, which is the final subspace of C to the G, and so it makes sense to take this quotient on both sides. And so we can get this pi D map, and so This pipe B map, and so now I can actually give the interesting definitions in this little box that's left. So we will say that X is free if for every above variety V of A, pi B of X is not horizontal or vertical. Horizontal or vertical. Yeah, okay, so this is one half of the thing. The other half of the thing is that x is rotand. If again for every d is a d as a priority array, the dimension of pi d x Pi d x is at least given by the dimension of k over. Okay, so Vincento talked about urbanity a bit yesterday. You know, he said, for example, that you should think about it from the perspective, for example, that if you want to intersect x with the graph of the exponential, then how big is the graph of the exponential? It has the dimension of a. A. And so, in particular, since the ambient space has got twice the dimension of A, that X has got at least that same dimension of A, but then you also want that it's persistently likely, that the intersection is persistently likely, sorry, and so that whenever you take this portion, the dimension stays sufficiently good. But then you also want this freemus thing, because, like I said, if the variety is horizontal or vertical, or even if it is just horizontal or vertical. Or even if it is just, for example, a vertical in a quotient, you know, then you don't have a lot of, depending on what XL your CG, as I call them, here looks like, you don't have that much hope of finding an exponential point because it's difficult of the exponential on any single point there. For example, in this case, it's pretty pretty third. You don't have a lot of, for example, And so, once we have all of this, once we have these two definitions, we can state the conjecture two, which is a B an exponential algebraic process at this point. And so, conjecture two tells us that if you take a median variety A by the height, whenever By the height. Whenever I say a vision variety, I guess I mean complex original. So A is a complex combined variety. X is as great, you can see to the G plus A and it is clear at hand. Then it has an exponential point. So then there exists a point of the form z x a z inside x. Okay, and I'm lying a little bit maybe this is not exactly what the conjecture says. The conjecture is concerned maybe with other easy dense set of solutions rather than a single one. Rather than a single one. But I don't want to complicate things, and so I'm going to pretend that's not the case. And also, if you can solve this, then you should also be able to find some very, very standard methods, I think. So let's just say that we want one solution for now, and then when I want to talk about waste denicity, I will make some comments about it. And so, as has been said a couple of times, As has been uh said a couple of times already, there is this uh link between conjecture one and conjecture two, which maybe has not been it has been made explicit by Jonathan in the case of the complex exponential, but so it also works here. So the term, once again, of Bayesian curve is that indeed if you take your complex of the numbers. If you take your complex opinion by idea, and I guess technically I should say it's simple. So simple means that it doesn't have any proper non-tilt in the sub-variety, but I'm going to come back to that. So if A is a simple and complex optimal variety and the conjecture Conjecture 2 holds for every power of A, so for A to the N, for every A and N, then conjecture one holds for so maybe this is a bit of an overly complicated way of of saying this, but Of saying this, but yeah, indeed, that's what we want to do. So, basically, we want to make sure that we can solve any system of equations involving the exponential map of A. And so, you know, we also need to work in the Cartesian powers of A at that point, otherwise we are not going to be able to consider all the possible systems of equations. But then, once we've done that, we get positive magnets. But, of course, you know, the way I think The way I think we should go about it is we should prove that the conjecture holds for every product for every product, for every power of its simple product. And then there's this method that I require need to be simple because Marty and Johnson worked with a simple addition variety for simplicity, I guess. But I don't think that's a very, very important description. I mean, I think that if you take their paper and you open up the paper. You need to change some things, but this should still be. But I guess technically the way the result that's in the literature now as precise as I can make it should be this one. Right, so yes, so a couple of things that we already know about this. So, a couple of things that we don't already know about this. One is a the Here of the Hagen, Jonathan, and Munchenzo. So this is 22, I guess. And it says that the conjecture is 2, so we'll say conjecture 2 is 2 when X satisfies Satisfies that the projection of X on C to the G is dominant. So if you get almost everything once you project to the first block of coordinates, then you're fine. And the other thing that I wanted to mention, so this was my So it's my is out in 23, and it's that conjecture true. It's also true when you write x as L minus W, where L is a linear subspace, and win W. Okay, so in this specific Okay, so in this specific case, you get the split term variety, and so the word split starts to appear here, although that's not the split that I'm referring to. But you know, in this case, it splits as this product with this specific geometric form. For example, now n is a subspace, which means that the exponential of n is a subgroup of A, even though it's not an algebraic subgroup, and so you can do something. It simplifies your life point a bit. Life, your life quite a bit. But then the update on this that I really want to talk about today is that indeed that doesn't need to be there. So I guess now I can just remove this because it's, let's say, working progress. But then here I can just put some V, which is not necessarily here, but just Okay, and that's why I say split, you know, because here X splits, and then in every split case we can solve something, or at least I can do it. Hopefully, in a few months, you can read the paper and you can read it. Right, so are there any questions so far? Cool. This is unreachable. This is unreachable. Sorry, I know my handwriting is right, but if you if you see your own program for improvement, you must use that. Right, so now I want to say a bit about how to prove this theorem. So, yeah, okay, I erased the previous version, but so in the previous version, we had here a linear space, like I said, and now we have an algebraic subvariety. And if you think about And if you think about it for a bit, maybe you can start imagining that if you have an algebraic sub-variety of your complex attitude group here and you go towards infinity, you take very, very deep points of your variety and you look around yourself, then you might expect to be seeing something that is almost linear around you. And so, the picture that I always tell to try to explain this, and I'll come back to this picture later on, is that if you let's just say that. If you let's just say that we are in i squared, let's just make it simpler. And let's look at the parabola that we learned about in high school: the y equals x squared. Then, you know, if you take a point whose coordinates are very big, if you look around yourself, you're not going to be able to tell if you are on that parabola or if you are actually sitting on a vertical line. Because the parabola looks a lot like a vertical line at infinity, even though we. Vertical line at infinity, even though it doesn't really have an asymptote. And so, how can we try to make this formal? How can we try to make this precise? Well, we don't have to, because Brettz and Astachenko did it for us. So, I'm going to recall some stuff that they did and then try to show you how it relates to this problem. So, let's say that we take We take, so let's put it this way. Let's say that we take a big elementary extension of the real numbers, just as a vector field, let's say. So let's say that this Fermi I is a kappa separated kappa self-genius where you have this field per sound. Sufficiently large kappa. Okay, what can we do then? That we can take it algebraic closure. So let's say that we take a finding C to be with I plus Ii and so yeah. And so, yeah, so now we have this big algebraic quantity close field, and because we built it this way, going through a real close field, we can actually think about an absolute value on it, and then we can put the evaluation on it. And so we see this as an alternative flows on the with the open yellow. Okay, and so just in terms of notation, I'm going to write O for the evaluation range of finite elements and the mu for the maximum elements. Of few feet okay, so we got this DB CDF. What do we do with it? So, I don't think I'm forgetting anything here. Okay, so let's say that then we take definition. So, let's say that we take a point alpha, which lives in C to the G. So, it's a big, big, well, it's not necessarily, it's a point in this big, big algebraically closed valued field, and then. Valued field, and then we define so the asymptotic flat of alpha, which I will write as right of alpha. So it is the smallest at time space over the complex. Affine space of other complex numbers, so C, affine space L such that, what happens, such that alpha lies in, let's say, L of C plus B. So I'm going to come to examples in a second, but hopefully you can already work out what this definition means. You got your Your affine space that's the fine number complex numbers, and alpha needs to sit inside that space up to a small infinitesimal wiggle that you are about to manage. So, this is the smallest something. Now, I'm also going to have to use the biggest something. So, let's say that P is a type in the language of value fields over the complex numbers, so that P. Numbers so that P L vowel answer. That's clear what I mean over the complex numbers and so I would say that the new stabilizer H of P is the largest Let's say C linear, so yes, C linear such that if you take the realization of the type P in your big field and you will go by infinitesimals, or if you take P of C to the G and you add, let's say, the H of O, so the bounded element. Bounded elements of all, and once again wiggled by an infinitesimal, you get the same thing. So, sorry, this is supposed to be fancy. Right, and then I'm also going to say that the new stabilizer of a point is just the new stabilizer of its time. So star new alpha is going to be Is going to be the new stagnator of the type in the language of valid fields of alpha over C. Yes. Why do you write that in Palau C? L is just hidden? Well, I'm seeing it as a the final set. Yeah, yeah, I guess if you see I guess if you see, because L is defined over the complex numbers, but it is a subspace of funny C to the G. So I'm talking about the funny C points of L. I'm choosing kernels to some of the light. That is what I define of the products. What's it? Go ahead. So can I give an example and then maybe I will get to explain. Maybe I will get to explain this. So let's give an example and let's think about this parabola bit share once again. And that makes things a bit clearer. So, what happens if we look at points on the parabola, we try to compute, which we are now thinking of as a complex parabola, and we try to compute the And we try to compute this asymptotic flat so in new stabilizers of them. So let's say that you take the point alpha, alpha squared in C squared. Okay, well then there's two things that can happen essentially. So either alpha is in the bone, so either alpha is bounded and then alpha squared is also going to be bounded, or that's not the case. That's not the case. And so, if alpha is in O, then this is all fairly simple because then there is a very obvious candidate for the asymptotic flat, which is just the standard part of alpha. So, then the asymptotic flat of alpha is just the standard part of alpha, because then, by the way this thing works, it's definitely good that alpha lies inside the its standard part plus anything that's not happening special. And then what's the new stabilizer? Sorry, just that would be standard part of alpha, standard part of alpha score. Okay, and yeah, and then on the other end if you drive the new stabilizer, so it's functional of alpha alpha square. Well, now we're not interested in affine thing, now we're really looking for a linear thing, so really the only thing we can get is because what does the alpha equal alpha alpha square over the complex number say? Over the complex number, say it says I am at infinitesimal distance from the standard part, and then you know, and then if I try to move by anything, I'm going to break that eigen. So this condition doesn't give me anything. So maybe this finite case is not very interesting. So let's look at what happens when alpha is not. Um you know but if alpha is not in all, then who's the is important flat? Isn't that flat of alpha alpha squared? So basically, I would have to. So well, I guess it can have dimension 2, a 1, a 0. So it would have dimension less than 2 if you could find complex numbers lambda 1, lambda 2, and lambda 3 such that lambda 1 alpha plus lambda 2 alpha squared, let's say. Square, let's say, is in lambda 3 plus mu. That would give you that alpha alpha square is almost contained in an affine subspace that is the fined of the complex numbers. But this doesn't happen because these are supposed to be complex numbers, and these two things have got different medium module, and so it's impossible to find such a thing. And therefore, And therefore, the asymptotic flat of alpha alpha squared is just going to be c squared. But what did I say before? What I said before is even if the parabola doesn't have an Asian code, it is true that it looks more and more like a vertical line as we approach infinity. And so, indeed, if you think about it for a second, if you try to compute what the new What the new stabilizer of alpha alpha square is. Well, then maybe you can consider the fact that if you look at the point this point, alpha plus one over two alpha, and its square is going to be alpha squared plus alpha squared plus one over alpha squared plus one. You know, this is This is infinitesimally close to, so this is in, let's say, alpha alpha squared plus one plus. So, you know, this point is still on the parabola. This point is not on the parabola, but it is infinitesimally close to one point on the parabola. So maybe I'm more interested in the other equation. I want to say that this is in that class. And so, hopefully, this, if you combine what I just heard on the board with this image that the fire upload looks like a vertical line at infinity, that might be enough to convince you that the mu stabilizer of alpha alpha squared is the subset base of c squared. That's defined by x2 equals. And so, in this case, we're not looking at enough anything, we're looking at the linear thing. So, that's So that's more or less how it works. And so at this point you might start to wonder why I am talking about this, what does it have to do with all this pallium varieties business that I was talking about before. And so let me say two things that I need to present Saturday. So one is still So, one is still not connected to Big J varieties. I guess it's just a general fact that you might have guessed, which is that for every alpha in C to the G, you get that the asymptotic flag using variant weight translation under the new stabilizer. Okay, so this will come back to the interval. But the actually important thing that I wanted to say is the following. So I'll say it here because it might take a couple of times. So it is that if you take V, let's say an algebraic subvariety of finish e to the g that is defined. That is defined over the complex numbers. And let's say that you take alpha upon V, then, okay, and let's also say that A is a complex ability variety then Then so let's say if L is the asymptotic form of alpha what happens is that the exponential of L is going to be contained in the closure of x k of the x. That makes sense. So we've got this a fine subspace of the complex numbers at this point, so maybe it should be 250% and say that I'm still just looking at the complex points of that space. And I take the exponential of it, and it is going to be contained in the closure of the exponential. Contain the closure of the exponential of the variety. So, this is why this asymptotic flat business is relevant when we want to work with the exponential of the variety, because it gives us kind of a powerful approximation to where the exponentials of the points in V are going to, as the points in V themselves are counting to. Okay, and so yes, I have no less okay. And so I guess that what I want to say now, a further thing, if you want, like this way, so now maybe we can also go back to what to the fact that we're still working on exponential algebraic closeness in your doing all this. And so I can tell you that. Tell you that if V times W is an algebraic subvariety of C to the G times A that is Rotan then there exists some point alpha in V of In V of quanticies, so V is seen as a definable set. We look for a point in the big algebraically closed field, and then we can find some alpha such that if you do a symbolic flat of alpha times W, you still get something of alpha. Okay, so what it is is you can You can preserve rotamity when you go to an asymplotted flat, and that's kind of a powerful thing, because then we can sort of not directly, because maybe we lose freedom, so we have to be a bit careful, but you know, model of that, this thing essentially means that if you take my previous result that I wrote before, in which we were looking at things of the form n like Slavli, then we can use them to approximate things of the form V in a meaningful way. A meaningful way for the problem of finding points of the foreign d time style. Sorry, exponential points in varieties of the foreign d time style here. So now that I've said this, I wanted to, in the last 10 minutes, I wanted to kind of give a very, very rough sketch of how we use these things in the program or other things come into play, and then hopefully I. And then, hopefully, I will still have time to say a couple of things about positivality. So, let's say sketch of proof of theorem. So, there are two cases, essentially, because I said. Because I said here that you can save rotability when you go to the asymptotic flat, but I didn't say what happens when you look at the new stabilizers. So it is very well possible that even if your variety is rotund, for every new stabilizer H of V that you look at, you get that H times W is not rotund. And so that's the distinction that you need to make. So case one is that there exists some other. Is that there exists some alpha in V C with H equals type alpha such that H times type of this properties. Okay, and this is sort of the easy case. And again, you have to be a bit careful if H times W is not free, which Times W is not free, which may happen, but it's not a big problem. You can get around that using your freeness of V times W. That's okay. But so in this case, then you, again, you are using freeness potentially, so you're not really applying metric result word by word, but it's something like that. And so then you find a point. Let's say z x z in h times w and then you do a topological argument. So then use Gravitz point theorem essentially point to something of the formula z prime x a z prime in the tense value. So again, let me stress. Here the big thing comes from the fact that you get a new stabilizer age such that each time style is your plan and that you use you a lot. But like I said, that also may not happen. And so the alternative is, I guess, that for every A in V C, you know, with H equal to star minus alpha, you get that H times tau minimum is not alpha. Okay, yeah, so you bend your head against the wall for a bit and you think how to do this. Then you think how to do this, and then you realize that you can use a struggle, which gives you, among other things, it gives you an almond sub-variety B of A such that when you look at the projection, so let P B sorry. You are back into case one. Okay, so if you are in case one, then that means that you succeed in finding an exponential point in the quotient. And so, what's an exponential point in the quotient? Well, that means that then you can find vw times w. W such that w minus xA of v is b, is in your media subvariant b and then this Freudus groups. You have two more cases, so you have case to a and in case to a you write a situation in which w plus b is not w and then. And then I won't get into the details, but essentially you use gravity again. And the argument is more complicated, but then the advantage is that you get a risky density over much pain. But in the end, I didn't really have time to say a lot about the risky density. But yeah, let's not get into that. And then in case to B, what happens in case to B is just that here w plus b is equal to w. And so if you look at this thing here, you knew that you had w minus xab equal to b d and so what does that mean? And so what does that mean? That means that x A V is equal to W minus V, which is the W. And so you would think you're done. And indeed, you are done if you only care about finding solutions, but then this doesn't tell you anything about the ski density, and that complicates things. And so here, then for Jerry Sky density in case to D. In case of 2B, you use the other 2, which maybe comes as a surprise, but I think it came as a surprise to me. It's not my idea. It's a strategy that Jadu Myamini suggested to some of us over the summer. So strategy, let's say, suggested by Yadu Myamini. And so the intuition that Gaunt had is that indeed, as Michel was saying yesterday, if you decrease the dimension, so if all your solutions are contained in a place to close set, then there's something wrong because you are essentially in an unlikely intersection situation. Then you can get out of it, as you often do from unlikely intersection situations, with a point counting argument which shows you that you cannot have too many points inside of the basic Inside the Valesky closed set. Okay, and so before I conclude, let me just say, because I started, I guess, we've been saying that all these DAC problems are sort of motivated by poisonality. And so do you get quasi-ninimal structures using this result? That's the question. So at the moment, there is no result in the literature that I am aware of which allows you to see. Which allows you to say that from the theorem that I talked about, you get quasi-minimality, but also there are some material candidates that could be looked at. So one is what if you look at this structure, so is an elliptic curve then is the two circuits. The two-circuit structure C exponential V complex points in Plaza And at this point I'm fairly certain the answer is yes in the sense that you know you should be able to play this base curvy strategy again and apply it to this kind of structures and that should give you And that should give you positive normality because then the corresponding exponential algebraic closeness result is the one that I'm just talking about. But then if you want to put here an abelian variety of larger dimension, you run into double, because then you automatically would have definable subsets of A, C of higher dimension, which are therefore not countable or not countable. But then you can maybe pull back. You can maybe pull back all the structure to C, and you can do it using theta functions. So I don't really have time to say what a theta function is. So let's just do a working definition. So let's say that let's recall that for every hyper surface W in an ambient variety A There exists a function, let's say W from C to the dimensional A into C, such that for every Z in C to the G, theta w of Z is zero, even only if X A of zero. X A of Z is in value. And so these theta functions are important in number theory for various reasons, not all of you might aware of, but, you know, and they are entire function, is what I should say. They are entire function, and you know, there is this kind of guiding philosophy that whenever you put some entire functions on the complex numbers, you should get a positive structure. And so the question at this point is. And so the question at this point is is the structure C plus minus times zero one blah blah blah together with the set of all theta functions So theta is a theta function uh was in And again, so let's say that for question one, I am like 90% sure that at this point, you know, it should be doable. Question two, I'm not as sure, the details are a bit as clear to me at the moment, but I also think it should be doable. And I feel like there are nice results. There are nice results about the findability of restricted theta functions in non-minimal structures. So it would be nice to get the findability of full theta functions in quasi-minimal structures, and it would be a natural thing to look at, I think, and some further evidence towards the quasi-mimic conjectures. Okay, I can kind of We have some questions. So your method explicit in any way? Do you have a description of the distribution? No. No, I would say the answer is no. That's a good question. So I guess the problem is that also for the older zone, the one for the linear space, the answer. The one for the linear space, the uncertainty and so first one would have to sort that out, and then maybe, yeah, maybe assuming that, maybe you could get something of the form the solutions are why we should be using this asymptotic flag to use. But yeah, at the moment the answer is not, let's say, something general service, yeah. So do you know something about your points are not Zoisky dense? So if your points are not Zoisky dense, then you take you take the Tsariski closure. Let's say, so, okay, I have been a bit impercive about this. I guess the one case that you have to get rid of is the one in which the Arcta Risky dance is in something of the form V times W prime. V times W prime, where W prime is appropriate subset of W prime. And so if they idoise density in something like this, then what you do is you take the perimage of W prime under the exponential function, you restrict the fundamental domain. And so let's call that log K W prime mingler set with some function. Bright mingler set with some fundamental domain F. And then you take this set minus V and you intersect it with the lattice. So you intersect it with the lattice and so you know you see the lattice of course as Z to the 2G so that you have a meaningful notion of height. And so this is the kind of so then you have to play a bit with it, but then you see that. Play a bit with it, but then you see that you, I mean, that it's impossible that there are enough points of the correct height in this set, that the ones that you get if you remove. Alright, so other questions? No. When you use the bar to explain term, is that the version due to Yes, yes, but I mentioned the past. Yes, yes, yes. Because indeed, yes, that's part of our person. Other questions? I think I had two questions. The first is just coming back to your old theorem with the linear space. How does that relate to axes work on analytic subgroups of varieties? Can I draw this? So Axe had a very similar result to it, which is remarkable given that it worked 20 years before UAC happened. But so he proved, essentially what he proved was that del times W has exponential points when A is simple. And so I have not read his proof in detail, I must admit. I must admit, but you know, let's say with my methods, the methods that the last 50 years, it's fairly simple, it's fairly easy to prove this case. So, you know, I guess this is more general. And the second question has to do with this general method of using flats. Have you thought about how well that would work if you tried to apply it directly to a sub-right? Directly to a sub-variety of a non-split sub-variety. Security but like a compact part on one side. Yeah, yeah, not in super detail, but I do think that if you take X variety of C to the G by say, then indeed you have this compact type here and this non-compact type here. And so this should exactly be approximated again by something of the form L times. The forms are used somehow. But yeah, that was actually part of the things that Galvin Junior suggested to us in the summer, even though he has a method that's based more on complex analysis than on monetary learning, so I understand it better this way, let's say. But yeah, no, I I think you think this could be useful for but I haven't really touched it yet. All right then, so uh let's thank Francesco again. And so let's thank Francesco again. And that's
