So today I'm going to talk about moduli spaces of cubic hypersurfaces and this is all joint work with Stan Gruszevsky, Klaus Sulek, and Robin Lasa. And I should apologize in advance that some of this may be familiar and in some ways it answered to a question by Dan from a little while back about a different talk that I gave about k-equivalence of two spaces. All right, so let's see. I had some talks motivated, some slides motivating cubic, the study of the moduli cubic hyperservices, but I feel like for the purpose of this talk, maybe as a moduli conference, I didn't need as much motivation, but let me just sort of say in words that cubic hypersurfaces are quite interesting for a number of reasons, including rationality questions and so on, and they're a good testing ground for various types of. Testing ground for various types of questions. And so that's something my motivation for studying cubic hypersurfaces. Today I'm going to focus on the moduli space. So I'm going to look at moduli of cubic hypersurfaces. And cubic surfaces is quickly going to be the topic of focus in a moment. Okay, so just to review, I think we've sort of maybe even seen some of this before, but we have a natural parameter space for cubic hypersurfaces with their embedding, and we can take the quotient. And we can take the quotient by the automorphisms of SLN times SLN plus 1c to do GIT. And we obtain the GIT quotient taking a quotient. And that's going to be our moduli space that we start with. The locus that parametrizes smooth hypersurfaces is a zero-scalable subset, and it's smooth up to finite quotient singularities. Okay. There are some, this is, what I'm about to say is. There are some, this is what I'm about to say is actually sort of even interesting to think about for cubic curves, I think, since there's some stuff that's happening in the background. So if you're interested in having that example as you're going, I think it's worth thinking about. And for instance, even when I say up to isomorphism, there's some technical issues here. And there's some, you know, because there's a difference between the cubic curve embedded in D2 and M11, but it's not a big difference. And so anyways, you can think about that in the background if you've seen the slides. Okay, so just as a reminder, this is a normal projective variety, and we can quickly compute the dimensions. Since I think in other talks, the side of the computation has been done. Let me just list what's important, which is that we're going to be looking at the quantity of cubic surfaces, which is four-dimensional. That's sort of the only thing that's important, I think, from this slide for the rest of the talk. Can I ask a remedial question? Oh, yeah, because maybe someone else has them. Else has to make it. Is it true that all abstract automorphisms of a cubic surface come from the emissions of the embedding? The canonical, the Picard rank is one. But it's not true for elliptic, for D-S1 curves, which is sort of where the problem starts to show up. But yes. And you can also ask what about deformations. Is this all the deformations? And so for a smooth cubic type of sort of as an abstract deformation. Right, and then once things get very singular, then there could be other components. And so I'm sort of ignoring that line of thinking. But I think it's an interesting question because there are sort of a bunch of moduli spaces. They all have sometimes multiple stack structures on them, and you can sort of ask what is the relationship among all of them. I'm not going to talk about that at all, but it's a fun thing to think about that everybody. Okay, so just to be clear, this moduli space is not interesting. This moduli space is not interesting in some sense because they're all unirational. So the Kadarinich is not a topic that I'm going to be focusing on for this moduli space. Okay, so let me start sort of the beginning of the talk. All right, so let's compare this moduli space to the most beautiful moduli space of all time. So I think Jesse Cass, a long time ago, asked me, you know, is empty bar just like Is empty bar just like the most beautiful thing ever, or is it only because Mumford showed us that it's so beautiful? And so that's the motivation here. Okay, so empty bar is the most beautiful market space of all time. Let's compare the two. Okay, some good comparisons. They're both smooth stacks. One is a smooth William Mumford stack, one is a smooth Arden stack. Great, okay, with projective moduli space. Okay, that's great. When I say course, yeah, I mean, yeah, good. Course, yeah, I mean, yeah, a good modulation is a better word. I just mean the closest scheme to this stack is a projective run. If that helps to answer the question. And we'll get into more details about the polystable locus and why it's not exactly a moduli, of course, moduli space in the usual sense, but I'm just being used. Thanks. Okay, MGIT, sorry, the MG bar has finite quotient singularities. MGIT in general is going to have. MGIT in general is going to have bad singularities. We'll see that that actually accidentally doesn't have bad singularities for cubic curves or cubic surfaces. But we'll come to that. And generally, you want to think of it as having bad singularities. Is that KLT or not? What's up? KLT? Yes, I'll come to that also. What's that? KLT. And yes, they are KLT. But I'll explain I'll have a slide about that later. Because they're they're it's a sort of a general phenomenon, but I'll explain. Of a general phenomenon. Well, that's why. Sorry, this button is not always working. Okay. All right, so now from the perspective of period maps, MGBAR has a normal crossing boundary, so period maps just extend well, and there's a whole story behind that. But the natural period map that we'll talk about here for cubic surfaces and some other cubic hypersurfaces does not extend over the boundary. Services do not extend over the boundary. Okay, so you might want to improve this moduli space so that period maps extend. That's a natural thing to want to do. And then finally, this is sort of more speculative, but you can look at, if you are familiar with this Hasse-Keel program for modular queries, you can kind of look at various spaces that show up in that program. It's not going to be interesting for MGIT. There are different birational models, but if you try to, the Picard rank of MGIT is one, so it's not interesting. GIT is one, and so it's not interesting. So maybe we want a bigger space that we could work on that has all of the things on the left going for it. Is that everybody sort of clear on what my goal is? Motivation? Okay. All right, so at least for low dimension, maybe we can find a model of MGIT that behaves more like MGBAR. That's kind of the underlying goal of my talk. Okay, so my focus is on low dimension. For dimension at most four, For dimension at most four, there is a picture that sort of shows up in all of the cases. So, for instance, you can even think about this for the case of cubic curves. In that already, everything here will be an isomorphism, but at the level of stacks, they'll be different. Okay, so I'm not going to be talking about stacks, but just as somebody to kind of think about in the background. Okay, so what are these phases? Here's the space that we're interested in, to start with. Then there is some period map, and there'll be some arithmetic quotient that we can map to, and you can take the Satake, Bailey, Borrell, come back to be. And you can take the Satake-Bailey-Burrell compactification of that arithmetic quotient. It's another compactification of our moduli space. Then, somehow up here is we have a GIT quotient which may not be smooth. Even if the GIT quotient is smooth, there may be points that have large-dimensional stabilizer, and you can still do Kirwan's process of blowing up. This is the Kiran blow-up. So, if you think about cubic curves, you can think about what's going on here. If you take cubic curves, what are the guys here? What are the guys here that have positive dimensional stabilizer? Well, the polystable locus is three lines. It's not the nodal curve, it's three lines beating. And of course, there's a large stabilizer, and so this process is a blow-up of, you know, the GIT quotients are the same, but the process of construction is slightly different. Are you using governance blow-up as it's stated? It's usual smooth blowout? Yes. Yes. Yeah, yeah, your usual log. Yes. And I'll go through the construction in a second. I'll go through the construction in a second as well. But Q1 has a process of desingularizing up to finite quotient singularities a GIT quotient of something smooth. And that's this. And you can do that for any, in any dimension. Okay, and then over here is the toroidal compactification. So if you have this arithmetic equation, you can take the Sataki-Bailey-Borrel, or you can take a Troyal compactification. Potentially, there could be lots of choices, and that might be an interesting thing. But we'll see for cubic surfaces that there's only one choice. That's there's only one choice, so we'll come to that also. Okay, so again, MK is the Q-1 blow-up. This can be done in any dimension, and this D mod gamma tau is atroyal compactification of some arithmetic quotient model. And if you want to think about this for the case of curves, this is the plane curves. This is some kind of new GIT problem related to that, where you have to blow up the locus of. Where you have to blow up the locus of, throw out everything that's unstable, blow up the locus of the three lines, and then take the GIT quotient, but you'll get the same P1 moduli space, but it's a different construction. This is just upper half-plane modulo SL2Z. And then this is just the same. These are equal. So in the case of cubic curves, these are all things you could try to do. You always get the same modulo space. I'm hoping that that's a familiar. A familiar point of view, but if not, it's okay. For the cubic surfaces, I'm going to go through each thing a little bit more carefully. Okay, so the goals for today: talk about cubic surfaces. I want to describe the geometry of each of the spaces. I want to explain why, possibly despite appearances, the Kirwan blow-up is not isomorphic to the Truro compactification. As we go along, you'll see that they might start to look very similar, and you could wonder, are they the same or are they not? And it turns out, well, we'll see what happens. Turns out, or we'll see what happens. Okay, and then I want to sort of talk about which of these two might be a good replacement in the sort of that slide I've been talking about comparing to the delimo for conductivation. Okay, that's my goal. Okay, so this is the diagram. I'm going to keep coming back to this diagram, but just so we keep seeing it, remember, we're going to start in the bottom left corner here and then work our way around the diagram. Did you tell us what the M hat on this for? I didn't. This is. I didn't. This is, for the purposes of this talk, I'm just going to ignore MPAT. Just it shows up in higher dimension, and it isn't really interesting there, but I think I'm just going to ignore it for that for that. Okay. So let's, and so just I'm starting at the bottom left, and I don't think this audience needs much reminder, but just we'll need to remember what AK singularities are. So this is the example of an AK singularity. And what's particular for surfaces that we Particular for surfaces that we do need to know, but which you can forget shortly after this slide, is what it means for an A2 cubic surface to contain the axis of the A2 singularity. So let me explain what happens. If you have an A2 surface singularity that looks like this, locally analytically, the tangent cone splits into two planes. And then we're in, so if you think about this, in P3, the tangent cone is two planes, and there's going to have an intersection of two planes in P3. Of two planes in P3, that line is important for the stability condition, as we'll see. So that's really a technical point. You can pretty much just ignore that. I'm just mentioning it. So on the next slide, we know what the words are saying. Okay, so let's describe the points parameterized by M GIT. Okay, so a cubic surface is stable if and only if it has a worst A1 singularities. So that's sort of the good low. So that's sort of the good locus. You are semi-stable if and only if you are stable or have at worst A2 singularities, and you don't contain the axis of the A2 singularities, which is that technical condition on the last page, which you can just forget, but that's what it means. And I should say that, you know, a really nice presentation of this classical result from Tai's book. Okay, and then the GIT boundary, the points of a GIT modulus, you know, GIT quotient. A GIT quotient, you can think of this as parameterizing polystable points, so points with closed orbit. Okay, so which are the ones with closed orbit? So the boundary just consists of a single point, and that point corresponds to this 3A2 cubic surface. You can immediately see that it's A2 just by getting rid of one variable. And you can also see, if you get rid of this, that you have the 3A1 cubic curve. So there's sort of this hierarchy. Cubic curves. So there's sort of this hierarchy that shows up in cubic hypersurface GIT. This is just that standard cubic, so to speak. This is a cubic surface with three A2 singularities at the coordinate, you know, point sort of 100 and so on. And that is what is parameterized by the boundary. Okay. Great. What's the step we'll ask here of this one? We'll come to that. The connecting component is C star squared. We'll need that. You'll need that. And you will you would need the full stabilizer in order to do some more of the stuff I'm talking about, but I'm going to kind of put that in the background. Okay, so what are some other descriptions of this moduli space? Well, it's a class that goes back to the 19th century, that there are invariant polynomials that describe this quotient. And so you can, so there are invariants of these degrees that Degrees that identify the GIT quotient with weighted projective space. Yes, Dan. So when you say classical, you mean really before GIT was ever. Oh yeah, I think this was like the limit of what people could do, because I understand, and this was sort of why Mumford was motivated to do that. But yeah, you can do this classical. You look in. It's sort of fun. I'll maybe have a side statement later about what exactly is in Kaylee's papers that I can find. That I can find. But this identifies our moduli space of cubic surfaces with this weighted projective space, which accidentally just has finite quotient singleton. So I view that as an accident. In higher dimensions, you're not going to have just finite quotient singleers, but it does happen in this case. Okay, and then of great importance generally, and also for this talk, this conference, it turns out, and many people have mentioned this, that MGIT is also the moduli space of K-semi-stable. The moduli space of K semi-stable cubic surface. And then the GIT and K semi-apolystability agree. And then a lot of people mentioned the references for other dimensions as well, so I'll just go. But that is a terrific and it's a spectacular result. And for the purposes of my talk, it's something which I'm not going to use, but it's a really nice. Okay. Okay. There's a couple of important divisors in this moduli space. There's the discriminant, so the locus of cubic surfaces that are singular. And this is an irreducible divisor, and it's the closure of the locus of cubic surfaces with the unique singularity, which is in type A1. So we've got the smooth locus, the A1 locus, and then the A2 locus. That's just one point in our moduli space corresponding to the 3A2 cube. Okay, there's also another interesting divisor called the Eckhart divisor, which I'm Divisor called the EckArt divisor, which I'm calling R because there's some ramification that's showing up in some other setting. So I'm thinking of it's my ramification divisor, but you know, that's why I'm calling it R and not something else, just so you know. This is also irreducible, and it generically parameters a smooth cubic surface as having an XR point, just as a reminder for people who haven't thought about cubic surfaces recently. An X-R point is a point on the surface where three of the lines meet. Not all cubic surfaces have that property. The ones that do are special performative divisor. Form of divisor called the Eckhart divisor. A general smooth cubic surface that an Eckhart point has an automorphism group of Z2. And then it's a fact that the Eckhart divisor contains the locus of all smooth cubic surfaces with the non-trivial automorphisms. So all the cubic smooth cubics that have extra automorphisms are in that Eckhart divisor. Yes? But these two divisors, what are in terms of the quick I will tell you. Yes. Yeah, these are classically done, yes. And so I will not write down to the following. I will not write down the following numbers defining them, but I will tell you the degree. Okay. Okay, so under this isomorphism between MGIT and this weighted projective space, we of course have the record groups generated by the O of 1. And then to answer your question, the discriminant divisor is four times that divisor. That divisor? The Eckhart divisor is twenty five times that divisor. Um now maybe you're wondering because you're thinking, oh, but the Eckhart divisor is degree 100. Well, there's a ramification, so you have to be a little careful about that. Okay, but okay, no one is bothered by that. That's great. Ignore that. Okay. Okay, so the betting numbers, of course, we. Of course, we know, I want to talk about the cohomology of the spaces as well, so just we know the battery numbers just from the weighted projective space description. Okay, so now I want to talk about the Cure1 blow-up. So we started in this corner, and now I'm going up to this top part here, the Cure1 blow-up. Okay, what is the Cure1 blow-up? Okay, so the setting is that we have a GIT quotient of a smooth, projective, polarized variety. Polarized variety, you know, with a reductive group acting. And Kiron describes a quotient that you, a GIT quotient, you get by a sequence of blow-ups. And you know, the way that you should think about this is you look for the worst offenders. You know, you want everybody to finance stabilizers, but life isn't good. And so there's some guys who don't have finite stabilizers. You find the worst offender. And then you look at the locus of the worst offenders. And the closed loci will be disjoint, turns out. But you look at the worst offenders, and then you At the worst defenders, and then you blow up, you throw away everything that's not semi-stable, and you blow up the locus of worst defenders, which are smooth, and you twist by some of the exceptional divisor, and you repeat. And yeah, but so let me describe what happens. You start with your semi-stable locus, then you find the guys, the worst defenders, you blow up along the locus of the worst defenders, and then you get this new GIG problem. You look at the guys that are unstable, throw them out, see who's left with the worst defenders. It's the fact that you that the Is the fact that the dimension of the stabilizers of the worst offenders will go down after this process. And so at each step, you may not have, this R for me is indexing the dimension of the stabilizers of the worst offenders. And at each step, you may not have a locus with that dimension, but by the time you finish, you end up with something here where all of the stabilizers are finite. That should be x0. Um, yeah. Sorry. Okay, so, all right, so this quotient is called the Kirwan blow, but as by construction, only finite quotient singularities. So, to emphasize my question, you're using the usual block of that locus, you're not trying to do a weighted block, it's more efficient sometimes. And maybe it's better. And maybe it's better. In many examples, I think that that's better, but somehow this process is designed to be able to compute the cohomology, and it's just much easier when you have smooth blow-ups, that you blow up a smooth center. Because you, yeah, you, for technical reasons. We can now also, we can blow up. Wait, blow-up next time. Okay, I guess the main, okay, I'll ask you after, because there's some technical points. You usually want to be able to do it on the original GIT problem, because it gets harder and harder after each blow-up to keep track of exactly what's happening. Of exactly what's happening. And so this is set up so that you can do everything on the original guide and looking at Jennifer. That's an interesting one. Okay. Okay. Okay, so now I want to describe this process in our case of interest. So we start with MGIT, and then the Kiron blow-up has a single step coming from the blow-up of the 3A2 locus. So you just, that's there's a one-work defender, you throw everybody who's not semi-stable, then you blow up along the smooth locus. The smooth locus, and you get the Q1 blow up when you take the GIT quotient of the steam block. Alright, and delta is the 3A2 point. Okay, that's the Q1 blow-up. Okay, now, as I said, I want to ignore m hat for this talk, so if there's an equality there, I'm just going to ignore that. Okay, and then just going back to Okay, and then just going back to here, I want to just give some notation. I'm going to put tildas for strict transforms, and then I've got the one exceptional divisor, D3A2, so I'm calling it D3A2, because it's sort of parametrizing the 3A2 cubic, so to speak. It's not really parametrizing anything, it's just a blow-up, but I think of it as coming from the 3A2 cubics. Maybe a little bit similar to Luca's notation. The divisor that came from the singularities that I want to get rid of. Singularities that I want to get rid of. Is there a way to make it parameterize something? Well, because it's a global quotient stack. Okay. But I don't have a good answer to your question. Yeah. I don't have a good answer to your question. I also wanted to, yeah, never mind. Okay. Okay, so Kirwan given the Betty numbers of the space MK, and there was a small correction later by Zhang. These are the Betty numbers. These are the Betty numbers. I want to compare these later to some other Betty numbers. Okay, so let's move over to the arithmetic quotient side. Talk about these two spaces. Okay, so I want to write down a period map for cubic surfaces. So I want to use the Hodge decomposition to obtain a period map. To obtain a period map. The hot structure of a cubic surface, maybe as it is, is not as interesting as another hot structure, an auxiliary period map, Carlson Toledo, so I'm going to explain that. Okay, so people have probably seen these types of construction before. You have some variety that doesn't have a very interesting hot structure, and then you maybe take a cyclic cover and you get something that is interesting. Okay, so what are we going to do here? We start with a cubic surface defined by some equation. Defined by some equation. And then in coordinates, I'm just going to get a new cubic threefold by taking z cubed minus that cubic. That gives me a triple, a sigma cumber of P3 branched along the cubic surface. Okay, and just, as you can see, it's a cubic threefold. Okay, that's great. Why is that important? Well, if I have a cubic threefold, then I can take the intermediate Jacobian of the cubic threefold, and that gives me a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension five, as a lot of people were talking about in various talks. Okay, so that's a Hawks. Okay, so it's a period map to A5, the moduli space of this important five-folds. So if you consider the composition, you take the moduli of cubic, smooth cubic surfaces, then you convert them to cubic three-folds, then you take the intermediate Jacobian, and you remember the Z3 action, and you actually get a period map to a complex four-dimensional ball. The reason I'm interested in that is I'll come to an I'll come to it in a second, a result of Alcock, Carlson, and Toledo. Let me talk about two natural compactifications. There's two compactifications of our arithmetic quotient. There is the Satake-Bailey-Berl compactifications, which we get from modular forms. Just take modular forms, use them to embed your guy into protective space, take the closure. Usually that's not very nice. And then you have the toroidal compactification, which is a projective compactification that smooths up to finite coordinates in the 30s. Now, coming to that point, most of the time you have to care. Now, coming to that point, most of the time you have to be careful. You have to choose a tortoise vector. And then some of those will be smooth, some of them will be projective, some of them will be both smooth and projective. And then there's a result that says you can always find such a one. But for a ball quotient, the isotropic subspaces that define the boundary components are all one-dimensional. So there's no choice. There's just one toroyal compactification, and by what I just said, it has to be both smooth and projective. Okay, great. Okay, great. So, blah potions are sort of special in this way. It's a really nice situation where things are easier. Okay, the boundary of the Sadaki-Bailey-Borrell compactification, as a point, is called a cusp in that terminology. And of course, we're going to call it the 3A2 cusp for reasons that will become clearer momentarily. Okay, and that is, okay, so that's our one compactification. And then the tortoise is obtained. And then the total conductification is obtained from blowing up that point. Okay, so it's not just not a, so it happens that that is a smooth point, but this is not the usual blow-up. It's a different blow-up. I'll talk about that a little bit later, but essentially it's replacing that point with a divisor. In fact, the this ball parameterizes abelian 5 poles with a Z3 action? Or what is it? Let's see, I'm not sure if it's every one of those, but it is a component that, yes, that parameterizes, yes. You can describe it sort of abstractly in terms of abelian varieties independent of the fact that it came in. Way Z must be active. Yes, yes. Yeah, they have to have a certain decomposition one, four, and then that's getting all. Yeah, I'm going to sort of ignore getting into the technical details of arithmetic quotients, but yeah, nothing's But yeah, nothing's been there. Okay, so let's see. Okay, so what I want to now talk about is the period map here. So I talked about the period that was described a little bit better. This is work of Walcock, Carlson, and Toledo. They tell us that there is a commutative diagram. So here we have, and this is the bottom of the diagram on the last page. We have MGIT. That period map extends to actually an isomorphism of, so this is not the usual situation, but it just happens that if you take the GIT quotation. Happens that if you take the GIT quotation, take that period map, it extends to an isomorphism with the Sudaki-Bailey Berl open vectoration. And the modulation of smooth cubic sits inside of here as an open, Zrisky open subset, sort of typical there's going to be something you're missing. You're missing the discriminant divisor. So let me talk about that. First of all, the boundary point here corresponding to the 3A2 cubic gets sent to the cusp, the 3A2 cusp over here, just like I was saying before. Cusp over here, just like I was saying before, because everything's sort of matching up. And then the divise, there are divisors that match up. The discriminant divisor in MGIT that gets mapped to, we call it HN for a heat mirror divisor, notable heatener divisor. That's in, already shows up in this fall quotient here. And then there's, of course, the Eckhart divisor, and then this is, for some reason, I chose EH Eckhart. And those divisors are mapped to each other under this. This. For us, for our purposes today, it's just naming the images of these devices. Yes? What's the complement of this open embedding? Did you just save, or I had? Yes, it is this device right here. And that's the discriminant process. Yes. Yeah, if you put back in the discriminant, you'll get the whole Satake Bay program. They both pass through the cus? Yes, because the cus corresponds to the 302 cubics, and so that's indiscriminate. Okay, so just to be clear, we now have an isomorphism down here. Let's continue moving through the diagram. I give some notation. Again, I'm just using tildas to know the strict transforms. To denote the strict transforms. And over here, I'm going to call the toroidal boundary divisor T3A2. So that's T3A2 is the toroidal boundary divisor, D3A2 is the Q1 exceptional divisor. Okay, so when you're looking at arithmetic quotients, then there's a natural line bundle to look at, the Hodge bundle. So we know that this MGIT is isomorphic to weighted projective space, so that's the card rank one, so we should have a nice description, and some work of Alcock and Freiktag, based on some work of Borchards, tells us that the nodal divisor in the arithmetic quotient is 24 times the Hodge bundle, the Eckhart divisor is 150 times. The Eckhart divisor is 150 times the Hodge bundle, and then OP of one is six times the Hodge bundle. Okay. How nice it's a cube. Um oh great, yes, yeah, yeah. Yes, maybe I have this backwards. Yeah, I think I have a set of this backwards. Let me, yeah, thank you for that. Yes. I think it should be six O of one. Oh, six is one. Oh, six is one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you, Dan. What's that? You'd say it's still a Quick. This is a good point. Let me come back to this. The first bundle is not a line bundle. It's only... On the arithmetic questions, it's only an orphan line bundle. Oh, okay, right. Yeah, okay. So some high tensor power of it. Okay, now we know which one. Okay, thank you for that. So it clearly extends to the combatification. I guess that's part of. Extends to the commactification. I guess that's part of the Hodge theory kind of thing. Yes, yes, exactly. Definition of the Bailey Bureau. And on projective, weighted projective space of one is a Q line but not on the stack. Yes. Okay. All right. The Betty numbers of this Troyoga Of this steroidal compactification. This is something that we worked out. This is with, again, with Kruszzewski, Hulak, and Laza. And you can see that these match up with the Huron blow-up. And let me say something about that in a second. The proof of this is basically use the decomposition theorem and then show that this pteroidal boundary is isomorphic to P3, and that will give you this result. So here you really just need to show that. So, here you really just need to show that the tortilla boundary is isformed PP3, and that's what you do using this technology of tortile compactifications. Okay, but what I want to emphasize here is that both the Q1 blow-up and the tortile magnification are blow-ups of the same space, MGIT, at the same point, which is a smooth point of the weighted projective space. And they have the same betting numbers. Many numbers. So they're looking fairly similar, is what I say. But we'll see that they turn out to not be as okay. So this is something I learned recently. Hopefully I didn't get any typos in these slides as I was typing them up quickly yesterday. But let's give a modular interpretation to this tortoise and vectorification. That would be really nice. Okay, well, let's consider pairs where you take a cubic, a semi-stable cubic surface. So remember, those are A1, and then you. Surface. So remember, those are A1 and then these special A2 cubic surfaces. And then take the sum of the lines, 27 lines, divide by a ninth, and then add a small epsilon for the stability. Okay, so just to remind everybody, this is sort of the standard situation where the canonical plus this boundary is trivial. So that's loglaw bow. And then the stability, I'm going to give this a little bit to make sure that everybody's ample, and just a little bit to check for stability. Check for stability. That's how I think of these problems. Okay, and then it's actually pretty, you can check pretty quickly that for a GIT stable cubic surface, so that's smooth or A1, this pair is log canonical. Okay, and what does that come down to? Think about for XR cubic, you need three lines to be a negative point. You need to check that condition. And then for the A1, you need to think about on a cubic surface for the A1 singularity, you have three lines that pass through the singular point, counted with multiplication E2. You need to check everything's okay there. Check everything's okay there, but that's not so bad. And then you can check that for A2 cubics, the semi-stable, but not stable, these are not log canonical. That's again another quick computation to see if they're not log canonical. So the natural question is, well, what happens? So this is, I would say, it's Gaia Karashaffler, maybe motivated by hacking kill Tuvaluv. But B mod Ganama Bar. B mod gamma bar, the throwout compactification is the closure in the appropriate case B compactification of the moduli of pairs that we're just talking about, where V is a GIT stable cubic surface. So you take the stable guys, not the semi-stable guys, throw out the semi-stable guys. Take the sum of the 27 lines, divide by 9, add epsilon. Okay, and just as a remark, if you look at the paper, the proof in GKS is for marked cubic surfaces, and this was suggested by the remark about which. And then just to get to the unmarked case, you know, plus epsilon, you just need to check the compatibility of the ball quotient constructions in these two settings. And I'm actually going to say something about that in a second, so that will make more sense. But anyways, plus epsilon kind of gives you what I just said here. So this is a KSPA convectification, which I'm not going to use, but this troll convectification parametrizes these KSP stable surfaces. Stable surfaces. Okay, ah, and then what is at the boundary? Okay, this is thanks to Luca, whose code I pilfered to draw this. I did not draw this. So here's the, thanks to Luca. What is parameterized by the 32 cubics? Let me explain. So you've got three copies of P2, that's what the three coordinate axes are representing, meeting in normal crossing along lines. Along lines, okay, and then each of the lines has three points on it. And then what you do is you connect those points. And the 27 lines are obtained by connecting the points. I put six of them in red because it was kind of hard to see what they were when they were all in black. So th they're not special, they're just there to make it clear what the lines are. Okay, so this is what the boundary is parametrizing. And again, thanks to Luke for the great picture. Thanks, Deluca. Great picture. Any question? Oh, okay. Okay, so now, what about what is the QR envelope extend maybe to an isomorphism? If not, even weaker, are they abstractly isomorphic? Even weaker, maybe they're not abstractly isomorphic, but they're K equivalent. Maybe that explains the Equivalent, maybe that explains the quality of the Betty numbers. Maybe I'll talk about that in a second. Are they equivalent in the Grothendieck ring? Do either of them have normal crossing boundary? Okay, so these are the questions I want to look at. Okay, so today we'll answer these questions. Okay, so the first thing is: why might you expect the period map to extend to an isomorphism? At first, I thought Map to extend to an isomorphism. At first, I thought that it would, okay, and I was surprised that it didn't. So, well, if you look at cubic surfaces with marked lines, then you obtain a compactification of the modulo of cubic surfaces called the Naruki compactification, so it's been around for quite a while. And Gaiardo, Kerr and Schoffler, showed that the period map to the natural ball quotient model extends to an isomorphism of the Naruki compactification of the Torah compactification, and that sort of maybe gives some motivation for why you would think this might hold in this case as well. This case as well. And the second thing is that for people who have period map over the comp, you know, that extends over the complement of a divisor, well, the Borel extension theorem should say that the period map extends. Because there's no choice in the tortile convectification for cone, so there's no monochromatic condition to check. Oh, wait, but the boundary doesn't, that I just said doesn't include the DA1 boundary, and it's not locally liftable over the DA1 locus. Liftable over the DA1 logus. If it were, the two would be more liftable, so that argument doesn't work. It does work in the other case, though. Okay, so let me take an aside now on the rookie compactification. You take cubic surfaces, you mark them with the 27 lines, including the intersection pairing. There's another arithmetic group, and you get a picture. So, the picture that I'm trying to explain here is that we've got. The picture that I'm trying to explain here is that we've got the moduli of smooth cubic surfaces and the moduli-marked cubic surfaces. Then we've got the arithmetic quotient and an arithmetic quotient here lying over it with the while group of V6 as giving the quotient. That extends to an action on all of these compactifications. There's a Sabaki Belli-Brel, a Sabaki Belli-Brell, there's a toroidal and a toroidal, and then you've got the Daruki compactification, and Gaier-Karish-Schoffler showed that this is an isomorphism. Something that is known is that the boundary here is normal crossing. And so you could also use that argument that I just gave. If you know that there are 40 boundary divisors here and 40 boundary divisors here, and the grade map extends, then it has to be an isomorphism because they both are q factorials, and you can't have a small contraction. So that's another way to view it here. That's just an aside. I thought you might find it interesting. Okay, and then the motto for my talk is that. And then the motto for my talk is that everything you could possibly want to know about the Naruki compactification is known from Naruki. So I'm going to put a lot of stuff into a black box and just say Naruki proved this here. And we have this isomorphism, and that's going to tell me something about the ball quotient, the drawer qualification for the unmarked case. Okay, so the first thing to check is that in the Kirwan compactification, the boundary, this is the exceptional divisor and the strict transform of the discriminant, they don't meet in normal crossings. And the proof of that is fairly, you know, it's a lot of computations, but the idea is easy. You just look at a Luna slice for the GIT, and then you just carefully describe what happens in the Q1 blow up for the Luna slice, and you just check by hand. Of the Luna slice, and you just check by hand. And it's very similar to the situation where we have A2 singularities. We think about the discriminant for an A2 singularity, the discriminator cusp. When you do the naive blow-up, you just don't have normal crossing with the exceptional divisor. So the idea is fairly simple. It's just where you're going to start. Okay, on the other hand, in the Troidal compactification, you do have normal crossing. And like I said, this you just compare with the Nuki. And like I said, this you just compare with the Ruki compactification. It's normal crossing in the Ruki compactification. And this is up to finite quotients, I mean. And so since you just have a finite quotient, you get this for free. Okay, so these two spaces can't be isomorphic as moduli spaces, just from that fact, because the discriminants are different. But you can ask, well, maybe the period map extends still. They're not isomorphic, but somehow the period map extends. And you can see that this is not possible. This is not impossible. If it were to extend to amorphism, it would have to be a small contraction, but B mod gamma is Q factorial, and that gives a contradiction. So there's nothing to check there. Okay. Okay, so now you can ask, well, maybe they could be abstractly isomorphic. I'm just forgetting about whether they're a moduli space. Are these two varieties abstractly isomorphic or even k equivalent? Okay, what is k equivalent? Okay, recall the two birational normal projective Q Gaussian varieties X and Y are said to be K equivalent if, for example, Varieties x and y are said to be k equivalent if there exists a smooth variety z dominating them both birationally in this diagram, so that the pullback of the canonicals are the same. Okay, why is this an interesting concept? Well, from the perspective of this talk, and I think what Dan may have been thinking about when I gave a talk on this before, let me. Okay, what do we can we say? Why ask about k equivalents? Well, if we have two smooth k equivalent varieties that have the same Betty, that's all, two smooth K-equivalent varieties. Betty, that's our two smooth k-equivalent varieties have the same Betty numbers. So we have these two guys that are not isomorphic, but they have the same Betty numbers. They're smooth enough to find equations together, but if you think of them as being smooth, maybe that would explain it. Okay, and then maybe why would we think that these could be K equivalent? Well, if you have two birational normal projective Huguenots in varieties with canonical singularities and Netf canonical, then they're K equivalent. That's due to Karlomata. So maybe this is what's going on. But of course, if we think about it, okay, the Huron blow-up and the throw-up activation are. Blow-up and the throne of activation are singular. They find a question singular, so the first one is sort of out for that reason. And then, of course, the canonical bundles are not nef, they're birational to a qfauno variety, and so the second one is not going to apply. Isn't there a stack version of that first? Where everything's quotient singularity? I'm not, I wouldn't be surprised if there were. I remember I think you have to use the orbital heading options, which and then. Yes. Okay, yeah, I would believe that. Yeah. Okay. I would believe that, yeah. Okay. All right, so although now I'm thinking of it, let me come back to that. Okay. Okay, so the theorem I want to talk about today, sort of answering Dan's question from a while ago, is that these are not k-equivalent. Okay, and what's the proof? I'm going to show that the top intersection numbers of the canonical bundles of the two compactivations are different. Bundles of the two compactivations are different. If they're the same and you pull back, you should get the same number up above. And so, okay, that would do it. Okay, how am I going to do this? Okay. Well, I want to sort of go into a little bit about discrepancies in the Cure1 blow-up setting, because it has sort of a nice application to give a simple proof in some special cases of some customs about KLD for JT collections. Okay, so in Cure1 blow-up, we have, I'm just going to do one step in the blow-up. I'm just going to do one step in the blow-up and imagine that that resolves to singularities, but you can do this for more. So we have a smooth codimension C subvariety that were the center of the blow-up for our first blow-up. I'm going to call the exceptional divisor F. We've got a ramification divisor. So these are the divisors with non-trivial generic stabilizers, and I need to know when I pull back under the blow-up, how much of the exceptional divisor do I get. Okay, and then I'm going to call E the exceptional divisor for the Q1 blow-up after I take the GIT quote. Pure one blow up after I take the GIT quotes. You're taking the core space for the Pure1 blow-up? Is this MK the core space? Scheme, as opposed to the scheme. Yeah, right. Yes, I'm only talking about schemes. I do think it's interesting to think about the stacks in the background, but I don't want to get them just because there's a whole bunch of different stack structures that you can choose that are kind of interesting to think about. Okay, so this is just a little bit Okay, so this is just a little lemma using facts about discrepancies when you have a finite for ramified covers. So just Kohlar's book on the section of ramified covers, look there. And out comes this. What's important is that, these are in terms of these invariants, this is some description of the discrepancy for the QR1 glow in terms of some things that we can determine on the original Q1, like the original GIT problem. Okay, so what are these things? Okay, so what are these things? Gx is the stabilizer of a generic point. So when you have SLN acting, the diagonal guy with the roots of unity is going to stabilize everybody. So you've got to get rid of those guys. Those guys don't count. Okay, so then you just need to know how much bigger are the stabilizers of everybody else. These are the stabilizers of the divisors that have interesting stabilizers. And this is just getting, this is the stabilizer of the exceptional divisor here. And after you've blown up, and this is the mu I. Going up, and this is the μi is this multiplicity here. Okay, so just an answer to this question before, it's just sort of a nice, you can just quickly see here. Okay, and I need the technical condition is I need the semi-stable locus to be codimension 2, and I need the quotient to be q Gorencing, which is not necessarily going to be the case. But if I'm in that situation, which we are here, then you get this, and you can quickly see that these have to be KLT from there. And that's actually a much more general result of Schuten's GIT coaching. Of Schuten's, that GIT coefficients are KLT. And then it's sort of fun that this is really an aside because the results that I'm citing are way more powerful than anything I'm saying here. But if you do already know that some moduli spaces of smooth Fanos satisfy this condition, then you can say that that locus is KLT. It's kind of a fun little proof that the deformate, locally, the modular space looks like a GAT quotient, and so then locally you can use this. So it's just a fun little fact. So it's just a fun little fact. There's much more general results out there, but I could be forgetting some names here. Is that actually? I think in general, even though the GID quotients are KLG singularities, they are of KLG type. Yes. Yes, it's a much more general result. This is only of a very special case. Yeah, shooting, yeah, yes. Thanks. The only observation being KSD is being correlated. Yes, you call it. So that's a much more, much bigger result. This is just a little lemma for this very special case, but it happens to show up often. Okay. Okay, so what happens in our specific case? So let's apply it. I just took copy the lemma from the last page. Let's apply it. Okay, well, Z in this situation is the orbit of 3A2 cubics. We know the dimension of the stabilizer, so that tells us that the codimension. So that tells us that the codimension is 6. Okay, the only ramification divisor is the Eckhart divisor, and you can compute using the Lundis-Lice theorem that the mu there is 15. That's the multiplicity of the divisor coming into that locus. Okay, and then the general stabilizer is just the diagonal mu4. You know, we're an SL4, and so we just have these diagonal lines that will stabilize everybody. And so therefore, we have, and then we talked about how the Eckhart cubics have a Z2 automorphism. Ecker cubics have a Z2 automorphism, that's this fact here. And then you can check that generically along the exceptional divisor F, you just have the standard stabilizers. Okay, we put that all together, and you get that the canonical of the Q1 is fullback of canonical from the MPIT plus 20 times the pound. Why is the general stabilizer bigger? Why is it not bigger? No, why? Oh, because you have the di SL4, you have the diagonal matrices with the root of unity? Also, you're acting on DJL. Yes. DJL3. Four. Sorry. Yeah, I'm doing GIT, so I want to be here in, yes. Okay. All right. So what about in the toroidal compactification? Okay, well, Mumford has a formula for the compactification. Has a formula for the canonical for toroidals and for the Satake Belly Borel. And this is what, once you know the stabilizers, in the Hodge theoretic sense, this just comes out of that. And you can compare it to the Maruki compactification and get this. And let me just sort of cut to the chase for the victorial compactification. You can compute that the canonical is the victorial compactification is a pullback of the canonical from a Fullback of the canonical from the Sadaki Bailey Borrel, which is MGIT, and plus 16 times the boundary. Alright, so far so good. Alright, so this is just reiterating what's there. What I want to do is compute the top intersection of these two guys. And so what I really need to focus on is the top intersection over here. Okay, so from you can compare with Muruki and you do some work and you can find that the top intersection here of the toroidal boundary is negative 1 over 6 cubed. Is negative 1 over 6 cubed. Okay, and so putting this all together, we can see that the top intersection, well, we have the same number here. Here, we know explicitly what the number is here. This turned, computing the top intersection of the toidal, that's the Q-1 boundary turned out to be a little bit harder than I was anticipating. And so I didn't want to, it seems like you should be able to do it, but then I just, it turned out to be more tricky. So, what we showed instead. We showed instead was just that the fourth power is in one over e times z, where five does not divide e, and that's going to be enough to show that these genomes can't be the same. Okay, so we just sort of look, we restrict our attention to d32, and you use the cur1 blow-up, and you can check that there's no stabilizers that have order equal to five, and that's enough to show this. Is it hard to find these lunar slices? No, that's really that. No, that's really, yeah, that you can just write down explicitly, and there's a nice way to kind of go about finding them. But yeah, I didn't want to get into the any great. But if you do look in the appendix, if you're ever interested and you look in the appendix, you'll see far more detail, I think, than you may ever want to go through. But for general GIT pause, it's not no, no, it's just for hyperservices, you can like I found that it's not, I mean, in general, I'm not going to say it's only, but for particular examples, it's not, it's. Particular examples, it's not, it's a technique that seems to work well. Okay, and then this is just explaining that since we know that d to the fourth is not divisible, you know, it is of this form, then the two canonical, the top intersections of the canonical can't be equal, and so they're not k equivalent. Okay. Okay, so let me summarize just before I end the talk. Just before I end the talk. Okay, the period map from the Kiron blow-up does, maybe perhaps surprisingly or not, does not extend to morphism or isomorphism. The Kirwan blow-up and the cheroidal convectivation are not even abstractly isomorphic or even k-equivalent. I don't really have time to talk about why the two spaces are equivalent in the Groth and Degramme of varieties, but they are. Our troll classification has normal crossing boundary, while MK does not. So maybe that means that this is the better one to study. And from experience with cubic threefolds as well, it seems like these toroidal compactifications of the arithmetic quotient seem to be nice spaces to work with, whereas some of the other spaces are not so nice. So it's sort of an interesting point. Okay, I think that that's everything that I wanted to say. Let me check that the next slide is in fact, yes. That is in fact, yes, our boots. Thank you. Thanks for your attention. Question: So it is, I basically repeat what I said Kira. So Kira's procedure has the flexibility that we don't have to take a usual blowout as long as we separate the value of the sala. So a weighted blowout is often Blu-ray is often as good and suggests that it is a different blow-up. Yes, exactly. And the exact analog of this, like secretly in the background, you should just replace this problem with the situation of semi-stable reduction for an elliptic curve to generate your hospital. Right, yeah, exactly. And then in the Curebon blow-up, yeah, you just blow up, you know, and then that doesn't really help you. But what you really want to do is take the vial cover, and then To just take the vial cover and then separate the lines, the determinant separates the lines, and then take the quotient after you've blown that up. And that's this weighted blow-up that you're describing. And so it seems that, yeah, if you just do the weighted blow-up, it should be better. The only issue that I'm wondering about is when you want to use, so for the purposes of this talk, it wasn't really necessary, but when you're trying to compute the cohomology, you want to compute some of these invariants by looking at the action of stabilizers on the normal bundle when you blow. On the normal bundle when you've blown up. And you sort of need to know that when you do things equally, you're getting something representative of what's happening in general. And I am wondering whether in the weighted blow-up you can maybe if you view it by first taking the finite cover, then blow up it and quotienting, that maybe you can keep track of that. But anyways, that's, I think, the only point that. Q, What's that? The orbital cohomology. Even not the orbital cohort, just cohomology. And the cohomology of the stack. I'm worried a little bit about Kirwan's argument for she wants to prefer computing the column of it. Like to, okay, that seems really reasonable, but I'm not sure. So I mentioned the So I imagine they are baddie members or they're saying what about the torture? I know. Yeah. Hunting. Yeah, that could be very interesting. But I, so Dominiono Fulgesu has been looking at these kinds of questions, like integral commas, integral chow type questions. And this one seems to be more, I don't know, I mean, I talked to him a little bit about it, and it seemed to be something maybe possible, but maybe it's the boundary of what. The boundary of what he wanted to look at. It's possible that that's changed. He may have made one part of this. Not on this problem, but on related questions. Like I think, I can't, I'm trying to remember if maybe it's like plain cubics. Sorry, plain cortex. I think there's maybe, maybe he has a paper on that. It's similar in spirit to this. And yeah, you should look at his papers, I think. Look at his papers I think. Explain what goes wrong in terms of normal crossing in the Kerman bar? Yes. So maybe I'll just write with chalk for a second. This isn't a perfect picture of what's going on, but if you look at the discriminant of an A2 single Of an A2 singularity. It's a cusp. And the analog of what's happening at the current load is just saying that we should do is just blow up the A2 locus. And then in this situation, you just get this. Now, you still do have to take a quotient by the group action, check that nothing happened. But you can check that even after you take the quotient, you're not normal crossing, which you do have to check, to be a little careful with that. But this is the idea. But this is the idea that this is the problem. But what is better is to do a weighted blow-up. But one way to think about the weighted blow-up more for ADE singularities, where this works really well, is that if you take the bile cover, there's a bile group cover that separates the discriminant into type A hyperplane arrangement. And then once you have an hyperplane arrangement that's governed by the roots, in this case, it's very easy to see what to do, but you can blow up starting from the worst effect. Blow up starting from the worst offending strata in that sense, and then you get these guys separated. And that there is the J line, basically, or not the J line, the lambda line, so to speak. And then you can take the quotient here. This is different. So take a quotient and get, take the quotient of the blow-up, and this gives you something. The quotient of the blow-up, and this gives you something nicer. That would be the weighted blow-up that Dan is talking about. And then that would be normal crossing of definite quotients. And so that's a much better thing to do in general rather than just the Q1 blow-up. But I don't know how that interacts with her computations in the cohomology. I think it was just a question of normal process. Yeah, again about like normal crossing because like if you take like the stacky right over packification, it's sort of normal crossings. But if you just look at the core space, like then right, I mean are there does that come up in this case? I'm always taking things up to finite quotients. So I'm thinking about it in that sense as a stack. Yeah, even though I'm sort of Yeah, even though I'm I'm sort of ignoring that for those purposes. One of the technical points is that's an analytic stack with a projective course moduli space. And I'm fairly certain that that means that it's also an algebraic stack. Although I haven't found a reference for that and keep asking people about that. And I have an idea of how you would go about proving that, but I couldn't find a reference. Maybe you know. I mean, this is automatic. I mean this is automatic from just passing to a finite index subcover so that the so that there are no local stabilizers and taking the toroidal compactification. The toroidal construction is compatible with passing to a finite index. Oh, yeah. This gives us stack cover of the via project. Right. Okay. So that makes it easier. Thank you. But that was one of the reasons I was sort of ignoring the question. Thanks for uh clearing that up. Now I can boldly Clearing that up. Now I can boldly use that stack structure. And maybe I should also say that you can use that to describe this structural commatification as a modula of hot structures, to generate all of its hot structures in the sense of coding symmetry. Thank you all again. We'll resume at 10:30. We'll resume at 10:30. So, some of you ask me why. Oh, thanks. Very clear.
