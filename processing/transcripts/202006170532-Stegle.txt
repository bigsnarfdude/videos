So up to you, Olivon. Thank you for having me here. Apologies. I joined a little late on time for my schedule slot at least, but I was in traffic. I actually put together a talk more on computational integration of multi-omics data. And then obviously I'll talk about the use case you mentioned, you know, that that specific study, but I'll have some more background. But I'll have some more background on that. And I'll try to share my screen. Okay, move this over here. I go to full screen. Can you see my slides? Yes, we can. No? Excellent. Excellent. Great. Yes. Yeah. So just before, sorry. Yeah. You can post your questions in the chat and we can wait until Alva is finished before we ask the questions. Thanks, Aliba. Thanks, Ariva. Yeah, I mean, it's also not that a huge audience. So, from my perspective, you know, you could also jump in. So, if you see moderating questions that would fit in, you can also just interrupt me. I mean, I don't, you know, whatever, whatever works. Sometimes it's, you know, the sort of monitoring webinars can be sometimes difficult to follow through to the end. So very happy to take questions as they come along, have a discussion. So I put together a few slides on methods for integrating multi-omics data and then lead over to this gas relation study. I want to start here with, you know, Relation study, I want to start here with a generic problem that I think also motivates why we do these multi-omics questions. And I thought it maybe just puts things a little bit in perspective. And we do many single-cell analysis. We often have the problem that in classical experiments with bulk assays, we have some different groups, control groups, drug one, drug two, maybe interactions. And then we can ask, you know, are the differences between these different groups? And one of the main reasons why I think multi-omics approaches are useful in a single Mix approaches are useful at a single level, and primarily is because we don't have those grouping structures. We have the cells, we need to understand what these cells do, and we need to basically reason from the data different states, different conditions, different cell types, different cell states, and then do these inter-comparisons, for example, at the epigenetic layer. So there is sort of two answers to this question. The first, however, is to do inferences, to basically infer these groups from the data and then do these comparisons. And that's something historically that's been happened a lot. And that's something historically that's been happening a lot in the single-cell RNA-seq field. You know, I just have you just one slide sort of to recap on all stuff where essentially we infer these different groups from the data itself and ask these questions. For example, where cells go along differentization, and you have showed it's been covered also in previous talks extensively, where we basically use pseudo-temporal orderings, understand from these orderings what's changing, and then, for example, correlate the expression changes of individual use to these different groupings. Now, Things. Now, I also thought I'll have sort of one slide here to link into the spatial technologies being talked about because it fitted very nicely into this theme that if you don't want to do the differences about cell types and cell states, then spaces in a way is just also one other modality we're measuring about the same cells. That's, I think, a very interesting way how to look at it. That essentially, it's sort of one dimension. You know, it's sort of one dimension of big multi-omics because we measure either at the single cell level or at the level of voxels. This is a 10x mesium slide here where we don't measure single cell resolution, but immediately voxels. We measure other data that we can use to draw interactions. And I don't have to walk you through the technologies. You had a beautiful talk from Bernd yesterday about SITOF combined with imaging data where we basically measure these variations in two dimensions. But the main point I want to make here is essentially that this is also another way of having a multi-omics technology if you wish. Of having a multi-omics technology, if you wish, where essentially we can ask questions how the different coordinates where a particular cell or voxel are located, how they relate to the molecular output of gene expression here. Every bar here is, you know, how expressed a particular gene is. We can ask question, how does space relate to gene expression? And that's, I think, a very, a very nice analogy. And you will see, we will use very, very similar principles when you come to the multi-omic state on looking at epigenome. It's just we don't have spatial coordinates. Spatial coordinates, but epigenetic coordinates of these cells. And we can start asking these questions how they interrelate. And I even have here sort of one slide on a method we developed a few years ago, which we're also going to use now in a second, just in the multi-omic day, where essentially we're asking whether variation in space of a specific gene, so this is now one single gene, sort of as a mock-up here, whether this basically whether expression changes across space, whether they can be explained by spatial similarity where these measurements are. Spatial similarity where these measurements are. And one way to measure that is actually by using covariance models and measuring the distance between voxels. So, voxels that are close together as cells have high covariance, those farther away have less high covariance, and essentially asking the question, does spatial proximity translate into expression proximity? And there's a very, very strong connection between these spatial methods and the multi-omics technologies, which my talk's going to focusing on. I think that's also a very interesting thing to think in the brainstorming session, you know, how these technologies relate and how does multi-methyl technology These technologies relate, and how does multi-omics link to the spatial assays, which are very exciting. We had a whole video about this. Okay, so this, you know, the third dimension, obviously, and this is sort of what this talk will be mainly about, is multi-omics. And I think, you know, once after this introduction, it's quite clear how we can frame this. Essentially, you know, we're measuring one readout, let's say the transcriptome, and we want to relate how do these changes, these transcriptional changes, relate to this other modality, this other dimension we can measure, for example. Damage that we can measure, for example, DNA methylation, DNA accessibility, or DNA sequencing, which are increasingly available in parallel measurements in the same cells. So historically for us, this journey started with a very fruitful collaboration with Wolf Reich's Lab. And at the time, Stephen Clark and Heather Lee and Wolf's Lab developed an approach that essentially allows from the same physical cell that has been sold. The same physical cell that has been sorted into a 96-well plate using fax to physically separate the RNA component and the DNA. And that allowed and enabled the first of a series of parallel profiling efforts where from the same cells, we now could obtain multiple omics layers in parallel. In this case, using the DNA part and essentially caringite bisulfurite treatment and And DNA sequencing to get a very shallow DNA methylone using essentially the same technology that is applied regularly on bulk for DNA addition profiling, with some caveats. The main caveat being that you have very little material to start with, you have two copies of DNA to go with. And so, you know, if you miss any of those, then obviously there's not much left to look at. Well, on the RNA side, we at least have had a sort of somewhat higher level of transcriptome sequencing. So we actually use. Level of transcriptome sequencing. So we actually use, in this case, Smart C2 essentially for sequencing. And that gave the first rise to the first parallel data sets where we have a DNA methylation variation and transcription at the same time. Here in this diagram, we depicting the top 200 gene bodies by variability in rows, and the columns are different cells. And so basically, we have no parallel variation of the methylation transcriptome. What actually was quite interesting to see at this point, and you see this later on, that actually relating This point, you see this later on, that actually relating these two information is a lot more subtle than you would think. So they're clustered by the methylation. So the columns are clustered, so you can see by the methylone profile of promoters. And there was very little concordance with the transcriptome. If you sort of just look at this clustering relationship. So there's some interesting questions on how to start integrating these data sets and how to do it in a way that you can learn anything. And I mainly want to convey here in this talk a few ideas about what we learned, what worked, what didn't. We learned what worked, what didn't work, you know, what were the strategies, the principles, and then also going to some of the statistical methods that underpinned this effort. So, here's maybe a slide on the challenges. We sort of essentially do this multi-omics profiling because we want to study a biological object of interest. And I'll show you later on what that biological object is, and sort of get different views of it. And sort of get different views of it. Maybe the genome, maybe the transcriptome, maybe the proteome within metabolome. I'm here really for this talk, maybe focusing on epigenome and transcriptome, because that's the two assets we have been using extensively. But these principles obviously translate to other multi-omics dimensions. And now the questions and how to make sense of this data start with getting things right for every distinct data type. So if we want to combine the epigenome variation, the transcriptome variation, we need to. Epigenome variation, the transcriptome variation, we need to think about the individual properties of DNA methylation and single-cell RNA-seq and got those right. And since this hasn't been really touched upon so far, I will talk a little bit about the methylbee and as the epigenome, essentially. Very similar principles hold for DNA accessibility as well, because I think it's very useful to be aware of these challenges when you start tying together these data sets. Together, these data sets and making sense of them. So, we'll spend a little bit of time talking about DNA methylation at the single cell level, period, and then I'll go back to how to tie in that variation with the transcriptome and make sense of those. So this is sort of a bird's eye view or summary in one slide about why is single-cell epigenome sequencing hard. It's hard, I already mentioned this. It's hard. I already mentioned this because we have scarce starting material, two copies of DNA per cell. Things go well, and it's not a copy number amplified, for example, in the context of disease. And hence, there's very little starting material. And even if you sequence these libraries to full depth and spend a lot of money, the data I talk about is still roughly like 50 bucks per cell. So it's sequenced to almost saturation. It's quite deep. And even if you go there, you get a matrix. You get a matrix that looks like this. You get some ones and some zeros. One essentially means that you have observed one read that overlaps a CPG site that has been converted from sulfur sequence, where you basically know it is methylated. And so it's very, very, very unlikely to get to see two chromosomal copies. And the reason Copies. And the reason simply is the missingness rate of 60 to 80%. So if you sequence 10 to 20% of the genome, you know, you can imagine that you see both sides. This is 20% squared. So you're talking about roughly 4% of the genome where you see both chromosomal copies. So almost always you only see one. So it's useful to think about because all these hemi-methylation states are basically not accessible. You only know: is at least one of these chromosomal copies methylated or unmethylated? In most cases, you have no idea. In most cases, you have no idea. That's actually where these question marks come from. What's important, however, is compared in contrast to singles and attack sequencing, which is also very popular, you know what you know and what you don't know. So you have reads and that bisulfide conversion steps tells you whether you have methylation or unmethylated sites. And hence, we at least we know the missing values, which is obviously a real asset, but there are lots of them. So the first chance to impute the epigenome profiles, this is work that Christopher Engemüller, a student who backed. That Christoph Engemüller, a student who back then worked very closely with Rulflag, developed and thought about. And I just want to show you one more slide why this is quite important. What I'm plotting here is for two canonical genomic elements you might want to look at. I mean, all is the whole genome, genome-wide methylation. But I'm taking out here CGI promoters and lowly methylate regions as two examples of regulatory sites and non-regulatory sites. Non-regulatory sites is CGF promoters, not very relevant in regulation. And here, you see quite a good coverage. So, if you look at what fraction of these promoters are covered in at least 20%, 50%, 100% of all cells, you see that many of these elements you can actually access in many of the cells. So, that time this was a data set of 100 cells or so. We can see that in many cells. But many of these regulatory interesting regions, LMRs, enhancers. LMRs, enhancers, and other elements they have much more this profile here. What you see on the right, namely that you know you only see it in a very small fraction of cells, and there's a large fraction of missing values you have to deal with. And if you don't deal with that, you can't really ask many questions. If you only see a site in 10% of the cells, it's very difficult to do any interesting analysis downstream. So, at least something to think about missing values. At the time, we devised a method that basically tries to explicitly That basically tries to explicitly fill in these gaps. And as mentioned before, we know which values are missing, which ones are not missing. So we can essentially figure out a scheme to address what's the most likely binary methylation state of one of these question mark regions here. And the model Christopher put together uses two informations. On the one hand, correlations between sites. So if I have a question mark here, but I know that the right-hand neighbor is unmethylated. But I know that the right-hand neighbor is unmethylated. Obviously, that changes my belief that this site here is maybe also unmethylated. And similarly, you might also say, well, you know, if the same site is methylated in another cell, you know, that also informs me about the belief. So there's sort of a local correlation both in genomic coordinates, and that's a theme that comes back later. So we can think about correlation in genome space, but also have correlations across different cells. And then there's a third. Different cells. And then there's a third component that we leverage, which is maybe a bit more surprising, and that's the DNA context. So we also accounted for the fact that methylation is strongly determined and affected by the DNA sequence in multiple ways. On the one hand, specific regions of the genome are more likely methylate than others. You know, this is thinking about is that a promoter or an enhancer, is it a CPG island or not? So this is sort of information. CPG island or not. So, this is sort of information that encodes in the DNA. But you might even have also sequence variants that change the likelihood of seeing methylation. And so, you know, this is sort of the three bits of information we wanted to encode in one model that tries to basically fill in these gaps. What we used at that time, and there is now a series of methods to do that. There's actually also simpler methods that do quite well. We at that time sort of used a brute force approach. This one is sort of retrospectively. One is sort of retrospectively considering this was a deep neural network, which had two components. One of them is a bidirectional GIU unit that essentially encodes for these local correlations. So basically, it looks at, you know, what are the neighbors of a site? I want to predict the methylation state of one specific CPG site. Is it zero or one, methylated, unmethylated? And the information that goes in is what are my neighbors? What's the CPGs on the left, on the right, in the cell itself, and in other Cell itself and in other cells. And that correlation structure was encoded, and it's one module for every cell. So, in every cell, we sort of model the correlation structure in neighbors and in other related cells, which is already, as you can imagine, quite a potent predictor in making these inferences. Is a particular CBD user method or not? The second information we took into account was the DNA sequence. So, here we basically looked at the local stretch of DNA around the CPD. Of DNA around the CPG site, 1 Kb, I believe, and we use the convolutional network matrix structure filters. These are basically motifs, it's a bit like precision weight matrices that essentially captures where are we in the genome, essentially the context. You know, is the transmission factbin side? Is this the CPG's weight region? Is it the CPG poor region and so forth? And then with some pooling steps, we again got sort of a predictive signal that is biasing these elements. Now, what's the exciting element, and that's maybe something to highlight here, is that this model also learns. Is that this model also learned interactions? So essentially, what's changing is there are regions in the genome where methylation is more smooth, while in others, you have more abrupt changes. So you could imagine that depending on where you are in the genome, the information about what's going on with your neighbors left and right in the CPG methylation is more or less relevant. And that's actually what also is encoded by this. Essentially, this part here at the bottom, the main important element what this model learns is essentially where are we in the genome, you know, because that changes the way you want to interpolate. Changes the way you want to interpolate in this methodation space. So, to cut a long story short, this worked okay. So, we did better than other things at the time. You know, this is sort of some baseline strategies we could consider. So, this is averaging in local regions along the genome. So, here you're just taking the left, right, and the right five CPG sites and averaging over those and use the others predictor. This is averaging a This is averaging across different cells for the same CPG sites. These are different random forest models that one could construct. And this model that we built was quite a bit more accurate. What's also quite exciting is actually, if you sort of zoom in, what are these different components? I already mentioned to you, there's one method, CPG context, which looks at local correlation. There's DNA context, which looks at the DNA sequence. And there's a full model. You can see that you're getting information by putting these signals together. And you can do an okay job. Together, and you can do an okay job in predicting methylation. So, are we done? I mean, that's, I think, an important message here to convey. We are not done. This is still a hard problem. I showed you this middle bar here, which I see a mark all. This is the genome-wide average of all CPG sites. But if we stratify these CPG sites by type, we see great differences between going to something like predicting methylation in an axon. Methylation in an exon or in a gene promoter, which arguably as you see later on, is a lot less interesting and relevant because they don't vary much across cells versus the example I showed you earlier on, a lowly methylated region or an active enhancer where it is still hard to predict. It's hard because they're small, there's very local changes in a very confined region, they're very variable across cells. And this is where the action sits in the epigenome. And there's still some work to be done. And there's still some work to be done, but certainly we've learned something, and we are definitely a lot better than averaging an increment windows. If you think about where this red bar here is compared to these other ones. And the other thing I just want to mention is that this model from the DNA part actually picked up a lot of interesting things also from the DNA sequencing part. So we learned also which motifs are associated with CPG sites that are either unmethylated or methylated. And some motifs are. And some CB, some motifs are positively and negatively associated with methylation. It's sort of, you know, by doing this reputation exercise, we actually learned quite a lot about the regulation, you know, basically where DNA sequence changes the way methylation acts. And I think it's something we have to sort of remind ourselves when we interpret epigenetic variation that the context, the genomic context, is usually important and derives a lot from methylation changes and so forth. Now, with this sort of summary, I Now, you know, with this sort of summary, I wanted to convey you sort of an idea that getting the inputs right is sort of the first step, and it can be quite challenging to do so. And it's something we obviously have to do some thought. Now, I want to now proceed and talk a bit about schemes of integrating epigenetic variation with transcription. So I'll stick to my methylation example. So, I'll stick to my methylation example mainly here. And, you know, and there are sort of two regimes to think about this: one, which one could call local or association-based, where, you know, similar to genetics, where we associate individual SNPs to gene expression changes nearby, you know, we can associate absence presence of phenome methylation in CBG sites, for example, in a local enhancer to gene expression changes and so forth. And we will consider this, and this is sort of, I think, how many. Consider this, and this is sort of, I think, how many people would want to see that. You want to see that the methylone and regulatory element changes to the expression of something nearby. And then there's a more global view, which is to say, well, you know, we just take the whole methylone and now my pointer died. Well, okay, pointer, pointer's gone. You take the whole methylome and the whole transcriptome, and you want to sort of more get a global view of cell states. Get a global view of cell states. So, the left is more regulatory associations between how epigenetic changes drive perhaps expression changes of individual genes. And the right-hand picture is more how can we learn something about cell identity? Where is a cell? Transcriptionally, what is the cell type, cell state, but also where is it coming from from an epigenetic perspective, which is more giving you an idea and insight about cell states. And I think these are two different ways of interlinking this variation, and something we also think about when we do the analysis. About when we do the analysis. So, I'll start here with the local part of the last bit and just want to give you an example. Okay. Okay, at least this works still. This is basically one locus. Okay, now my computer does its own thing. Apologies, that was not planned. I won't. Not planned, I want okay. And this is one larkus is um ESRB, it's a pluripotency gene in a pilot that we generated early on in mouse pluripoten stem cells. And here we want to do exactly the sort of local correlation. So we want to basically look, and this top left figure is meant to represent that, correlating epigenetic changes locally in the genome to changes in prescription algorithms. To changes in prescription output of one gene. And this one gene is ESRB. And what you can see here in this picture is essentially the methylation measurements as you're taking them. So every dot here is a CBG site in a cell. And you can see in the bottom panel labeled methylation, there are regions where all cells are methylated. So everything is at the top. And then there are regions where all cells are unmethylated. So things cluster at the bottom. And then there are interesting regions, which is these two regions you highlight on the right. These two regions you highlight on the right, where there seem to be two populations. Some cells are methylated, others are unmethylated. And what you see in the top is actually scatterplotting the methylome at these sites in the individual cells to the gene expression level of ESRB. And here you can see that high methylation rates are associated with low expression. So you see the canonical associations that you perhaps would expect when looking at the DNA methylone. And what's quite important is. And what's quite important is these are regions, actually, these enhancer regions. There are P300 regions and two super enhancers. And that's exactly what we see. That's mostly enhancers and methylation in enhancers that is correlated to gene expression changes. It's not gene promoters. I think maybe something to be very, very, very strong about. It's very, in all, almost all cases, things like these pictures. And there's a small, tiny region somewhere in the gene in this case that's correlated to the output of ESRB. You can do this. Of ESRB. You can do this globally. And what I think to us was also surprising is how much power you have. And I don't know why my computer is deciding to do this. Now I have this picture. So what you see here is now if you take all genes genome-wide and we correlate methylation variation at P300 sites to expression changes of the nearest gene. And it was surprising to us that we have actually any power to find associations. Actually, any power to find associations. This is just 90 cells. It's a very tiny data set. And this also gives you some, I think, of the power of single-cell multi-omics that because we have relatively few populations of cells, we have a lot more power to detect regulatorizations than you would in bulk data sets. It's really quite staggering. Some of these effects are quite strong. That's maybe the main message. So, where have things moved since then? I mean, one innovation was to look at SE NMTC. Was to look at SENMT-C. So, this is essentially generalizing this protocol I mentioned earlier to a third dimension, which is gene accessibility, by profiling GPC methylation using an enzymatic protocol. And there essentially getting methylation variation again, so CPG methylation, but also nucleosome positioning as a second readout and thereby accessibility. And that's not three layers in one go, that's just work again. Now, three layers in one go. There's this work again by Stephen Clark and Mulfslag's really been very innovative on the web lab side and developing it. And Henry Carr has been driving the analysis, and he's also later on in driving and leading the brainstorming session. So you can talk to him much more about the analysis and what we've been doing with these types of data. I just want to continue a little bit with this local theme, just one slide, and just say, look, I mean, you can obviously, I'm not sure why this is sort of jumping like this. Sort of jumping like this, it's not what I want to do. I'm really sorry. I'm pressing one button and it jumps three flights. That's disturbing. And so we can okay. I'm trying again. Not sure what I could do here. I'm not sure what I can do here, but it's not doing what it's meant to do. We have a few questions in the chat room. Yeah, maybe you can ask questions and I'll try to reboot my presentation. So share your slides with Kim Ann and we can present them from here if that might. We just need to wait for it to reconnect on. Oh, he froze. I think he completely froze.  Can you hear me now? Yes. Okay. You're reconnecting everything? Let me see whether I can get this thing. Maybe go ahead with your questions. Sorry, I'll try to. So we have a question from Voter who say who. From Voter, who ask for the deep CPG work, how much each source of information contributes to the imputation? That is, how important is cross-cell information versus between locus information? I'll try to share the screen. Okay, that was actually quickly shown. Quickly shown in this figure here where you can see here what happens if you only look at neighborhood correlation, which is what's here called CPG context. And this right model here, this only looks at the DNA sequence, so it's a model that only predicts. DNA sequence, so it's a model that only predicts from DNA sequence methodation changes. And this model here on the left is the full model that uses both information. So it's a bit difficult to say, you know, obviously they're all correlated and interrelated, but there's sort of, there's clearly quite a lot already just by using the DNA sequence alone is already quite predictive, which was perhaps surprising. Okay, do you want to move on to your presentation now? On to your presentation now, or do you want to try again? Is there another question now? One question from Vera on that same topic is on what scale did you define the CPG context? So, what we did at that time is, it's a very good question because, you know, there's a question, what is the nearest CBG site? So, we define it on the scales of the next of Of the next observed CPG sites. So if it was missing, we went to the next one, essentially is to the left 25 and to the right 25, the next observed 25. But the distance was also information. So essentially the model learned at DK that the further away the individual CPGs that are observed, the less they inform. But it's essentially the 25 nearest in both directions. That was the approach we took. All right. Let's move on to your talk and then we will ask the other questions. Great. I really hope it's a bit more stable now. I decoupled my screen and I hope this works now. Great. So yeah, so I mentioned that we can obviously One second, somehow doesn't work. So now I hope it works. So I mentioned this is that the question is how to do this more in general. Once you have three layers, you can obviously do the same game in different contexts. You can correlate now gene accessibility to gene expression or genethylation to expression. So there's different ways to do that. So, there's different ways to do this. And just to say that in general, there's quite a lot of associations available that can be uncovered by such an approach. What's perhaps a bit more interesting, but I'll be brief here, is we can also link within a cell changes at the epigenome level at a particular element to gene expression changes. So, this is slightly different because previously, I'm just maybe going back one slide, you know, the key idea here is. Back one slide, you know, the key idea here is essentially leveraging the variation across cells at a regulatory element to link it to variation in gene expression across cells for a given gene. So it's basically locally one element to locally one gene by exploiting the heterogeneity across cells. When cutopsy slice the matrix the other way around and say we for one cell calculate on average how correlated are, for example, CPG methyl. example CPG methylation in promoters to gene expression where basically this is promoter of gene A, gene expression of gene A, promoter of gene B, gene expression of prime B, and so forth, where they elongate the whole genome and we get one correlation coefficient per cell. So previously we get one correlation per gene, now we get one per cell, if you wish. And that's sort of generalizing bulk data sets. And there are some interesting findings. Mainly this replicates what you expect in bulk, but there are some. You expect in bulk, but there are some changes where basically in different cells with different extents of coupling, if you wish, between different cells, for example, as a function of cell states. I think it's also an interesting way of thinking about how to integrate these two different layers. And within a cell, we can look at correlations along the genome, which is perhaps counterintuitive at first. Now, with the second part of the talk, and this is more what I'm going to talk more extensively about now, is how we can do global integration. And I'm just showing you again this. Integration. And I'm just showing you again this picture here where the goal is to integrate different dimensions of variation to essentially reason upon cell identity and cell states, understanding whether we can identify new subclasses of cells, new cell types, new dynamics of how cell types change by looking at different dimensions. And the approach we've been using extensively is essentially what we're using on the RNA side to define cell type. What we're using on the RNA side to define cell states are latent variable models. So, reducing dimensionality, you know, from observed gene expression into some latent variables, we've been using extensively factor analysis, which is basically a linear dimensional reduction method, where you take your features times sample matrix. So this might be different CPG sites in rows, samples different cells, and even produce this into a smaller set of dimensions of features times factors and factors times samples. And this is the, in this factor times sample space, we essentially compress. Space, we essentially compress the variation into a small number of components or factors that are now reproducing or representing the dimensions of variation that capture the principled axis of variability. For example, in PCA or frac males, slightly different objectives to do this dimensional reduction. Now, we've been working on extending faculty in a different way. Extending factors in a different way. I'm just showing here one graphical representation of MOFA, a model we developed that is called Multi-Omics Fact Analysis. There's sort of two versions of it, and I'm showing here the version two, but just to say there's sort of two papers and highly overlapping people who've been driving this. Ricar, as main author, Bridger has been very involved in Mofa 1 and Danila in the version 2 of Mofa, and Damian Arnold, I forgot here on the slide. Mofa and Damian Arnold, I forgot here on the slides, but as he's been a student who's been very, very engaged in the second version of this model. And what we are doing here is essentially, again, dimensional reduction, but modeling different views or grouping structures between cells. In the first dimension, I want to focus you on these different rows, essentially saying, you know, we do have different matrices where we have from the same cell different. From the same cell, different omics layers observed, for example, DNA methylation, gene expression, DNA accessibility. So, here V1, V, V2 are different types of features from the same cells that originate from different omics layers, from different assays in this specific example. And that's obviously very canonical. What we want to do in the multi-omics example. And the model actually does something else. In addition, it also models variation across different groups. So we can also account. Across different groups. So, we can also account for the fact that cells are not all the same. They're cells of very different types, for example. Group one might be cells in a particular cell type state, group two in another state, and so forth. So, the model can be flexibly used to group your data matrix in different components. It also is very well attuned to modeling missing values. I motivated already earlier why we need these missing values. It uses a fast, stochastic variational inference that comprises on data data to infer these matrices. And the key idea essentially is that we have view specific weight matrices, so one matrix for each of the. Weight matrices, so one matrix for each of these weights, while the latent dimensions are shared across these different views. So the cell state matrix, if you wish, where are these cells in this latent space? They are common and the weights are specific for this different views. Here's a graphical model for those who are interested in the technology and what's underpinning this. I think the key bits here to mention is we only observe these variables. We only observe these variables in the bottom for different views, m and you know, different groups. And these are modeled essentially by the product of latent factors and weights. And these latent factors and weights themselves are described by two types of sparsity. One that models for every factor how relevant the factor is. The model figures out itself, whether we need three, four, five, six, or ten components. And this is sort of pruned away that we don't have to worry too much about. We don't have to worry too much, at least, about how to define these numbers of factors. And then there's a second sparsity component, which basically encourages that many of these entries are actually zero. So that you basically get a new interpretable output and switching things off if they're not relevant. So there's two types of different sparsity. One, switching off all factors, and the other ones setting individual entries to zero. And that's quite important for getting interpolal solutions. And that's done exactly the same way on both these matrices in a symmetric manner. Symmetric manner. What can you use this model for? And I show you some use cases later on, but just to have a bit of a theoretical discussion and more think about the principles and just to really emphasize fact analysis is something that we invented here. This is a very widely used class of models for these types of analysis that we adapted in specific ways here. But essentially, we can now. Here, but essentially, we can now, you know, similar to a screen plot in PCA, we can look for every group view factor combinations. What's the relevance? Typically, we know for every factor how much variance do we explain. You know, the first principle component explains most variance, and then you have the decaying relevance component. But now we essentially get this in a skew-based way. We can look at for every group, you know, which cell group do we explain variance, in which omics modality. And that's very exciting because we can primarily also determine connections between the Determine connections between different omics layers that are coupled by the same latent variables that are connected to one specific biological process that explains variation. I'll show you later on how we can use this to also explore Omics data in a very intuitive manner and gaining insights from these types of models. The second thing you can do is you can obviously look at each factor. This is what I mentioned before: essentially, expecting these weights here. These weights here, and by doing so, we can see which factors have non-zero weights to specific genes, for example, from the transcriptome. And thereby, we can, for example, identify what are the molecular processes or pathways that are associated with factors. You can also do genes to enrichment on these pathways, and for example, figure out that one factor might be connected to cell division, and another one linked to the cell cycle, and the third factor linked to cell differentiation and other components. And finally, And finally, it is also possible to fill in missing values. So you can impute these factors if you wish. The database on these, that's something we don't really do much in practice because we then reduce the analysis to these factors and do operate on those. But if you wish to go back to the raw data, this imputation step might be something to consider. And we can finally also really use these factors to draw inferences. Similar to plotting data in gene one versus gene two space, we can now absolutely visualize our data set in this factor space. Our data set in this factor space and also use these as input, for example, for non-linear methods like TC and others. I have now two brief applications, and I'll try to speed up a little bit to have time for discussion. One talk about groups of cells, and I'm almost skipping this now in the interest of time. But just to say, there are increasing data sets where we don't want to treat cells independently, but there are different groupings. And dimensional cell types is one application. There's another, I think, really exciting application. These are a crystal perturbation. These are crystal perturbation screens. So, with Robert Reich, we have a nice study where we look at activation screens. So, we have cells that carry different guide RNAs that activate one out of 475 targets that correspond to 200 odd target genes. And so, obviously, you don't want to treat cells identical irrespective of the specific perturbation they carry. And here we leverage this to group cells into this different perturbation. To group cells into these different perturbation groups, those cells where we activate a particular gene versus another gene here, for example, represented in colors. And this is a very nice grouping structure. It's not multi-omics, but really site information on the cells that you want to use when doing these inferences. That's exactly what we've done here. So essentially, the views is gene expression. That's actually second views of repeat elements. But the key idea here is that we have different grouping structures. Those cells carrying guide one, guide two, guide three, guide four, and so forth. And then we can use this to actually assess what's the ready. Uses to actually assess what's the regulatory impact of these different perturbations on the level of these factors that we infer because these groups are also represented by all these factors, you know, like individual components and they segregate by different subgroups. And then we can ask, you know, how do these factors change from one perturbation to another perturbation and so forth? And actually, we found that this is much, much more powerful for finding activation targets. And we found quite a number of targets using that way, also novel targets. Way also novel targets, but basically associating changes on the factor level rather than individual genes using this sort of grouping structure and thereby identifying targets. So that's a very brief one. And I want to come now a bit more later and talk more in detail about the main object of study of the hackathon, the practical component. And I think that's a very nice example where we don't carry so much about different types of cells, although that's also a component, but where we focus on different omics layers, different views. Different omics layers, different views. And here the views were RNA expression, DNA methylation, and DNA accessibility from the same cells. And that's a data set that is now also published. And Ricardo really led the analysis. And Stephen, the experimental side, the data generation together with Fisham and Wolf's lab, that considered early stages of mouse development, gastrulation, the first days of life. The first days of July from E4.0, E5.5, 6.7, 7.5. And at all of these stages, we collected cells using this triple omics profiling method I described earlier. So we have access to RNA accessibility, DNA methylation, DNA accessibility, really in the same cells. And you can see in this matrix, these cells separated by stages. And we can then already see, you know, that the transcriptome, these stages are extremely visible because as major cell type transitions. Because there's major cell-type transitions. And, but you know, there's also changes in the methyloman accessibility changes. And obviously, the question is: how do epigenetic changes interlink to these major decisions and lineage formation events that happen at these developmental stages? And I just want to give you a bit of a flavor of what this data looks like. This is visualizing these cells at the transcriptome state. So, this is only RNA using t-SNE, and what's I think very apparent. And what's I think very apparent, and you already saw this before, is this massive changes in the transcriptome across these stages of gene expression variation that we now have available. But I want to now, you know, there's also other things we can do with these. We can back map these cells onto larger reference atlases. So we here use the transcript home essentially of these combined data to map these cells onto a very, very sizable RNA, single-cell RNA-seq-based atlas only. So using the transcript hope. Atlas only, so using the transcriptome as a coordinate system, if you wish, to assign these cells, where are they, in which lineages, sub-lineages, and so forth. I think it was a very exciting and powerful way to integrate these data types. However, I mentioned MOFA, and so that's really what I want to illustrate here. You know, how do we use this multi-omics method to analyze these data? And I think there's one sort of trick that's worth highlighting, and that is to these. And that is to design these views. What is it that we measure on the methyl level? I highlighted before, promoter methylation is often not very regulatory relevant. That's something we already observed in these very small pilot data sets. And so we actually went for other putatively regulatory regions for which we used H3K for trimethylation, active chromatin, and distal enhancer marks. Enhancer marks that we derive from specific lineages, so lineage-specific enhancer marks in the canonical germ layers we expect: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. This work with Roy Z's lab generated the ChIP-seq profiles in sorted populations, long oscillations for these three lineages. And for those, then we can basically tease out methylation in regions, for example, here. Here an enhancer that is specific to ectoderm, yeah, and there are others which might be you know specific to endoderm and mesoderm derived from these chick-see profiles. And then using those, we essentially slice them data into these different views and fed them into MOFAR. And what MOFAR essentially yielded us is six major factors that explain variations. So factor one to six. Factor one to six. We could annotate them with specific processes, and that's mainly done based on the transcriptome. So we essentially ask what are the genes that are associated with the transcriptome view, with the RNA view here, to infer the lineages. So factor one is mesodermal lineages, a second is associated with endodermal lineages, and so forth. And then the other views of the model were basically chromatin accessibility and DNethylation, but then really segregating this by epigenetic state. Epigenetic states associated with these epigenome regions, distal enhancers, HV quadrimethylation marks, and also gene promoters for reference, which I already mentioned is not where the action resides at the epigenetic layers. And the color here indicates basically how much variance does the factor explain in this. And I think what's really exciting to see is, for example, the mesodermal integing factor is mainly associated with mesoderm-specific enhancers, which is really quite exciting. For example, endodermal linking with the endodermal enhancers. Endodomal lining with the endodermal enhancers. And again, promoters really don't play a major role. And what we could actually do with this, this was the major hypothesis generation for us that led to sort of a hierarchical model of how germ layer formation works with the default layer to ectoderm and then segregation in endodermal and mesodermal integers. That was actually mainly motivated just from this sort of MOFA output. And the MOFA didn't model, didn't really know anything about the biology. It's really, I think, a very nice. It's really, I think, a very nice way to generate hypothesis and discover these global cell state linkages in these types of data. And I just want to mention open challenges very briefly. One of them is time and dynamics. I already indicated that this data set is developmental. So obviously we have a huge time component, but MOFAR doesn't know anything about time. I said we can group cells in different groups, but not in a continuous way. And Britra is actually extending MOFAR in a more continuous way. More for in a more continuous way that we can encode time explicitly, and I think it's a very useful way to bring that in. And time is also very important for these local analysis. I talk now a lot about these global analysis, linking cell states together, global methylation transcriptome profiles in identifying cell identity. But also for this local analysis, time is usually interesting. And I just want to show you here, just as meat for thought, almost, maybe also very useful for the hackathon to think about work that Maxis is leading in the lab. Is leading in the lab, and he's basically taking these lineage pseudotymes based on the transcriptome for different lineages that we can derive, you know, not core lineages, gut, mesodermal lineages, and then ask how along these lineages do methylation changes change for individual enhancers. So going back to local single region, single gene associations, and so forth. And I just want to show you these figures. I think it's very, very exciting to see this. Very exciting to see this. You know, that we can see if we look at genomic region, this is from one enhancer for HNF1B. This is essentially the ordering of lineage formation for three lineages here. And here we can see that the methylation undergoes very different local changes and actually quite interesting also non-linear changes that are confined to specific genomic regions. And these regions might actually be quite different across different lineages where methylation changes from no methylation in blue to higher methylation. In blue to higher methylation in red. And here's the case with gains of methylation. You know, here's just another example, I think, of a really exciting developmental enhancer left you to where we have sort of narrower methylation profiles in some lineages and much more broader in others. And I think that's a very, I think, interesting way to look at this almost sort of genomic, temporal, spatial changes by tying these layers together. Okay. And with this, I think I should finish here. I really want to acknowledge the lab mainly. What I talked about. Mainly, what I talked about today is first in the early stages with Professor Angebuller on the DNA methylation, also deep CPG, this type of work together with Stephen Clark and both Reich's lab. And later on, the MOFA models as Brikar, Danila, and Brita. And then I mentioned this very exciting gastrulation study, which is joint work with John Marioni's lab, Wilfreich's lab. And here, really, Stephen Hisham and Hisham and Vita have been the main drivers of putting this together. And with this, I'd like to thank you. Apologies for the technical glitch, and yeah, I'm very happy to take any further questions. Great, thank you, Oliver. So I'm going to start with some questions on MOFA because it's quite fresh in our memory. Susan Holmes is asking, How do you choose the number of factors or components in MOFAR? Yeah, it's a very good question. I mean, we haven't Yeah, it's a very good question. I mean, we haven't solved that problem definitively. I think that's the most important component to say. So what we use is it as a main determinant essentially is to regularize. It's an ARD prior. So essentially, the variance of the weights for every factor have a gamma prior on top that drive the variance explained by factors that are not needed to small values. To small values. This works sort of okay. But what we do in practice is also we then have a threshold and say, you know, factors that explain less than a certain amount of variance. And we disregard. So there's still some choosing, right? In a way, you can either choose number factors or you can choose a regularization parameter. We feel that continuous parameterization, the regularization has some advantages, but it doesn't really solve it. But similar to any other method, you need to determine. Determine somehow how many factors you have and make a choice, which will, depending on the application, one element we see as data sets become larger, we can very reliably identify factors that explain very little variance because things become statistically very stable. But for the analysis I presented here, we essentially used a variance cutoff and I mean, where is this figure? And me, you know, I'm showing you six factors, and I think these six factors are only visualizing these six, which explain these five percent of the variance. So that's the criterion we used to do. It's a very good question. Christian Wells asks, could you expect that the promoter emethylation correlations reflect the progenitor status of the cells exomine, or is the same relationship observed at the other end of a cell lineage tree? Sorry, I need to ask again for this question. I didn't quite grasp it. Christine, do you want to ask your question? Yes. So I guess there might be two reasons that a gene is not expressed. One reason is that it's incapable of being activated because it's in heterochromatin. And the other reason is that it actually hasn't received the signal it needs. Actually, it hasn't received the signal it needs to turn on. And so, if you're just looking at the state not expressed, you're unable to decouple those two reasons that they're not expressed. And I wondered if you, because you're looking at very early in embryonic development, you would expect that most of the genome is in euchromatin and able to be expressed, but the signal to be. The signal to be expressed hasn't been received. As you commit to lineage and then move more and more to a mature state, you see the acquisition of methylation. I think there's a very interesting question. I think, again, I would like to maybe just stress that there is just two ways of two different. Oh, stopped you sharing. I'm cutting your share screen, yeah. Okay, great. Then I have to explain with words. There is a There is two different types of associations we have considered. One essentially in this gastrulation, this later study, you know, where we looked at changes in enhancers globally, you know, across the whole genome, enhanced of a particular type, for example, those which are associated with a particular lineage, to expression of factors that capture the formation of a particular lineage. And that's a global process. And so there we know pinpoint. And so, you know, there we go. We're not pinpointing individual genes. It's more like compartmentalizing genome-by-methylation changes in particular loci, if you wish, or genomic contexts, and similarly doing the transcriptional side and linking these compartmentalized epigenetic variation to the transcriptional changes. So the other question you're posing, if you look at individual genes, is a very good one. It depends on regulatory changes. So these early association analyses I've shown you were in ES cells. So there you've also this cycle of cells. So, there you have also this cycle of cells, you know, exiting pluripotency and other global changes. But on this mouse castellation data set, you haven't shown me actually single gene association. So that's a very good question. I mean, that's an excellent one. I mean, we are at the moment looking at individual single gene regulatory dependencies. So I've shown you this sort of beautiful 2D plot so we can see methylation changes, but that was independent of expression at this point. So, yeah. So yeah. Okay. Aiden is asking how consistent in methylation within topological associating domain topologically associating domain if I could only do HIC or any chromatin structure approach or methylation, which better predicts accessibility of genes? And can one be inferred from the other? I mean, we don't have, I think that. I mean, we don't have, I think that's the honest element at the moment, you know, single-cell high-C or any sort of assay that really looks at path structures and how they change. And there's dramatic changes as well across particular early development. And what we can say is that DNA accessibility and DNA methylation are strongly coupled. They're very, very strongly correlated. And that is very clear. It depends a bit on the assay. On the assay. So, this specific assay leverages GPC and CPG methylation. So, you need to see how many CPG and GPC sites you have, which yields to differential coverage already at this point. So, it depends really a little bit on the question and what you want to do. To say that I've been very positive, surprised almost by the implication of DNA methylation, at least in this developmental context, compared to accessibility. But I wouldn't say that's a genetic. But I wouldn't say that's a generic rule. I think it really depends on the setting. Definitely, accessibility is a very exciting essay as well. I think I don't want to put out a generic statement, but they're closely correlated. That's very clear. And I'm going to just take another last question. I think the MOFA question I can move to the Slack channel. I'm sure Ricard also will be happy to chip in. Sure, Ricard also would be happy to chip in. But this is a question from Genoviev. She asked: Did you look at combinations of histone marks for prime states or just each individually? No combinations at this point. Yeah, no, we have not done that. Yeah, it's it, it's it. Okay, and the last question from Vera is: have you considered long-range chromatin contacts? No, no, we haven't done that either. I mean, I think that'll be. No, we haven't done that either. I mean, I think that would be really exciting if we had promoter high C or something like that, you know, in the relevant states. And I think that would be interesting. So we just look at putative enhancers. Actually, no, we have done some work in ES cells. I think there we used that promoter IC at some point. And we did see that associations in enhancers that are in contact, in physical contact promoters, were more likely to be correlated. But I think we've only done this in the SLs and not really followed up in the context of these later gasolation data sets. Gasolation data sets? That's a great question. Great. Well, thank you again, Oliver, for joining us and being part of this workshop. If you want to stay a little bit more to answer some of the questions on the Slack, that would be great. We're going to have. Great.
