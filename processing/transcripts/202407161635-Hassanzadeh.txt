Our next talk is by Hossein and he's going to be talking about basically jets and viscoplasticity. So I'll just let you start your talk and we're interested in hearing what you have to say. Hello everybody, it's so nice to be here and thanks to organizers for this great workshop. I'm Hussein Hassan Zadeh. Actually I defended my PhD about two weeks ago and now I Weeks ago, and now I'm a postdoc working with Mohamed and Yen. Today, I'm gonna present some insight regarding this question, what happens when a jet meets Piscopalastisk. So, this presentation has four main parts. In the first one, I explain some concepts and also describe our problem, and then show our methodology to tackle this problem. To tackle this problem and summary of our results and finally conclude. So, you all know about the Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, but to have a physical sense, let's see this figure, which is one of my favorite figures, shows the examples of everyday flights ranging from very low viscos to very high viscos. Very high risk of and also one of the main categories of non-Newtonian tools is yield stress or miscoplastic toy, which is characterized by yildecerus. And you can see the range of folloids that has yields and their corresponding rough values for this. So, and due to the characteristics of The characteristics of non-Newtonian fluids, they have been used as a fluid model by several researchers for deformable prosme, such as crushed soil and tailing sediment and also human tissues. So, and also the jet flow can be seen in many industrial applications and also natural phenomena. Natural phenomena, and also the jet flow system usually deal with non-Newtonian fluids. A well-known example is 3D printing technology that relies on injecting non-Newtonian fluids into either Newtonian or non-Newtonian fluids. Another example that all of you may have experienced is the delivery of the drugs into the body, which usually the neotonian fluid is. Newtonian fluid is injected into the non-Newtonian. And also, we can see other examples of jet dealing with non-Newtonian fluid, such as cleaning process, oil and gas, microfluidic device, and even in the nature, such as volcanic eruptions. So, let's see what is our main motivation. We can generally derot a snapshot of the oil and gas lifetime into three stages. First, at the First, at the first stage, naturally cap rock isolates the reservoir from any fluid movement between different layers. In the second stage, we drill the cap rock and the reservoir to extract oil and gas. And finally, we have to seal the reservoir to isolate the reservoir similar to the natural capital. So the PNA has four main steps. Has four main steps, and one of these steps is cleaning the target area, which is usually performed by two methods: mechanical and jetting method. And the effective cleaning can actually lead to enhance the cement quality color and also have a good results. So, this is the schematic of our problem. We can see the jetting tools, and also there is a perforating case. There is a perforating casing here, and also we have a wall here, and etc. There are a lot of parameters that can affect the cleaning process, and you can see some of them here. And there are different forces and effects, such as inertia, buoyancy, and viscose. And mostly two fluids are miscible, and also the ambient fluid has yielded stress. And depending on the distance between the wall and the formation, Between the wall and the formation, we can have a free jet, impinging jet, or combination of between these two jets. And also, based on the forces and effect, we can have at least 10-dimensionless numbers, such as Reynolds, Fruit, Scarfty Ratio, Pinkham, and at least four aspect ratios. So, to be able to comprehensively investigate the effect of Investigate the effect of different parameters on the jet flow system. We employ different actually experimental techniques. Our flow experiments are performed in a transparent rectangular tank. A dark fluid is injected into the ambient flow. And also, we use a mirror to capture the bottom view of the jet. And in addition, note that if the injection flow is heavier than the jet jet, The injection flow is heavier than ambient flow, we have a positively buoyant jet, meaning that momentum and buoyancy acts in the same direction. So, one of our main measurement techniques is a high-speed camera by adding ink into the injection fluid and using image analysis. And also, we use a Pelanar laser-induced fluorescence that we use a laser sheet to have it to obtain concentration profile in. Provide in different cross-sections. In addition, we also employ ultrasonic Doppler velocity metric that finally we can obtain 2D velocity behavior in a specific position. And in this project, we also define another experimental setup by considering a perforated wall because of our Because of our main motivation. And then to gain additional insight, we use time-resolved tomographic particle image velocimetry. You can see the main component of this technique. We use four high-speed camera, laser source, and array of lenses to provide the volume of laser. And also, for example, here you can see the results of analysis of four cameras. Of four cameras and other instruments for foliage purpose. And this slide shows the industrial range and experimental range that we use, and for generalization of our results, we use dimensionless number and also these characteristic scales. So first let's see the general behavior of jet flow system. This is the typical jet flow behavior. Jet flow behavior. We can see there are two different parts: the laminar region and the distributed region. And after the laminar region, the jet breaks down into the breaks down, and then the jet radius starts to increase. And so, based on the image analysis, we can define different forms such as radius, penetration length, and laminar length. Penetration lengths and laminar lengths. This is a concentration field which is a special temporal diagram. The color bar shows the depth average concentration value, which is value 1 represents the pure ambient fluid and value 0 represents the jet fluid, pure jet fluid. So in this region, before the dashed line, we have a laminar length. So because of the minimal mixing that we have here and also the small jet rate. And also the small jet radius, we can see the value of depth average concentration is almost one. This one is the velocity field obtained by UDV in the laminar length region and we can see the boundary of the non-zero velocity and also the value of the velocity, which is the dimensionless velocity, is almost the same as the non- So we define two different regimes. Two different regimes based on the presence and absence of laminar lengths, which is this one is a semi-turbulent regime or with laminar lengths, and this one without laminar lengths or fully tubular regime. And we can see that by increasing the Archimedes number or buoyancy, the critical Reynolds number, which is transition between these two regimes, increases. And also, we propose a correlation for the laminar length based on the Reynolds and Archimedes number by this R square. And you can see the R square, and you can see the results for our experiment. And also, we employ machine learning technique to predict the whole shape of the jet. And for example, by random force algorithm, we could increase the accuracy of predicting the laminar lexus to 0.96. And this one is one example that gray scale is our experiment, and the Xion surface is predicted. Is the predicted shape of the jet. So we actually systematically studied the jet flow behavior, effect of parameters and jet flow behavior. Next, before going to the visco-velastic flow, we studied the effect of viscosity ratio and found that by increasing the viscosity of ambient fluid, we can have a new regime that we named a jellyfish regime. And this one is a you can. And this one is a, you can see the results obtained by the PLAF technique that you can see that over time the radius of the jet almost constant. Here is the radio classification in the plane of Reynolds and Reynolds over viscous ratio. And we propose the transition critical Reynolds number for transition between the regimes. Regimes. So let's see what happens when viscopelastic fluids come to play. Here you can see the experiments that the different flow regimes based on different Reynolds and Bingham number. So we define four different flow regimes. The mixing regime, we can see the obvious perturbation at the boundary of the jet before and after impingement. In the martial regime, we can see the sharp interface. The sharp interface, especially after impingement, and there is this one. This actually sharp interface is the main difference between these two regimes. In the fingering regime, we can see the jet penetrates initially mainly in the longitudinal direction and then expands in all directions here and as several fingers. But in the fractional regime, we can see that. Regime: We can see that here the jet stops before this actually perforated wall that we have, and then because of continuous injection, the jet can penetrate to the second zone and after actually the perforated ball as a fracture. And also, you can see the social temporal diagram for each regime. So, in this slide, you can see the results obtained by PLAF technique. Results obtained by PLOF technique in the actually cross-section at X equal to 22. And we can see here different actually different regime area. For example, in the Martian motion, we can see also the sharp interface that we saw in the previous slide. In terms of the variation of the jet radius versus time, as we can see here, the variation of the See here the variation of the mixing regime radius. We can see the girls rate is relatively very high, but by increasing the Bingham number, we can see that the jet radius decreases and also this time that the jet tries to reach this axial distance increases. So, but there actually seems But there actually seems to be a critical point that the jet, especially in the finger regime, deviates from its initial SO. So we try to use the balance between the jet inertial, local inertial, and the inlet stress to find some value and find some simple relation. And finally, we found LSE or critical lengths can be related to the being hum over Reynolds to Bing hump over Reynolds to power of minus one over four. And here in some figure B, we can see our data point almost follow this balance and we can find the coefficient. And interestingly, in terms of the radium classification, we can see that this value, this only this dimensionless number, helps us to find the transition between these rays. Between these regions. It means that we can use only one dimensionless numbers to control the regions. So let's see the results obtained by the TUMO PIV. In the first row, you can see the 3D iso surface of the velocity for each regime. And we can see by moving from mixing regime to fraction regime, which means that the Bing Hump over Reynolds increases. Increases, the jet velocity behavior deviates from symmetrical behavior. And also, for these three cases, we can see the highest velocity is in the innermost isosurface, and the lowest velocity is in the outermost isosurface. But here, the fraction regime, we cannot find the regular pattern and specific for this region. This second row shows the self-similarity. In the y-axis, we actually use S scale, we escalate the velocity based on the maximum center line velocity, and in the x-axis, we scale y versus x. And in the mixing region, we can see the nice self-similarity for different axial and for different velocity at different axials. Velocity at a different axial distance, but we can see that by moving from mixing to fraction regime, the self-similarity, the velocity behavior deviates from self-similarity. And here is one of examples about the velocity three dot three components of velocity for different regimes. For example, we can see that at same at the same peaks. At the same peaks at the center line of the jet, the value of the average velocity decreases by moving from mixing to fraction. You can see the value, the solid line represents the average value in the x-axis, sorry, in U. And for the V and W, we can see that the average velocity is almost zero for all of the cases. zero for all of the cases. Okay, because our measurement point is at the centerline of the jet. But the interesting thing is that by increasing, by moving from mixing to fraction radium, the fluctuation of the velocity increases. So based on this, we actually calculated flow intermittency and found that which defined based on the fluctuation of kinetic energy over the total kinetic energy, which is the summation. Which is the summation of mean kinetic energy and a fluctuation kinetic energy. You can see that from mixing to fraction regime, the flow intermittency increases. But we know that in the fraction regime, we do not have a turbulence velocity. But based on this case, it seems that the jet actually traps inside the scopelastic fluid and try to escape. And because of that, we have a very large uh fluctuation velocity. Fluctuation velocity. So, at the end of the day, we have larger flow intermittents. So, building on the insights gained from our previous works, we address a different problem, but within the same context, with collaboration with Ian Binson from Cambrie. And in this case, we explore the cleaning of the viscopelastic flow, viscopelastic layer by turbo edits. And you can see that. And you can see different videos here for different cases, neutonia, low yield stellars and high yield stress, from side view, bottom view, and side view that both fluids are transparent. So the first point that we can see is that the jet translates to the layer, tunnels down to the surface, and then a cavity is formed in all of the cases. And also in these cases, that we have this couple acetophyllib. These cases that we have is couplacelope, we can see the instability at the edge of the cavity, and also in terms of this for side view, we can see the jets bring some air as bubbles, several bubbles into the fluids. Another thing is that in terms of the high end ceros fluid, you can see the blister region at the initial stages of the cleaning of the high industrus fluid. Of the cleaning of the high yellow surface that we cannot see in these two cases. So, our aim here is to analyze the cavity form. We define different characteristics such as cleaning radius, the angle between the cavity and the surface, and also the maximum cavity radius, and also the radius of the blister region. So, and we try to develop a simple model to predict. Model to predict these characteristics and find the coefficient based on our fitting data. So here, for example, we can see that for cleaning radius, we can find that this one is a function of T power of 0.2. And here we found that by increasing the ligar thickness and also from neotonia to viscopelastic to high-yield cerosfloids, the coefficient. Floids, the coefficient decreases, meaning that the cleaning becomes more challenging. For the maximum cavity radius, we have found this relation and also we found that the variation of the maximum cavity radius is almost the same as the blister region radius. And also, for this case, we found that by increasing the both layer tickets. Layer thickness and also the yield stress, we can see the omega decreases. And also, for the alpha, the blue data shows the experimental, the direct visualization, experimental data, and the yellow one represents our model, and also the pink one represents the previous model. And also, we have And also we have found that by increasing the layer thickness, the alpha decreases and also from neotonium to viscoplastic flow, the alpha decreases. So as I mentioned in the presentation, we studied buoyant jet flow into the Newtonian and non-Newtonian ambient flow with the specific motivation Piane of oil and gas well. Gas well, we try to identify and quantify different flow regimes and transition. And finally, we found that the increasing the Reynolds number or decreasing the buoyancy leads to decrease the laminar lengths. And also we found a new regime in terms of when we use a high-viscose ambient floor. And in terms of non-Newtonian ambient flow, we found that the center line velocity decreases and the jet flow behavior, the VSO. The geoto behavior de Viennesfalun self-similarity, and we found the critical penetration length based on only one dimensionless number. And also by increasing the yield stress, the layer resistance enhances and also leads to a reduction of killing rate. So not every failed experiment actually is pointless. Is pointless. This little guy actually winking at us may suggest a possible future direction. Thank you. Any questions for the speaker? Yes. What is it? I think, as I said, this is failed experiments. You can't see?
