And so I really appreciate the invitation. And this is a great crowd. I'm happy to be here. Thanks. So I'm going to talk about intermediate sub-algebras for reduced cross-products of discrete groups. And I'll tell you what I mean by that. I should have said that this is joint work with my former PhD student, Dan Ursu, who is now postdoc at Minster. And so the big problem that we want to consider is you have an inclusion, and say A is included in C to C star algebras, and we sort of take for granted. C-star algebras, and we sort of take for granted that we understand some things about A and C. And what we'd like to know is what possible C star algebras can I fit in between. And so we call these intermediate C star algebras for the inclusion of A and B, or A and C rather. And there's a lot of really interesting questions you could ask here. And this is a basically this problem is way too hard the way that I just stated it. For example, it contains all of subfactor theory. All of subfactor theory. So probably we should scale this back a little bit. And the way that I'm going to scale it back is I'm going to restrict my attention to inclusions. I'm going to start with a group action on a C-star algebra A. And I'm going to consider the inclusion. So there's a, I'll just remind you, I'm sure everyone has seen this, but I'm going to consider the reduced cost product with respect to this action. So this is a C-star algebra. So this is a C-star algebra. It's generated by a copy of A and a copy of the regular representation of gamma. Gamma is my group. So that the action is covariant in the sense that the unitaries implement the action that we started with. So the problem that I want to restrict my attention to is: can we classify the intermediate C-star algebra for the inclusion of A inside of this reduced cross-product? So just by construction, A naturally embeds in here, and we wanted. Embeds in here, and we want to know what b's can we get in between these two algebras. And let me just give you one quick example. So if I take a subgroup, say lambda of gamma, then I can take the reduced cross product with the restricted action of alpha. So I just simply forget about the elements that aren't in lambda for a minute. And this naturally embeds into the reduced cross product with gamma. So it gives us an intermediate subalgebra. So, it gives us an intermediate subalgebra. And so, this is one possible answer to this question. This is one example of an intermediate C-star algebra. So, I'm going to talk about more complicated examples. And I'm going to do this. It turns out that partial actions arise very naturally in this context. So, I'll remind you what a partial action is. And I'm going to steal Larissa's description by simply saying, By simply saying basically, these axioms tell you that when it makes sense to compose to, say, alpha G and alpha H, then alpha G, alpha H is just alpha G H. That's basically how you can interpret these. Now, whenever I have, so I'm going to say, I should back up just a second. So I'm starting with. Just a second. So I'm starting with an action of gamma on A. I'm considering a partial action, but I want my partial action to have a little bit more structure. Namely, I want to have a set of ideals, let's say IG, and A, so that if I restrict to these ideals, I get the partial action. So I call this a partial sub-action because I started with this global action and then just restricted down. So I'm going to restrict my attention to. So, I'm going to restrict my attention to partial actions that come from these sort of given global actions. And when I have such a partial sub-action, then I can consider the reduced cross product of the partial sub-action, which I'm going to take this as the definition. The actual definition is a little bit different, and it's not so hard to prove that this is equivalent. But basically, what I do is I just take the span of these elements inside of my reduced cross product with the global action. Reduced cost product of the global action, and this gives me an intermediate C-star algebra. So, of course, I can't do this arbitrarily. I need the action to be compatible with the set of ideals, IG. So, it may not be the case that I'm able to do this, but when I am able to do this, then I get an intermediate subalgebra. And we have a, so in my paper with Dan, we have a short argument that uses a result of Quig and Rayburn, which is a generalization. Of Quigg and Rayburn, which is a generalization of Landstatt's duality theorem, which basically tells you when you're inside of a reduced cross product. And so we can use this result to show that this algebra is actually isomorphic to the usual definition of a reduced cross product of a partial action. You can do it in other ways too, but I fought with Dan, and this was the proof that we included. So not every intermediate sub-algebra has to be of this, what I would consider nice form. What I would consider nice form, where it's a reduced cross product by partial action or partial sub-action. So, I'm going to give you one example of this. So, let's start with an abelian group acting on a commutative C-star algebra. Then, and actually I want the action to be trivial so that the reduced cross-product is actually isomorphic to the tensor product of C of X with the continuous functions on the dual group. So, we can think of this as continuous functions from the dual group to X. Group to X and then I take a closed subset of my dual group, which has the property that the closed subset and its complement have non-empty interior. And that gives me an ideal that I'm going to call if. This works just like continuous functions where ideals correspond to open subsets or equivalently closed subsets by taking complements. And then I can consider the algebra C of X plus the ideal IF. And this is actually a proper intermediate. And this is actually a proper intermediate C-star algebra for this inclusion of C of X in the reduced cross product. And it's not difficult to show this, but it's not the reduced cross product of a partial sub-action. And this may seem like a very special example because, of course, I started with the trivial action. I have an abelian group, but actually, it turns out that this construction is fairly general. It turns out that whenever I have a partial action and I satisfy a few sort of mild constraints, then I can. Mild constraints, then I can pass to invariant ideals, so ideals that are invariant for the action, and then I can pass to abelian subgroups acting trivially on the quotient by this ideal. And then I can do this construction to get an intermediate sub-algebra in this quotient for this subgroup. But then I can just pull everything back, and that will actually give me a non-trivial intermediate sub-algebra for the thing that I started with. So, this idea actually is pretty powerful. Actually, it is pretty powerful if you're interested in constructing exotic sub-algebra, intermediate sub-algebras. But I claim that, so you could say, well, this is not a partial action, but there actually seems to be some kind of structure here. So you can imagine maybe there's some kind of a description that you could give of these things, a little bit more general than partial actions. But I claim that things can get way worse than this. So let me give you a. If you took the three-point associated The group point associated to this. And are you just saying you're restricting to a subset of the unit space since it's not invariant? And getting yourself a group point subalgebra that way? Yeah, I think that's exactly equivalent to what I'm doing right here. And that actually reminds me, I should mention, I'm going to mention Adam and David Sarah's work a little bit later, and John. So this is a sort of reasonably nice, what I consider to be wild intermediate subalgebra. Let me just At sub-algebra. Let me just give you one example to show you that things can get way worse. Alright, so the credit for this horrendous example goes to Dan. He went away and came back with this thing. I'm not even going to try to describe it all to you, but basically, you start with a group satisfying certain conditions. You suppose that you have a point. So it's acting on a commutative C-star algebra, and you suppose you have a point in X where this In X, where the stabilizer has order exactly 2. And as soon as you have that, then you can do this construction. So it's actually fairly general. You take some open subset satisfying appropriate conditions. You can always find such a subset that's not hard to see. And then you take your algebra B to be this span where you've got these functions in C of X satisfying all these constraints. This is a proper intermediate C-star algebra. These constraints. These constraints are loose enough because they depend, for example, on some choice of an open subset. So these constraints are loose enough that there doesn't really seem to be any structure at all to this kind of thing. And it's an intermediate sub-algebra. It's not a partial, not coming from a partial sub-action. It's just not very nice. Okay, so let's revise the problem then. When is it the case that every intermediate C-star algebra for the inclusion of algebra for the inclusion of A in its reduced cross product by gamma is what we would consider tame. And my definition of TAME is that the reduced cross product, it's the reduced cross product by partial sub-action of alpha. And equivalently, I'm asking really, when is there a Galois correspondence between intermediate C-star algebras and partial sub-actions? And so there are some results that are known. That are known. So, the theorem by Cameron Smith in 2019 considers the case when A is simple. And in the simple case, if you think about your partial action, you remember partial action is defined by restricting to ideals. If you're simple, there are no non-trivial ideals. And the only possible thing that you can do is you can restrict to subgroups. And I'll give you the partial sub-action description of this. So basically, I've got A, and I've got gamma acting on A. Gamma acting on A, and I've got, let's say, lambda and gamma. And what I do is I just simply set my ideals to be Ig is A, G is in my subgroup, and Ig is equal to zero otherwise. And then the reduced cross product by this partial subaction will be the cross product by my subgroup. So this has a partial action description. Description. And so Cameron and Smith showed that if you're simple and the action is outer, which means not inner, so it's not implemented by a unitary, then every intermediate C-star algebra comes from some subgroup and has this description. And in the sort of completely opposite direction, so far from simple, commutative, so Brown, Excel, Fuller, Pitts, Resnikov, all but one of the authors is actually in the audience. So, all but one of the authors is actually in the audience. So, they completely dealt with the commutative case. They showed that if the action of gamma on X is free, and gamma has the approximation property, which I'll say something about in a second, then every intermediate seester algebra is tame in the sense that it's the reduced cross product by partial subaction. Now, actually, Adam talked about this result yesterday, and you may recall their results are actually a lot more general than this because they proved this result for group one. Than this because they proved this result for group widths. This is me specializing to the case of a transformation group what. And I'll say something now about the approximation property. So this is something that's just necessary. You really can't get away from this. And the reason is because essentially by definition, the approximation property is saying that everything can be written or approximated in a reasonable way from its Fourier coefficients inside the reduced press property. Fourier coefficients inside the reduced press product. And if it fails, if you don't have the approximation property, then essentially by definition, you get some really bizarre intermediate sub-outsports that tell you that you're not going to get some kind of a result like this. In general, at least. Luckily, though, the class of groups with the approximation property is quite big. It includes, for example, weakly amenable groups, which means all amenable groups, and in particular, finite groups. Groups and also all hyperbolic groups. So there's a big supply of groups for which we have AP. So in the von Neumann setting, there's some results. This is actually where this kind of industry started. So the first result, so basically they have a complete answer to this question that I asked in the von Reummen setting. The first result by Choda was for the case when M is a factor. Was for the case when M is a factor and has some additional stuff with some additional properties. Izumi, Longo, Popa, they removed all those assumptions for the case of any factor. And then Cameron and Smith proved the general case in 2015. So there, the condition is that the action is properly outer. And actually, in the von Neumann setting, there's no controversy about what you should say to it. What you should say there. So, in the C-star setting, I'm going to allude to this in a minute, but there's about 15 different choices of generalizations of the notion of freeness in the commutative setting. In the von Neumann setting, there's only one good choice. So this is sort of the expected answer to this question. And it strongly suggests that in the C-star setting, we're going to need something, some analog of proper outerness here to get a result. A proper outerness here to get a result along these lines. I'll just quickly remind you: Cameron and Smith, their assumption was outerness. So we need some replacement for proper outerness. Proper outerness in the C-star setting is really the analog of topological freeness. So, topological freeness tells you that your fixed point sets are small topologically, meaning, for example, that they're meager. In the measurable setting, freeness should mean that it's small and measured. But if you think back to this result of Adam and David and Sarah and Jonathan, probably I guess somebody, so their condition is freeness, which means there's no fixed points, and no non-trivial fixed points. That's not really a topological notion, and so there have been. And so there have been a number of attempts. I mean, when you start doing dynamics in non-committed diseases algebras, the first issue you realize you have is that there's no good notion of a point. So what should you mean by not having any non-trivial fixed points? So there have been a bunch of attempts to try to come up with the right definition, and they all have different applications, and they're useful for different things, but it's a very complicated situation. Sometimes they're equivalent in the separable setting, but not in a non-separable. Equivalent in the separable setting, but not in a non-separable setting. We need something different here. And I should also say for simple C-star algebra like von Neumann algebra, this sort of cluster of definitions collapses, and most of them are equivalent to outerness. So this situation is quite different in the general non-commutative setting. So here's the definition that we came up with, and I'll try to motivate it a little bit along the way. So we call an action residually properly outer. So, we call an action residually properly outer for every element in your group. And then every ideal which is invariant under that single element, the induced star automorphism on the quotient, because being invariant you get such a thing. You want that to be properly outer. And this is motivated by the following fact. If I have an action on a, let's say by an automorphism on a compact space, then that automorphism is free, meaning it. Automorphism is free, meaning it has no non-trivial fixed points, if and only if every quotient by an invariant open subset, sorry to say every restriction to a closed invariant subset is topologically free. You can check this. So this is trying to write down freeness in terms of topological freeness, essentially, because topological freeness just works much better in the C-star setting because it's a topological. Better in the C-star setting because it's a topological notion. This is what I just said. All right, so here, using this definition, are some new results by myself and Dan. So if gamma has the approximation property, in either the order of gamma is 2, this is actually the Adam mentioned this yesterday. There's this distinction between, I forget exactly what the group weight condition was, but in the I forget exactly what the group weight condition was, but in the group condition, it's just that the order of the group is 2. If the order of the group is not 2, then you need to assume you have residual proper outerness. Then every intermediate C-star algebra for this inclusion is tame in the sense that it's a reduced cross product by partial subaction. And we felt after we proved this that we really needed to justify the use of this notion of freeness because you could imagine that you use. You could imagine that you use a notion of freeness that's so strong that the first result just sort of follows trivially. So, we needed, we felt anyways, that we needed to provide some justification. And we were able to do that, but basically the converse of this result almost always holds. If the order of the group is greater than or equal to three, so you're not in this situation, and you're not residually properly outer, and then there's this. And then there's this condition here: this rigid stabilizer. You can think of this as sort of the right notion of a stabilizer for a group action that fails this residual property, autonomous property. Then you always have some wild intermediate sub-algebra that's not a reduced cross-product. And so the only case that's left here is really, well, there are a couple of cases left, but it really is the case when you've got a stabilizer of order 2. Order two. And we can show that actually in any place where this theorem doesn't hold, there are examples showing that it can't hold. So it's about as good as you can hope for in this context. And I'm going to, very quickly, I want to sort of motivate some of the, Dora, I'm not going to prove anything, but I'm going to mention at least a couple of techniques because I want to try to advertise them to you. Because I want to try to advertise them to you as being potentially useful. So, the first idea came from the theory of C-Star simplicity and then, more generally, the stuff that, for example, Dan and Camilla and Larsa and I have been doing with reduced cost products. We have this set of tools now that we've developed, which essentially relates the dynamics of a group action on a C-star algebra to the dynamics of the action on some kind of a non-commutative boundary. C-star algebra. Computed a boundary, C-star algebraic boundary. And this is a really powerful tool for, for example, for examining the ideal structure of C-star algebras with some kind of dynamics. We've sort of demonstrated that, but actually, I think these tools are much more general than that and probably should have lots of applications. And these ideas really went into the results that I just mentioned. And in particular, this notion of residual proper outerness, the reason it's so useful here is because you So, useful here is because you can see proper outerness of an action on the injective envelope. So, every automorphism on the C-star algebra has a unique extension to the injective envelope. And in the injective envelope, you have a decomposition theory that's very reminiscent to what you would have for von Neumann algebra. And in particular, every action on a C-star algebra decomposes on its injective envelope into an inner part and an outer part. And that allows us to use this residual proper outdoor property combined. Residual proper outdoorness property combined with these boundary theoretic techniques, and to really get at the structure of the algebra. And the other thing here that I think is quite novel, actually, is, and this is my other thing that I like to push on people, is we made heavy use here of non-commutative convexity or C-star convexity. One of the main things that you need to do if you have an intermediate sub-algebra and you want to show that it comes from one of these partial It comes from one of these partial reduced cross products. So I take B and my intermediate subalgebra and I write it as a Fourier series, say BG lambda G. And what I need to show is I need to show that for each coefficient, this thing actually lives inside of B so that I can decompose my elements. This is the key step in our results. And the way that we do that, And the way that we do that is we actually show that you can average any element b to any coefficient that looks like this using c star convex combinations where the elements in your c star convex combination, so this is like a convex combination, except that instead of scalar coefficients, you have c star coefficients, and those elements need to come from the intermediate c stars with b. And what we did is we proved a separation theorem that says that if the element here is That says that if the element here is not in the C-star convex combinations, in the set of all C-star convex combinations, you get a very strong condition. You get a map, you get a bimodule, and this really tells you that you're, we use this to show that you have to violate this condition of residual proper LRMS. And I will stop here. Thank you. Three
