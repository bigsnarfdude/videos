So please, Anna, the floor is yours. Thank you. In this talk, I'm going to present a result concerning the barotropic navistoke system, which describes the motion of a compressible viscous fluid. We assume it is driven by time-periodic inflow-outflow boundary conditions, and we investigate the existence of a solution. The existence of a solution in the class of weak solutions satisfying the energy inequality. Time-periodic interactions are frequently observed in many applications of the fluid dynamics, like the modeling of the blood flow. And for this reason, it is of interest to investigate time-periodic flows subject to time-periodic data. Time periodic data are material. Time periodic data are mathematically functions such that their value at time t plus capital T, if capital T is the period, their value at this time is the same that at time t for every t. And this is equivalent to let the time vary in the time periodic domain or the interval 0t where the points 0 and t coincide. Under this assumption on the data, This assumption on the data, one can expect that the flows exhibit the same period than the data. The analysis of the time-periodic navy stock system was initiated by Sarin for the incompressible case. He developed a formal method to identify a time-periodic solution as a limit of the solution to the initial value problem subject to Value problem subject to a time periodic force. This result is formal in the sense that the regularity needed is still not known. And the first concrete examples of time periodic flows for the incompressible Navier-Stock system were due to Prodi and Judovich, who considered the Poincaré map, which takes the initial value into the state corresponding to the solution of the initial value problem. Solution of the initial value problem evaluated at the time t. And then a time-periodic solution can be obtained via a fixed-point argument. These two methods were employed by many authors who proved the time periodic flows in different situations. And of particular interest is the result due to Prouse, who adapted to the time period. Who adapted to the time periodic setting the method developed by OPS. And here are displayed other references in the case of strong solutions with the assumption of smallness of the data when the boundary is moving or in the case of an exterior domain which is the complement of a compact set. Let us now consider for a moment the case of the nonlinear viscous. moment the case of the nonlinear viscosity. So we assume that the relation between the viscous stress tensor and the symmetric velocity gradient is of this polynomial type. And I'm again talking of the incompressible case. And note that when q is equal to 2, we obtain the Newton's rheological law. In this case of nonlinear viscosity the corresponding The corresponding system describes many non-Newtonian phenomena. And the first examples of time periodic flows are Duty Leons, who consider the case Q bigger than 3 and S depending on the full gradient instead of its symmetric part. And there are other partial results, and I also contributed to this topic presently. And I considered the case Q in the interval 6. Q in the interval 6 over 5 plus infinity. And I proved the existence of time-periodic incompressible flows in this case of non-linear viscosity. And note that this bound for the exponent Q is the same that for the existence of weak solutions to the initial value problem. And as we saw yesterday in a talk, below this critical exponent, only Exponent only generalized dissipative solutions are available, which were introduced by Faraisel and myself recently. So far, all dimensional results considered the models of incompressible viscous flows. However, similar problems for time periodic motions were considered by these authors. And of particular interest is the Particular interest is the result due to Ferrazel, Mooka, Novotny, and Pokorny, who considered the Navier-Stokes Fourier system and constructed a time-periodic solution working directly in the time-periodic domain. So far, all the results mentioned consider the time-periodic equation as an evolutionary system of partial differential equations. More partial differential equations where the right-hand side is a time-periodic function. And in most cases, the no-slip condition is preferred to avoid the boundary terms, despite the interaction of the fluid with the outer world is incorporated in the boundary conditions. So we consider the more physically realistic scenario of inhomogeneous boundary conditions. Boundary conditions, and we consider a compressible viscous fluid. So, our system of partial differential equations is made of the equation of continuity and the balance of momentum. The variables are the density ρ and the velocity u. The pressure is a given function of the density, and the viscous stress tensor S is related to the gradient through the Newton's theological law. Law. We prescribe inhomogeneous boundary conditions in the sense that we prescribe the velocity on the boundary UB and accordingly we prescribe density on the inflow part of the boundary of the domain, which is a subset of the time space cylinder. And it is defined through the relation that the scalar product of the boundary velocity and outer normal vector. And the outer normal vector is negative. We assume that the data are periodic in time. So the external force G, the boundary velocity UB and the density on the inflow part of the boundary domain are time periodic. And we investigate the existence of a corresponding solution which is periodic in time. What is known concerning the initial and Concerning the initial and the boundary value problem for a compressible viscous fluid with inhomogeneous data, it is known the existence of local in time strong solutions and it is also known the existence of long time weak solutions for large data but independent of the time due to Chang, Jin and Novotny. Our aim is to construct a time-periodic solution. So our Solution. So, our main tool is the energy balance. If one has a smooth solution, it satisfies the energy balance in this sense. And note that here, capital P is the pressure potential related to the pressure through this expression. In order to exhibit a time-periodic solution, we want to compress the right-hand side into the dissipation table. Into the dissipation term on the left-hand side. And it comes out that the main difficulty is the convective term in blue. Due to the presence of the density rho, this term might be uncontrollable. And note that in the case of the no-slip condition, we would not have this term since UB would be zero. So we decide to consider the hard sphere pressure. The hard sphere pressure equation of state, which describes real fluids. And it means that the density is confined to the range zero rho bar. And the pressure is a non-decreasing function of the density and becomes singular when the density approaches this value rho bar. We also assume this growth condition on the pressure in order to have. In order to have a uniform estimate for the pressure, this type of equation of state excludes the isentropic flows. And the existence theory for the evolutionary problem in three dimensions, as far as I know, has to be developed. There are results in two dimensions and in the steady case. We consider an approximation scheme similar to Chang, Jin, and Novotny, used to prove the existence of weak solutions to this problem for the initial value problem, but for the isentropic flows. So, in our case, we introduce a parabolic approximation in the equation of continuity, and note that for given And note that for given U, this is a linear parabolic problem. So we can consider that the density is a given function of the velocity. Then we replace the momentum equation with the Fido-Galerkin approximation. And to this aim, we introduce finite dimensional subspaces over two. And we look for the velocity in this form, V plus UB, with V in the finite dimensional space. With the V in the finite dimensional space. So we incorporate the homogeneous boundary data in the first step of the approximation. In the approximate momentum equation, we introduce the approximation of the pressure, which is of the type the original pressure plus a power of the density. And we introduce other terms according to the parabolic approximation. Parabolic approximation of the equation of continuity. And capital lambda over rho is a term which depend on the positive part of the function rho bar minus rho. And we need in order to control the terms to have the time periodic solution. For the approximate system, this is the system, this is the energy inequality. And this is the main tool to prove the existence of a time periodic approximate solution. Note that the brown terms are non-negative, since the pressure potential is a convex function. The green terms depend on the data, so we can manipulate them. And we need to control also the convective term in blue. So, if rho is smaller than rho bar, choosing properly the extension of UB inside the domain omega and using the Cornel-Poin-Carray inequality and the RD-SOBELF inequality, we can control this term with the dissipation term s multiplied by the gradient of V. When rho is bigger than rho bar, then we can send this term into capital lambda of rho modulus. Lambda over modulus of V square. So these are the tools used to manipulate the approximate energy inequality. And at this point, we can define the Poincaré mapping, which sends the initial value into the state evaluated at the time capital T. Thanks to the energy inequality manipulated, as I showed you, and thanks to the Showed you, and thanks to the fact that we are in a finite-dimensional space, and thanks to the parabolic regularity theory for the equation of for the approximated equation of continuity, all the assumptions of the Schauder fixed point theorem are fulfilled. And so we obtain a time-periodic approximating solution. Now we need to discuss the limit in the approximation. First, in the Galerkin approximation, First in the Galerkin approximation, and this is now understood. Then in the parabolic approximation of the equation of continuity, and finally in the approximation of the pressure. And this is rather delicate. We derive an estimate for the pressure thanks to the energy inequality in L1. And then, in order to obtain the weak convergence of the pressure, we need Convergence of the pressure, we need the renormalized continuity equation with the inhomogeneous boundary data. Then, in order to identify the limit of the pressure, we prove the compactness of the density and we make use of the Lyons identity. And finally, we obtain rho and U, which are time periodic and they belong to this regularity class. This regularity class and the equation of continuity is satisfied in this weak sense. The momentum equation is satisfied also in a weak sense, and this is the energy balance. So, let me conclude. We consider a bounded domain of class C3 to avoid the technicalities. We consider the earth sphere pressure equation of state and we assume. and we assume the growth condition, a growth condition where we are near the value rho bar with the exponent beta bigger or equal than 3. This is needed in order to manipulate, to have an estimate for the pressure. We choose the initial boundary velocity UB to be of this type. So it can be split in two components. One, it's a curl of a vector. So, it's a curl of a vector-valued function. And another component has a symmetric gradient, a positively semi-definite matrix. And the infimum of the divergence of VB on a subset of omega is positive. We fix the density rho B on the inflow part of the boundary to be a C1 function, the external force in L infinity, and we show the existence of a time-periodic. Existence of a time-periodic weak solution in the sense showed before. It remains only to thank you very much for your attention. Okay, let's thank Anna for her very clear and
