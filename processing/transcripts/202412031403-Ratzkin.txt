The other organizers for the invitation to come here. This has been a very enlightening conference. I've enjoyed a lot. What I'm going to tell you about is joint work with Hayes Acaju, who is at the University of Chile, and Amias Losantos, who is at the University of Sequipe in Brazil. And so here's a very brief table of contents. Table of contexts. I'm going to introduce the problem and state some theorems. I'm going to tell you about Delaney solutions. These are special model solutions, and I'm going to tell you about sort of the asymptotics. There's some linear analysis, there's some non-linear analysis, and there's a symplectic structure I'm going to tell you about in the end. I may mix some of these orders up because I think really there are some interesting points I want to get to. Interesting points I want to get to in the nonlinear analysis in the symplectic structure. Some novel features, I think. And the other thing I should mention is that a lot of this work is based on, there's a corresponding results for scalar curvature. Scalar curvature. And this was work of Matzo, Pollock, and Mulebeck. From sometime around 1995, I think that's the correct year. Thereabouts, this is Braille Woman. This is a fairly well-written paper, so maybe some of you are a little bit familiar with it. But a lot of the ideas I'm going to talk about are actually, all the ideas I'm going to talk about actually come from that paper. Is that the singular problem? Yeah. Alright, so here's the statement of the problem. We're going to look at the panse operator, which you've seen a couple of times before. This has a This has a very long formula attached to it, but the important things I want you to take from this formula are just that a fourth-order operator, the leading order term, is the square of the Laplace Veltromi. There is an associated curvature quantity, which is written down here. And the important thing about the penance operator is that it satisfies Veroni's transformation law, which is here, which says that if I do a conformal change. Says that if I do a conformal change of my metric, then the operator transforms very nicely. This exponent here, if you're not familiar with it, this looks, oh, that's a typo. That should be a 4, not a 2. Sorry. This exponent here looks a little bit funny when you first see it, but it's cosmetic really. If you choose a different exponent, you'll get just a slightly more complicated transformation. More complicated transformation rule with extra gradient terms and so on. So, anyways, one thing this tells you is that if you do a conformal change of metric, the Q curvature itself transforms according to this very nice rule. You get this by plugging in phi is equal to 1 into the previous transformation rule. So, if I set phi, if I set the Q curvature equal to this particular constant, there's nothing very magical about this constant. This is just the value of Just the value of the Q curvature you obtain for the standard round metric on the sphere. So if I normalize the Q curvature to be that of the round sphere, you obtain this very nice fourth order elliptic PD. So we're interested in solutions of this PD. And this whole setup is meant to mimic, is meant to be a fourth-order analog of the classical Yamatoic. Analog of the classical Yamave problem. In the case where the background metric is the round metric on the sphere, the paths operator factors very nicely. So you might think, this is great. I have an operator that factors into a product of second-order operators, so I might be able to do some sort of nice iteration. And unfortunately, the conformal The conformal invariance throws a big wrench into the works. And the reason this conformal invariance throws a big wrench into the works is that the conformal group is not compact. This is something we've actually seen a couple of times over the last several days. And in particular, you can pull back by a sequence of conformal dilations, and you can pull back any solution. And you can pull back any solution by a sequence of performal dilations, and then you obtain a sequence of solutions that these elements didn't mean norms go to plus or fifty. This is, by now, a very well-established fact. And this motivates the formulation of a singular Yamabe problem. And the singular Yamabe problem says: if I'm given a closed subset lambda inside the sphere, does there exist a conformal metric that is complete on the sphere? Conformal metric that is complete on the sphere minus this lambda with constant Q curvature. So, this is the problem we're going to look at. And we're going to actually specialize even more. I'm going to say that the, okay, so in terms of solving a boundary value problem, I can rephrase this geometric problem in terms of solving its boundary value problem. I'm looking for a positive function on the complement of my singular set. It satisfies a It satisfies a PDE, and I have this boundary condition here, which says that the liminth as I approach the singular set is plus infinity. I can use stereographic projection to transfer to Euclidean space, and then if I do that, I obtain this nice PDE at the same sort of boundary function. So, just a quick word on the notation. Just a quick word on the notation. It's often for this problem very useful to transfer between the spherical gauge and the Euclidean gauge. And I'll try to draw some pictures later on illustrating this. There's a third gauge we'll talk about later on, which is called the cylindrical gauge. So it's useful in the end to transfer to all three of these gauges and work in all three of these gauges sort of. And work in all three of these gauges sort of simultaneously. I'm going to adopt the convention that when the conformal factor is capitalized, it's with respect to the spherical gauge. And when the conformal factor is lowercase, it's going to be in the Euclidean gauge, and the two are related here. That's just a notational convenience. All right, so we're going to discuss. We're going to discuss really the case that this singular set is a finite collection of points. Maybe a brief comment on some of this. A brief comment is that it seems like in some sense, the case that you have, the singular says, find a collection of points, should be the easiest. The easiest one to think about. And in practice, at least for the scalar curvature setting, this was not the case. This turned out to be the more difficult case to understand in many ways. And the reason has to do with basically the moduli space of solution. The moduli space of solutions when the singular set has higher dimension is infinite dimensional, so you have a lot of flexibility in trying to solve that problem. And when you have only finitely many points, you'll see that actually the moduli space is a finite dimensional space, so it's a much more rigid problem. And the intuition you have is that if you're removing something like a k-di-di-di-di-di A k-dimensional equatorial sphere in your sphere, then you can perturb that equatorial sphere by an arbitrarily small function, by some arbitrary small function, and then you can solve. So this gives you, because you have, you're perturbing along this positive dimensional singular set, you have this infinite-dimensional family of solutions. The problem is actually a lot more flexible when you have a higher dimensional singular. When you have a higher-dimensional singular set, when you have a zero-dimensional set, it's just a collection of points, it's a little bit more difficult to construct these solutions. Right. There are two moduli spaces I want to define associated to this problem. The first is what I will call the marked moduli space. This is where I actually Space. This is where I actually specify the position of the punctures. And the second is what I'll call the unmarked moduli space. This is where I allow the punctures to move around. Just that the cardinality of the set of punctures should be k. Right. I can place the Grummoff-Hausdorff topology. The Gromoff-Hausdorff topology on both of these moduli spaces, that's not too important for today. Okay, so here are some results. If the number of singular points is at least three, then this marked moduli space is a real analytic variety of. A real analytic variety of formal dimension k. As is usually the case, if you assume some sort of non-degeneracy, then you get a better result. In the non-degenerate case, there is a neighborhood of your metric such that this neighborhood is a smooth manifold of dimension k. So I'll actually sketch out the, I'll sketch out the proof of this theorem, and then this theorem is Theorem is follows from the same technique after Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction. The non-degeneracy condition, this operator I'm writing down here, is the linearization of this constant Q-curvature equation. So what is this saying, this is saying that I have no Jacobi fields, no functions that preserve the Q curvature to first order. To first order that are in L2. And this L2 is with respect to the metric G. Right. So this is some set of theorems. The other thing I want to tell you about is this result, this says that there's a natural 2K-dimensional parameter space, and we're going to see those parameters very explicitly in a couple of minutes. Um and this parameter space carries a symplectic structure, which we will construct. And if I have a non-degenerate metric, then there's a neighborhood of that metric in the moduli space that embeds into this parameter. This parameter space W. Later, we'll call this parameter space the deficiency space. So there's a neighborhood that embeds into the deficiency space as a Lagrangian submanifold. So there's something sort of that seems a little bit mysterious. We have two K parameters. You have K punctures. If you have three punctures, then you have six parameters to play with. Parameters to play with, but only half those parameters actually parametrize the moduli space, and the other half are sort of orthogonal in a way. Right. Okay. Those are all the theorems that we're going to talk about today. Okay. Today. Okay, it's good to describe just some models, have some models in your head. So, the first model you have in your head is, of course, the round sphere, where you do not have any punctures. The round sphere we all know about. You might ask yourself, is there a solution with only one puncture? And in fact, there is not. There are no solutions with just one puncture. The next simplest thing you can look for are the twice-punctures, are the solutions with two punctures. Are the solutions with two punctures? So I have two punctures. I can do a conformal transformation, and I can arrange for those two punctures to be antipodal. Once I know that I have antipodal points, I can do a version of moving planes in the Euclidean gauge, for instance. And I can use moving planes to show that the solutions have to be rotationally symmetric. And then this is. And then this is where we introduce our third gauge, the cylindrical gauge. We do this with usually called the Emden-Fowler change of coordinates. It's written down here. This sends, so maybe, gosh. The three gauges I have. The three gauges I have: there's a sphere. This has a north and a south pole. There's the Euclidean space. The north pole gets sent off to the point at infinity, and the south pole is sitting here at the origin. Sitting here at the origin. After this Emden-Fowler change of coordinates, I have a cylinder parameterized with T. The North Pole is actually back here at T is equal to minus infinity. And the south pole is here at T is equal to plus infinity. at t is equal to plus infinity. The reversal comes from the fact that I have set t is equal to minus log of length x. So that picture over there is meant to show you the three different gauges that we have. Alright, so once I do this change of coordinates, the panace operator we've written down transformed The panace operator written down transforms into this thing, which again, don't pay too much attention to what this formula says. Once I use rotational symmetry, I get this fourth order ODE. And several years ago now, I think around 2019 or 2020, thereabouts, Frank and Koenig showed they classified all the solutions, and the solutions are And the solutions are nice periodic functions. The only other possibility is the Enden-Fowler transform of the spherical Talenti bubble, which is, it turns out, cosh to a power. A complete list of all the solutions. There's a picture. Yes, here's the picture. Here's a picture of all the Delaney solutions. So there's a constant solution, so you can see. A constant solution, so you can see here if I set these derivatives both to be equal to zero, oh, there should be a v here, then I can solve for v and I obtain a particular value. I can obtain this particular value for my constant, and that gives me this blue line right here. That's my cylindrical solution. So, this solution is constant in the cylindrical gauge. In the cylindrical gauge, in the Euclidean gauge, it looks like a power of length of x. Because I have that four-factor. The other solution we already know is the spherical solution. That's this green guy right here. Interpolating between the cylinder and the sphere, I have these oscillating, undulating things like that. They're nice periodic solutions. It's a little bit They're nice periodic solutions. It's a little bit speculative, but we think that the period is a monotone decreasing function of the neck size. This next size is this minimum value of the Delaney solution. So as I say, this is a little bit speculative, but we think very much this is true. The next size is the period. The neck size is the period and the neck size are related monotonically. For the second order problem, this is actually relatively easy to do because you have a second order ODE. So you can write the period function very explicitly as a single integral. In this case, you have a higher order ODE, and you end up with some sort of iterated integral that is much more complicated to unravel. Is it converted or is it just one over the period, right? It's actually not quite one over the period, but it's some other monotone function. Yeah. Yeah, and you can even work out very explicit estimates, at least in the second-order case, this is also very straightforward. That when the epsilon goes to zero, the period goes. The period goes to infinity at a specific rate. This is something you can write down the integral and see very explicitly. And if you're here for these higher order things, the situation is more complicated. Right, so these are all the Delaney solutions. So in the cylindrical gauge, you get these nice periodic things. gauge you get these nice periodic things and in the Euclidean gauge you get something that looks like this. You have this four factor of length of x to the power of four minus n over two. Okay, so those are the there is a first integral to my ODE. This is my first integral and I'm only showing you this slide because I'm going to need it later on when we talk I'm going to need it later on when we talk about the symplectic structure. But what do I need to know about this first integral? I need to know that this is constant for each solution, and I need to know that my solutions, the Delaney solutions, are ordered by this Hamiltonian. So if I look at, and this is actually kind of amazing if you stop and think about it, because I have solutions to a fourth-order ODE, but the solution... But the solutions to this fourth-order ODE are determined by a single integral. They're determined by a single conserved quantity. I still find this a little bit surprising. So this integrals are there because there was no explicit t dependent. Right. There's actually so the fact that there is a first integral is because the, as you said, there's no dependence on t and the coefficients, but the fact this actually determines all the solutions has to do with the way the ODE factors in a very nice way. Sort of. Generators of cube. There is a solution. Yeah, we have not really explored the Poisson geometry of this. Yeah, that's maybe something interesting to talk about. But there's an energy landscape that's useful to draw. I have this sphere. I have the spherical solution. And this has Hamiltonian equal to zero. The cylindrical solution is a fixed point in here. And this And this has a negative value to the Hamiltonian. The other Delaneys are all correspond to closed loops here. So, the important thing to take away from this picture is that the Delaney solutions Solutions are ordered by their energy. In particular, as I decrease the neck size, I'm going to increase the Hamiltonian. And that's going to end up being an important point. As you decrease the neck size, you increase the Hamiltonian. I'm sorry, I've seen my thing. Isn't that the variable sort of door? Age must be the guy going radio with the alpha notes. Sorry, the. Could you repeat that? Because you want something that buzz on record to put the agent on mind. Oh, that might be. Which is probably the worry you don't really have enough expertise in that kind of dynamical. That kind of dynamical systems language to say. From sort of my naive ODE point of view, the way I understand it is you draw the Bayes diagram and this is actually what it looks like in Bayes Base. But yeah, I don't know the answer to your question off the top of my head. Okay. Where were we? Okay, where were we? Okay, right. There's a theorem by Tianling Jin and Shong. They prove that for any of these singular imabe metrics, they are asymptotic to a translator of the Delaney. And this is where I want to sort of pause and think about the central motivating. The central motivating question, at least in my mind, to all this. I have one of these singular Yamabe metrics in my marked moduli space. I've specified where the punctures occur. That gives me some asymptotic data. And the asymptotic data are the sequences of nex sizes and the sequences of these translations, translation parameters. And the question. And the question, at least in my head, is now: how well does this asymptotic data determine the metric? Does there exist a solution for every set of asymptotic data? If not, Asymptotic data. If not, what is the set of admissible asymptotic data? If I tell you some asymptotic data, does that specify the solution uniquely or at least locally uniquely? These are sort of motivating questions. So maybe one more aside. Before we were able to show that That if you here by Andrade O, which says that if the next sizes are all bounded away from zero, Away from zero, then the corresponding set in this moduli space is compact. So one thing this theorem says is that if you have a degenerating sequence. Generating sequence, if you have a divergent sequence in moduli space, either the punctures need to come together and collide, or some of the next sizes need to go to zero. It's the only kind of degenerations you can have. Okay. I want to describe some geometric deformations of the geometry. Geometric deformations of the Delaney solutions. So the first two we already know. We already know that you have a conformally invariant PDE, so you can rescale it. And the picture of that rescaling, I've drawn the conformal rescaling in the sphere in Euclidean space. If you do the endenfowler change, you see that the conformal rescaling ends up just translating in the t variable. In the t variable. So, this is the picture of the conformal rescaling in the three respective gauges. The other change you have is you can vary the neck size. And that you can see from this picture, and you can see that. And you can see that from looking at this picture and using just the relationship that V epsilon of T plus T epsilon is V epsilon of T. If you differentiate this equation with respect to epsilon, you see that the Jacobi field, the Jacobi field generating this change of Generating this change of neck size Groza most linearly. Right, this Jacobi field generates Groza most linearly. The Jacobi field that corresponds to the conformal rescaling is periodic in end and power coordinates. Right. There are some other deformations that come from translations. You can translate the origin in Euclidean space. Origin in Euclidean space. So here's a picture of the translation. I've translated the South Pole. This is translating the origin in Euclidean space. And in end and faller coordinates, that corresponds actually to bending this end up as it goes to the right. And we see that this, if you do a Taylor expansion of Of the deformed solution in Enden-Fowler coordinates. This is what you obtain. And so you see that you get either an exponentially growing or an exponentially decaying solution. And the exponential growth rate, decay rate, is one. So if you translate the point at infinity, that means you're taking not this picture, but the picture where you reflect. This picture, but the picture where you reflect through the y-axis, the vertical axis. And then you get a Jacobi field that grows like e to the minus t as t goes to minus infinity, and the k is like e to the minus k, as t goes to plus infinity. But these are all things you can sit down and do very explicitly to talk about linear analysis. Okay, so So there are some weighted function spaces. Unfortunately, you just have to work in weighted function spaces. These are the weights. The reason you work in weighted function spaces for the Mden-Fowler is because you have either exponential growth or decay according to these solutions. You see very explicitly again. Right. So we already see that. So we already see that the translational Jacobi fields lie in these weighted function spaces. The Jacobi field coming from the conformal rescaling and the Jacobi field coming from the changing the neck size. These both lie in, they're both tempered. They're either bounded. They're either bounded, they're either bounded or linearly growing, and they have sub-exponential growth. So, if you do a little bit of Fourier analysis and use some duality, the fact that you have a formally self-dual operator, then you obtain the following linear decomposition lemma. It says that if I have a function that has some mild exponential growth, And L of V is equal to phi, which actually decays exponentially, then this V actually has to be in the span of these, this V has a component that does not decay, and the component that does not decay is a linear combination of these two very special Jacobi fields. Okay. Now I want to transfer all of this. I want to transfer this linear decomposition lemma on just a Delaney solution on Delaney end. I want to transfer that to one of these arbitrary solutions. So what do I do? I transfer them over very crudely with a cutoff function. And then I obtain this other version. This other version of the linear decomposition lemma. So here I have those special solutions, these special zero mode, zero Fourier mode Jacobi fields that I've transferred to my general solution using comma functions. And if I have a function that has mild exponential growth and L of V actually has exponential decay, Actually, it has exponential decay, then my V has to be something that decay is plus something in this very special finite-dimensional family. And this guy here, by construction, has dimension 2k. And this is my parameter space. Okay. I'm going to skip over this for the moment because I'm going to skip over this for the moment because I'm worried a little bit about time. There's a bounded null space. This bounded null space you can think of as lying inside the deficiency space and it corresponds to the actual solutions. So if I take L of anything in the deficiency space, it's probably not zero, but it's something that decays exponentially or it's very small. And this is sort of telling you which subset of the deficiency space is actually in the kernel. And the theorem, so I'm going to skip over this proof for the time being. If I have time, I'll come back to it. It's kind of interesting. But the dimension of the spouted null space is k. And sort of once you know this setup, once you know that you have a natural 2k dimension, That you have a natural 2k-dimensional parameter space. Once you know that you have this linear decomposition lemma, and once you know that the dimension of the kernel is k, you can see where all this is going by trying to set up the implicit function theorem in the correct way. And the question becomes really: how do I set up the implicit function theorem? And this is And this is the problematic part, right? Because if I choose my functions here to be, so I have some h of v, which is this guy in the Euclidean gauge. So u is my chosen metric. U corresponds to my chosen metric. I want to solve this. I want to look at solutions of things in the kernel of this operator. So I want to solve the h of. I just wanted to solve the h of v equals 0. And the problem is now, where do I choose v to lie? If I choose v to be exponentially decaying, my linearized operator is not going to be surjective, and then I have no hopes of trying to use the implicit function theorem and actually get the result I want. But if I choose v to be in the space of functions that have no decay or they're Or they have a little bit of exponential growth, then my conformal factor I have is likely going to change sign, and that's not going to be an admissible conformal factor. So I'm sort of stuck. And I'm sort of stuck until I remember that I have this very nice linear decomposition lemma. I have this very nice linear decomposition lemma right here, and I can try to use elements. And I can try to use elements of this deficiency space to build in directly by hand. And, oh, right. So what I do is I take something in the deficiency space, and something in the deficiency space on any end has an asymptotic expansion that looks like this. And I just cut my My conformal factor off, I change my conformal factor like this. And when I do this, this looks like a terrible idea. This looks like an absolutely terrible idea. So I'll draw a picture of, so here's a picture of what I'm doing. I have these transition regions I've drawn in red. So I've started off with this very nice constant Q curvature metric. But in these transition regions, I have destroyed the fact that I have constant Q curvature. The fact that I have custom Q curvature. And I have moved those ends by hand according to this element of the deficiency space. I've just changed the asymptotics wholesale. So what I'm ending up with by doing this deformation by an element of the deficiency space is something that does not have Constant Q curvature and has different asymptotics from what I've started with. So, as I said, this looks like an absolutely terrible idea, and yet it is the right thing to do. So, why is this the right thing to do? So, the equation I want to solve is now this equation. So, I take the panets of this deformed guy, 1 plus v minus this. I'm going to call that operator H. call that operator hg tilde w of 1 plus v and I just add and subtract the original operator. And now I look at this difference here and this difference here is going to be Lg of W plus some small remainder term. This guy over here is going to be Lg of V plus some small remainder term. So in the end, what I have End, what I have is that the linearized operator maps from the deficiency space plus exponentially decaying functions to exponentially decaying functions. And this is now the right setup where I have my operator set up between the right spaces. I know this is now a surjective operator, so I should take that back. In the case that In the case that I have a non-degenerate solution, this is a surjective operator whose kernel is exactly the bounded null space. In the case where I have an L2 kernel, there's going to be some additional component of the kernel that I have to deal with later on by a Lyapunostrat reduction. But in the case where I have a non-degenerate solution, Have a non-degenerate solution. This is now a surjective operator, and it has exactly this k-dimensional kernel, which is bad in null space. And now I can apply my implicit function theorem exactly in this setting, and I get the conclusion that I want, namely that some small neighborhood of this pointed moduli space is a smooth k-dimensional manifold. Which you can think of, and you can think of this smooth k-dimensional sub-manifold as being parametrized exactly by this bounded null space. And you can really think of the bounded null space as living inside the deficiency space. This is really occupying some k-dimensional submanifold of this very specific 2k-dimensional parameter space. Case. Okay. And then, as I said, the degenerate case is a bit more complicated, but is by now a very standard Leop notion of reduction. Okay. So with the time remaining, I want to just tell you about the symplectic structure. So this is what it is. I take my punctures, I surround them by some small balls. I surround them by some small balls. I excise those small balls. And now I perform this boundary integral. Oh, there should be a. Should be a. Right, that's what it should be. Okay, so this is what I have. So I need to show that this limited I need to show that this limit exists. A priori, there's no reason it does. Um I need to show this limit exists and that this defines a non-degenerate anti-symmetric bilinear flow. So if I integrate by parts twice, I get this expression, and now I localize to one of these boundary components. I do an Enden-Fowler change of coordinates, I get this kind of ugly looking thing. And again, I take t going to plus infinity, so I can ignore this leftover term. Over term. And when I take the derivative of the integrand, when I take the derivative of the integrand with respect to t right, so I use the fact that I have Jacoby fields. I reduce this. I reduce this now to something evaluated on w plus and w minus, and I get this expression. I take the derivative of this integrand, and I get zero. And so, what am I using here? I'm using the fact that this w plus and w minus satisfy a very nice fourth order ODE. So, this shows that the limit is well defined. This limit process here is actually Limit process here is actually, you do obtain a limit. And it comes from the fact that you have a very nice, these w plus and w minus all satisfy a very nice ODE. So when you differentiate this integrand, it gets something that does not depend on t at all. All right. And now we have to show that this can vanish. So, I have to show that the only way this vanishes is if this coefficient in front here vanishes. And this is where the remark I had earlier about the Hamiltonian comes in. So, if I call this integrand A, I write it down, I see that I can use the ODE. That I can use the ODE and I get something that looks like this. And then I realize my Hamiltonian was way back here. I evaluate what this Hamiltonian is. At t is equal to zero, I use the fact that v dot of zero is zero, v triple dot of zero is zero. V triple dot of zero is zero. I get some nice expression in terms of what epsilon is, and then there's a second derivative term I can't really do a whole lot about, but it's there. And what you find out is that this integrand is the derivative of the Hamiltonian minus the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to epsilon, and that's positive because the set of my. Because the set of my Delaney solutions is ordered by this Hamiltonian. That actually shows that I have a symplectic form. And then the fact that this last theorem, that near a degenerate point, a neighborhood of a degenerate point, and then is a Lagrangian submanifold, this follows directly because if I have the tangent space to my To my moduli space, all those Jacobi fields will satisfy L of V is equal to 0, L of W is equal to 0. So the symplectic form will actually vanish on those tangent factors. Obviously, I'll be the most closed. Sorry? This is actually a symplectic form on a vector space. Yeah. Okay. So this is actually a good place to stop. And I'm going to thank you for your attention. Okay.
