Sorry, from the focus medium equation to the elevation of flow and optimal transport approach. Yes, and green. Black and green. Okay, so okay, thank you very much. And thank you very much for the organizers, Han Invon and June, for having me. It's a great pleasure. So I would like to speak about the joint work that I did. About the joint work that I did with Noemi David and Filipo Santa Androgio. So it seems that Santa Miji is a light motif, at least of this day. So let me from Tiami to Pilosho. We are OT and this is joint with Noemi David. And Noemi was a postdoc. And Noemi was a postdoc of Philippe Leon, and she's starting a CRRS position this fall. Okay, so what is, I will jump in because everybody is hungry, I think. So I am considering this main actor of the talk, which is the Porus medium equation with a drift. And this drift can be, so I will specify in a moment what do I think about this drift. Here you have m greater. You have n greater than one. We have a time horizon, so this is typically set on zero t cross Rd. And for me, this B vector field will be always negative gradient of a potential minus negative gradient of another potential convolved with the measure. And because of that, this has a gradient flow perspective in the Wasserstein speed. And for notational purposes, And for notational purposes, I will introduce this pressure variable, which is something like this. And this problem has been studied hugely in the past. Yes, please, please correct and interrupt me if I do mistakes or if you have questions. So, this has been studied a lot in the literature, so I do not want to list names here. Names here. So, this problem is very well known. The main question that we will be interested in is: what happens if we send M quink? And this, philosophically speaking, let us see what is the equation that we would expect. So, if you would take, for instance, this W to be zero and V to be like a convex potential. Like a convex potential with Laplacian that is negative. And if we start, of course, this is always equipped with row zero. So rho zero is for me a probability measure with a density. So if I would take the indicator function of a set in the limit, in this case, the infinity problem would look like a free boundary problem. So it is something like this. Something like this on the positivity set of this pressure. So P, which we will denote as omega t, and you will have a normal velocity, which is just the negative gradient of V times N minus the normal derivative of this pressure, of course. This pressure, of course, understood formally, and this, because of this compressibility condition on the vector field, this will give you an evolution of a set. So you really have, and this is on this. So this is very much the Healershaw problem with the drift. And in general, so what we would expect is the So, what we would expect is the following situation. So, you would have a problem that looks like this: a PV that looks like as follows. So, you will have here the divergence of this vector field. So, actually, okay, so let me write it like this, and I will comment on it. So, this is equal to the To the Laplace T infinity. And this is a distributional, it has to be understood in a distributional sense. And we have a compatibility condition that the pressure is always supported on the set where rho is equal to one. And this means that in all these limiting processes, you would need to have rho infinity to be smaller equal than. Okay, and there is a nice interpretation. And there is a nice interpretation, if you like, let's say, convex analysis of this problem, because what you can do, you can introduce the so-called set of admissible vector fields associated to a probability measure, which are just vector fields in L2 having no negative divergence, but this only on the set where you have already saturated. Have already saturated the mass, and you can rewrite this PD, this PD infinity as follows. I can introduce a projection problem, so I can take a projection of my vector field onto the set of admissible velocities, and this is a close. This is a closed convex cone, and because of that, you have a Helmholtz Hodge type decomposition. And this is precisely like this. So this is how you get a gradient pressure as a Lagrange multiplier. And this the limiting PD would need to be written with this projection. And if you use this law, you see that I will get to this. And there are various motivations for this kind of limit. So this is called the incompressible limit or a stiff limit, but these kinds of equations arise very naturally in cloud motion. So cloud motion with conjugate With congestion, because what you can say is that you have a crowd which is aiming to move with a desired velocity field, but they would want to avoid congestion. So they do not want to saturate the density. And this is a typical problem in evacuation. So, for instance, if you would want to evacuate a room, you do not want to have people climbing onto each other. Climbing onto each other. So it is natural to have a constraint which is row smaller equal than one. And because of that, people would need to modify their desired velocity field on the zones which are already congested. And there was like quite influential paper coming from the Optima transport community. So this is Bertin Morie or Rodney Chupin. And Santam Giorgio from 2010, when they have studied the case W, it is equal to zero and this limiting problem through a gradient flow perspective. And a couple of years later, Invon and collaborators revisited this problem. So there is this paper by Alexander. Tim and Yao from, I believe, 2014, still in the case of Wt is equal to zero. And in particular, in this paper, there was this kind of convergence problem also addressed. And there is a rate of convergence derived here. So you will have that in Wasserstein distance, the rate it is. The rate it is decaying as m to the one over, so one over m to the one over 24. So, this is a mysterious number. It is coming from various kind of iterations of JPO schemes and things like that. But it was a very first impressive result on the rate of convergence using optimal transport techniques. I would like to emphasize that this constant here is depending on time. So these are. Time. So these are local in time, and I would come back to this question in a moment. And of course, there were plenty other things, not just very, so there is an understanding of this kind of problems using these COZIP solutions and so on and so forth. Okay, so this is, and if you are at the literature, I would like to mention, I'm just mentioning a couple of papers, I'm not mentioning all the All the related results because you can use different kinds of techniques to study this convergence problem. So, I would want to mention also another paper of Inwon with Etik Craig and Yao Yao. And this was a couple of years later. And this was in the case of V, it is equal to zero. And the W, it is a Newtonian potential. Newtonian potential, and the convergence rate was. Potential and the convergence rate was derived here, among other things, in particular existence and so forth. So, here the rate is even more, a mysterious number, which is m to the one over 144. And this is also local in time, and this is also coming from this kind of JPU iteration. Okay, and there have been plenty other. And there have been plenty other, quite a few works, including myself during my PhD. I studied some of these problems, but let us not get into those kind of details. So there is another quite nice paper by Piercam and Vasquez around the same time. So I think that that was also. Same time. So I think that that was also 14. And here they can have reaction. So they do not have interaction. And I believe that they have a drift term, but they cannot have this term. And they understand for a good class of reaction terms the kind of limiting procedure. But I would like to address also the rate of convergence and in particular. Rate of convergence, and in particular, trying to improve this kind of mysterious quantum. So, this is the objective of my talk. It is quantitative. And to the best of my knowledge, beside that work of Ivan Kim, Alexander, and Yao, there is only two papers addressing rates. And actually, actually. So, actually, beside those two, I think that there is only one because I have already mentioned those two. And this is a recent paper of my collaborator Noemi. Another postdoc, I think, of at that time of Pertam, DBH and Pertam. And this is in the case, so this is 22. This is in the case of W t is equal to zero plus reaction. Plus reaction and they obtain a rate in this case in H minus one. So they can have a rate which is of this type in H dot minus one. It is smaller equal than a constant, which is depending on time, divided by m to the one half. So this is the kind of rate that they obtain, and this h minus one dot, it is Minus one dot, it is just this kind of norm. So if I would want to measure u in h minus one dot, then this is equal to like a Dirichlet energy, sorry, pi one half when you solve this problem. And this is a notable distance because at a small or large scale, depending how you view it, it could be called. View it, it could be compared to the Wasserstein. But this doesn't imply convergence rate in Wasserstein because of the following reason. So, W2 between row 0 and row 1, let's say, can be bounded by above, by a constant which is depending on the two measures and row 0, row 1, h minus 1 dot, but this constant is depending on the lower bound. So this constant is depending on the lower bounds on the density. And in particular, if the densities touch zero, this is exploding to plus infinity. So this result doesn't imply convergence resulting in the Wasserstein space because, for this kind of porous medium equations, obviously we will not be able to impose uniform lower parts. And another disclaimer is that for this. Another disclaimer is that for this DDP result, there was another important assumption that it was made, which is that this is having compact support, which we would want to avoid, and plus this kind of technical assumption on the potential, which was something of this type. So this is greater record than lambda times the. Lambda times the identity matrix for some constant R, and the constant Ct here is depending on Lambda. And if you would want to take this Ct to be independent of capital T, you would need to take this lambda to be positive. If you take this lambda to be positive, then this essentially would imply that you have to take potentials which are concave. So global. rate if lambda positive and this implies like I am writing in quotation marks because it is not exactly but definitely you cannot have convex potentials which is the objective of our study so it is concave y okay so I would want to come to the main theorem let me state this main Theorem, let me state this main theorem that we have in the paper that we posted on the archive just a couple of months ago. So, the main theorem of this talk, which is in collaboration with Noemi and Filippo, is that we are assuming these potentials to be convex, to be semi-convex, yes, concave-like, sorry. Concave light, sorry. So if you take x squared here, for instance, this will or x squared over 2, this will be the identity, and this will be minus one half d times the identity. No? And this is a negative. So if you are in high dimensions, this is. Is a negative, so if you are in high dimensions, this is this is a negative number, so you cannot bound this below by a positive lambda. So, I and okay, so this is this is an exaggeration, so maybe put it in parenthesis, but I cannot take convex potentials satisfying this. Sorry, so this is okay, so let me put it in, it is like it, this property gives you more of a concave type behavior. So, you can change that exactly, exactly, exactly, exactly. Exactly, exactly. So, forget about this cannot be convex in high dimension. In dimension one, you are still fine, for instance. So, our main result is that suppose that we have two potentials, which are let's say C2, and you have And you have there exists alpha A beta capital B constant such that the hashtag is bounded between these two guys and okay and furthermore. And furthermore, suppose so this is let's say A1 and furthermore suppose that we have certain convexity in the problem. So meaning that either alpha is greater or equal than zero and the sum will be greater or equal than zero, or if v it is equal to zero, then beta has to be greater than zero. And in this case, And in this case, suppose also that row zero is smaller equal than one, then there exists a constant which is independent of time, time horizon such that the Wasserstein distance between rho m t and rho infinity t is more equal than a constant m to the one. M to the one-half for anything. So, this is the result that we are having. And in particular, this improves this result. This doesn't improve this result because this was for the Newtonian potential phase, which doesn't fall into this category. But the main thing here is that we have tools from optimal transportation to prove this theorem. And for the rest of the talk, which I do not know how much time I have, I would. Have I would want to about half an hour 25 10 minutes only? So I have I have one hour like I had a one hour talk okay okay so okay of course I do not want to stay here forever so that we can we can go to have uh okay so I would not want to sketch the the the sketch the the the proof of this result and and for that we will use optimal transport techniques so and in particular gradient so the m problem can be seen as a gradient so in the wasserstein space for this energy which is em to be the integral of this guy plus the integral of v plus the and of course i forgot to say that i am a Forgot to say that I am assuming for simplicity that V is symmetric. Sorry, W is symmetric. This is just for simplicity to avoid technical issues. We put the one half here and d row. So this is the original activation is a gradient flow of this energy for the Wasserstein two metric. The infinity problem, and this is always assumed in a sense that whenever this is meaningful, That whenever this is meaningful and plus infinity otherwise, and the infinity energy infinity of rho will be just that part with the additional constraint. So this will be V plus this guy if rho is small or equal than one and meaningful, the integra and plus simplical. Integra plus infinity of them. And in particular, so the limit equation can be understood also as gradient flow of this one. We have gamma convergence. And this kind of approach was first used by Invon and Crowters in the two different papers. So this gamma converges to this, minimizers converge to minimizers, gradient flows converge to gradient flows, and we have a very good understanding. And let me. And let me if meaningful meaningful means that if the integral is finite because we are on the whole Rn whole Rd and you have to be careful because even if I take densities which are smaller equal than one the integral might be infinity so whenever whenever this is meaningful then I take it like that and otherwise I extend it to plus infinity this will be a convex function will be a convex function and moreover it will be displacement semi-convex in the sense of MAC I will come back to this I will come back to this this is a very interesting point so actually we have found examples where this rate is not shut and this is precisely for the stationary states you can cook up stationary states which which decay Stationary states which decay better. So I am not claiming sharpness of this bound. And it seems that this bound one over m to the square root of m is not sharp. Okay. So sketch of the proof. And for that, I would want to record some notations from Optima Transport and these. From optimal transport, and these have been introduced by all the speakers from today. So, but just for notational purposes, let me write this as the dual, because I would need to have access to this counter of which potentials. So, this is phi psi in CB. And from now on, I am restricting myself to absolutely continuous measures because all the To absolutely continuous measures because all the solutions to my PDs will be absolutely continuous for any time. So, in that case, so if row zero and rho one, they are absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue, we know by Bronier theorem that the optimal transportation is realized by map, which is a gradient of a convex function. And in particular, this counter-wich potential here is responsible for constructing the optimal transport. So this. So this guy can be written as the integra of this with respect to rho zero. And in particular, I will be using this notation. Please forgive me because this is for the time horizon as well. But since I am aiming for global in-time result, whenever this is a vector, we think about it as the optimal transport map. So this is written like this. Written like this, and since the other one is also absolutely continuous, actually, this guy also, so t minus one, and of course, this is on the almost everywhere, like row zero almost everywhere, and t minus one, y will be y minus this psi, and this is row one almost everywhere. Okay, and these guys on the support of the measures will be uh will be really inverses of each other and and. Other and you will have further regularity if you have further regularity of the densities, but we do not worry about that. So, let me just write because I will be using this. So, in particular, you will have that identity minus this gradient of psi composed with identity gradient of pi. It is equal to identity, and because of that, you will have that gradient of pi. That gradient of, so if we rearrange this a little bit, I am writing this because I will be using it in a moment. So we will have this formula in a clean way. So this will be precisely. So if I take this, put it on the other side, I bring this over. This should be minus gradient of pi. And this is rho zero almost everything. Okay, so you have this kind of formula, and another two. Formula. And another tool that I will be using, it will be a differentiation formula. So suppose that I give you two absolutely continuous curves in the Wasserstein space with their velocities. So these are continuity equations with this velocity field in P2 RD192, you have a theorem from Androsio-Gigi Savaray. Which is my second or third favorite, because of course my favorite is Santan Projo's book. And I am biased because he was my advisor. So he's paying me for this kind of claims. No, I'm just joking. So you have this kind of differentiation formula, which it will be important for our purposes. So the waserst time. Our purposes, so the Wasserstein two distance between two curves will be equal to the gradient of the Cantor of each potential times V1 d rho one t plus the gradient of the other potential V2. And these are also time-dependent vector fields d rho t for almost every so this is this. So, this works for without any assumptions on the measures, just knowing that these are absolutely continuous. So, this is a meaningful formula. And of course, if we are in the setting that for almost every t, these curves are absolutely continuous with respect to, so the time evaluation of the curves are absolutely conjugate with respect to Lebesgue, we can simplify this form. So, suppose That row one t and row two t are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue, then you will have, let me continue this one now. So this is equal to yes, sorry, yes, you're right. So this is identity minus gradient of phi t. Gradient of 5t push forward row 1t it is equal to row 2t. So I just put a t here to say that this is a time dependent curve and time by time you have to have new counter of each potential. So you have to solve the optimal transport problem for every time. And that is just a time dependence. So if all these are satisfied, then we can rewrite this. Why? Because we know that. Why? Because we know that rho two is the push forward of this. So I am using just the definition of the push forward. So this will be, and that gives rise of row one. And you will be able to factorize out because of this formula, the gradient of pi. So what you will have here, this is inner product between v1 t minus v2t composed with identity minus. With identity minus gradient of phi t, and this is d rho one t. So the formula simplifies SCP if we have absolutely continuous measures. Okay, and okay, the heart of our analysis is that now consider. Is that now consider two solutions with two different exponents? So let row i be, let's say, a solution to PME with those general drifts with mi and m1 and m2, they are greater than one. Later, we will choose a special. Later, we will choose a specific relation between the two of them, but for now, let us focus on these ones. So, let me just recall that the Poros medium equation can be rewritten with the pressure. So, this is why I wrote it, because here you can write the gradient of the pressure associated to the first or the ice one plus the gradient of this plus the gradient of the other convolution. Rho, it is equal to zero. So this guy together is playing the role of Vi. So this is the optimal drift, right? And this is really, you have energy estimates and because of the gradient flow structure. So take these two solutions and compute the depth between the two of them. B over dt of one half was such time between these two guts. And I have a claim or a lemma is that this derivative that I may call x dot of t set. Dota of t satisfies a differential inequality. So which is x dot t is smaller equal minus two. So let me take the one half here. Gamma x e plus the g function divided by m times some constant here that is That this gamma can be chosen to be positive because of the assumptions of the theorem. And of course, here I have to write something like the mean between M1 and M2. And G is uniformly integrable independently of. independently of M1 and M. So this is the lemma. And I claim that this lemma implies the main theorem. And why is that the case? Because if we have something like this, this will imply automatically that X of T is decaying like a constant, one over the mean, let's say, between Let's say between M1 and M2. And this, the constant that I can write here is only depending on the L1 norm of G. And you can convince yourself about this implication by computing e to the 2 gamma t x dot. If you compute this, you will be able to replace this term here, and if you compute it, you will have. And if you compute it, you will have you will multiply over, and that will kill the exponential terms because this is positive. So, this implies this. So, that means that the Wasserstein distance time by time has this kind of decay factor, which is independent of the time horizon. And why are we done from that lemma? Because of a dyadic type decomposition of Of this kind of exponents m. So now choose m2 to be 2m1 minus 1. And this is, there is no mystery here. Vvc by, do we need to choose precisely this kind of relationship? So we will be applying that lemma with that. So in this means that was such time 2, because m2 is greater than m1. M2 is greater than M1 between rho one t and so this is squared rho two t is smaller equal than a constant divided by m1 okay and I can write this Wasserstein distance between rho m and rho infinity of t using a bunch of A bunch of triangle inequalities. Do you agree that I can write up the constant this to be smaller equal than this kind of infinite sum? Let me finish and you will tell me if you agree or not. 2 to the k plus 1 m minus 1. So just introducing, so k is equal to 0, this is precisely this guy and that. Precisely this guy, and at infinity, we are having this, and because of that lemma over there, I can take one over the smallest exponent. So, this is this is precisely because of the lemma, smaller equal than this kind of infinite sum which is converging of one over two to the k to the n. And then you are done. So, if you have that lemma, we are done. So, the Lemma, we are done. So the job is to prove the lemma. And I don't know how much time I have. I got time. So that means plus infinity. Okay. Okay. Okay, so the proof of the lemma is using the formula that I have written here. Here with the specific velocity. So let me rewrite that this has to be what? So it has to be, it will have three different kinds of contributions coming from the three different terms here. Three different terms here. And the first one is this pressure term. And I do not want to write the gradient of the pressure, but I would rather pass all the derivatives to the Kantorovich potential. So let me write it first. And I will comment on that later. So remember that we had Laplace of rho to the power m. So I will have the first term via integration by parts will be something. Will be something like this plus. So actually, this is small equal. So let me comment on this in a bit. So, why is this a legitimate operation? So, this Kantorovich potential is semi-concrete. Is semi-concave. So that means that the singular part of the Laplacian is a negative measure. So I can forget about the symmetric part, sorry, the singular part by putting an inequality. And for the absolute, I would need to write here absolutely continuous part of this Laplacian. I will convince you a posteriori that these guys are integral. And then eventually this computation will be legitimate. So this is coming from the porous medium term and this pressure term. This pressure term, and for the rest, and I will call this I for the rest, I do not have an inequity, but I have an inequity because I might have dropped here a singular part. I will have that kind of term. So coming from the potential energy, you will have here this guy and then this composition. Okay, so this is composed with identity minus this one, the row one p. And similarly, I will have something like that with these guys. So this is now convolved with row one, and you will have this convolved with row two and composed with identity minus like this. Like this, and this is 0, 1. So, I have in total, I will have three different terms. So, I will call this accordingly I2 and this I3. I2 is the simplest one, because we have assumed, in fact, a semi-convexity on the potentials. So that means that V of X minus V of Y. minus v of y inner product with x minus y by the assumption is greater equal than alpha x minus y squared and because of that this this can be made smaller than minus alpha times the wasterstein squared so the easiest term is that this guy is smaller equal than minus alpha because here you will have this minus that one you would need to have a negative sign Minus that one, you would need to have a negative sign. So the Wasserstein distance squared between row 1T and row 2. So this is the easiest part. And the second easy part is this one, but this is way more tedious. And I will not do the details of the computation, but I will just claim something. Exactly, exactly, exactly. So, you're right that these kinds of things have been observed before, but here, this is a little bit trickier because the interaction energy, so you will have a barycenter contribution. So, here, which is not because here you are convolving at two different measures. It helps you the same as that you get if drug measurement. You're right, you're right. You're right. So, essentially, what You're right. So essentially, what you're saying is that because of semi-displacement convexity of these two, we have a bound. Yes, you're right. Exactly. Exactly, exactly. So, but to be a little bit more precise, we will have here minus beta. So you have actually a little bit more, a little sharper estimate, and here you end up with a very centered contribution. Which, of course, in some cases you will be able to just forget. So you will have a contribution like that. And this is certainly bounded above by the Wasterst time distance. So in particular, this whole thing, if beta is positive, can be, so it doesn't really contribute. But it could help you a little bit if Help you a little bit if you do not have V, then you still want to make sense of like the decay estimate from here. And what is an important observation is that if V is equal to zero, the porous radio maximum just with the interaction energy, V preserves barisometer. So that means that if I take the equation with the same initial condition, then this contribution is null. And because of that, this is helping you if beta is positive and v is equal to zero. And otherwise, it doesn't really contribute. So from this I2 and I3, we are having this kind of term. With suitable choose a gamma, we are landing in this situation that you will have a vast time distance. That you will have a Washerstein distance to the squared, and gamma is precisely depending on the sum, or if V is equal to zero on that. Yes. Yes, so the assumption in the statement of the theorem was something like this, right? If you remember, the statement of the theorem. So this is for the Hessian, but this is the same, right? But this is the same, right? So this is alpha convexity, and this is monotonicity of the. Yes, sorry. Sorry. No, no, no. That was in the Pertam paper. So that was in the Pertan paper. No, I said that the Pertan paper will not be able to apply in our situation because of two reasons. And yeah. Yes. Is the first term on the right-hand side? Is that just a minus sign? Are those on my sign? Are I thinking about those here? No, no, sorry, the line below. Here, sorry, that is that. No, this is a positive Laplacian. So, are those potentials come back? So, this potentials are semi-concave. Okay. So, if it is exactly, it has a negative sign which I can forget. And this is right. Okay, so all in all, term two and three will contribute. Term two and three will contribute to this part. So now I just have to convince you, and this is the most serious part, that this actually will give you that kind of decay with this G funct. And this is really the non-trivial part, which is actually the main contribution of the paper, because as Matthias was saying, that this kind of computations have been done already before. Okay, so R. And for IV, we use two ingredients. Use two ingredients. Essentially, one will be Mont Jean-Père. So, Mont Jam-Père tells us that since this is the optimal transport map was something like this. So, for I, so we have Montjean-Père, which tells you that this guy can be written like this. And t again, it is just denoting this by t. And similarly, you have for the backward transport, you will have a term which is rho 2t divided by rho 1t compose t minus. And then, so whenever you see this kind of Laplacian, you always have to think about arithmetic and geometric mean, because that is the hashing of a convex function. So it is. So it is a positive definite symmetric matrix. So arithmetic and geometric mean will tell you that D times this determinant to the one over D, which is nothing but this guy. This guy, so this is the geometric mean is a circular is smaller or equal than the tricks, and the tricks is V minus the Laplacian. And so that means that the Laplacian, in the sense of distributions, will be smaller equal than, so if I rearrange this inequality, will be one minus rho one divided by rho two t one over d. One over d, and similarly, you can do the same computation for the Laplacian psi. Okay, and I will replace this back over there. So, in order to save space, let me just write that this guy here is smaller equipo. Because this is the main term that we would want to estimate now. So, first of all, smaller equal than d one minus rho one rho two p one over d times rho one to the m1. And I would want to actually factorize out the rho one here and write it like this. And I would want to write again rho two as the push forward. Again, row two as the push forward of row one with respect to the previous measure, the previous map, so you will have something like plus one minus rho divided by rho one composed with the inverse. And this has to be composed with the t. So I will write here rho 2 t rho 1. So please tell me if you agree with this. And I will have rho 2. And I will have rho 2 composed with t to the m2 minus 1 and dx. And this is because I have decomposed this rho 2 to the power m2 as m minus 1 times rho 2. And for the second rho 2, I have used the push-forward condition. And this is what you get. And this is also the justification why this is meaningful because this becomes like an you can you can show that this is this is fine. This is finite as long as we have some more estimates. But if you introduce this kind of quantity, which is rho one to the one over d and b to be rho two composed with t to the one over d. This integral, and these are functions of space-time, can be written as d times rho one times one minus a over b. Minus A over B times A to the D M one minus one plus one plus B over A times B to the D M two minus one dx. So now our job is just to understand this two, this poly like this functional. This poly like this, this function of two variables, how big it can be. And if a is bigger than the a is bigger than b, then this contribution is negative. So we just need to optimize this function. So on so if I call this term here, I1 and this term here, I2, on the set when A is bigger than B, we have that I1 is negative, so it doesn't. Is negative, so it doesn't really contribute. And you just need to compute the maximum of this I2 under the constraint that B is smaller than A. And vice versa. So, and these guys will be finite. It turns out that these maximization problems will give you so here. So, here, if you solve, this is like a Cartus 101, because it is a function of two variables that you would want to maximize under this constraint. And here, in this case, the optimizer will be optimizer will be, or the optimal value will be smaller equal, then you will have something like one over m2, like a constant, and times. like a constant and times a to the d m1, sorry, m2 minus m. So if you solve this optimization problem, the optimal value will be smaller than this. So all in all, if you collect this information, this is the opposite power in some sense. So you would have an estimate which is I1 is smaller or equal than rho1. And if I rewrite back this transportation problem, Transportation problem, and I will recover the additional rho two. You will have that this guy is smaller equal than rho one to the m2 power plus rho two to the m to the m1 power. So it remains and divided by the right positive. So divided by the minimum between these two positions. And this is coming from this finite dimensional optimization problem, essentially. And here, what Essential. And here, what it remains is to study the properties of the Porus medium equation with power m1 with the other power. And this is where it comes the 2m minus 1. Because the pressure estimates will give you, so pressure estimates and energy estimates, which are more or less standard. More or less standard in polarized, also without considering through the lens of optimal transport, will give you that the density to the power 2m minus 1 will be integral. We'll give you that this whole thing here is bounded by, so if we take m to precisely 2m 1 minus 1, One minus one, this will be smaller equal than one over and one, we are constant, and the g function. And this g function is nothing but the dissipation that you that you see along the gradient flow, which is something like the velocity squared integrated against the measure, which is rho i t gradient of p. Pmi plus the gradient of v plus this guy the x. And this along the gradient flow, this is uniformly integral in time. And this is which ends actually the proof of the lemma and hence the theorem. And just one or two more remarks to go to launch. And this is precisely because Matthias also has this question about the stationary states. States so some concluding remarks If you do not have those inequalities for alpha and beta as it was stated in the in the statement of the theorem, all these estimates still go through just they are not global so you can recover local estimates if so if this kind of So this is not, then, and if v is equal to zero, so if these two do not satisfy, then estimates local. So those constants depend on capital T. The second, remark is sharpness. Sharpness and one over square root of n probably sharp, or I can erase even the probability because of stationary states. So you can cook up a potential which is something like Vx, it is equal to something like H. x it is equal to something like a x squared and you take w it is equal to zero you will have that for the stationary states and this has to be specifically chosen in a way that the stationary state for the m problem so this is the global minimizer of e m the support you would need this You would need this to be included in the support of the stationary state for the infinity problem. And then, for this class of examples that we have constructed, you will have a better data. So, you will have something like W two. And again, these are the global minimizers of the energy with this additional constraint. So, this has to be chosen in a way that you can ensure that all these stationary states are confined, so that the supports are contained in the support of the infinity problem, which is just a characteristic function of a set, this one. And it is just a characteristic function of a set, which is a sublevel set of P. level set of V and you can compute explicitly the stationary states as well because you can write down first order optimatic condition for the EM energy so this is smaller input than something like this so you can improve a little so here kappa is depending on all the parameters that we have in the the problem so you can improve a little bit the one half and another the third remark and final remark is that we can we can consider other Is that we can consider other pressure laws. So, in mathematical biology, and in particular in that paper of DDP, so David, Debih, and Pertam, they consider this kind of pressure law, which is a singular pressure law of the type rho over one minus rho times epsilon. And here, epsilon is a positive number. And this automatically implies that you are working at the epsilon level already with densities which are strictly smaller than one. Which are strictly smaller than one. But if you send epsilon to zero, these kind of problems also converge to this Hilleshot type limit. So if you send down epsilon to zero, you can record exactly the same kind of estimate using exactly the same calculations or almost the same kind of calculations because there we can compute the Wasserstein distance between the epsilon and let me write again infinity here. And this infinity is. And this infinity is the limit of, let's say, one over epsilon. So it is infinity, is a smaller equal than the square root of epsilon times epsilon. And the technique, it is pretty much the same, and it is the computation in this pressure law, it is very easy. And with that, I will thank you for the question. Thank you for the talk. In the differential inequality that you had from the lemma, there was like an integrating factor that you threw away from like the this gamma coefficient. I was wondering like if you incorporate that, can that give you a rate of conversions that doesn't okay, okay, I see. So it is not really. C so it is not really giving you because what I what I threw away is something like so this x of t, so I was a little bit sloppy with this. So it is smaller equal than a constant times something like this. So it doesn't really help you too much. So it is the factor that I threw away was of this type and you had this M1 and M2 the mean. The mean. So it doesn't really help you too much, right? Because this is beating only this one, but it is not giving you exponential, like yet another layer of exponential. But it helps you to get global rates because this is beating that. This is a good question. So I think I misunderstand something. Misunderstanding something so so that counter example is supposed to be faster or slower. So let me let me see because I might have messed up the yeah, I think K. Okay, so let me let me write it like this. No, this is the same. Okay, okay, so let me uh no, but I will okay, okay, so it was plus V. So if I if I have the minus there, it is something like this. Yes, I might say yeah. Yes, and this is coming from Sobolev estimates essentially, because you will have, so if you are coming from the optimal transport perspective, you will have something like this, right? So you will have. This, right? So you will have m over m minus one rho to the m minus one squared, and this is uniformly bounded. And if you work out this, the precise exponent and use sobola embeddings, we'll give you that this as so if this is uniformly bounded, let's say, will give you that rho to the 2m minus 1 is uniformly bounded. Polyphon, and this is you also get lower powers too. Is that because the second term has to do? That is a very, very good point. So, that is a very, very good point. That this is giving you the term that you want for this one. And since we are on R D, you have to be a little bit more careful with the embeddings. But eventually, yes. So, you will have an interpolation inequality, which will give you specifically you can choose here M1. And this is again because of the fact that if I rewrite it, That if I rewrite it, so you had that 2m1 minus 1 was equal to m2. And if I rewrite it like this, I will have precisely this estimate for, I will have this estimate also for root. But this is not coming, it is not only coming from the pressure estimate, but coming from another interpolation inequality in apospace. But it turns out that this choice is really matching both of them. Okay, so I mean, you have to have. Okay, so you have that soble up bound, so is there another bound that you have to the equation that allows you to interpolate that? You have this kind of bound, you have also that actually this whole thing is bounding this one. And let me see. So what is naturally you will have m2 estimates because the energy is finite. So rho to the m2 itself is rho two to the m2. Rho 2 to the M2 is also uniformly bounded because of energy estimates, and this together with the corresponding pressure estimates for M2, it turns out that this relationship will make both of the exponents match. So this is somehow a magic of these numbers that they actually correspond to each other. But this is a very good point. I was swiping under the raw graph, this detail. Dependent upper bound on the sector, yes. Yes, yes, because we have also, because of the upper bounds on the hash, yes, so I am swiping on the drag a lot of things, you have also uniform second moment testing. So you will have all these and this. So, you will have all these, and this is coming from the upper bound on the hash. So, you will have second moment estimates, you will have this kind of Sobolev estimates and energy estimates, and these all together will make the powers actually match. Yes, this is also an important, and this is where we couldn't get rid of the capital A and capital B, because that means that these are comparable to quadratic functions, essentially. Second moment estimates are also. Moment estimates are also important. And precisely, they're where we was.
