Okay, thank you very much. First, I'd like to thank the organizers for this wonderful workshop on this beautiful island. So I'll talk about two phenomena that we expect to see in turbine flows. I'll talk about the dissipation anomaly and anomalous dissipation. And I'll be very precise by what I mean by. By what I mean by this. And I'll try to make it somewhat related to the discussion that Edward started yesterday: whether there is a selection principle for Euler equation, right? And whether it's, you know, whether Euler equation actually models turbulence. So let me start with the equations. Okay, so these are the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. U is the velocity, P is the pressure, ν is the kinematic viscosity. So, when μ is positive, right, this is the Merriest-Stokes equations, when μ is zero, this is what we call the Euler equation. We'll talk about the energy balance. So, what is the energy balance? So, formally, if you have a smooth solution, you can just take the dot product of the equation with u, integrate in space, and then you'll have to. U integrate in space, and then you'll have the time derivative of the kinetic energy, or twice the kinetic energy, is equal to minus the 2 nu times the integral of the altonormal gradient u squared. So this is something what we call the, oops, sorry. There is no integral on the right-hand side, right? So there is no integral on the right-hand side, right? So this is a differential form. It's this is a differential form of the energy balance. So the rate of change of the energy is equal to minus the enstrophe. So in the case of Euler equation, nu is zero, right? So we obtain the conservation of energy. The energy is constant. If there is no external force, of course, if there is external force, then we also have the work done with the force on the right-hand side. Okay, so now let me. Let me start with the Euler equation. So, then let me try to explain what I mean by anomalous dissipation. So, when we say that the solution of Euler equation exhibits a normal dissipation, what we mean is that the energy balance is not satisfied, right? The energy is not constant. Constant and the threshold for the smoothness of solutions, of course, smooth solutions satisfy the energy balance. And the exact threshold is the space B one over C is three infinity. So if solutions have one over three derivatives in L3 sense, so the right so we are Right, so we are thinking about L3 space here. Then they satisfy the energy balance. So this was first obtained by constant in E in TT. So they had exponent one over three minus epsilon. And then with constant infinite Landauer Schwitzkoi, we basically removed epsilon. And the best condition that we have nowadays looks in the following way. Relative the time integral of lambda q. integral of lambda q so lambda q is the frequencies it's 2 to the power q so here we are thinking about the little woodpelli decomposition delta q u is a little woodpelly piece of u so you project u onto frequencies around so on the dyadic shell of radius lambda q you take L3 norm multiply by the frequency to the power one over C integrate in time and that somehow represents the flux of the energy to high mold so if High modes. So, if the limit at the frequency goes to infinity is zero, it means the flux of the energy goes to zero as the frequency goes to infinity. So, no energy escapes to the infinite wave number. And we have conservation of energy. So, on Sagar conjecture, so this is actually the answer of On Sager conjecture. So, on Sagar was the first who conjectured that the exponent one over three. Exponent one over three is the critical threshold for the energy conservation. And in the negative direction, the conjecture was solved by IZ. So this is a success story over the convex integration introduced by Camille Ellis and Las La Cheklahi to the mathematical fluid dynamics. So I'm not going to go through it. Okay, I'll keep pressing the wrong button. I'll keep pressing the wrong button. Right. So, let me just tell you that there is still a little gap between the negative results or between the construction of Z and the positive result that we have. So there is still a tiny, tiny gap. And if I have time, I'll discuss later whether there is a hope to fill this gap. For sure, not using convex integration. Using convex integration. So there are, I mean, as much as I love convex integration, there are some limitations. So, first of all, the frequency growth super exponentially interactions are non-local. That's not what we see in physical flows, in physical turbine flows. And second, there is no hope to approximate wild solutions of Euler equations, so solutions obtained by Convince integration by any reasonable solutions. By any reasonable solutions of Negerstock's equations. So, by reasonable, I mean solutions where the energy dissipation is finite. And if the energy dissipation is not finite, that's not turbulence, right? We cannot even talk about turbulence. Okay, so now let me switch to the solutions of Nager-Stokes equations, and let me try to explain what I mean by dissipation anomaly. So, this is a phenomenon predicted by Thomas. Predicted by Tomogorov. And one way to describe it mathematically is in the following way. It doesn't work. Anyway, so let's take the energy dissipations. So L delta norm squared of gradient u. Take some kind of average. So here I'm going to be thinking about time average. If you'd like, think about some average over the tractor with respect. Over the attractor with respect to some invariant measure. And if Lim soup, as you send this constant to zero, if Lim soup happens to be positive, we say that the flow exhibits a dissipation anomaly. Of course, if you show this to any physicist, right, immediately, you know, you'll see a problem, right? The left-hand side is not a dimensional. So if we expect to write If we expect to write Liam soup to be some kind of positive constant, this constant is better to be adimensional. So let's make it more precise or more correct. Let's introduce, let's make everything a dimensional, right? So let's change variables. So now X1, T1, U1, P1, F1 are adimensional. So here now I have a force as well. The Reynolds number is going to be defined in a standard way. It's characteristic velocity, capital U. So this is a long time average of the energy to the power one half times characteristic length scale. So I'm just thinking about maybe torus, right? Length of the size of the torus divided by nu. So this is an ad-dimensional quantity. And in our new coordinates, the Navier-Stokes equations will look in the following way. So instead of this cost, now you will have one of the Reynolds. This cost, now you will have one of the Reynolds number. So, if you want to see what happens in the limit of zero of its cost, what you want to see, you want to basically send the Reynolds number to infinity. And then Kolmogorov's dissipation anomaly hypothesis can be stated in the following way: that in the limit, as Reynolds number goes to zero, epsilon L of Epsilon L over U cubed, so it is scaled energy dissipation rate does not vanish. And let me mention the following positive results. So in one direction, this hypothesis has been solved in a very, very general, general way. So take, I'll make it a bit more precise later. So, for any force, if you take long-time averages, Poyers-Doring obtained the following upper bound. So, here you have a Reynolds number to the power minus one. So, that's the upper bound in the Lyman region, plus plus a constant, right? So, that's exactly what we expect to have when the Reynolds number goes to zero. And if I have time, I'll maybe talk a little bit about what happens for fractal forces or rough forces. Fractal forces or rough forces, so that's when the force is not square integrable. But so the dispression anomaly hypothesis breaks down, even though physicists are still interested in such kind of forces. So you have, in this case, you have Reynolds number to a positive number as upper bound. Okay, so There is a name for this quantity epsilon L over U cubed. It's called drug coefficient. And this equation anomaly law says the following, says something what we learn in elementary physics classes, that when the velocity is high, the force, the drug force, is proportional to velocity squared, right? Because on top you have the energy dissipation rate. the disp uh the energy dissipation rate all right so it's equal to it's equal to the um the work done by the force so velocity one one velocity cancels and then you just you just get velocity squared and this is a picture from from the book of frees you can see uh so these are real experiments i think this is for this is this was an experiment for um Either for a ball or for a cylinder, I think it was a cylinder. So you can see one of the Reynolds number in the lymphandry regime, and then you can see that it kind of levels right. So you can see that it becomes more or less, you know, not constant. There is deep. But this really happens, you know. So in the case of cylinder, what happens is that at some point the wake The wake becomes very small, and that kind of reduces the drug. So, for example, this is the reason why golf balls have dimples, because for golf balls, the Reynolds number happens to be exactly like in this range. So, you introduce a little bit of more turbulence and the drug decreases rate. But in general, you know, in general, of course. You expect it to be more constant. You expect it to be more constant when the Reynolds number is very, very large. Okay, so well, I'm not going to talk much about fractal force turbulence. So, some physicists are interested in kind of fractal or rough forces and they even try to make an experiment like this introducing low scales. So, what I just want to show you is that the maybe the approach. Want to show you that the maybe the appropriate mathematical setup should be in the following, should look like this. Okay, so of course, in experiments, there is no way you can come up with a rough forces. At some point, you have to stop at some small scale, right? So, mathematically, it would make sense to model the force in the following way. Let's say the force is going to be capital F. The force is going to be capital F, whereas the F is the amplitude times some smooth function phi, which is just the dimensionless shape of the force. And then in the limit of Reynolds number, as Reynolds number goes to infinity, if phi converges in L2, so these are, to me, these are good forces, right? So they don't produce any work on small scales, and we expect to have the dissipation. And we expect to have the dissipation anomaly law. If you have convergence in some rougher spaces, then okay, things become worse. So, this is to me some good mathematical setup. And now let's so how much time do I have? 10 minutes, right? Let me start talking about some mathematics actually. So, I'm going to talk about the dissipation anomaly. So, I'm going. So, I'm going to discuss the following quantities. So, this is the Navier-Stokes equations. F is going to be the force. Capital E is going to be lim inf of the energy. So, that's what I call the energy limit. Capital D is going to be lim soup of the dissipation. That's the dissipation limit. And I will also look at the energy of the limit solution. So, here, capital U, sorry, little U without without mu. So, that's going to be the Without you, so that's going to be the solution of the earlier equation. Okay, so we look at the energy of the limit. Also, since there is a force, so the force will converge in all two, so it's going to be a nice force. Actually, we'll see, it's even going to be better in all the examples that I show. It's going to be convergence, it's going to be in Hoder spaces. And solutions of the Nagier-Stokes equations will converge. Solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations will converge weakly in a lot of okay. Capital W is going to be the work done by the force, but in all the examples it's going to be zero, so just ignore capital W. So immediately by taking the limit of the energy balance for the Navier-Stokes equations, right, since we have a weak convergence in L2, the energy in the limit rock, right? And then you have the following inequality, so capital E, so that's the So, capital E, so that's the limit energy, it's non-negative, all right? It's equal to the initial energy minus the total dissipation plus the work done by the force. And we have the following inequality for capital D, right? It's non-negative and it's less than or equal to the initial energy plus the total work, right? So, in particular, okay, first let me define what I mean by dissipation anomaly. So, we are going to see. Dissipation anomaly. So we are going to say that solutions of Navier stocks exhibit dissipation anomaly if capital D is positive. So in the limit, the energy dissipation does not vanish. And I want to say that solutions of Euler exhibit anomalous dissipation if the limit solution U does not satisfy the energy balance. And clearly, one implies another. Dissipation anomaly implies anomaly. You can just A normal dissipation. You can just see it from equation six. If capital D is positive, then of course the Euler equation cannot satisfy the energy balance. So maybe just to emphasize it, you start with the energy balance for the energy stokes. If you assume that along some sub-sequence, the energy dissipation does not vanish, immediately you obtain that the limit solution does not satisfy the algebra. So in particular, The algebras. So, in particular, it's natural to ask a question whether the anomalous dissipation implies dissipation anomaly. And I'll show you some examples where this is not true. Okay, so these are some questions that I'd like to, you know, ask whether capital D can achieve all the possible values, whether the energy of the limit solution can achieve all. limit solution can achieve all the possible values allowed by the inequalities above, whether capital E and capital D can be continuous, whether the energy of the limit solution can be continuous, whether anomal dissipation implied dissipation anomaly, and whether there are infinitely many limiting solutions of the Euler equation. Okay, so let me talk about the previous results. First, by Drew. Um, Driva, Salgindi, and uh, here, and at Yong, it was uh shown that there is this equation anomaly for that vection diffusion equation. Uh, and there was a very recent result by Armstrong and Vicole for arbitrary initial data, and uh, just one year ago, Elia Brigo and Tamil Delis showed the The dissipation anomaly for the Stergita and Gesdox equations, and their construction was two plus, so they I mean it was a two plus one half dimensional construction where the third component of the velocity was transported by the first two components and they were using. They were using a smooth solution of the transport equation by Alberti Cripa and Mozzokata that was efficiently mixing the scalar SATA. So SATA here is a third component. Okay, so maybe let me just, so I have five minutes left, let me try to describe the results. The results. So, this is one of the negative. So, I'm not, I'm not going to skip this one. Okay, so this is one of the main theorems. So, it's a long statement. I'll just show you some pictures, right? Okay, so basically, the theorem says that there is a sequence of smooth solutions of Nevier-Stokes equations. Smooth solutions of Nagierstock's equations with smooth forces. So the force converges in C alpha for any positive alpha. Okay, initial data is smooth, it's fixed. And then the theorem says that, so there is a sequence of solutions. The theorem says that there are lots of different subsequences that exhibit different properties. Actually, there are uncountably many different sub-sequences. Countably many different subsequences with different properties. And I'm going to try to describe what kind of subsequences we can obtain in the following slide. So this is the second part of the theorem. Sort part, okay. Okay, here it is. Okay, so the first family of subsequents. The first family of subsequents. The first family of subsequences will look in the following way. So here I'll use the following color code. So red, the color red will correspond to Nagierstock solutions. So for me, Nagi-Stok solutions, these are solutions that describe real fluids. So this is real life. And the color blue is going to be for the limiting solution of the Euler equation. So this is a mathematical idealization. And then we'll see that in some Right, and then we'll see that in some cases it's a maybe it's a it's a good model, in some cases it's it's not a good model. Okay, so the first subsequence we look in the following way. So choose any, so initial energy is going to be one, initial energy is going to be one. So choose any number E1 between zero and one. So that's going to be this red dot. There is a sub-sequence for which the dissipation anomaly. Dissipation anomaly, so the amount of energy lost by the Magistok's sequence is exactly one minus E1, right? And the limiting solution of the Euler is always the same. It loses all the energy at time one, okay? And if you want to see what happens in the frequency, that's what it's going to look. Like the Navier-Stokes solutions, you know, will follow Euler until they hit some frequency lambda and then. Hit some frequency lambda, and then you know they'll be just staying on that frequency later on. So, this is the first family of solutions. And now the second family. So, for this family, the wave number capital lambda. So, that's where the Niger stock solution stops, more or less. Going to higher frequency. So, in this case, it's going to be much later, much, much larger than the Kolmogorov dissipation wave number. So, this is the first family. In the second family, it's going to be comparable to Kolmogorov dissipation wave number. So, in this case, you'll see that the limiting energy is continuous. So, in the first family, it was actually discontinuous. Actually, it is continuous. So you have a jump. And the second family immediately becomes continuous. All right. And when capital lambda is much, much smaller than Kolomogorov dissipation wave number, you will see that the limiting energy, so that's the red line, is actually horizontal. So this is an example where there is no dissipation anomaly. So solutions of the Nagier-Sox equation don't lose any energy in the limit. Any energy in the limit. But of course, the solution of Euler equation, the limiting solution is always the same. The limiting solution loses all the energy. So this is an example where the anomalous dissipation does not imply the dissipation anomaly. And yeah, so I'm just trying to emphasize it on this slide. So, on one hand, the solutions of the Euler equation do not satisfy the energy balance. Satisfy the energy balance. On the other hand, in the limit of vanishing viscosity, the energy dissipation goes to zero. So it is possible. Okay. And so the second theorem. So the first theorem was actually based. I mean, I was just trying to study the construction by Brilliant Delilith. All right. In this result, the construction is a bit more complicated. I introduced backwards energy. Complicated, I introduced backwards energy cascade. So if you look at the frequency, that's what happens to the solutions, right? So the Euler equation blows up at time one, but then, you know, right away, there is a backwards energy cascade. So all the energy that escapes to infinity, all the energy comes back. Okay. And solutions of Nagas-Stokes equation, I mean, they're all smooth, of course, right? So, you know. You know, so as before, the energy reaches some frequency capital lambda and then it starts going back. Okay, so in this case, in this case, I can show that actually there are many, many limiting solutions of the infinitely many limiting solutions of the Euler equation. So there are two obvious limiting solutions that, you know, just one can obtain from the, from the constant. just one can obtain from the from the construction one limiting solution is the same as before where all the energy is getting lost at time at time one and then you nothing nothing comes back and then the second limiting solution is when all the energy which is getting lost at time one comes back so if you look at the Euler equation then the energy of the limiting solution is just a horizontal line so there are two obvious ones which come from the construction but I can prove that on top of that there are infinite can prove that on top of that there are infinitely many i cannot prove that there are countably many but i can prove that there are infinitely many solutions of the euler equation in between right okay so again so we uh what what happens here if you look at the navier-stokes equation so uh as time approaches one you know the navier-tokes equations lose some energy but you know they don't have to lose all the energy so you can choose any number e2 all right and there is Number e2, right, and there is a sub-sequence for which solutions of Mario-Stokes equation will be having such in such a way. So they lose exactly one minus E2 amount of energy. And what happens for the limiting solution? So on the interval from one to two, the convergence in general is just weak. So I cannot show that the convergence is strong. So the limiting solution can be even lower than the energy of the limiting solution. So, the energy of the limiting solution can be even smaller than the limiting energy of the negative stock solutions. And okay, maybe let me just stop here because I'm running out of time. Okay, very good. Okay, very quickly. Okay, any questions? The online part if there are any questions. Uh is that any question from offline people so I see so the uh so basically what's your conclusion? So it's uh the equivalent in some case but another case. Yeah, so the conclusion is that uh even the Even the you know, vanish viscosity might not be a good selection principle for the Euler equation, right? So, so for example, like the last example shows you, okay, so given the same initial data, you know, the same force, right, there are infinitely many solutions to Fourier equation. All of them can be obtained in the limit of Vanitian viscosity. viscosity. And some of them might not actually be, might not actually model the Navier-Stokes equations, the Navier-Stokes solutions in the right way. So the energy of the limiting solution, the energy of the Euler solution might be actually smaller than the limiting energy of the Nagas-Tokes solution. So anything is alphabetically bad in a good in some certain good order. In a good in some certain good or not in the old point. So basically, so it depends on which are you looking for for the older. Yeah, so yeah, so well, I mean, in this case, I'm talking about, of course, these are all, I mean, these solutions of all are all rough. They blow up. So all of them blow up at time one, right? So we are talking about rough solution, but that's what we expect, right? Rough solution, but that's what we expect, right? If all your models are turbulence, of course, we expect those solutions to be rough. That's what Onsager predicted, right? We expect them to be rough. Solutions from the Stokes are all smooth in this construction. They're all smooth, but we can still see that, okay. So, in some cases, in some cases, all your solutions approximate Negro-stock solutions in a nice way. Like, for example, in the first example. Like, for example, in the first example, right? So, in this case, the Euler equation is a good model, maybe. But in some cases, this is not true. For example, for this third family of sub-sequences, the Nagier-Stokes solutions do not lose any energy in the limit at all. But the limiting Euler solution, so I didn't, I mean, so the limiting Euler solution is zero on the interval from one to two, so it's zero. The interval from one to two, so it's zero, so it loses all the energy, and the Nadia-stock solutions don't lose any energy, all right? So the behavior is very, very different. And yeah.
