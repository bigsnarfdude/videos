Yeah, all right. Now, let's try again. How's this? All right, so I spent a few years of my career going around saying that I was a herbist theorist and then I met Hannah and I got tropicalized. And now I'm about to start this new phase of my career where I was a herbist theory and then I got tropicalized and then I met Dhruv and I got him logarithmic. I met Dhroove and I get him logarithmified, right? So, I guess the advice I'll be giving to the young mathematician in our mentoring groups is that math is a brutal endeavor where you get transformed all the time. That is to say, I feel, you know, I was asked to give sort of like an introductory talk, and I feel like one thing that been really intriguing and excited is that these contributions, I mean, I feel pretty comfortable with tautological classes. I do not feel super comfortable with log geometry, but Comfortable with log geometry, but sometimes those are the people that you want to hear an introductory talk from. Some of the people that are the super experts are exactly in this room, like Jonathan, that I always see outside the country, even more than an hour away, and David and Dhruv. And was then not here? And now it's on record. I hear that somebody did that to somebody else. Somebody did that to somebody else at some other conference, but that's another story. Anyway, since we have like 55 minutes before the bell things, let me actually get started. So let me start. I mean, we all, you know, I shouldn't define a moduli space of curve NGN bar, but what I want to focus is I want to think of it mostly as a stratified space. So it's a space made out of a bunch of. out of a collection of locally closed strata, locally closed subbrieties, that parametrize curves that are all homeomorphic to each other. So here is my picture. My favorite moduli space is M bar12, genus1 curves with two marked points. It's a two-dimensional moduli space. It has a dense open set that parametrizes smooth curves, genus 1 curves with two marked points. It has two one-dimensional orbit. It has two one-dimensional orbits, right? This horizontal blue thing that parametrizes an elliptic curve with a little genus zero bubble with two mark points, and this curly thing called irreducible divisors that parametrizes a genus zero curve with four marked points, where then you glue two of these four mark points to get a nodal elliptic curve. Well, a nodal genus, a representative genus one curve with mark points. And then we have two zero-dimensional strata, right? Zero-dimensional strata, right? The green one is what are called the banana curves, right? And I don't know, this orange one looks like a calamari to me, but whatever, right? So the key point is that our moduli space comes chopped into smaller pieces, each that can be described in a geometric way. And the other thing that I want to point out is that moduli spaces are sociable creatures. They don't just hang around in their offices and do math by themselves, right? And do math by themselves, right? But they talk to each other through a bunch of natural tautological morphisms, of which I want to highlight forgetful morphisms, sections, and gluing morphism that I've color-coded, right? So forgetful morphisms will say, okay, if somebody hands you a curve with two marked points and you don't like the second mark point, then delete it and you get a curve with one mark point. And so that gives you a map from, for example, in this case, from n bar 1, 2 to n bar. Case from mbar12 to mbar11. And sometimes what happens is when you delete your point, the curve is not quite acceptable, it's not stable anymore, but there's some canonical thing that you can do to get a stable curve. So we do get this morphism from mgn plus m to mgn box in general. We have sections that basically say, all right, if I have a curve with n mark points, Mark points. I want to look at a curve with one more mark point where I single out a particular mark point. So, what I'm going to do, I'm going to attach a genome zero bubble on that mark point and put that mark point and one another mark point on that bubble. And this gives me basically a map. Again, let's look at this example from M11 bar to N12 bar. That for each elliptic curve, we'll put this. Each elliptic curve, we'll put this geno0 bubble with one and two right where the origin of the two curve is. And echoing mortgages are exactly what it sounds like, right? And this is what makes the boundary stratum, or at least the closure of the boundary stratum, right? So this particular point is this particular boundary stratum is the image of a gluing morphins for a product of m bar03 and m bar03, right? Where you have, you know, somebody calls you in and says, Calls you in and says, Okay, I'm going to order an IKEA, a kit that comes with two rational curves, each with three marked points, label 1, 2, and A on one sphere and B plus and minus on the other. And then the assembly instruction is glue A and B and glue plus and minus. And what you end up getting is this particular point in M12. So far, so good. Great. Am I understanding right? So the section works in this example of the global process. The section is an example of cooling. This section is an example of good. Yes, yes, absolutely. Cool. So this strata are indexed and are easily described by dual graphs. So I'm going to just introduce this notation by one picture, one example, because I think that no actual formal definition of a graph has ever been useful to anybody in history, I think. I've been recorded saying that. I've been recorded saying that, so I'll be hated by a lot of people. But anyway, so dual graphs work like this. If somebody hands you a curve of a given topological type, you record all the topological information by basically getting a vertex for every irreducible component. You label this vertex with the genus of the irreducible component. So here I have a vertex of genus 1. And then every time two components are joined by a node, you put an edge. And for every mark point, you put a edge. And for every mark point, you put an end or a leg or a hat head or whatever you want. And so, in particular, every time somebody hands you a dual graph, this completely identifies a stratum in a particular morte space. Great. And so, what are tautological rings? Tautological rings is an attempt to study intersection theory of the moduli space of curves. Intersection theory of the moduli space of curves, and the attempt that happens after you realize that the full cha ring of moduli space of curves is very, very hard. And so we have very little hope of understanding in a systematic way the cha rings of all moduli space of curves. And so what David Mumford in 1983 kind of kick-started, and then people like Abajel and Cornalba, Fabricande, and many, many more developed was saying, okay, what is Was saying, okay, what is sort of a slice of the intersection theory of moduli six curves, which is simultaneously simple enough that we can have some hope of understanding it and rich enough that we can actually say and do something non-trivial. And they came up with the idea of the tautological ring. And so this lick way to define the tautological ring was introduced by Fleiber-Produced Panden. Was introduced by Fiber and Pandora Pandey and they say, okay, what is the minimal requirement if you want to study a system of subrings of all modulated spaces? Well, they should have the fundamental classes. Otherwise, you have no multiplicative identity in any particular mg and bar. And then because we just said that one thing we like about moduli spaces, that's how sociable they are, is that it should be a system of sub-rings of each ring of each moduli space mt and bar, but this system should be closed under push forward. Should be closed under push-forward via pathological models. And this seems like, okay, that's not a lot to ask, right? But it turns out it builds a really rich subgroup. Now, a somewhat slogan that I want to introduce is that this is also we can think of it, and I'll say it and then I'll say no, I don't agree with myself, right? But I want to think of it as the subring of classes that play well with the certification. That plays well with the certification. So, what do I mean by that? Let me illustrate this by just saying a few examples of classes that are tautological classes. Well, certainly the closure of strata are tautological classes, because we just said it's images of gluimorphism. And I'm seeing Isabel's eyes like, let's fork over Q, right? Coefficients are rational, right? So, I know that there are people. Right, so I know that there are people in this audience that you know refine and think that chau ring should have coefficient in z, and then this is not quite true, but if we work over q, that's not a problem, right? So strata are assuming topological classes, and then there's a bunch of classes that are built out of the relative dualizing sheaf on the modular space, right? And this is a sheaf on the universal curve, right? Roughly speaking, you should think that if you were Roughly speaking, you should think that if you restrict the sheaf to each fiber of the universal curve, you get the cotangent line bundle of that curve. But anyway, it's as natural as it gets of an object, you know. And so what you do is you can construct these classes that, again, I'm not going to tell you what they are, because either you already know or it's not going to be helpful. But because the names are going to come around, you know, this all you need to know is that psi classes are classes of degree one. Classes are classes of degree one, co-dimension one, and this i is corresponds to a particular mark point. So psi i's are classes attached in some moral sense to mark points of co-dimension one. Kappa classes and lambda classes are classes of degree, again, J and K, where K is a subsequent class. All that I would like, you know, again, either you already know this very well. Again, either you already know this very well, or if these are not familiar objects, all that I would like you to take home from this is now that there is very nice combinatorial rules for multiplying all these classes. And this is what I meant by this play well with the stratification. So I can say what happens when a kappa class is multiplied with a stratum, right? And what happens is there is this combinatorial rule that tells you how this That tells you how this kappa class breaks up as a sum of tautological classes on a bunch of stratum. Cool. And so, in particular, these tautological rings, they have a very combinatorial set of generators, right, that was described by Graeber and Pandaripande. So, a set of additive generators for tautological rank of M, G, and bar is given by decorated dual graphs. So, dual graphs identify structures. So, dual graphs identify strata. So, these are going to be classes supported on strata. And they need to be decorated by psi classes and kappa classes. And like I said, psi classes are things that are attached to mark points. And mark points are half edges. And I'm cheating a little bit because, well, so half edges are also their ends. And these are really the marked points on NGN bar. But they're also half of actual edges. Of actual edges, and this corresponds to nodes in the curves. But here, what we should imagine is that these nodal curves are images of tautological morphism. And so, in the source of this tautological morphism, when you pull the various curves apart, the nodes have two inverse images, so two marked points that will become a node. And so you can have psi classes coming from there, and then we push forward the other gluing morphism. Do important things. And so, again, here's an example of one of these generators. It's a dual graph, and then I had fun putting some psi classes on some half edges here, some psi classes on some marked edges, some kappa classes on vertices. And so, you know, because all these classes have nice combinatorial rules for multiplication, like the tautological. Multiplication, like the tautological ring, is the quotient of some, you know, decorated strata algebra. And there's been a rich industry of describing relation, figuring out relation, figuring out properties about the quotient. This is a great story, but it would take me completely astray. So if you want to find out some more, ask Gabby. He's going to be happy to tell you all about it. Or myself. Alright. So what I want to talk about instead is like, okay, there's a whole bunch of other tautological classes that are not so obviously tautological. I mean, all the classes of interest so far, it's really, it's an exercise to see that they're tautological. But what's kind of amazing about a tautological ring is that is that all Is that a lot of classes that you can think of in terms of like, let's look at all curves that satisfy this bunch of natural geometric properties, often they end up being tautological. So for example, I want to focus a character in this story is going to be these double ramification cycles. These are going to be denoted by dr of x, where x is a vector of. Of x, where x is a vector of integers, right? And I'm going to, again, cheatingly, I'm going to build suspense by defining them in half an hour. But what I'm going to tell you right now is that if you restrict this loci to the smooth locus, to the locus of smooth curves, this parametrizes sets of marked curves, C with a bunch of marked points, where the Where the divisor summation of XIPI is principal. So, this is also saying that this is the set of curves with a bunch of marked points where you specify that this curves must emit a rational function that has zeros and poles at these marked points, and you specify the orders of the so this is a very natural condition to put and this This thing defines something that ends up being a topological class on the modular space, of course. I've hesitated a little bit because I've only told you what this thing is on the open modular space. There has been like a 20-year-long evolution of the story of how one should properly define actually a closed locus or a cycle class that is the quote-unquote right way to close up this open double. Way to close up this open double refrigeration locus. Again, I'm not going to get into that, but let me say that one way to compactify is to say, okay, because on the open locus, these are curves that emit maps to P1 with a given set of zeros and poles, let's compactify. One way to compactify is by doing relative stable maps. And these are maps not necessarily just to P1, but possibly to a chain of relative stable. But possibly to a chain of rational curves. Yeah. Basically, for the P is the n-vector? Yes, yes. Sorry. So these P are the mark points, right? And these X are the coefficients, right? Yeah. So relative stable maps, the kind of degeneration that we allow, they're not just maps to a single P1, but possibly to a chain of P1. The zero and the infinity, they sort of end up spreading out. Sort of end up spreading out on the opposite ends of the chain. And we just want a map to each component. And every time you join a component, you have this thing called the Kissinger condition. Again, why us mathematicians are considered romantics? All right. Anyway, this is, I mean, it's not obvious at all that this is a tautological class, but it is, right? Other examples of tautological classes are. Of tattological classes are curved loci, right? So, when at least when, so loci of curves that admit a map to P1, where is genus 0, with given ramification and profile, and genus 0 remoteness cycles. Again, might have heard these words or not. This is all to say that even though the definition of tautological ring was very simple-minded, it contains a lot of instruments. A lot of these things. Great. So, and now I'm. Do I contradict myself? Yes, I contradict myself. I am best, I can take multitudes. So these tautological classes don't always play well with stratifications. So, and here's the example. So, let me consider a double ramification cycle of genus one. So, this is going to be generically parametrized curves. Parametrize curves that emit a map to P1. My vector, my profile is minus DD, so this map of D is the 3D, and it will have one zero of order D, one pole of order D. So the little picture is this one. Otherwise, it's the feature. Very well, very common. Yeah. That's what you can do with a microphone. All right, so this is the degeneric element. And what would I expect? So again, you can do a little Riemann-Hurbitz dimension. You can do a little with Riemann-Hurbit's dimension count. This is a locus of dimension one. So, locus of dimension one in M12 bar, because these are genus one curves with two more points. And so, what would it mean to play well with the stratification? Well, if you chuck a curve into a stratified surface, what you would imagine is this curve to intersect the one-dimensional stratic points and to miss the. And to miss the zero-dimensional strata. And the double recognition cycle fails at both. It both contains one of the one-dimensional strata completely, because there's one particular component of this double amplification cycle that parametrizes curves that look like this. I have a genus zero curve with a map, which is essentially y equals x to the d. y equals x to the d, and then at some point you attach an elliptic curve and the map contracts the elliptic curve. And because the complex structure and the elliptic curve can vary arbitrarily, you can actually trace any point in this section. And on the other hand, it also intersects this banana locus, this codimension to stratum, because when you degenerate a cover that looks like this in a red That looks like this in a relative stable maps way, you actually acquire two mark points because of this Kissing condition we ask. So you get two rational curves that are attached at two points. And so the fact that this ontological classes don't play well with the stratification is a reason to want to do something about it. To want to do something about it. And log geometry is one of the some things that you can try to do about it. And so the rest of the talk is going to try to like, again, give an idea of how a log geometry can try to fix something like this. So let me also say, okay, what are the examples of the things that are that go wrong? And what are the examples of things that got fixed that go fixed? So this is a result by Aaron Pixton and Johanna Schmidt, right? Pixton and Johanna Schmidt, right? And so, because this double ramification cycle on the open part of the modules, did I get the attribution wrong? Yeah. Is David as well? David as well. Sorry. No worries. I was like preparing my slides as I... I bet I'm forgetting somebody, and I stupidly did not check. But you know, it's an iPad. I can even like. I can even like look. This is so exciting. There you go. Thank you. Thank God I saw immediately Rosa's knicker when I forgot you. I knew what had gone on. Rosa was like, yes, my revenge on my advisor. Alright, sorry. So, uh, back on track. So that contract. This Law Safe curve, they parametrize curves with a bunch of marked points that support a principal device. So you would expect to satisfy this natural relation. Because if you know that summation of xi pi is principal, and summation of yi pi is principal, also summation of xi plus yi pi should be principal. Simple as that. Simple as that, right? And so you would expect if you intersect back to my pointer. If you intersect the locus where the XIPI is principal and the locus where the YIPI is principal, it should be the same as requiring XIPI to be principal and XI plus YIPI to be principal. It should be the same. But it's not. You can actually check that in the modulus piece of curves, this will. That in the modulus piece of curves, this relation does not hold. But this relation magically gets restored if you go from dr to this thing called log. All right, so what is log dr? Well, hang on tight and last time I'll do yes. Oh, they're not the same class. So sorry, I am talking about at this point like classes, like so they're not the same class. Like, so they're not the same class. You can find, you can describe them very explicitly, can give formulas, you can intersect, you can check that it's not the same. So then Render only defined it on the looks of smooth codes and then they argue. But like the definition that Brenda never told us as to what's your boundary, that's what went wrong. Okay, so this definition, yeah, it's working. This I've kind of told you, which one possible definition is by relative stable maps. And so you can, and this is, and it's a little bit annoying because you have relative. A little bit annoying because you have relative simulats, you need to go and do virtual classes and yada yada yada. But there is a definition, and with this definition, this doesn't work. There's other definitions, and this still doesn't work in MGFR. But if you sort of enhance it to this log world, it will work. And again, not yet going to tell you what this is, but I'm getting there before the reality. Before we get to the point of the market that this is also yeah, this is also going to be true if you take the Zeroesky closure. It's not going to be true. But I would have to double check. I'm sure that it does not work with the relative stable case. Okay, so let me before I oh, of the locus in the open part of the modulator space. So yeah, yeah, so there's one natural thing that one could just do. Natural thing that one could just do is like when, when, so this little bit of history is like Eliasberg was the person that said, like, what is the right way to compactify this locus of curves that support a given principal divisor? And the natural way that algebraic geometers would be like, well, take this origin closure, right? This would be the closure by admissible covers. And then this closure end up not satisfying a bunch of sort of natural properties that you would expect of this family of class. That you would expect of this family of classes. In particular, it did not play well with Eliasper's inflective field theory construction. And so somehow this got discarded as not the right way to close the example. Yeah. In your M12 variability, if you say x is 1 minus 1 and y is 0, then that technology also fails when there is eclipsing. Cool. So, yeah, it's cool. Thank you. Great. Okay, so I want to get to tell you what this log dr is, but I want to say a few words about what is log geometry for a non-log geometry. And I'm going to ask all the geometer in the audience to plug your ears and cover your eyes. But the place I want to start is Torque Geometry. So what are the things that we like about Torque Browsers? So here's my little diagram with our favorite Torque browser. My little diagram with our favorite torque variety, P2, with its fan, right? And then the blow-up of P2 at a torque's fixed point with its fan. So, torque varieties are stratified, just like modularities of curves. There is this combinatorial bijection between orbits of the torus action on toric varieties and cones in the fan of toric varieties. So, this thing called the orbit of torture. Friday, so this thing called the orbit cone correspondence. There is a sort of feedback from the combinatorial data to the geometry, as in given by the fact that if you subdivide some cones, you get some birational morphism toward variety. Like you subdivide a cone that corresponds to a blob, but subdivisions. And these three things I think we've all known and loved ever since we were quite a colleague. I don't know. Kindergarten like that, right? Mathematical kindergarten. The fourth thing, though, that it's going to be very important for us, it's maybe a little bit more sophisticated, which is that if you look at the equivariant comology of a toric variety, it can be described through the Atiabo. Through the Atiya-Baud localization theorem, as the ring of piecewise polynomial functions on the fan of the torque fragment. And again, if you're familiar with the Taboth, this is very natural. If you're not familiar, please take it as a black box for now and then we can chat over coffee. And then, of course, every time you have a covariant homology, you can turn the equivariance off. Turn the covariance off, so you get a map to the child ring of a toilet variety. And so we have this map from this very combinatorial algebraic and combinatorial thing, so piecewise polynomials on the fan of a tort variety, to the channel of the total power. And from my perspective, log geometry is that magic wand that, you know, proof and David and Jonathan. And David and Jonathan, and the other Locke board want the wave for us so that we can get some of these things that we like so much about target varieties. And then I was just crediting the log geometers of the words and thanking them for giving us the possibility, so people like them as well, giving us the possibility to use or modulate specific curves these things that we lost. Of the curve of curves, these things that we love about torxons, right? So again, going back to my little running example, M12 bar, it's stratified. So one can use, and it has in particular a boundary which is a divisor with normal crossing. And so one, in particular, can put a divisorial log structure, which means that basically you just put a bunch of monoids over this, you know, that are locally constant on each strata. Constant in each strata. Sorry, not geometers. But what this gives you is really like then you look at where these monoids are locally constant and you associate to each modoid a cone and then you have specialization morphism among monoid and that gives you gluing on cones. And so what this happens is that from this stratified space you get this cone complex, which is called the Artin fan of Of the log scheme, right? And this cone complex plays the role of the fan of the torque curve. Incidentally, this cone complex is the same thing as a moduli space of tropical curves. Because, well, the things that index these cones are dual graph of strata. And then these cones end up having sort of a dimension. ends up having sort of a dimension which is equal to the number of compact edges and tropical curves are again now Hannah is gonna have to close her ears and eyes tropical curves are dual graphs of stable curves plus lengths on edges and so there is this connection between sort of this this combinatorial gadget that comes from putting the devsorial log structure modules the curves and this this tropical model. And this tropical modular space. And then, as the other thing that we recover from torque varieties is that piecewise polynomials on this Arctic fan, on this tropical moduli space, will give you Chow classes on the modulus discursive. There is a map from P-suis polynomial to the Chao ring of the modulus discerned. This map is neither injective nor subjective, but it's Injective nor subjective, but it's nonetheless a map. So it's one way to access certain kind of classes. So let me talk a little bit about. Sorry, any questions here? I'd be happy to turn any question you ask me to the Log Geometer. Okay. Any corrections? I mean, any correction will probably require a lecture in and of itself. Any questions on Zoom? Any questions on Zoom? Any questions? Zoom. Okay. So again, I hope that this can, for somebody who's not had the luck to be hanging around with the grooves of the world for a long time, that this has a little bit the effect of saying like, L look, this is a very nice car and this is how you digitize the ignition, right? And this is the it's automatic, so it drives on its own, right? And not telling you anything about it. Not telling you anything about it. Cool. Alright, so let's do a little bit of warm-up on how these piecewise polynomials give you chow classes on the model that's right. So if you have a ray in one of these arcing tens, and you end up having lucky u a piecewise linear function Linear function that has slope 1 along this ray and slope 0 anywhere else, right? Then this piecewise linear function, as in torque geometry, just corresponds to the boundary divisor that is dual to this ray. So rays correspond to divisors, and a piecewise in a function, well because the internal geometry is a divisor. And so then, you know, if you take a pieceless polynomial function, If you take a pieceless polynomial function, which is the square of this ray, it will be sort of the square of this divisor. And so if this divisor does not have any self-intersection, this is, for example, the divisor, and then pair with the other class of the normal bundle of the divisor X. And if you have two rays that span a two-dimensional cone, Rays that span a two-dimensional cone, and you have a piecewise polynomial function which is the product of two pieces in their function, then you get the intersection of the two. So far, so good. If the ray sorry, if the divisor I'm talking about has self-intersection, which means that there could be a two-dimensional cone which is which has the Which has the two rays that are the same ray, that things are a little bit more complicated, but they can be understood. So, here's sort of like a little cartoon picture to understand it, right? So, if I have a divisor with self-intersection and I want to self-intersect it, then one thing that you might do is you say, okay, I'm going to normalize the divisor. I'm going to pull apart the self-interception. Now I can deform it. Now I can deform it by a section. I can wiggle it. I can take the normal bundle, take a section of the normal bundle, this light blue one, and I have some points of intersections. But now let me put this picture, this dark blue and light blue picture, back with the normalization map. And what I see is that there is two kinds of intersections in here. There's the green ones that are ones that come from the intersection. The intersection of the formed sections. And there is these two red points, which are kind of like just happening because there was a transversal self-intersection here happening. And so, you know, my deformed section will get two points of intersection between the blue and the dark blue kind of curves that are not appearing. Are not appearing here. And so now these pieces polynomial functions will notice the difference between these two kinds of intersections. So the cross term will actually capture this sort of like transversal self-intersection part. And the sort of Newton part, the square part, will notice the part which comes from the Euler class on the normal bundle of normalization. Euler class on a normal bundle of normalization. So there's, again, there's a little bit of, this is not obvious, there is some work to be done, but just to say that there is some calculus that one can really get their hands on and work with this calculus. Okay, next slide is: well, what do I actually mean by COS polynomial? It's a polynomial in pieces. Polynomial in pieces, but what are these pieces? And one thing that you can say is like, okay, the pieces should be the cones of this art content. And then the kind of things that you're getting are strata, products of strata, this kind of phenomenon where you separate kind of parts of the self-intersection of strata, so on and so forth. But another thing that you can say, you can relax this condition, and you can say, what if we allow the domain of polynomiality to not just be whole cones, but you allow yourself to subdue it? Whole cones, but you allow yourself to subdivide cones. So what if I slide that skip? More example. What if, for example, right, in this m12 bar, I take this piecewise polynomial function, which is the notation is this is, I'm thinking of this as a quadrant of the plane, where this is my x-axis and this is my y-axis. Take the piecewise polynomial function, which is the minimum of x1. So it's polynomial on this region of the plane, it's polynomial on this region of the plane, and it breaks polynomiality along this ray. And it's a piecewise linear function with slope 1 along this ray and slope 0 along every point. Again, if this were not log geometry but were toric geometry, But erotoric geometry, and this was the fan of C2, you would immediately know what to do. This is the blow of C2 at the origin, and this piecewise linear function is the class of the exact logobots. And so the magic is that the same exact thing happens. So we're going to be obtaining, so the piecewise linear function given by this minimal x and y will give the class of the exceptional divisor. Exceptional divisor in the blow up of M1 bar2 at the codimension two stratum that corresponds to this two-dimensional column. Okay, so at this point, if we're willing to break the domain of polynomiality of our pieceless polynomial function, we're now we're no longer working with mg and bar. Working with Mgn bar, but we're working with a system of birational spaces to Mgn bar, where you allow yourself to do all sorts of like blow-ups or weighted blow-ups along strata, proper transform of strata, and so on and so forth. And so instead of doing intersection theory on Mg and bar, what you need to do is you need to do intersection theory on this directed system, on this directed system of modulation. This directed system of moduli spaces, of curves. And the logarithmic Chow ring of n gen bar, by definition, is the limit of the chow ring of this directed system. A class is going to be a class on some logarithmic modification of ng and bar. And then once you have it there, if you further blow up, you just pull it back. Blow up, you just pull it back. Great, and so now I can tell you about this logarithmic double replication cycles, which is an element that lives in this logarithmic child ring. And also, I mean, again, if you're like, oh, this is horrible because now it's not just living anywhere, but it just needs to live in this direct system. Well, it's not quite so bad because for any particular choice, For any particular choice of ramification vector x, you can actually find a specific finite model where you can actually have this class be. And how does this work? So this is also sort of the definition of the double ramification cycle that Jonathan and Stephanie and David gave. Gave way back when, a few years ago, right? Which is which is saying, okay, how do let's reboot a little bit our definition of double reification cycle on the open locus, right? So we said is the locus of curves where a given divisor summation of XIPI is principle. I can interpret this with this diagram, right? I can take Mgn, I can take universal Picard, pick GN over Mgn. Pick GN over NGN. And I have two sections from NGN to pick GN. One section is the identity, the zero section. It says that for every curve Cp, I assign to it the, and sorry, which should be the peak zero. I assign to this curve the trivial line bundle. And then I can take the section sigma x that to every curve c, t assigns the line bundle all of. All of summation of XIPI. And so the double ramification locus is the intersection of the image of these two sections, or if you want, the pullback of one via the other. And then what happens is you'd like to extend this to Mgn bar. And what happens when you try to extend this to Mgn bar is that the zero section is perfectly well defined because there is a trivial L Mando, but the other section But the outer section becomes a rational section. So it's not well-defined. And so the insight of logarithmic geometry is that, okay, you can actually perform a logarithmic modification of MgN bar and you can get a moduli space which is which dominates Mgnar. Which dominates Mgnbar. And you can extend the universal pic on this thing in such a way that the Abel-Jacobi section extends, right? And then you can actually define this log DR as the pullback hip is your section of the Abel Jacobi section. And again, there's a lot of technical work that goes into making this honest, right? But it worked. So this is what essentially what logarithmic, again, my slogan is what logarithmic geometry did for us, is allowing us to do what we wanted to do and we couldn't begin. Extend this resolution. But the price to pay is that depending on the x, you might have to choose a different logarithmic minimification with more density. But we also have a systematic way to make this choice. To make this choice. Okay, so let me illustrate again an example of an application of this logarithmic towering that is sort of pretty close to my heart because it's work with Dhruv and Hannah, which is one thing that I've been working on for a long time is sort of understanding double Hurvis numbers in a geometric way, right? And so double Herbie's numbers, this count. Numbers, this account maps of curves to P1, where you specify what the order of zero and poles of these maps are, and then you fix a bunch of branch points, and you say, well, all the other ramifications need to be simple, and you have to map over these fixed branches. It's an enumerated problem that has had a lot of interesting sort of both geometric and combinatorial. Both geometric and combinatorial evolution. But in particular, you can also think of this as a zero-dimensional cycle in the moduli space of curves, a set of curves that emit match these properties. And so one thing that would be nice is to have this description of this zero-dimensional cycle as some sort of nice intersection theoretic expression in the topological ring of the modulus concerns. And this thing has. And this thing had eluded us for a very long time. I remember years where Han and Druvai were coming up with this progressively more contrived way of cutting down Douglas of these numbers. And the reason is that there was a nice way to impose the condition of the ramification over zero infinity, this is dr or whatever you want, but there wasn't really a nice way to impose the condition of Nice way to impose the condition of fixing the other branch loci because this was sort of something that came from the map. It was something that you could easily get if you allow yourself some sort of branch morphism to another moduli space, to moduli space of targets, moduli space of divisor, but it was not something that the moduli space of curves seem to know. And so now, what this logarithmic technology allows us to do is allow us to say, okay, To do, it's allows us to say, okay, well, there is one way to let the moduli space of curves know about this branch divisor, but the price to pay is, again, you have to go to this enhanced log version. So let me state the theorem and then illustrate it with a couple pictures in an example. And so the theorem says that there is a piecewise polynomial function called v sub x. function called v sub x that lives in the logarithmic child ring of the moduli space of curves such that the double Hurbis number is the degree of this zero-dimensional cycle which is obtained by intersecting the logarithmic double remote cycle with this piecewise polynomial function. And then for people like me and Hannah that like to actually compute things and like tropical geometry, it's nice to know It's nice to know that this piecewise polynomial function and the finite modification of the modulus curve that supports this double modification cycle are explicitly determined by this tropical double modification cycle. So there is this tropical geometric version of the theory that somehow contains all the all the instructions to run the log geometry. To run the log geometry to get the right answer. So let me, again, this might feel a little bit mysterious, so let me just illustrate it in this example. So let's go back to our genus 1, 2 mark point case, right? And let me tell you that the genus 1 degree 3 fully ramified double herbit number is 2. Find your favorite method. And I want to attain this, this 2, I want to attain it as an intersection of a piecewise polynomial function with log dr. And so I start by looking at regular dr and I say, okay, regular dr is pretty bad. It goes, it contains this divisor and it intersects this other divisor. Intersects this other divisor, and actually, because I mentioned two strata, it's kind of hard for me to control its intersection. So, what I'm going to do, I'm going to look at the moduli space of tropical covers. Here we go. So, tropical covers are just sort of piecewise linear version of algebraic covers, right? So, there's a map from a graph of genus 1 to a line. Of genus 1 to a line, right? And sort of the ramifications should be taught as the weights of n's. And so I want 3 over minus infinity and 3 over plus infinity because that is sort of the condition we put for double-reaching cycle. And then I'm going to ask for trivalent vertices, and I'm going to ask for the balancing condition. And the only picture I can draw is really this whiteness. Is really this one, this kind of Egyptian eye kind of thing, right? So we're 3, 3, 2, and 1. And then I say, okay, this is a ray because I can choose a length here, however I want. And this ray, actually, if I look in the locus of tropical curves, M1, 2, at the image of this ray, it's this ray with slope sort of 1 half. Slope sort of one half in the lower corner of this modulus basically. And so because the tropical moduli space of covers subdivides this cone, this is telling me, okay, what you should do, you should do a weighted in this case. There's some nasty stackiness that I don't want to talk about here, but some blow-up of this fixed point. Fixed point and sort of obtain a new moduli space by rational modification of m12 bar. And now the property that this has is that now it has transversalized the intersection of this double ramification cycle with the boundary. In a sense, that the double ramifications cycle does not intersect, I mean, sorry, it intersects the It intersects the boundary dimensionally transverse components. And then what we can do is we can say, okay, well, now I can actually pick a piecewise linear function, namely I can pick the piecewise linear function that has slope 1 along this ray and slope 0 everywhere else. And this piecewise linear function will have the property of. Will have the property of having one point of intersection with the R. We see two here, but they're two halves. Under the right is what's happening. And now what happens is that, okay, so I can give this piecewise function slope equal to the product of the internal edges of the graphs that are parametrized by the tropical modulus because it curves. By the tropical modulus Gaza curves. And if you do that, then that intersection number all of a sudden becomes a weighted sum over graphs that 10 years ago we had proven is a way to compute the Hertz dump. And so basically, like, you know, it was, I have to say that for us, maybe this was very anticlimactic because we worked very, very hard to basically. To basically reverse engineer a theorem we had proven 10 years ago. But then it's, you know, if you think about it, it was very satisfactory because it's like, okay, this theorem that 10 years ago was a little bit of this combinatorial magic, now it has a very natural sort of geometrical implication. And so my last slide is that once you learn to stop worrying and love the log, then a whole wealth of And a whole wealth of new enumerative geometric problems open up. So, something that we've been explored with Truve and Hanna, Johann and Schmidt, is all these variations of Herbit's numbers where you can impose only a partial amount of branch condition, so you don't fix all the branch points, but only part of them, and then you have room to put other classes, your favorite classes. Put other classes, your favorite classes, psi classes, lambda classes. Another thing that we've been sort of able to explore is instead of like working on these double ramification cycles that parametrize actually maps to P1, where the branch condition actually makes sense, you can look at this double ramification cycle that parametrizes curves where the device or XIPI is linearly equivalent to some power. Linearly equivalent to some power of the canonical device, or the non-canonical device. These are all, you know, sort of, these are very nice cycle classes, they're tautological. There's no natural algebraic branch morphism, but there is somehow a tropical or logarithmic branch morphism that allows you to play the same things. And all these variations of Herfield's numbers end up having all the nice properties that you expect. That you expect of them. So they're piecewise polynomial, there's nice modular wall crossings, they're computed as vacuum expectations on some Fox space, and they all come with like sort of a tropical computational microphone. So in conclusion, for me, this sort of perspective has really opened up a whole new area of investigation in the areas of enumerative geometry. And I'll move to average. That said, Paul had please. Thank you so much. Questions? Why do you write leaky or is it good or not? Yeah, so the reason we write leaky is I didn't talk much at all about the tropical version, right? But these tropical covers of P1, they're these networks of... There are these sort of networks of pipes, right? It's this sort of graph that you think of network of pipes, and the balancing condition that they satisfy can be expressed as a certain amount of water comes in, a certain amount of water comes out, and at every moment the water is preserved. So this technically is a condition of harmonicity of these maps of graphs. When instead of like doing sort of the tropical version of maps, you do the tropical version of these sections of pluricanical bundles. Bundles. Then what ends up happening is that what you're looking at is again these trivalent graphs with a certain amount of water coming in, a certain amount of water coming out, but at every vertex, the balance condition is broken by a prescribed amount. So the amount of water that comes out is, in the Kx case, the first one, is exactly one less than the one that comes in. And so we're saying that in this case, it leaks one at every vertex. leaks one at every vertex. It's like so does it not depend on the power of the power power. Sorry. It depends, right? So when k when it's just one times k, then it leaks one. When it's m times k, the extent that every trace of the matrix. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Well, I'm terrified about it. It's awesome. So you said that the proof that you gave is. So you said that the proof that you gave is sort of a, oh, and this is formula we can ten years ago. Is it possible to give a very naive intuition as to the why? No, it is possible. And the idea is essentially that so you have this map from, if you look algebraically, right, that you have this map from the moduli space of radiism maps to this Laos and Manin space. This loads of money space, right? But then, you know, you also have a map in the log category to this space, stack of target expansions. And the double Ramis numbers, you can think of it as the degree of the pullback of the class of a point from Rosen-Manin, which you can think of as like a total degeneration, right? The maximal chain degeneration. And that is now, you look at it in the target expansion thing, and that's like, oh, look, this is. Thing and that's like, oh, look, this is a sign. You can describe this as the piece. The argument of this thing is just one orthant, and you just take the square free monomial with all the variables, right? And I think it corresponds to that stratum. It's that stratum, correct? Yeah. And then all you do is you say, okay, if I pull that back here, the tropical branch morphism, what this was full-donald function does it give us? And then you observe that these are the grandmorphs. Observe that these are the graphs that arise, and then you put the multiplicity. And looking multiplies. Yeah. I mean, there's always multiplies are always the bane of our existence, right? Yeah, that's essentially my question. Is there another question there? Sam? Any other questions? Other questions on Zoom? Thank you. Unmute yourself. All right, there are no zoom questions, no in-person questions, and we can do in-person thanking. Is something in the chat? I think that's been there for a while. All right, well, thanks, Brenda.
