Capital X is the position vector of the hypersurface M of T. So essentially the position vector moving in the direction of normal and f is a curvature function. So for closed hypersurfaces and sub t. So in this talk, So, in this talk, for closed one, new points inside, it's inside normal. And for non-compact type of surfaces, new points upward. So that's a sentimental for this top. So if it's a cold surface, our new is our normal direction is this. And then if we are talking about a non-compact hypersurface, Compact hypersurface new is always pointing upward. Okay, so first let's go over some well-known result. So in this case, F equals H, which is the mean curvature, that's a very well-known mean curvature flow. And in 1984, we can show that if we start from cold and convex. A closed and convexed hypersurface, then the flow exists for a finite time. And moreover, under suitable rescaling, the flow goes to a sphere, which means that we have a closed convex hyper surface, we slow it, and then in finite time it disappears at a point. And then if we rescale, And then if we rescale around this point, we'll see that this point is actually a sphere. So that's Huiskins right now. And then in 1998, Gerhardt showed the following inverse curvature flow. So in this case, Gerhardt showed that again, we start from a closed We start from a closed initial hypersurface, but he doesn't require this hypersurface is convex. He requires that this hypersurface is star-shaped, which means that you can rewrite this hypersurface as a graph of a sphere. So he required that it's a closed and a star-shaped. Then he showed that the flow. That the flow 1 exists for all time, and under suitable refitting, the flow goes to a sphere again. So, here our sigma k is the k elementary symmetric polynomial. It's defined like this. And then it's very easy to see that when k equals 1, it's just for sigma 1, it's just the summation of kappa n. So this. Of copper i. So this gives us the mean curator flow. I mean, gives us the mean curvature flow. And then for sigma 2, it's a summation for kappa i, kappa j, i is not equal to j. So actually this gives us a scalar coefficient. And then for sigma n, it's kappa 1 times kappa 2. Kappa 1 times kappa 2 and then t of kappa n. So this actually gives us our Gauss curvature. So then sigma k is our kth curvature. So here that's a definition of sigma k. So what Gerhard showed is, okay, we start from a closed hypersurface and then we flow by speed equals the negative sigma. equals the negative sigma k to the negative 1 over k. When k equals 1, that's the inverse mean coefficient. So he showed that, okay, and this flow, so essentially this closed hypersurface become larger and larger and then it exists for all time. And he also showed that under suitable rescaling it goes to SN. That means that in the process it's it In the process, it goes larger and larger, it also goes rounder and rounder. So let's go have a readout. The next one F equals sigma, which is the Gauss curvature. So for Gauss curvature flow, Andrews showed that if we start with a closed strictly convex surface, because he only Because he only started n equals 2. And then the flow 1 exists for finite time. Moreover, and the situation scaling, it goes to sphere. So Andrews only proved the Gauss curvature flow for n equals 2. So for general n, in 2013, one Ni showed that if we One knee showed that if we start from a closed strictly convex hypersurface, and then the flow, the Gauss culture flow exists for a finite time. Moreover, under suitable rescaling, they can show that M sub t goes to M tilde, where M tilde is a self-shrinker satisfying the following equation. So they don't know if So they don't know if after rescale they showed that the flow exists and they also showed that the flow converge I mean under suitable rescaling it converges and they can prove that it converges to a hypersurface satisfies this equation but they could not confirm that this actually a sphere. A sphere. So they basically get every ingredient itself. They don't know that if this is a sphere. It's very easy to verify that sphere satisfies this equation because for sphere x dot nu equals minus one because here my nu is inward normal and x is pointing outside. pointing out side. So x dot nu equals minus one. So it's very easy to verify that okay sphere is M sphere satisfies this equation, but we don't know that if that's a unique solution for this equation. So they don't know if m tilde have to be a sphere or not. Okay, so this is their result. And Okay, so in 2017, Brenda Troy and Daska Laplace proved that M tilde is a sphere when we are talking about Gaussian curvature flow. So actually they showed a more general result. Actually I think they showed that I think they show that minus the x star nu equals the sigma n to the power of alpha. So they show that when alpha greater than or equal to 1 over n, the solution has to be a sphere. I mean you need to double check if it's exactly 1 over n, I forgot. So, but I know that when alpha greater than or equal to 1 over, Know that when alpha greater than or equal to 1 over n, the solution definitely has to be a sphere. Okay, so however, not all self-shrinker have to be sphere. So they also showed that when the power is 1 over m plus 2, then m tilde can be ellipsoid. So other words that So, other words, that solution to this equation is not unique. You can find infinitely many ellipsoids that satisfies this equation. So, other words, that if you study the Gauss culture flow, actually it's 1 over n plus 2 times Î¼. If you study this culture flow, you can Culture flow, you cannot say that after rescaling, your limit has to be a spherical. You can only say that, okay, the limit is one of those ellipsoids. Okay, so that's uh lots of uh results about uh uh closed cultural flow, uh just like uh warm up because uh Warm up because in general people are more familiar with closed culture flow. Okay, so next we are going to move on to non-compact cultural flows. Okay, so we still start with the mean culture flow. So in 1989, Eicher and Whitkin showed that if M0 is the entire graph. If M0 is the entire graph, the height and the gradient of M0 have polynomial growth rate, then flow 1 exists for all the time. So what they started is incorrect of flow, but instead of flowing a closed hypersurface, they flow a graph like this. And they have some restriction on. Restriction on the graph. So the height of the initial graph have to be polynomial growth, which means that you can't have a graph like e to the x, that type of thing. And then the gradient of the initial graph have to be polynomial as well. And then they show that, okay, for you give me. Okay, for you give me this type of graph, then they can show that the mean curvature flow of this graph exists forever. But they don't have any convergence result or something like that. They just have a long time existence result for this type of non-compact flow. Okay, so a very natural question to ask is why they needed to assume growth. Need to assume growth rates. So here they want to assume growth rate is because they need to use the maximum principle. So for all those culture flow closed one I talk about, pretty much you have to use the maximum principle to get estimates in order to prove the existence and the convergence of the flow. So maximum principle is a very important tool. Principle is a very important tool in studying flow equations. But for non-compact subject, in general, one do not have a maximum principle. You have to add an extra condition in order to apply maximum principle. There there there is uh no uniform maximum principle for noncompact uh objects. Non-compact object. So, in this case, they have to assume the polynomial growth so that they tailored a specific version of maximum principle for this case. Okay. And then in 1997, Iker himself started. Eicher himself studied the mean curvature flow in Minkowski space. So, in this case, he proved something very similar. So, he proved that if the initial surface is arbitrary spaced like the graph, then the flow 1 exists for all time. So, because he's doing things in Minkowski space, so our graph you So our graph yield is space-like because the space-like graph, the induced metric, space-like graph is the Riemannian metric, otherwise it's not. So it's very natural just to start this space-like graph, mean cost, and then he showed that flow one exists. Flow one exists for all time. So it's, as we can see, that the condition in Mikovsky space is less restrictive than the condition in Euclidean space. So why this happens? Because we can see that for a space like graph, Graph, you know, the height function is automatically kind of bounded because your gradient is always less than one, so your height function cannot be exponentially gross for sure. So, here he doesn't need that condition. And more importantly, he He didn't prove the existence as a whole. What he did was the proof is done by solving the corresponding boundary value problems on increasing the length of radiance k and selecting a convergence subsequence of solutions for k goes to infinity. So he just actually showed the Just actually showed the existence of mean curvature flow on different balls of, and then the radiance got larger and larger. So on each ball, there's long-time existence. Then he just needed to show that those solutions converges to an entire solution. Then that's it. So he didn't need a maximum principle for the entire domain. Domain, so that's a difference. Okay, the last result I'm going to talk about is when f equals negative h to the negative one, this is the inverse curvature flow. And then in 2022, that's called plus and which can show that. And who is can show that if we have an entire convex graph M0, which satisfies the following condition. So the first restriction is on the height, and then the second restriction essentially is on the mean curvature. So basically So basically what they are saying is okay if we have an initial graph is which uh you know which is uh in between of this uh two columns. Two columns. Then, in finite time, if we flow by inverse mean coefficient of flow, the graph just converges to a hyperplane, that's it. So that's their result. And of course there are as I mentioned that uh they they have some requirement uh on the curvature. Requirement on the curvature. Because usually you start the non-compact curvature flow in order to get a convergence result. For the initial hypersurface, we usually need some restriction on the curvature. Otherwise, it's very hard to get a convergence result. Maybe one can get a long time existence. Having these tests. Not have an avoidance principle there. So, I mean, you start it between these two sort of piecewise flat graphs, which are fixed under the mean curvature flow, right? But then somehow when you're evolving, it's a little bit more. Actually, they rewrite the cone into like something like a into like uh something like uh r of t times x, rough roughly speaking, something like that. But maybe they add something to smooth it, I forgot. But actually they then they flow this thing and the inverse will flow. And then actually this thing gonna go to flat, they go to become flat together. Okay. Okay, so this is some history about cultural flow. I'm kind of slow because I figure basically no one works in this area here, so I'm kind of slow. So okay, let's talk about our direct motivation. So in 2015, So in 2015, Andrews, Chen, Feng, and Mikoy started the curvature flow problem in Minkowski space for curvature function f equals lowercase f to the power of alpha. Here, the lowercase f satisfies a lot of conditions, so we can just think the lowercase f as sigma n over sigma n. To the power of 1 over n. So it's just the Gauss coefficient to the power of 1 over n. We can just think f plus this. There f is slightly more general, but not that much. Okay, so they started with the the curvature flow with the curvature function equals this. Function equals this and they showed that if the initial hypersurface is co-compact space like locally strictly convex, then equation one exists for all time. And after rescaling, mt goes to m tilde. And m tilde is a future time-like. Time like hyperboloid. So, this is their result. So, one natural question is: you know, what is co-compact mean? And the next natural question one may ask what's so special about future time-like hypobloid. Okay, so uh Okay, so so let's uh uh explain it. So what is co-compact? Co-compact is the definition of co-compact is following. So we let a G be a subgroup of asymmetry group of Minkowski space. And actually our initial hypersurface is Hypersurface is a fixed point of this subgroup. And moreover, the quotient space is compact. Then we say that M0 is co-compact. So the technical advantage is that we can apply maximum principle as in the closed case. So that's why they need the assumption of co-compact, as I mentioned before. One of the problem of One of the problems of starting non-compact culture flow is that you don't have a maximum principle to use. You have to add additional restrictions on the initial hypersurface in order to have some maximum principle. And usually you cannot have maximum principle on the hand. Usually you need to just uh tailor a version of your own. So so but uh here they use a cold compact, then they avoid all the trouble, they just do it directly. And just do it directly. Okay. So, why they were interested in studying this type of flow, this is go back to 2004, Cho and Hamilton introduced the following cross-curvature flow. So, the flow defined as following. Flowing. So here it's a flow of the metric. It's like a Ricci flow, but not a Ricci flow. So here the Xij is the normalized einstant tensor. So that's the cross curvature flow. So so what w one want to understand that uh what this uh what is the limit of this uh metric, right? Of this metric, right? So the Andrews Chen Feng and Mikui showed that in the locally embedded case, which means that you can actually embedding your metric into the Minkowski space, I mean more specifically. So anyway, in the locally embedded case, the solution of cross-curvature flow with negatively curved initial metric is precisely. Is precisely the induced metric of the solution of Gauss curvature flow in Minkowski space. So, Gauss curvature flow in Minkowski space is essentially just a special case of the cross-curvil flow. Okay, so in particular, they proved that the evolving hypersurfaces and the Gauss. Hypersurfaces and the Gauss curvature flow approach the hyperboloid modular scaling. So, therefore, the metric approaches hyperbolic metric modular scaling. So, which means that they proved that under a very special case, this cross-curvature flow goes to, I mean, after scaling, goes to hyperbolic metric. So that's essentially what Andrews and his collaborators prove. Okay, so next we are talking, we want to talk about what's so special about hyperboloid. So we just go back to our flow, right? So our flow is Xt equals the Gauss curvature times the Curvature times the normal direction, right? So, so because here we are specifically talking about the Gauss curvature. Okay, so if the hypersurfaces move homothetically, then we can rewrite the position vector as phi of t times the x naught, right? So if we assume that the flow hypersurface just rescaling under time. Just rescaling under time, which means that the solution looks like this. And one can show that if m sub t is a homothetic solution to this equation 2 for all time, then x naught equals satisfies sigma n equals minus x naught times mu naught. So where nu naught is upward normal right. So here we call it a self-expander. Before when we talk about a closed curvature flow, we talk about a self-shrinker. The difference of self-expander and self-shrinker, roughly speaking, is that they are all homostatic solutions to cultural flow, but they all just risk. They all just rescale as time change. But the self-shrinker disappears in finite time and the self-expander exists for all time. So basically, just like that. So here, because we are talking about solution exists for all time, so we call it a self-expander. Expander. So anyway, we can show that in Minkowski space, the self-expander satisfies this equation. Okay. Which is, you know, it looks like it's a self-shrinker as in Euclidean space. But actually, you write down self-expander in Euclidean space. Euclidean space, there's a sign difference. Here it doesn't have a sign difference because the Minkowski space and the Euclidean space itself have a sign difference. But it doesn't really matter. So, but anyway, I'm just saying that despite this, it looks the same. It's not quite. Okay. So then we go back to look at hyperboloid. So the So the you know the feature time like a hyperboloid uh if you know write it down just equals x uh square root of one plus x squared. And it's easy to, you know, just straightforward calculation, we can see that actually the hyperboloid hyper curvature all equals one. And then it's very easy to compute that x du, I mean minus x dar nu equals one. And then the Gauss curvature of Then the Gauss covatio of one obviously equals one. So we can see that the future time-like hyperboloid actually is a self-expander to the flow equation. So which means that Andrews and his collaborators proved that if they start from non-compact hypersurface satisfies all those conditions, there are They are after rescaling, the limit is self-expanded. So that's essentially what they prove. Okay, so then there are a lot of questions we can ask. First question is, can we prove Andrew's chain from McClay without exception on core compactness? Because we don't want to do everything like To do everything like in the closed case, which means that we want to weaker the condition. And then is the limit still hyperbolic? Okay, then the second natural question to ask is the future time-like hyperboloid the only locally strictly convex self-expander? And then And then last question is: can we prove the corresponding results for sigma k covatial flows? So these are all questions that we can ask. Okay, then I'm going to talk about our result. So our first result clearly is to answer the first question. So in this case, we do not need We do not need the core compactness. We just need that the initial so basically so we proved the long time existence of the power of Gauss curvature flow and here our power can be any you know alpha can be any you know alpha can be any positive number alpha greater than zero would be good and then we proved that after rescaling it goes to a future time like hyperboloid so then our condition a is different from Andrews and his collaborators so the So so uh first the two is the same, and then the third one will require the curvatures of our initial surface is uniformly bounded and so is their derivatives. So we need basically that means that we need our initial hypothesis. We need our initial hypersurface, you know, we need a smooth initial hypersurface with bounded coefficients. That's what we need. But we do not assume co-compactness. And then we also need the following condition. We need our initial hypersurface is in between of these two things, which is kind of like two cones. uh two cones. So it's uh just uh just uh basically but uh but uh but it goes to infinity then then those uh the two cone kind of goes together. It's like that. So our our initial surface have to be like this, then we can show that uh it uh actually Actually, also goes to hyperboloid. So, you may think that this condition is very strong, but actually it's weaker than Andrews and his collaborators because the surface they start the initial surface they require have to satisfy this condition and Condition and it needs to satisfy some more conditions. So it's actually a weaker condition. Okay. So that's the first question. First question, we can only make it so weak because actually later you'll see. So then for to answer question two. Question two and three. So we just do two and three together because for question two, we want to see if the self-expander is unique. For question three, we want to see that if the flow flows to a self-expander. So they they kind of together. So so so anyway we consider the following Consider the following flow equation. This is the sigma k covatial flow we were talking about. And here we explicitly require alpha from 1 over k to infinity. So in general, for closed curvature flow, so if for one want to start the I only talk about a closed virtual flow and then you have a closed initial surface and in Rn. So when you assume that the initial hypersurface is convex, there are a decent amount of results about those types of settings. But when the But when the power is less than 1 over k, actually the field is completely open because sometimes you don't even know if the flow is unique. So in general, alpha, when your power is slow or is small, there could be problem. So anyway, so here we require Anyway, so here we require alpha is greater than or equal to 1 over k because I think when alpha is less than 1 over k, you can't prove it because you are self-expander making. So anyway, so here we need a R. So, so here we need alpha is greater than or equal to one or x. So, we started this equation and then our initial surface satisfies this. This condition. So, which means that the initial hypersurface goes closer and closer to the light cone as the x goes to infinity. So, and we can always assume that this phi is a positive function. So, that's our setting. Okay. Okay, so we proved the following. So we let phi be a positive C2 function defined on the sphere. Then there exists an entire strictly convex space-like hypersurface satisfying this equation. So which means that That there is a self-shrinker with approximate boundary value equals 5. I guess here I should explain more. Okay, so before we said that the hyperboloid is a self-expander that satisfies sigma n equals minus sigma n equals minus the x nu, right? So and then the function of hyperboloid equals 1 plus x squared. That's our hyperboloid. And we can see that for hyperboloid it satisfies rule for x minus x goes to 0 as x goes to infinity, right? So that's our So that's our hyperbole. So here, you know, we may think of, you know, we still think of sigma n equals minus the x nu, right? So on the yeah, on the slide I use sigma k, but we can always just think of k equals n, right? And then the alpha equals one. We can always think that. So on the slide, we can still just look at this. At this equation. So, what we proved is you give me a positive function phi and phi is defined on the sphere. So, phi is a function over a sphere. And phi is always positive. So, you give me any positive function on the sphere. I can construct a self. Self-expander that satisfies this equation, and u minus the x goes to phi. So that's pretty much what we proved, which in turn shows that the hyperboloid is not the only self uh uh expander. So so there are lots of self-expanders. Lots of self-expander. So for any positive function phi, we can find a self-expander. Okay, so that's our second result. Okay, so then our third result is to show that actually If we have an initial hypersurface satisfy certain condition, then after we scale, our flow actually converges to the self-expander with the asymptotic behavior goes to phi. So which means that we should not expect the limit of cross-curvature flow is all Flow is always hyperbolic metric. So if you want to prove that the limit is a hyperbolic metric, you have to add lots of conditions on your initial metric. So in general, it's not a hyperbolic metric. Because in general, the limit just can be a random self-expand. So that's actually what So that's actually what we proved. Okay, so here, let's just take a brief look of condition B. So condition B is again space like strictly convex. And then it's asymptotic 2, 5. So our limit is self-expander SM target 25. asymptotic to phi and we also require our initial hypersurface is asymptotic to phi. So which means that our limit always have the same asymptotic as the initial hypothesis. So the same way we also have some curvature condition on the initial hypersurface. So Upper surface. So this condition is actually weaker than when I was talking about our first result. But the difference is our first result, the alpha can be random, doesn't need to be greater than or equal to, I mean here our alpha needs to be greater than or equal to 1. Need to be greater than or equal to 1. Yeah, because I derived the k here. So, anyway, so here the power needed to be greater than or equal to 1 over k. There, we just need the two power to be positive. So, there's some difference. So, anyway, but here we do not need the curvature is uniformly bounded. As we can see, that the upper bound is minus. The upper bound is minus C naught times X star nu. But because we are talking about a non-compact surface, so X dar nu doesn't have to be bound. So actually here our initial surface doesn't need a bounded curvature. It can be unbounded. But it cannot be, you know, it has a growth rate. Here we need. Here, we need the growth rate for constructing barrier functions. Okay, so yeah, so here our growth rate is not for the purpose of using maximum principle, but construct a barrier function. Okay, so the latter condition can be viewed as a growth condition on sigma k curvature of m0, which means So, which means that sigma k cannot grow too fast as x goes to infinity. So, we want to point out that hypersurface with constant sigma k curvature or with the bounded curvature satisfies the last condition. Okay. So the So the difficulty of starting this problem is the flow is non-compact, so we cannot apply maximum principle. As I said before, in order to apply maximum principle, we need to tailor a specific maximum principle for our case, which need to add lots of conditions, and we don't want to do that, so we cannot apply maximum principle directly. So uh natural way to solve this problem is to employ accurate strategy. That is you solve a problem on bounded sphere and then let the radius of the sphere goes to infinity and then you say that your solution converges. But in order to show the solution converge, because IPR only started mean culture flow, so in order to show his To show his surface converge, he only needs C1 interior estimates. We need C2 interior estimates. And as pointed out by Su Ye Lu yesterday, that for fully nonlinear equation, in most of cases, we do not have C2 interior estimate. So that's, so which means that we would have. So, which means that we would have trouble to show that the flow converges. And then the third part is we also need to control the behavior of m sub t as the x goes to infinity because we want to show that the flow after rescaling goes to a self. goes to a self-expander and our self-expander have a very specific asymptotic behavior at infinity. So we also needed to control the behavior. So very natural question is how can we set up the proximate problem? Okay, so we actually set up Set up the problem like this. We rewrite the curvature equation on boards. And then initially we start from u0x, it's the same. And then on the boundary of the board, because when you look at the flow in a compact domain, you need to consider what happens on the boundary. So as you can see, that we set up the boundary like this. And why do we? This. And then why do we set up the boundary like this? Because self-expander has to be a solution of this flow. So, and the boundary of self-expander satisfies this equation. So, that's how we choose the boundary equation. Because just keeping in mind that self-expanders have to be a solution. Have to be a solution. So that's how we set it up. So that's our equation. So basically, what we did was we solved this equation and proved the interior real estimate. But because, as I said, there's no pure interior estimate. So actually we proved some other interior estimate. So then we were able to solve this problem because To solve this problem, because I don't have enough time to go in detail. I think this is a good place to stop. Thank you. Okay.
