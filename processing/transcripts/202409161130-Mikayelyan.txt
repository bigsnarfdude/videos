So, the talk will be very simple. I will not go into details, but I want to introduce this a bit forgotten, maybe, direction of rearrangement problems, which have very strong connection to free boundary problems and as. And as actually other applications which I will touch. Oh, yeah. So let us first consider a stationary heat equation. So you have a heating term, external force, and then you consider the heat distribution in your, let's say, room. In your, let's say, room, and let's for simplicity take constant boundary conditions on the boundary. And well, for heating, what are your main parameters? It's your maximum capacity of your heater, which temperature it can give. This is M, and it's your And it's your electricity bill, the integral of f right. So these are the two things you usually cannot change. And then you are thinking about where you should put your heating elements because, depending on where you put them, you will get different output. And one energy you want to minimize or maximize would be the integral of the gradient of F of U. So, and this is actually the energy which we usually work with because actually the energy we work with is if you think about you. About you as a membrane, then if you dx so this is the work done by the membrane. So this is equal to phi. So it's because later we will have another example. Example and the energy is always this one. And then, okay, the set where your f lives is either the rearrangement class, and let's for simplicity take just zero, one functions, or if you want to consider the relaxed problem, then you consider the weak star closure of this class. And these are the functions between zero. And these are the functions between zero and one with given integral. That's very simple. So, what is known, and these are classical results by Jeffrey Burton, and in his papers, they are not written in these language and notations. And I will tell you why, because he is considering this problem in the context of fluid mechanics, and I will tell you. Mechanics, and I will talk later about it. So, but it boils down to the following: that if you consider the minimization problem, your function basically looks like if this is your domain, then you place your heating elements close to the boundary, and then your solution looks like this. So, it's constant in the middle, and then it goes. And then it goes up from the boundary, and you are putting your hitting elements close to the boundary. Okay, so this means there is an alpha, and u is constant in the middle, where obviously the right-hand side will be zero. And the function f is the characteristic function where u is less than alpha. And now if we And now, if we, if you think of this as a plate, if you turn it upside down, you get an obstacle problem. This is how this problem relates to free boundary problems. And, well, okay, this is the normalized obstacle problem where you have a heavy membrane and you are holding it above, say, Are you holding it above, say, a table, and then it is touching a table in some what is called coincidence set, and otherwise, it solves Laplace U equal one equation. Now, this kind of gives us the, if you want to solve this optimization problem, which is the minimization, let's say, of this energy. Energy, then this gives you kind of a method how to solve it because you are taking your membrane, you are lifting it up and down, and as soon as the surface area of the non-coincidence set gives you the value you are interested in, which is beta, then you know this is a solution. And then you turn it upside down, right? So far, very Right, so far, very classic. Now, okay, and then the minimization problem gives you the unstable obstacle problem, where you basically, so this is the energy minimizer, and the energy maximizer is where you put your F here in the middle, and then your solution looks like this, and then it is harmonic outside here, and it's like Laplace equals minus. Like Laplace equals minus one here. So, this is the solution with the maximum energy. Now, how this relates to fluid mechanics. So, if you have a two-dimensional ideal fluid, of course, this is only in two dimensions, then you have a string function. And then, well, it's a little bit unusual notation because usually the Unusual notation because usually the velocity field is bold u and the stream function is psi, but in our case, u will be the stream function, and then the gradient u rotated will be the velocity field, right? And And Laplacian of U equal omega, well, equal F now, will be the vorticity. Then you know for ideal fluids that the material derivative of the vorticity is zero, so they all belong to the So, they all belong to the same rearrangement class, right? And then you are interested in the question, and this energy is your kinetic energy, right? This is your kinetic energy. And then you are interested in the question for a given vorticity, which flow will give you the maximum kinetic energy and which one the minimum kinetic energy. And then the answer is that if you put your vorticity. Vorticity close to the boundary, and here it's zero. The water is not moving here and it's a rotating here. This is the one with the minimum kinetic energy. And then in this case, it's that your vorticity is here. So it's rotating quick here, but it is also rotating here. So these two have the same or. So, these two have the same vorticity, but in this case, the kinetic energy is maximum. In this case, the kinetic energy is minimum. And this is the context in which Jeffrey Burton considered this problem. And that's why the notations in his papers are somewhat different. And I have learned this from his student, which is my colleague since 12 years in China, Peiruzemamizade. Okay, so. Okay, so now what we've done is we consider the fractional version of this, right? Okay, just a second. Okay, so this is the maximization problem. Now, very short comment about this. Now, if we just forget everything and look at this as This is a maximization of this energy, then we have that pi is a convex functional, right? And R beta bar, this is this function, right? This is this. This is a convex. This is a convex set, closed convex set. This is also convex. So, obviously, the maximizer of a convex functional here will be on the extreme points of the convex set. And one can prove that the extreme of r beta is r beta, right? So, these are the zero-one functions. Functions. So that the maximizer is a 0, 1 function is pretty straightforward. That the minimizer is a 0, 1 function is somewhat surprising, because this is, you should be lucky to get it. So in the classical case, is the case when we are lucky. And then we will see that in basically other cases we consider it's not. It's not the case, and because for people in optimization, they think it's always should be a zero-one function, the optimal one, but actually, for the minimizers, it is not. Okay, so what we considered is like, okay, here's some short introduction to Galiardo semi-norms and so on. And what we consider is a fractional version of this problem, and this is. Problem. And this is a work done with my PhD student, Joey King, and Julian Bonder from Buenos Aires. So we basically consider the same problem in fractional context. So we replace Laplace operator by fractional Laplace and then consider the Galiardo Iraver semi-norm instead of the Dirichlaner. Instead of the Dirichlet energy. And then what we prove is that the minimizer exists, is unique, and it is not a zero, one function. It is a solution of the fractional obstacle problem, which gives you this Euler-Lagrange equation. Euler-Lagrange equation, like in this case, Euler-Lagrange equation is a set of two inequalities, but these two inequalities have a unique function which satisfies them. So these inequalities determine the solution in a unique version. Wait, I mean, for the local one, obviously you have equality here, but for the non-local one, it's like that. And then we were willing to have an equality. Willing to have an equality. And of course, I mean, these sets of inequalities, you can write as an equality. You can write as, I think, if I'm not mistaken, it's like one minus u. And then u s equal no, sorry. It's minimum one minus my uh. 1 minus my la plus s u u equals zero, right? It's equivalent to that. But we didn't like it somehow. And what we found is this formulation. So this looks a little bit messy, and I will not have time to go into that, but we have proven that this satisfying this equation. Satisfying this equation is equivalent to this one. Of course, in order to make sense of that, I mean, if your u is just a function in HS, then fractional of u will be a distribution function. I mean, it will be a distribution. So, in order to be able to write this minimum, you need to consider those whose fractional Laplace. Whose fractional laptop is a measure, signed measure. I mean, here we take like negative, but you can do it with signed measures as well. Okay, so this was the first result. And then the in case of the maximizers, it's again, you prove it's a zero, one function in this case. So work needs to be done, but yeah, basically, in this case, there was no much of surprising stuff. Much of surprising stuff. I want to mention here one open problem is that like if you have a set like that and you want to maximize the Dirichlet energy, then either you put your F here or here, right? So there is Or here, right? So there is a non-unique solution, and one expects that if your domain is convex, then the maximizer should be unique. And even in the classical case, this is an open problem. So this is open in the fractional case and in the classical case. Good. So the next problem I want to talk about is the reinforced membrane problem in this. Problem. I think this was introduced in the book of Lyons. And then many people worked on that. And then in the classical case, Henri and Milot got these results. So what is the problem? You have a membrane and you have an external force F. So external force F, and then it So external force F, and then it is giving some shape to your membrane. And then you know that in some subset omega, your membrane is like a composite material. So it is reinforced. So in this part, if you take this term to the other side, it somewhat cancels the effect of the external force, right? Force, right? So it makes it smaller. So here you kind of make it a little bit flatter by introducing this term. And then you want to minimize this functional, which is this energy, right? Which is worked on by the membrane. Okay. And the question is whether. The question is whether this problem has a solution. Is there an optimal subdomain where you can reinforce the membrane which would give you the minimal work done? And the answer is rather surprising, and I will still work on that, and then we got. We're still working on that, and then we got pretty good understanding that with some examples where this problem doesn't have a solution. So, first, in order to solve this, you relax the problem, you consider the weak closure of the zero-bound functions, and then you minimize this energy, where u sub L is the solution. Where u sub l is the solution of this problem, I mean, this pd, and I mean, it's not hard to show that this problem has a solution. And yeah, now the question is whether this solution will be a zero, one function. I mean, okay, let me jump to the next one. First, oh, I don't have it even here. I don't have it even here. Okay, what you can, okay, I don't have it here. So, what you can show is that what you can show is that the function u and l okay, okay, sorry. Okay, okay, sorry. So the minimizer exists and then they satisfy the following that there exists a gamma positive such that u larger gamma in the set where L, I mean the minimizer L, and this is the corresponding U, L is equal to. L is equal to one, and then you have equals gamma in zero less than L hat less than one, and then u hat is less than gamma in L hat equals zero. So, this is always true. So, now the question is whether Is whether one can prove that U doesn't have any flat regions. And actually, it's very surprising that there are rather nice examples for which this is not the case. And what they prove is that under any of Under any of these three conditions, if f satisfies any of these three conditions, then the solution will be a zero-bound function. I mean, then you will not have any flat parts. And actually, none of them seem to make any physical sense, like from the if you think. From the, if you think of the membrane like in physical terms, we couldn't make any sense of any of the conditions. And also, if you look at the proof, it's like very technical, like you do some computations and then you get contradiction here, contradiction there, if any of these conditions are satisfied. And for the same reason, when we've done the generalization of this problem, The generalization of this problem for the fractional appliances. Okay, another thing they prove is that in the radial symmetric case, if f is a radial decreasing function, then the solution is a 0, 1 function. And the proof in the radial case is based on explicit computations, because if you have Laplace operator in the radial case, then you have an ODE, and then you explicitly compute it. You explicitly computed. So, what we have done was the fractional version of this problem, and then we have shown that the solution exists. We have shown that these three conditions are satisfied. And these three conditions, we were not able to find a fraction analog of them because. Of them because all of them work in a very local context. And we have proven, yeah, okay, so these are the three conditions. And then we have proven the radially symmetric case, which was like we worked like more than a year to find the production analog of these three conditions. Analog of these three conditions. And in the end, I told Joey that it's not working. Just give you one week to write the radial symmetry case. And then it didn't work either because you don't have this ODE structure for the fractional Laplace. So the proof of the radiosymmetric one is also somewhat sophisticated and requires some other kind of technique. And requires some other kind of techniques, but then it works. Okay, so finally, I wanna come to the problem we work with Michelle together. So let's go back to the original rearrangement problem. How much time do I have? Okay, good. So let's consider the again the classical rearrangement problem. Again, the classical rearrangement problem. So, f is your force function, like these are your heating elements, and u is the temperature distribution. And if you look to this picture, which is from a Swedish company which produces these furnaces, you see that the heating elements are constant in the z direction, right? Direction, right? In the X3 direction, there are. So you don't have actually, in many cases, full freedom how your force function should be designed, right? So this gives you a new problem to minimize, let's say, this energy under the constraint that your force function does not. Force function does not depend on the z variable. Okay. So, in many problems, we know that if the function does not depend on a coordinate, this makes things simple, but here it makes things more complicated. So, what you get here is the following problem. So So what we prove is that there is a value alpha such that the integral, I mean, here we always have the, for any function v, we have the function, u, we have a function v, which lives in the n minus one dimensional space and is the integral of u in the z direction, right? We have a cylindrical domain and then you integrate. Domain, and then you integrate u in the t direction. So, what we prove is that we have the function v, which now lives in, let's say, if it's a three-dimensional case, it lives in R2. And then for V, you have For V, you have some space where V equals alpha, and here V is less than alpha. And your F, we have minus la plus U equal F. So here F is one and here F is between zero and one. So as you see again, this is an example where the minimum. This is an example where the minimization problem is not a zero-one function. And for some colleagues in optimization theory, this was a bit irritating. But then from the analysis point of view, it's very natural. And then what is interesting is if you do the same trick with turning the plate upside down, considering the function alpha minus u. Alpha minus u, it is minimizing the following functional. And that's why we call this a non-local obstacle. Because here the obstacle is like if you take the classical obstacle problem, then you have the membrane and you are holding it above the table. And you know, the table acting locally on your membrane pointwise. Here, your membrane is acting not. Here your membrane is acting not on u but on the integral of u. So you have here instead of u plus you have here v plus and you integrate on a base of omega. And yeah, so then so this is the problem I introduced in 2018. And I mean some existence, the W22 regularity. 2-2 regularity has been proven. And then, yeah, you prove that the minimizer satisfies this equation. And so this is a little bit crazy equation because then on the right-hand side, you have first the set V positive. So in the set V positive, it is one, the Laplacian of U. And in the set V negative, you have. Negative, you have that the Laplacian of U equals on the Neumann derivative of U on the top of your cylinder. I mean, here, of course, it's the simple version with constant boundary data. So, you have the Richland-Neumann operator on the right-hand side with some discontinuity and non-locality plug. locality plugged in the in the characteristic function so it's pretty I mean non-everything kind of and then what is interesting is that yeah for these for the minimizers of this functional the comparison principle is not true so if you take two boundary values alpha one and alpha two and alpha Alpha 1 and alpha 2, and alpha 1 is less than alpha 2, then it is not true that u1 is less or equal than u2. So the comparison principle doesn't hold. And this, of course, immediately causes headache if you want to do numerical approximation because you don't have these nice iterative structures and so on, which we were still after. After quite hard work, be able to do with Jilin Li from North Carolina State University. And so these are the pictures of U. Here, U is a three-dimensional function, which you always like have a picture of a cut. So this is how the cut in the middle look like. And you see that it is not quite clear what kind of regularity you will have. And this is the function of v. The function of v and v is looks pretty much like a solution to the obstacle problem. This is like how the free boundary looks. Like, yeah, so some comments about the comparison principle. As I said, the comparison principle is not true. And then in my original paper, there was a wrong proof that the comparison principle is true for the function v. Is true for the function v. So after you find a mistake, theorem turns into conjecture. So, and this is what I still work on, and we also worked with Michelle. And we got some results in this direction. What we proven is in the paper. In the paper published in 22, is that the comparison principle would be equivalent to either this property, which means that if you have a solution with a larger boundary data, if you push it down, then it should be smaller than the other one. Or it is equivalent at the It is equivalent that the function is convex in the difference of two solutions is convex in the z direction. But again, these are like equivalents, but none of them has been proven yet. And yeah, so I think I have some slides about, yeah, okay. About, yeah, okay. Maybe I should give some comment about the remarks on free boundary regularity. I mean, free boundary regularity is somewhat simpler because one can prove that the function v, I mean, free boundary here is also cylindrical. It doesn't depend on the z coordinate. And one can prove that the function v satisfies the Normalized obstacle problem equation with the function h here. And at least for constant boundary data, you can proven that this h will be a positive function. And then if and it's a c alpha function. And then you get the regularity of the free boundary from the PHDC. The free boundary from the PhD thesis of Ivan Blanc, who has basically done this. But this is, of course, for the case of constant boundary data. Now, whether one can cook up an example where the boundary data is not constant and get here function age, which will be A function h, which will be zero on the free boundary point, and this can cause bad behavior of the free boundary. Like the fame, I mean, the, I mean, for the classical problem, you have, I mean, if age is positive, then the free boundary is either flat or it is a cusp, right? Basically, okay, there are, of course, classifications of cusps and so on, but these are basically two cases. So on, but these are basically two cases you have. And if you consider this equation, u xy equals x square, y square if xy is positive and zero if xy is less or equal to zero, right? Then the pre-boundary can be And the free boundary can be across, right? So if you take the Laplace of this function, then you'll get a function h, which is zero on the free boundary. So this is another interesting example where the one can cook up, it's like something I every now and then try to construct, one can cook up an example of boundary data which would have this type of Have this type of degenerate free boundary. I think maybe I okay. Yeah, okay. So this is what I told. And then, okay, there is some techniques and so on. Let me just skip that part. Good. Thank you.
