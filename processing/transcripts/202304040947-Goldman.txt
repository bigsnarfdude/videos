Okay, so thank you very much. And now then we can start with the second speaker of today, Michael Goldman from Nicol Polytechnique. And he will tell us about some energies penalizing objects. Okay, so thank you very much for the invitation. And sorry, I could not come to Balf. So I want to talk to So, I want to talk today about joint work with Bounin Merlet. So, I hope you can all hear me. And, of course, if there is any problem, just ask. So, it's a kind of a long-term project that we have with Benoit on some energies which are penalizing oblique oscillations. So, you will see in a few minutes what I mean by that. So, let me start with some notation. So, it's start with a bit of heavy notation. So, we look at Notation, but so we look at the space Rn and we split it in two orthogonal spaces, so which I call X1 and X2. So X1 has a dimension N1 and X2 has dimension N2. And for a big part of the talk, N will be 2 and N1 and N2 will be 1. So we just split R2 in the vertical and horizontal directions, but this generalize to arbitrary dimensions. Dimensions. And so we will fix for the whole talk a convolutional kernel row epsilon and a parameter theta, which can be split as theta one plus theta two. And here I will only consider theta less than one. And I will come back to this later. And so we are interested in this type of energy. So what I will call E of u is the Liminf of this integral here. So what I'm doing is that I integrate I integrate rho epsilon of z times this complicated quantity here. So, what I call du of x and z is just a discrete difference. So, u of x plus z minus u of x. So, I look at u of x plus z1 minus u of x to the power of theta 1 times u of x plus z2 to the power theta2. And I divide by that by z squared. And I'll come back later to why this square here. This square here. And so I integrate that with respect to x and z and send epsilon to zero. So the more, so since rho epsilon converges to a Dirac mass, I will look at smaller and smaller interaction scales. And so during the whole talk, to avoid issues with boundary conditions, I will just look at the periodic case. So T for me is the torus. And we will assume to also simplify the statements that U is less than one, but this is just This is just a technical fact. So, important observation is that if I have a function u which depends only on x1 or only on x2, so if u is u of x1 or u of x is equal to u of x2, then let's say in the first case, if u is u of x1, then du of x and z2 is zero. And so then the energy is the energy equals zero. Energy equals zero. And so, what you see is that this energy is going to penalize a function which depends both on x1 and on x2. So, in this sense, it penalizes oblique oscillations. So, just one slide of motivation. So, I will not go too much into the details, but this functional did not come out of nowhere. It first appeared in a paper which I wrote with Eris. Paper which I wrote with Eris Funa a few years ago. So it was in a case where one of the two n, so let's say n2 is equal to one, and where u is a characteristic function. And it was appearing as a term which was penalizing kind of a curvature in an isoperometric problem with non-local interactions. And this was a really central tool to prove that in the regime we were looking at, the minimizers were The minimizers were periodic stripes, so this energy was forbidding the creation of curved boundaries. And this was then used very intensely by Danieri and Runa for studying a whole family of problems like that and proving periodicity of minimizer. So it's a very nice series of work by Star Ardeneri and Eric Schuler. And it's also And it's also, I think, a natural extension of energies which were considered by Borgia, Resis and Nironescu, which are this kind. So what they prove is that you can see the integral of graduate to the P as the limit of the similar type of energies, but for now you just penalize one of the invariations in one direction. So now you just integrate du xz to the p and they understood that the And they understood that the right power is also z to the p under. So if you send epsilon to zero, then this right-hand side converges to this integral graduate p. So both in a pointwise sense and also in a variational sense, in the sense of gamma convergence. And these type of energies have been studied a lot and still ongoing research on that. But even though at first glance these two energies, they look similar, they actually behave in a very different way. They actually behave in a very different way. And so, one first observation is that this Baughan-resist Mironescu energies are convex in U. So, in particular, you can, for many of the arguments, you can first assume that U is smooth, make the computations there, and then by convexity, you extend it to basically any function. This is absolutely not true here. You see, because of this product structure, the energy is non-convex. The energy is non-convex. This is not due to the fact that theta is less than one. This is true for every theta, actually. So we'll see that the behavior is extremely different. Okay. So I will start with the zero energy state, which is what we started with. And if you want, this is very similar to this sort of funny and nice paper by Brésis called How. Nice paper by Brezi called How to Recognize Constant Functions. And here you could say, How can you recognize functions depending only on x1 or only on x2? It's a less romantic title. So what we could prove with Benoit already a few years ago is that for every theta less than one, if you have a zero energy state means that if E of u is zero, then you depend either on X1 or either on X2. So this exactly characterizes. So, this exactly characterizes functions which depend only on one variable. And this result is actually sharp because, okay, if you think of, say, dimension two, to think of the simplest case, then if theta is less than, so for any theta, you can consider the corner function, so just the indicator of a square, then. Then, I mean, it's not very hard to make the computation, and you see that the energy is finite, and it's actually kind of concentrated around the corners. And of course, for a characteristic function, the value of theta doesn't matter because this u just takes two values. So whatever theta is, it gives you more or less the same result. But now, when theta is one, there is also another example of function. Another example of functions which have a finite energy, and which is what we call the rule functions. So you take q of x to be the minimum between x1 and x2. And so there you can also make quickly the computation. And you see that this has a finite energy. And you see that there the energy is going to concentrate close to the line x1 equals to x2. And so why is the energy finite? That if you are. finite that if you are uh so for every epsilon if uh you are on a epsilon neighborhood so the energy is going to uh live on the epsilon neighborhood of the this line x1 equals to x2 and you see that du of xz1 will be of the order of z1 so you get a z1 to the theta one du of xz2 is of the order of z2 so you get uh basically a z to the theta one plus theta two so this is so Theta one plus theta two. So this is so I remind you that theta is equal to one in this case. So you already uh killed one of the so instead of one over z two, you get one over z. And since you are integrating on the neighborhood of size z of the line, that kills the other z. You see that in this case, the energy is also finite. And we also have quantitative versions of this term, which I did not state here for simplicity, but which basically tells you that Which basically tells you that if the energy is small, then you are close in a certain sense to functions which depend only on x1 or only on x2. And so here this is why I restrict myself to theta less than one. It's because in the case of theta larger than one, we have some results of the same kind, but we don't have sharp results. In particular, you can see. In particular, you can see that you need to replace this power 2 by a different power. And we conjecture that the optimal power is 1 plus theta, but we are currently not able to prove that. So for the talk, I'm just going to consider the case where we can prove the sharp results, which is again theta less than 1. Okay, so maybe a couple of words about the proof because it will play an important role for the rest of the talk. Of the talk. So, what you can see by playing a bit around with the energy and using a triangle inequality, you see that your energy E of u, which was originally the product of first-order derivatives, actually controls something which is more like a second-order discrete differences. So this d of du of xz to the power theta one plus theta two, which was my theta. So now you see that this, as I said, is controlling a sort of Controlling a sort of second-order differential quotient, and so passing to the limits, what you get is that if the energy is zero, then the mixed derivatives, so grad one, grad two, so grad i is the gradient with respect to the variables in the space xi. So this kind of cross-derivative is zero. And now you can solve this equation. So this tells you exactly that u decompose as you exactly that u decompose as a u of x equals to u1 of x1 plus u2 of x2 and once you know that you have this decomposition you can oops what is that okay do you see this blue note is everything okay no everything is fine okay i just saw a blue mark appearing on the slide um Okay, um so once you know that U decomposes as a u1 plus u2, you can inject it back in the energy and then you get that one of the two has to vanish. And that concludes the proof. So this is a very quick overview on this proof, but what you get from what you get from this proof is Get from this proof is that actually this energy E of u, so it's controlling a second order quantity, which is this grad one, gradu, which monitors the oscillations in this oblique direction. So if grad one, grad two, u is small, that means that you don't depend on this mixed variables. And so what we extract from the proof is this following result, which is that Which is that if theta is less than one and if you have a finite energy, then this object here, what I call a mu of u, which is a grad one, grad two of u, then this object is actually a finite measure and its total variation, so total mass, is controlled by the energy. So in the case where E of u was zero, I was just getting exactly what I wrote before that. Exactly what I wrote before: that grad one, grad two, a few was zero. But in general, if I don't have zero energy, but only a finite energy, I still can extract from this that this object is a finite measure. And so actually, that brings me to the main goal of the talk, which is to investigate the structure of this measure mu of u, so which we call the defect measure for the problem. And we'll see that this. And we see that this connects quite nicely to different problems which have already been quite studied in the literature. Okay, so in some sense, I'm in this talk not so much interested in the energy E itself, but more in the structure of mu, which of course then I want to relate to E, but that's another story, which is still not written. Okay, so as we will see. So as we will see, the cases theta strictly less than one and theta equal to one are very different. So we will treat them completely separately. So let's start with the case theta less than one strictly. So we start with the two-dimensional case. So if n is equals to, if n equals to two, then okay, I can rewrite. So now it's a bit simpler. It's a bit simpler. So now my equation is d1 d2u equals to mu. And here you can recognize up to a rotation the wave equation. And so we can sort of integrate it. So if I denote by q of x and z the q which is which has a bottom left corner x. Bottom left corner X and has sides of length Z1 and Z2. So Q of XZ, it's this X plus 0, Z1 times 0, Z2. Then you can integrate this equation on this Q. And what you see is that when you compute the measure, so mu of u applied to Q of X Z, this is nothing else than this second order difference. Other different quotients, so it's just a kind of mixed derivative where you take u of the top right corner plus u of x minus the diagonals. And so if you start with the case of characteristic functions, you see that now you have this differential inclusion, which is that different Inclusion which is that d1 d2 k e is a measure, and actually, this differential inclusion is very rigid because you see that if you look at the measure mu, then since it is equal to this second order differential quantity and u takes only two values, then you see that this object, so d of du. This object, so d of du, takes only four values, so it can be sorry, five values. It can be zero, one, two, and minus one, and minus two. And so if you have a measure such that every time you test it against Q, it can take only a finite number of values, then this measure has to be atomic. So that's what I wrote here. So if you have a measure. here so if you have a measure which satisfies that d1 d2 of chi e sorry sorry if you have a set which satisfies that d1 d2 of chi e is a measure then this measure mu of e or mu of chi e then it has to be atomic and you can write it as a sum so you can write a sum of direct masses with coefficients plus and minus one and then you what you see is that from this it's not hard to Is that from this? It's not hard to see that your set E has to be a polygon with sides exactly parallel to the axis, and the corners of my set E will be exactly located at the point xi. So you see that this is quite simple. So I mean, it's actually slightly more complicated in the sense that you can also have an infinite number of stripes. Stripes which are either all parallel, all vertical or all horizontal, but up to this part which you cannot avoid, you have just a finite polygon, and moreover, this polygon has a side parallel to the axis. Okay, so this is the case of characteristic functions, which you see that even without any relation to the energy, you get this nice. Energy, you get this nice rigidity statement. And we, I mean, in the language that we will use in a few slides, you see that your measure is zero rectifiable in the sense that it's a sum of Dirac masses. So now if you go back to arbitrary functions, so if you take a function u, then it's clear that even if d1, d2, u is a measure, then that doesn't take me. Then that doesn't tell you anything about these rigidity statements because if you take any smooth function, then its cross-derivative will be a smooth object, so in particular a measure, and so that doesn't tell you much. But if now you relate back to the energy, then you can again say something similar to the case of characteristic functions. And this is what's contained in this statement. This statement. So, if now I take a measure μ, which is such that the following energy is finite, so the Liminv when epsilon goes to zero of this double integral of rho epsilon of so mu of this cubes to the power theta over z squared. If this is finite, then my measure mu is again zero rectifiable. So it's a sum of coefficients mi times the Dirac mass. mi times the Dirac masses. And you can control the sum over the weights mi to the power theta by the energy. And I remind you that since the mu of Q of X Z was equal to this D of D U of Z two Z one and because of the estimate here you can translate this back into saying that if you have Back into saying that if you have a function of finite energy, then this result applies, and you can control the sum of the mi to the theta by E of u. So this is a corollary of this proposition. And in particular, I mean, okay, in general, you can have many, many points. And so session can be a bit complex, but at least if you have, let's say, Uh, if you have, let's say, only finitely many points, then you see that if the energy is finite and if you have theta which is less than one, then u is basically of corner type, so it's just different constants times characteristic functions of polycodes. Okay, so then once we understood the two-dimensional case, we can go to arbitrary. Can go to arbitrary dimension. So now the situation is a bit more complex. So now if n is strictly larger than 2, I have the following statement. So again, if theta is less than 1 and if the energy is finite, then what we can prove is that our defect measure, so mu of u, this time is n minus 2 rectifiable. So I think most people in the audience must know what it means. Most people in the audience must know what it means, but let me go back to that. So that means that I have a n minus two rectifiable set sigma. So just think of n minus two dimensional set sigma, and a weight function m, which goes from sigma to r, such that I can write my measure mu in the following form, which is written here. So it's this weight function m times, so I have a new one tensor nu2. So new one and new two. So, new one and new two are vectors of norm one, which will be the normals to sigma. And so, what's important is that nu1 is in x1 and nu2 is in x2, so they belong to these orthogonal spaces. And then this is times the Hausdorff measure of dimension n minus two restricted to sigma. Okay, so this is what I mean by n minus two rectifiable. n minus 2 rectifiable. And moreover, I have an estimate on the energy. So what I call the m theta of mu. It's the integral on my n minus 2 rectifiable set sigma of my weight m to the theta integrated respect to the natural measure, which is the n minus 2 Hasdov measure. Then this object here is controlled by the energy. And moreover, we have a more precise characterization of sigma. We can prove that it is a tensor rectifiable. And by this, we mean that you can write that you can sigma is a subset of sigma one times sigma two, where sigma i are, so let's say sigma one is n one minus one rectifiable. minus one rectifiable and n2 is n2 minus one rectifiable. So in the best case scenario, sigma would be equal to this product, but actually you have counterexamples where you cannot write it as a union of tensorized object, but at least you can say that it has this very nice structure, which is quite natural from the way the problem is posed. Okay, so maybe a quick idea of the proof. So since μ is this D1, D2, so we have two derivatives, you can quite naturally associate to that N minus 2 current. And then once you see a mu as a n minus 2 current, you can try to apply a white rectifiability criterion, which says that Criterion, which says that if I am slicing my current mu by n minus two planes, which are parallel to the axis. So if I can prove that for every such slice, I have zero rectifiable measures, then by a white criterion, my measure mu will be itself n minus two rectifiable. And so for this, we build on the two-dimensional. So, for this, we build on the two-dimensional result by using that after some manipulation, the energy, so in this form here, is compatible with slicing, and this is basically through a Fubini theorem. And so this is not that easy, but once you write it in the right way, it's actually quite quick. But what is much more delicate and took us actually much more time. Delicate and took us actually much more time is the last part, which is this tensor rectifiability. And I'm just going to say one word about it. In order to prove this, we had to develop a whole theory of tensor rectifiable flat chains, which kind of parallels the classical theory of flat chains. And that was actually quite a long work which we finished only recently. Okay. Okay, so maybe some comments are in order. So this object Mθ, it's actually not a new object, and that was a bit of a surprise to us when it first popped out, because this is what is often called the H-mass. So it appears, for instance, in the work of White, but it also got quite a lot of attention in the last few years because it has a natural connection with A natural connection with a branched transportation. So you can see this energy as a branched transportation type energy. And so it would be interesting to deepen this link and understand a bit better how these non-local energies can relate to brass transportation. And a second comment, which is more in line with the theme of this workshop and is particularly with the work of Philip. And is particular with the work of Philippe Rindler, is that, and quarters, sorry, is that if you just look at this condition that nabla one, nabla two u is equal to mu, then you can rewrite it as the fact that your measure mu is satisfying a PD, which is that the curl with respect to the first variable is zero and the curve with respect to the second variable is also zero. So this fits exactly in this. So, this fits exactly in this framework of A3 measures, which was developed in a very impressive series of work by De Filippis and Rindler. And in particular, if you apply the rectifiability result of Arroyo, Rabasa, Irsch, De Filippis, and Rindler just directly to this PD, which is satisfied by a mu. Satisfied by a mu, then you get directly. I mean, okay, you use this kind of deep result, but without any further work, what you get is that the most singular part of your measure is n minus two rectifiable. So you'd say, why did you do all this work? Actually, what we get is much stronger because a priori, I mean, in their results, you can always have something which is more regular than the n minus two dimensional. Regular than the n minus two dimensional part. So, what we prove is that in our setting, the measure is exactly of dimension n minus two. And moreover, we have this tensor rectifiability, which is a much more precise characterization. And there's also this estimate on the energy, but that's okay. And once you have the rectifiability, then it's not so difficult to get that. Okay. So this settled the case theta less than one. So now we go to the case theta equals to one. So this case is actually much more delicate because as we saw in the beginning of the talk, in this case we can have measures of different dimensions. In particular, the corner is still a function of Function of finite energy, and for this function, the defect measure μ is atomic, so it's a measure of dimension zero. But if you look at the roof function, the measure mu is exactly concentrated on the diagonal, x1 equals to x2. And this one, this time mu is one rectifiable. And in fact, we can construct examples which have any dimension between 0 and 1. Between zero and one, and which can have even a mixed dimension, so both a mixture of zero-dimensional and one-dimensional example. But what we can prove, and this is actually quite a delicate proof, is that when theta is equal to one, if you have a function of finite energy, then your measure μ is concentrated on a set of Hausdorff dimensions at most one. So the worst case scenario is this one-dimensional object. Dimensional objects. And the proof is a somewhat far-reaching extension of the case theta less than one. And there we fully use the hypothesis that the energy is finite. So it's not enough to have this bold diversion where you have that integral of mu of q to the power theta is finite, but you really need the full energy. Okay, so now we want to concentrate on what happens when you have this one. What happens when you have this one-dimensional set? And so, for this, we will get inspiration from the example we had of this roof function. And so, we will assume that our functions are Lipschitz, continuous. And so, we will impose an extra condition, which is that the gradient of u is less than one. And so, now I define k to be the truncated cross. So, it's the vertical line times. Vertical line times the horizontal line, but restricted to B1. Then what you can see is that if the view, which is a leaf sheet with a finite energy, then its gradient has to be in this truncated cross. I mean, the fact that it's in B1 is just because we impose this condition that graduate is less than one. And then you, I mean, this is a bit of a fancy way of saying that. A fancy way of saying that almost everywhere you have d1 times d2 equals to zero. So you have either d1 of u equals to zero or d2 of u equals to zero. But this differential inclusion is not rigid at all. So if you just look at the set of Lipschitz functions which satisfy grad u is in k, then you see that actually Lipschitz functions with this property are dense. So, this doesn't tell too much, but now, if I add the constraint that d1, d2u is a measure, then as we will see, this restores the rigidity. And so now, in the rest of the talk, I will just consider this differential equation, which is that grad U in K, which I remind you that means that almost everywhere, either D1 of U. Where either d1 of u is equal to 0 or d2 of u is equal to 0, grad u is less than 1. And d1, d2 u, so this was my measure mu of u. So this is a measure. So the main result is the following. If we have a function u which satisfies the differential inclusion, then actually μ is one rectifiable, which in this case means that mu can be Which in this case means that μ can be written as a weight function m times H1 restricted to sigma, where sigma is a one-rectifiable set. And moreover, you can prove that your function gradu, it has strong traces on sigma. So what's the idea of the proof? The idea is to look at the level sets of my function u. So if I define omega. U. So, if I define omega t to be the set u less than t, then you can use, for instance, the layer cake formula to prove that since d1, d2, u was a measure, then you also get that d1, d2 of the indicator's function of these sets also measure. And now you can apply the two-dimensional result which we had for sets, which says that this inclusion here is rigid. This inclusion here is rigid. And so our sub-level sets omega t, they have to be polygons. And for most t, they will be finite polygons with sides which are parallel to the axis. So actually your sub-level sets are quite simple objects. They are just finite polygons with sides parallel to the axis. So now because of that, what you can see is that for a mu For μ almost every point, it has to be a corner of such a set omega t. And now, if you look at one such corner, then since everything is quantized, I mean, the number of corners of omega t, it's basically equal to the total variation of my measure. So, this is locally controlled. And so, if I look at, let's say, a Lebesgue point of this number, then around my point Then around my point x, I will have exactly one corner of the corresponding level set omega s, which I call the x of s. And so basically, this x of s will give me a local parametrization of my set sigma. So this is what you want to prove. And so for that, you use that you have this equation, so that u of x of s is equal to s. This is by definition of the fact that x of s is on the Of s is on the set omega s, and actually on the boundary of this set. And so if you take the, so this is a bit formal, but if you take the derivative in s of this quantity here, what you see is that the speed at which your point x is moving, it's dictated by the value of graduate. So if basically, if you look at points where graduate is well defined, so Lebesgue points of graduate, etc., there you see that this will give you exactly This will give you exactly a rule on how fast X is moving. And so, in this way, you can prove that for most points, X is differentiable in a suitable sense. I mean, of course, you can have holes and you need to work with Lobeck points and everything. But in a nutshell, that's the idea: that you can prove that because of this relationship here, the derivative of X, which will Of x, which will give you the tangent to sigma. It's basically the inverse of the derivatives of u. See by just taking the derivative here. So this was maybe a bit sketchy. But okay, in the last five minutes of the talk, I would like to draw a connection between this problem and the much more famous Aviles-Giga. Problem. So if I call V to be the rotated gradient of U, I can rewrite my inclusion in the following form here, which is that V has to... So V is a rotated gradient of U. It has to be in K. It has to be a divergence-free function. This is because it's a rotated gradient. And I have this extra condition, which is that D1 of V1 is a measure. One of v1 is a measure. Okay, so now if I just look at these two parts here, v in k and divergence of v equals to zero, if I replace k by the sphere, so the boundary of v1, then this is exactly the iconal equation, which is the starting point of this Avides-Giga functional. And basically, this condition D1, V1 is a measure. This replays the condition of being an entropic solution. Entropic solution. So you see, it has a very nice analogy with this case. And so let me remind you, for those of you which don't know it, that for the Avides Giga functions, if you want for entropic solutions of the iconal equation, so if you replace k by boundary of b1 and take the right notion of entropy solution, then there is a very nice and very difficult. A very nice and very difficult paper of Delilis and Otto, where they prove that for the iconal equation, if you have an entropic solution, then you can define one-dimensional set J, which is rectifiable and such that sort of the one-dimensional part of the defect measure is concentrated on J. And on this set, they can prove that. And on this set, they can prove that you have strong traces. But in the case of the Havilland-Giga energy, it's still an open problem to prove that your measure is exactly concentrated on J, which means that it's not known that there is no part of the measure mu, which is less singular. And so, in our case, we can completely prove, which would be kind of the analogous. Which would be kind of the analogous of the Avidas-Giga conjecture, which is that the measure is exactly concentrated on a set of dimension one, which is rectifiable. And you see, the fact that grad U has strong traces is in analogy with what I wrote here for the iconal equation. Okay, so maybe to close this talk, let me make a last comment. So So, in the Avid SDA framework, what is known from the work of Delilis and Otto again is that outside my set J, H1, so almost every point with respect to H1 is a VMO point. And by recent work by Lamy and Marconi, what they prove is that if you have a VMO point which has a vanishing point which has a vanishing energy of so I mean you need that the energy is vanishing in an algebraic way they prove that if you have these two conditions then you you have a Lobeck point and for us in our case it's not the case indeed we can prove that we have the analog of this VMO property in the following sense that if you are so for almost every point If you are so for almost every point outside of sigma, so you have vanishing energy, and then you can prove that you have the following thing here, which is that the limit of, so basically at every scale, either the integral on Br of V1 is small, so much more than R squared, or the integral of V2 is small, so which means that you are kind of strongly close to the crust. Are kind of strongly close to the cross. But so, even though you have this analog of the VMO points, we can construct a counter-example where we have a very small energy, so very small defect measure, but still you don't have the backpoints for neither V1 nor V2. And so, the example is like this: so you have kind of this very standard pyramid, so you can think of Pyramid, so you can think of if you come from below or above, you go quite steep. So the vertical derivative is equal to one. But if you come from the side, so you should think of epsilon to be very small, then you go up very quickly in a way that the two meets on this plateau, which is the central square. And so what you see is that if I look at a ball of radius two, so which is a kind of tangent to my oops. So, if I look at a ball which is tangent to the rectangle, then there I see that the amount of mu which I have is of order epsilon. So it's very small. But there I have that basically the integral of v2 is of order one. But now I can repeat this construction. But now I can repeat this construction by putting a very small copy of it in the middle of my square and rotating it in a way that if I zoom at a small enough scale, then this time it's the integral of v1, which is of the order of r squared. And so you see that I will not have that one of the two. Sorry, that I have one of the two, which is always zero. Depending on the scale, I have either v1 or v2, but Have either V1 or V2, but not always V1 or not always V2. So with this construction, you can prove a counterexample to the fact that you have Lebesgue points. And maybe as a conclusion, some future direction which we are thinking about. So kind of also in analogy with what was done in these Bauguin-resistant-cu type energies, you can wonder what is the pointwise limit, so compute E of U. Still, with this analogy and also having the Aviles-Diga conjecture in mind, you can try to compute the gamma limit of E epsilon. So now you allow you look at E epsilon of U epsilon. So now U is not fixed. And finally, as I've already mentioned, the case theta larger than one is also interesting, but there we don't have sharp results already for the zero energy case, so there is a lot to. So, there is a lot to do. And I think it's a good point to stop. And so, thank you. If you have any questions, don't hesitate. Yeah, thank you. So, what is very nice is that you get some sort of upper bound to the dimensionality. In the general results, you get effectively a lower bound. Effectively a lower bound, and you get some very nice upper bound for this special operator d1 d2. Sorry, the sound from the room is very bad, so I did not really understand your question. Okay, so I'll try again. Um I don't think so. The told us to show you. Okay, so can you hear me better now? Yeah, I think so. Okay, so I said that what is very nice is that you get effectively upper bounds on the dimensions of your measure, right?
