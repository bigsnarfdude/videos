There is a lot of people who are not afraid of the city. So I'm going to break this back category. Exact category. If you know about exact categories, then that's great. If you don't, then assume that I'm talking about R modules. Then we can define a k-theory space. As the blue space As the loop space of the nerve of IS.c. I'm going to tell you what all of these things are, though I think you'll already have some sense of the flavor. So I'm going to say that I SNC, this is going to be a groupoid as opposed to a set or a space. So of course, we can take its nerve and get a space. We can take its nerve and get a space. And group point with our objects are going to be diagrams of the following form. So So, on the top row, we've got a sequence of monomorphisms. In particular, we want them to be admissible monomorphisms, but for Armod, it's not going to worry about that. And then keep going down with zeros on the diagonal, epimorphisms in the vertical direction. In the vertical direction, and all of the squares in the picture are both push-outs and pullbacks and so on and so forth. And so we get this diagram that looks kind of like an upside-down staircase, which we've seen plenty of times today. So these are the objects. And our morphisms are going to be naturalizes. So we get a group width of these. And the phase and degeneracy maps, I'm not going to get into too much detail about because they are defined exactly the same way as everyone else has talked about this so far today. I'll just quickly mention that for a face map, That for a face map, you would pick out, for the ith face map, you would pick out the ith zero and remove the corresponding column and row, composing everything as needed. Or if it's the top, just removing it to get a diagram one level below. Sorry, maybe this is something that should be obvious, but is the I here, is that because we're working with a group away of isomorphisms? Is that going to be an index later that I'm missing? I is for isomorphism. Okay. Yeah. If I have time at the end, I'll change that to a W. But for now, we're just working with isomorphisms. You can change it to W small and no point, right? Yes. Exactly. Exactly. Then it would be a category or potentially a double category. But I get ahead of myself. So the idea is that this is a picture which we can define for exact categories, but as Victoria and Martina have convinced us of so well, this can be done for much more general objects. And so I'm going to talk about some that are not quite as general. So I'm going to talk about some that are not quite as general as theirs, but which we've been able to prove a lot of K-theory results in. And in particular, we use the fact that these diagrams are built out of two kinds of morphisms along with squares. And even without going into more homotopical territory, like stable double single spaces, we can define these things just for double categories. So I'll quickly So I'll quickly, or as quickly as I know how, tell you what a double category is. So we've got a pair of categories. I'm going to call them M and E. If you're wondering why. If you're wondering why, M is for monos, E is for epis, as in our motivating example. And I'm going to denote the morphisms in these with arrows that look like this for M and arrows that look like this for E. And I'm not telling you how I'm going to denote the objects because I am assuming that their objects are the same. Their objects are the same. Moreover, we also have some two-dimensional structure where we have a square of morphisms where opposite. Where opposite sides are of the same type, which I'm just going to draw little squares in these. You often see arrows done for them, but I think in this setting the squares make a little more sense. And these squares are composable, just like arrows in a category, and in both directions. By which I mean if we have a two by two grid of squares like so Then we can compose the horizonts, we can horizontally compose the rows, we can vertically compose the columns, and either, and if we do the rows first and then vertically compose those, we get the same things if we do it the other way. That's interchange. We also have unit and associativity equations that I'm not going to write down. But things you want to be true about composition of squares generally are. They generally are. And so I'll quickly give two examples. So if we take the pair of categories of monomorphisms in an exact category and epimorphisms in an exact category, along with squares given by Given by Cartesian squares, which are composable in both directions. That's one example. There's also the other one I'll be interested in, which is monomorphisms of finite sets. Monomorphisms of finite sets again. Even though these two different types of morphisms are not assumed to have anything to do with each other, we can always just decide to let them be the same categories. And then again, we can do by Cartesian squares between those. Between those. So, before I move on and give you a bunch of new axioms to consider, any questions on what I've talked about so far? This is a question. I think maybe you said it in words. So, in Martina's talk, we also heard about augmentation, that's something that's like special objects. Do you have also something here in the double category? In the double category, you cannot think of one. Right. So, in general, a double category doesn't have one of those. In just a minute, actually, I'm going to define a more specialized class of double categories where you do assume you have a special object. I also know that Julie, Martina, Victoria, et al. have worked on augmented stable double categories, which are, in some sense, a stricter version of what I'm going to talk about. Of what I'm going to talk about. Yes, that's closely related, and I'll get more into that at the end, I think. You actually have an example where M and E, you know, not coming from something proposal. You know, you can propose things in the inside category, you're not using this anymore. But you could. Or you could uh propose the uh APIs and models inside by set size thing. But uh you have an example which is You have an example, which is not of this nature. You, of course, can just create a category where you can compose, but you don't naturally have something to do? That's a very good question. I don't have one on my do. You can take your vertical morphisms, so objects are sets, vertical morphisms are functions, horizontal are relations between sets. You can compose relations to functions and get relationships. Okay, fine. Pretend I said pro functors and functions. Same deal. Yeah. You can do it. I am sure they exist. No examples come to mind. Usually, most often, either like the vertical morphisms are among the horizontal morphisms in one way or another, or both of them, in cases like this, kind of come from a similar category. Come from a similar category, but I. It's usually not hard to find some larger category that contains them both. What about bimodules? Ramorphisms in one direction and bimodules in the other direction? Don't ramorphisms give you bimodules? I think they do, but you're right in that it's less natural at least. Yeah. I'm just going to mention the exact I'm just going to mention the exact category example to have the epidemias going in the opposite direction, which is true. Ah? True, that's a good point. I'll say more about that in a minute. So yeah, so the easiest example is take the antimorphisms and put them. And then like, okay, you could formally compose them now, but you can't actually compose them. We've got a lot of options. Okay. So I've promised both to tell you what CGW categories are and to mention something closely related to augmentations and stability and do all of that at once. Do all of that at once. So, a CGW category is a special kind of double category. So, what are our axioms? So, we want the M morphisms and the E-morphisms to actually coincide when you consider their isomorphisms among them. Among them. And in order to make sense of this, I'm actually going to go in and show you what these axioms look like for the examples given so far. So if we take an exact category with its monomorphisms and epimorphisms and by Cartesian squares, we know that Isomorphisms are both mono and epi, and so the isomorphisms in both of these subcategories agree. Other example I want to consider is So, this is going to be the controversial part. So, you need to reverse the direction of either the epimorphisms in an exact category or the monomorphisms in finite set once, not twice. Now, in all of the papers about CGW categories, we actually let this be the guiding example, and there's the direction of these. And there's the direction of these, which makes the definition nicer in a lot of ways. It makes it a little more geometric. So I'm a big fan, but to make things look more closely to what we've seen already today, I'm going to do the other thing. So we can assume that our category M is supposed to look like monos and E is supposed to look like epis, as opposed to both of them being. To both of them being monos, which is what you'll see in the paper. Yeah, maybe I missed it, but is that a chosen specified isomorphism part of the data, or is it just that there exists some isomorphism? It's specified. And there's also some additional conditions that you need for this that I'm not going to mention. So I'll just say naturally to suggest that there's a little bit more you have to say there. In all of the examples, In all of the examples, it's kind of clear what it should look like. In fact, before I go on, I'll mention over here: if we have a finite set, if we have an inclusion of finite sets, which is an isomorphism, so if that were like an isof in A to B, well, here we need something in finite sets op. Finite sets up. So that's alright because we can just take the inverse. We want the category M to be all monomorphisms and we want E Should be all epimorphisms. In the original definition, those both say mono, so it's more symmetric or entirely symmetric, which is very nice. That's clearly true here. It's certainly true for the monomorphisms. And then we can just note that the opposite of monomorphisms in FitzET. Are all endomorphisms. So that's easy to see. And then finally, what I would say is two more about the main thing. So there's a zero object, which need only be initial in M and terminal in E. That's pretty easy to see here. Every object has a unique map from zero and to zero of the appropriate type. In here, that same picture looks like this, where you have a four. Where you have a forwards mono to A and a backwards mono to B. So can you say again, what's the significant all morphisms in M are monos or M contains all monos or all morphisms in M are monos. Manos where in M. In M. Because there's no larger M. Exactly. Like M is just a category, E is just a category. The fact that we happen to draw these from some other category in one way or another. Other category in one way or another has no bearing on the general definition aside from some inspiration. And then finally, we have a stability condition. So if we have a span of mixed type, Of mixed type or a cospan, then we say that this can be completed to a square Uniquely up to unique isomorphism. So in here, that just looks like pushouts and pullbacks. And then on the set side, if we have Span like so. So a backwards mono, then a forwards mono, and we want to complete this to a bi-Cartesian square. We can do that by taking C, cutting out the complement of A and B. This is, in fact, a bi-Cartesian square, and you can Cartesian square, and you can see it by this whole circle is C, this chunk is B, and this chunk is A. Then we start with all of C, and we cut out B except for A. So we get a subset of C whose intersection with B is precisely A, so it's a pole. Is precisely A, so it's a pullback, and you can see that the union of them, of those two, is all of the C. So we can do a lot of the same things that we know how to do for exact categories, or R modules, or in K-theory, we usually consider finitely generated projective modules. We can do a lot of the same things that we know how to do there for finite sets, which is a big part of the motivation for this. We can also do it for various other. For this, we can also do it for various other more geometric examples of things with the K-theory, like algebraic varieties, or G-sets, or lots of other things as well. Now, I'll mention just one more thing, which sadly won't fit into the table. But one of the big ideas in CGW. Big ideas in CGW categories is three-term relations. So if we use this stability condition of push-outs and pullbacks for a specific type of span, then We get something where, if our horizontal morphism is F, it could be reasonably regarded as its co-kernel. Or dually, if we have a cospan, like so, then completing completing that to a square This is G gives you something which generalizes the notion of kernel. And so, more generally, we get exact sequences. Which look like this: squares where the bottom left entry is zero. This is similar to what we've seen in Martina's talk, one of the talks this morning. And the nice thing is that this tells us that whereas we know what exact sequences should look like for our module, Exact sequences should look like for our modules for finite sets. For finite sets, this happens precisely when C looks like the complement of A and B, or various other equivalent versions of this condition. So complementary pairs of inclusion. Complementary pairs of inclusions give you the right analog of exact sequences of our modules. And then there's a there's a result that K zero Of a CGW category is the group where K0 is defined as high zero of ah I'm sorry, I haven't defined this top yet, but I will. C, C is a CGW category. Well, I'll define this dot in a minute. It's going to look exactly like it did for exact categories, but this is the group generated by the objects of our CGW category, subject to the relations that zero object is zero and b equals. equals A plus C for all exact sequences of this form. And so in the next talk you might see it's a four term relations which we have, but of course we also have three term relations which not all settings are able to do. Uh, are able to do. So in the time I have left, I want to quickly mention that we can define the S dot construction similar to how it's been defined in all of the cases before. So I'll just mention S2, which looks like this. One One zero two We have all of the information we need to define these types of staircase diagrams. We have two types of morphisms, we have squares, they can compose as needed to define the face maps. And the nice thing is that in fact We can regard one of these things as an augmented, stable, double seagull. Seagull groupoid, where which I'll call X where X minus one is the group void of the group of the groups So, this is going to be a contractible groupoid. The zero object need not be unique, but it is up to unique isomorphism. And then XMN is going to be the group void of M by N grids in our CG. In our CGW category, a natural isomorphisms between them. And based on this, just sort of using all of the intuition that we learned from Martinez's talk about how we can think of XMN as grids of squares, where in that case we have a sort of a weaker notion of composition between them. Here it's very strict. If we regard If we regard a CGW category as an augmented stable double SQL space in this way, then the SDOC construction I hinted at for CGW categories, and as we already heard, for exact categories, agrees with the one for augmented stable double SQL spaces. And so, in particular, we know that this is a This is a two-sequel groupoid. And so with that, I'll end here. Would you mind saying a couple of words about what would be different if you said W instead of I? Yeah, so everything I've talked about here is. Everything I've talked about here is based on Jonathan's paper, where CGW categories were introduced. More recently, Mario and I wrote about sort of an upgrade to CGW categories where you add a notion of weak equivalences in both the horizontal and vertical morphisms. Some of them are denoted weak equivalences and satisfying various properties. And in that set, And in that setting, you can define instead of IS.c, you get WS.c, where the objects of these categories, WSN, look the same, but in fact they're not categories, they are double categories of natural weak equivalences of both horizontal and vertical types. Also, for the K-theorists in the audience, in that setting, Theorists in the audience in that setting, or rather, between Maru and my paper and Ina's and Jonathan's, we've managed to prove a number of K-theory theorems in this setting. Ina and Jonathan did debasage and localization. Maru and I wrote down additivity, de-looping, vibration. Jolie Waldhausen did a limited, for a limited class of examples, and a lot of that is also based on their ideas as well. So that led. So that lets you get something closer to the more general forms of K-theory, not including Waldhausen, but largely inspired by a lot of those constructions. And we also believe those form augmented sable double SQL spaces with the right as dot construction. And here, zero objects in a CGW category, those are the ones that are initial and M and Yes, right. Yes. Hey, do you want to say a word about what is C G W? Yes. So we generated a calculator. Well, we started out with exact categories, if you recall. And these are, of course, not the same as exact categories. They're a bit more general. But they're close enough for government work. That's Brittany. Somebody laughed. Somebody laughed. Is that an explanation? That is the actual explanation. What if I close enough? It's not our fault. It's their fault. It's right here. We were originally calling them inexact categories, which is wrong because exact categories are an example. I think in reason. Yeah, so a close-out for government work is a phrase that means it's not perfect but it's okay. It's not perfect, but it's okay. Good enough. Okay, I also have a math question. And what's the significance of demanding these math to be moral scriptures? So that comes, so in the K-theory examples, that's very meaningful because K-theory is in some sense about building things out of smaller pieces, and this gives a pretty percent. And this gives a pretty precise meaning to what I mean by smaller. It also is many of the proofs of the K-theory results in both of the papers rely on that pretty heavily. Maybe for statement infinity categories. So I mean, I know that it's it's motivated by the exact category case. I would defer to the audience if they have any more infinity uh mot motivation there. Motivation there. In the infinity category, you usually are coming from a model category where you can factor anything as anything is either a co-vibration or covibration as you want up to weak equivalence. So everything is already monic and epic up to weak equivalence. So in that sense, they're already there. But we don't want to be working with infinity categories. So we need some more precise properties that you get from a mixture of mnemonics and epics and this relation to something being smaller. There was another question. I may have just answered my own question, but if you want, I can go ahead and say what it was because maybe it'll help other people. You have this generator and relations description that makes it look like it's just an abelian group. Then you're saying that it's a two-seagle group wave, but you're not saying that K0 is a two-seagle group wave. You're saying that I S dot C is a two single group wave. Yes. And then when you take I naught, you get an equivalent. Yes. And then when you take by not, you get an address. Yes. Take is.c, take loops on it, which used to be written on the board. And then you have a space who's, yeah, where PyNot is going to be a young graph. Is there any kind of new spectra you construct this way, or is there anything you can do beyond the usual theory? Or why do you do this? Yeah, so you do get a spectrum in roughly the same way that In roughly the same way that you do for a Walthausen category. Why would we do this is primarily to be able to extend results of K-theory to more examples. So finite sets, for instance, a lot of these results were not that you have for exact categories or you have for Vault Housing categories with various algebraic properties had not been extended to finite sets. In particular, Mauro and my main theorem was that we construct Theorem was that we constructed a double category of chain complexes of finite sets in a certain meaning of that, and gave it a k-theory which was equivalent to that of finite sets, like the classical Julian-Walthausen theorem, which had only been proved for very algebraic settings. So this is meant to extend all of the sphere spectrum. Huh? This gives you this sphere spectrum. Yes. Yes, exactly. So while it tells us, why don't you apply this to abstraction? To apply this to obstruction theory in surgery basic? Did you say something of this sort? I haven't thought about that. If anyone else has, I would love to hear about it. I know in the next talk we'll hear a bit about manifolds in a slightly different framework. So maybe getting closer to that. But I've been thinking more about just treating more objects than we were able to before in an algebraic manner using this generalized notion of exact sequences. Can you give more examples except for finite sets? It's exact categories and well, complexes of finite sets, just to have some information. Yeah, so the finite sets example generalizes to any extensive category. So that would include like G sets, spaces, but not with all of the structure people often use. People often use any topos, for instance. Algebraic varieties are one of the motivating examples where you use open and closed immersions as the two types of morphisms. I would suggest you ask Ina more about that. What other examples do we have? We also use it for monoid schemes. There we go. Chuck has written a paper applying these ideas to monoid schemes. So, are there? So are there any others that come to mind? Okay, yeah, let's stop. We want to have time for a coffee break as well. It's been 10 minutes, so let's leave all the other questions to the coffee break, and let's thank the speaker again.
