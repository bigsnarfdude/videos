The organizers for the invitation is very nice and interesting workshop and thanks also for giving me the opportunity to present my work. Okay, I will start with the I don't know if I will start. I try to start. I try to start. Excuse me, can you ask your voice included most? I'm not sure. I tried the summary of my talk. I will present different results that are result of a long-term collaboration with Francesca Rapetti from the Université Côte d'Azur in Nietzsche in France. This call concerns particular degrees of freedom that can be used to determine Can be used to determine univocal being the elements of the finite element within a finite element space of higher polynomial degree, not only polynomial degree one, but higher. There are two different families of these degrees of two main different families of such degrees of freedom that are the so-called weights and the moments. So I will try to explain what are weights and what are moments. Weights and moments. They coincide in the lower order case, but are quite different in higher polynomial divided case. I will mainly focus on weights that were proposed by Francesca and Alembo Savi in 2009. These weights, these degrees of freedom, has a very clear geometrical meaning. It's very easy to relate it with It's very easy to relate it with some object in the mesh. So, this particular property allows us to do different things. For instance, to extend to the high-order case graph technique that were not in the low-order case, or to generalize through the polynomial interpolation of differential case form, some fundamental concepts. Fundamental concepts of the classical approximation theory of polynomial approximation of regular scales. So I will focus on this family of finite element spaces. So you see here the rank complex for Hilbert spaces. So we start from We start from H1 of omega, you take the grade, you obtain an element of this kernel of omega, and so on. The image of one of this operator is on the kernel of the NS1, so this complex. And these are particular finite element spaces that are conforming in the corresponding Tilbert space in this. In this case, the classical Lagrange and finite finite elements of degree R plus one. Then I will focus on the first family of nedelect conforming finite elements of degree R plus one and the first family of nedelect divergence conforming finite elements that I do it with the Raviatoma finite element. Raviatoma usually refers to Refers to the two-dimensional case, the generalization to the three-dimensional case is this negative conformal finite element to be to distinguish better these two spaces I prefer to explain. And the last one are discontinuous finite elements of degree R. So in this diagram, the first three spaces are of degree last one, the last one. Last one, the last one is. I mean, these are spaces of piecewise polynomial functions, scalar functions in the case of the first and the last space, vector functions for h squared and h dip. They are pieceways polynomial functions. They are the continuity required to be conforming in the... Required to be conforming in the corresponding space, but restricted to each element of the mesh, they are not any polynomial of degree f plus one. Well, that's not true. Here, on each element of the mesh, the functions are any polynomial of the d plus one, also here, but not before so. So here you have the notation that explains the top part of the slide. I am working a particular in this moment, I am teaching a particular element of the mesh. Lambda i are the barycentric coordinates function with respect to t. So this lambda i depends on t. But in order to simplify a little bit the notation, I write just in this way because I think. I write just in this way because I think that it's clear enough. I will use multi-indices with, in this case, that is a three-dimensional case, but at this point, almost everything can be extended to general dimensions. Three is not a particular dimension. Well, in the previous diagrams, for dimensions. Dimensions, but the definition of the things that I will present in the following can be extended to in quite a natural way to any dimension. So I will use multi-inlish with m plus one component and the sum of this coefficient is equal to r not to r plus one. And I think that is quite clear here because Because okay, the first one are Lagrange continuous finite elements. So, on each element, the functions are polynomials of degree r plus one. This is the polynomial of degree r. I am multiplying by lambda i, so I have polynomial of degree r plus one. In the case of nedelec finite elements, the function restricted to each element. Restricted to each element is in the space generated by this function. This is not the basis of the space, but they generate the space of three meth polynomial forms corresponding to the left finite element. So here I have a generic polynomial of degree n and here I have particular polynomials of degree one. Polynomials of degree one. So this space is not the whole space of polynomials of degree r plus one. Something similar happens here. And then here, these are vigorous polynomial functions without continuity between the elements, so perfectly conforming. So the functions restricted to each element is The functions are polynomials that I want to write in this way. So, this is a funny way to write the polynomials of degree L. I am multiplying by this constant, but this constant is important because the terms in blue are the uniforms. Do you have that? Do you really know that particular product, lambda, the gradient of lambda one, lambda two, and lambda? One, lambda two, and lambda three, not i, j, and k in the definition of dp. You have very particular lambda one, lambda two. Yes, but that depends on the orientation and the triangle. I am avoiding the first node in this is a is not necessary to I need to avoid one vertex, no, and I decide in all the construction to avoid the first, okay, so very often. So, very often I have to work on all the vertices but one, the one in the first one. Okay. Okay. Okay. So in the first and the last case, the functions are locally polynomials of degree L plus one of R, but in the two intermediate case, The two intermediate case, the functions restricted to each element are particular polynomials of the Greek element. And the particularity is here, and these are the Greek forms. Okay, so in So I will prefer in this presentation this notation because allow me to work analogously in all the four spaces, just changing k. But these are spaces of polynomial differential forms. The finite element space that we have here are proxies of this differential forms. proxies of this differential swing. So for k equals one, I have Lagrange and finite elements, for k equals k equals zero, so I have Lagrangian finite elements, for keep k equals one, the third family of finite elements, k equals two, raviatoma, and k equals three discontinuous polynomial. As I said before, As I said before, well, this is the generic notation for the spaces that I illustrate in the previous slide, in the previous slide, I specify the space of local polynomial. You have to take into account that I have also to respect the continuity to be conforming in the Hilbert space. The space that in this case means to be continuous through the interfaces of the elements. In this case, means the continuity of the tangential component through the interfaces of the element. Here, the continuity of the normal component. And here, I have not requirements of the continuity function. So for every zero, I have. For errift zero, I have the widney force, and this is the reason why for use the name high-order winner finite elements to refer to this family of the spaces. Okay, so I said we are. Here I got these are the winiforms. Here I am working. This is the ground. In general, I have the stereo derivative of lambda j. The winny force can be defined recursively in this way, but this is a it's quite easy, but I think that if you see it. But I think that if you see it for the first time, it's not easy to realize. So they are the blue functions in the other slide. Is this clear? Do you want more details? I afraid that you know these things follow me. He don't know if it's even. So in this type I'm working with three main polynomial differential fields. Okay. Okay, so you know the space of local polynomial functions and be careful also with the continuity. So the degrees of The degrees of freedom must be defined, considered in such a way that they determine univocally the function on each element of the mesh and enforce also the continuity, the enough inter-element continuity to ensure the inclusion in the K-based. Okay. So, in the definition of the degrees of freedom, it will be very important the principal lattice of order R plus one of an N simplex T. That is defined in this way. Here you can see these points of the principal lattice of order four of the triangle, a b-dimensional example. A bidimensional example, the course is more clear. And it's interesting to distinguish, it will be important in the sequence to distinguish between, so we have different nodes in this principal lattice, and I will work with the vertices, the nodes corresponding to faces, and the nodes corresponding to faces. And then not corresponding to the interior of the domain. Well, these principal lattins are very well known when you work with Lagrange finite elements. The classical degrees of freedom for Lagrange finite elements are the values of the function in the points of the principal lattice of each element. Principal lattice of each element. Okay, well, these degrees of freedom, the values of the function at the points of the principal lattice, are the weights in the case equals zero. Another possibility, another possible set of degrees of freedom for Lagrangian finite elements of the D plus one are D plus one are moments. Moments are the typical degrees of freedom in the case of finite element distribution in this frame. And these are another set of degrees of freedom that allow me to define the Lagrangian finite element space. And here I distinguish between moments that are evaluated. moments that are evaluations on nodes, moments that are integrals on edge, moments that are integrals on phases, and moments that are integrals on the border. Okay? So why I distinguish in vertices, notes on the edges, not on the faces and knots on The faces and not on the element, because I will want to relate these kinds of disease of freedom with this one. With this slide, is this clear? Well, so in the case of Lagrangian finite elements, this was well known for Nedelec, Raviartoma, and the other spaces in this complex. Complex, the classical degrees of freedom are moments. Here you can find the momentum final elements. So the idea of Rapeti and Mosavi was to try to extend, to generalize the weights that are well known. Weights that are well known in lamp tag and finite elements, something similar to this kind of degrees of freedom to these species. Okay? Okay, so I said that I will prefer to work in general in the space P airplane. In the space p r plus one minus lambda k of p but here you have the detail in the each in each space. So the general definition of the moments is this one. This definition calls for any k equals zero, one, two, or three. Okay and you can see that we are defining the dish of freedoms. Are defining the visual freedom for a differential pay form. But we are integrating to define it, we are computing values on elements that are not only elements of phases, that are not only phases of dimension k, that is where we know how to integrate the differential k-form, but we are all. form but we are all using also faces the dimension higher than k so this is the reason why if this is a k4 we have to multiply by a dimen okay in order to obtain a d4 that we are able to integrate on f okay so yes technically that's the trace of omega onto x on this acid right Onto the fast, right? Okay, yes, yes, yes. Is the phase? I am going to write the phrase to simplify a little bit. So, the idea of Rappete and Mosabi was to use degrees of freedom that for a case. That for a k differential forward was the integral of k simplices of the mesh. We have not enough k simplicies in the mesh to characterize polynomials of degree higher than one. So we need to divide the subdivide the elements of the main in model in order to have enough case simplicities to Simplices to characterize polynomials of hydrodegenerative degree. And these k-simplicies that we construct inside of each element are called small k-simplices. Okay. The small case simplicies are, let me check. Okay. Okay. The small k simplices are constructed using the principal lattice of order R plus one of T, so it's consistent with how we proceed in the case of Lagrangian finite elements. So if k equals zero, this integral is the evaluation of. integral is the evaluation of the point or we find exactly the classical degrees of freedom for blood variant variant. In case equals one or two, this kind of degrees of freedom are circulation of fluxes that has effected the size sense are important quantities for a K4. And we will, it's possible to check, it's easy to check that possible to check it's easy to check that moments and when weights coincide when r equals c so for low order with any finite elements are exactly the same okay the small simplices that are used to to define these degrees of freedom are constructing using a small Using small simplices that are R plus one over R plus one homothetic to the original one and the vertices of the small triedra belongs to the principal lattice of our of order R plus one of the big energy. Okay. The small k-simplices are the k-phases of the small n-sincis. So in particular, the small nodes are the points of the principal faces. So the idea is to use as degree of freedom for the differential k4 the integrals on the The integers on the small k-faces associated to the principal lattice of the Greek airplasm. Well, this set of degrees of freedom are determined. If we have a k polynomial, differential for in this space that has all these integers equal to zero, then w is equal. But the sets for k equal one and k equal two are not unisolvent because the number of in this case k equal one and k equal two, the number of small k faces is bigger than the dimension of the polynomial space. So this can be solved, eliminating some. Eliminating some directions in this small edge. So for k equal one, on each phase is enough, on the interior of each face is enough to identify two directions. So here we go. So here we have three small edges, but in the interior of the phase, it's enough to consider two of them to identify univocally the polynomial function in the polynomial space. In the interior, we have, let me back, in the interior, in here in this plot, I have not this plot i have not interior elements but you have an interior element you have six edges but it's enough to consider three of these circles in this sense we are eliminating a small case simplicity we are not considering all the small case simplicies generated in this way but we are considering for instance okay one just two directions on the faces and three directions on the integral and not all the possible In zero, and not all the possible edges of the small syntax. For k equal 2, in the interior of titra, we have four phases, but three are enough. So we are eliminating the small phases in the interior of the titra. Well, proceeding in this way, in this systematic way, is possible. Way is possible to prove that the resulting set of small k-faces is unisolvent on these spaces. Anna? Yes. Could I ask you how does this then combine with the neighboring synthesis, right? You speak about one simplex, your spaces of polynomials, the specific forms for metallic graphs. You pick some small simplices inside, the species will go inside of this one simplex. But then you have a neighbor one and you need to impose your continuity, normal confidential or whatever. So you need to kind of pick corresponding neighbors from the neighboring simplex and match, or you adopt the same rule. The rule is based on the numeration of the phase. So the rule is intrinsic to the phase. It does not depend. It does not depend on the element that are looking to this phase. So, in this file, you are choosing, for instance, you are choosing these small edges and you are not taking into account these small edges. And this is the same rule because I am based on the. Basis on the global nomination of the edges on the neighboring simplex, it is the same thing, phase is the same, and then you pick the same degrees of freedom, and then this will ensure the continuity. Yeah, C0 for Iran and tuned. Okay, and then it's normal. So, this is the example here. So, this is the example here in the three-dimensional case. It's more difficult to visualize, but it's the same idea. And I will only on the case k equal one. Everything can be presented for any target three or for any k, but to fix the idea, I prefer to focus in the case k 1. Well, it's not only for fixed idea, it's also because we have very nice results. Have very nice results for k equal one and not for the other. So, k equal one is nadelic, yeah. Yes, which curls kidalic. K equal one is nadelic. Okay, so when we have this family of degrees of freedom, clearly we can define the interpolation operator using this kind of degrees of freedom. Using this kind of degrees of freedom. So we have to define the canonical basis associated to these degrees of freedom that are functions that have one of the degree of freedom equal to one and all the other equal to zero. And then when we have a canonical basis, taking into account that this is the degree of freedom, we have this spatial for any function in the discrete space. First and we have the the interpolation happening to different okay so see so in the usual basis say for medalic you kind of mix the dimensions right you speak about edge integrals over the big edges and then there are also phase integrals and then there are modeling integrals that's the usual sentence they like They like mix the dimensions, right? Just the three-dimensional volume that is two-dimensional phase, one-dimensional edge. So, the principle here, what you want, you want to have just the corresponding dimension, right? We want to avoid. Your degrees of freedom are always the k thing. So, in better life, they'll always be edge filters for any degree. The idea is. That's yeah, the idea is to integrate always on key phases, k phases, because that's kind of the natural. It's also what Johnny was describing, I mean, the other day. That's the most natural for witness, the lowest order. Now you have the same thing for any order. You just stick to the corresponding dimension, the corresponding circulation of a current over an edge, and that's a little bit different for any degree. Exactly. And this is the reason why the And this is the reason why I insist on the geometrical localization of this kind of detail of field. Because they are for the K form is always the for the one form is a circulation along. It's kind of more physical because now you go for the physics. If it's you look for current circulation, then all your drops are now the same same units, physical units, right? Units with the P on H files and units. Yes. And you are interpolating a physical something that has a very clear physical meaning. Okay, so in particular for K equals one, so now I am speaking about this geometrical localization of these degrees of freedom allow us to. Of freedom allows us to define a graph associated to the degrees of freedom that corresponds to a zero-fold and the degrees of freedom that corresponds to a one-fold. So we have a graph that is not the graph of vertices and edges of the max, is a refinement in some sense of this graph that does not contain. That does not contain all the small edges because I am taking into account only the small edges that I need to characterize the function. And I have also this graph in the case of finite elements of higher degree of one. So the graph is an oriented graph. These small edges inerate the orientation of the The B1, and I have a graph where the nodes correspond to the degrees of freedom, the support of the degrees of freedom for nodal finite elements, and the arcs are the support of these new degrees of freedom for H finite elements. So we have the graph corresponding here, I have also. Yeah, we have also another and so on. We have the graph and the full mesh associated to this degree of freedom. Yes, is it fine? Can I ask the questions like this? Yeah, for me, so does it mean that the graph is not a planner? The graph is some kind of like 3D graph, right? Because you have 3D graph, right? Because you have to mesh faces which are geometric objects in 3D, and then you can put your nose on these locations on the mesh faces, and then you connect to things. That is not planned. Here, I am not plotting all the edges in order to see something because. In order to see something, because otherwise I will cover also the faces, but it looks something like this: the graph. So, we can consider the incidence matrix of this graph. That is a matrix that has a row for each node and a column for each arc and indicates the And indicates the points that are joining an arc with the orientation. So, the nice thing is that this graph, the incidence matrix of this graph, is in fact the transpose of the matrix that defines the gradient operator between Lagrange and Nederlet final. Black lines and nether legs, and this is quite easy to verify this thing, it's quite intuitive also, but we can do the details. I have a zero form, polynomial zero form that I can write in terms of the canonical basis functions associated to this divided theorem, like this. The derivatives The derivative of this zero form is a one-four, so I can write it in terms of the corresponding dynamical function. But this is an issue of edge, so it's something that goes from an initial node to a final node. So I will do it in this way. I read here, and these are the results field of the functions that I just so the gradient. So the gradient operator, the sterile delivery operator, feeds the transport of the incidence matrix of the drug. Well, and this is the key point of the three-cotry techniques in the law order case. The three-cottry techniques the trick of the techniques that are used to eliminate essentially the kernel of the curve operators in the neglect final themony spaces. These techniques are based exactly in the spark that was well known for the case if at zero and I know we have the covered some higher rows. Okay. Okay, so now you can do the trick or gauging or you can extend also some construction of divergent free bases using the three techniques also in the high compactness. Okay. Well, so I will not detail the application. I just want to indicate. To indicate that how to construct this high-order decomposition in frequently is something that you can do very locally. You can construct the same spanning peak on each element with the same logic, with the same structure. And you have also to take care of what. To take care of what happens on the exterior edges of each element. So when we are constructing an spanning tree or the full high-order graph, we start with the standard construction of the spanning tree for all the elements. And we don't know if this small. These small edges will belong or not to the spanning tree. We will decide it looking for a spanning tree of the R equals zero calculation, a spanning tree of the graph induced by the mesh, vertices and edges of the mesh, not small vertices and small edges, but the big one. So we on the On the high order graph, we put over a low order graph. And if the big edge is in the spaniti, then we include this last small vertex in the high-order spanning t. Order spanning tree. And if this, the big H is not in the zero order spanning tree, we don't want so we have an efficient algorithm for the construction of this high order spanning trees. And the other interesting thing from my Another interesting thing from my point of view is that it's possible to define an isomorphism between weights and this and a particular set of moments that preserve the matrix of the gradient operator. So this isomorphism allows to extend this kind of construction also using moments. Also, using moments, not necessarily using weights. Yes, please. So, am I doing this just to be clear, like one time on a reference owner, or am I doing this in all elements? This exercise of you can't do it in the reference because it's just a selection of a rule to select. To send that small layers inside any animal. I don't know if I yeah, no, I think that makes sense. And then going to Martin's question earlier, to have consistency between elements, then you have some ordering on a particular phase. Yes, yes. So you have to have the same goal in other phases. So you have a reference like K symploint, like the reference symbols that's the same dimension as. That's the same dimension as your embedding space, and then on the sub-manifolds for sub-simplices, you also have reference elements basically that are subdivided this way. Do you have a also, I mean, in this 3D, do you have a reference element for the right and then a reference element for the faces for triangles, and then a reference for the elements? In some sense, we have a reference element. have a reference element for the faces and the for the faces yes and a reference construction for the individual yes yes thank you okay well uh i think that i i will skip the my idea was to detail a little bit the construction of Bit the construction of these isoma films, but I think that is better if I go to the other application of this kind of degrees of freedom that is related with the stability on the degree of the polynomial of the interpolation operator. So it will know that in the interpolation of regular functions, the interpolation on The interpolation on uniformly distributed nodes is not stable with respect to M. So the error in the correlation can increase if we interpolate an uniform distributed function. And this can be avoided choosing another distribution of interpolation nodes. For instance, Lovarto. Lovarto nodes or symmetric dogs that stabilize the interpolation of the vector with respect to the so since now we have a very clear geometrical localization of the degrees of freedom we wonder if choosing non-uniform distribution of nodes, so not the Nodes, so not the principal lattice, but optimizing distribution of nodes for the interpolation of regular fractions. This induce small edges that are not always equal, but induce this kind of edges. Our question was if this is for the interpolation of one form, was better to use these small edges than use these small edges. Is clear what was the problem and what is the strategic solution? Okay, we have no theoretical result on that, but we have some numerical experiments that allow us to say that, yes, it's improved the stability of the interpolations improved, in reduced. Improve in the edges induced but optimized distribution of points that are optimized by the interpolation of regular functions. And now we are using these induced edges for the interpolation of H-scale functions. So it's not guaranteed that this is the best choice of edges. It was the best choice of nodes, but we are not sure that it's the best choice of edges. Of edges, but in any case, improve the stability. And we do these computational experiments, evaluated something that is the generalization of the Lebesgue constants. So the plots that I showed you are the plots of the behavior of the Lebesgue constant when you increase the polynomial degree. The generalized Lebesgue constant is defined in this way. Instead of taking the sum on the evaluation in the nodes of the elements, we have to take the sum of the integral and on all the possible simplicities of order k in v. Of order k in the interior of the clearly, this is something that we cannot do. We cannot construct this soup, but we construct a fine mesh comparing with the original one and we evaluate the maximum in all the k-phases of this. Of this triangle mesh. So, computing, estimating the Lebesgue constant in this way, you can see that here is in dimension one and dimension two. I am conveying the classical behavior of the interpolation of regular functions. These are F distributed nodes, these are the low-water nodes, and these parallel lines. And these parallel lines correspond to the probability of node function using the edge elements corresponding to these distributions on nodes. And here in dimension two, this one and this one are the classical results for the political of continuous functions, regular functions. And here, so this So this and this are k equals zero and this and this are k equals one so we we observe the same behavior of the generalized function and the last one is in or in dimension three so here we can consider k equals zero that is the classical situation k equals one and k equals K equal one and k equal two. So this one, this one okay. These are distributed uniformly distributed nodes. These are the workflow nodes that are optimizes for the interpolation of regular functions. Of regular functions, and here you can see the results of k equal 1 and k equal 2 using the edges, and in this case, also the faces generated that this not uniform distribution of nodes. And again, we have the same behavior of this generalized levee constant that in the classical case. Okay. Okay. This quantity is important because this bounds the measure the stability of the interpolation. We are interpolating two different cell forms that are close. They are close, and the interpolation are equally close. Are equally close, multiplied by this constant. So we should flexibility in the well, thank you very much. Thank you, Joanna, for the contents of a lot of comments. We already had some many available. I have a question. So, question. Question. So how to do the second the finally uh yeah from the perspective is there any insight or the duality between between the first five layers and the second layer. Yes, the fabric. Yes, we have also some results using this duality. start using this duality concerning the second family of negative finite element this was in the cases of one of our experience there are results i think only for k equal to one not for k equal to we have some preliminary results on this election Martin, does this allow construct curve-free basis in this three-curve-free algorithm that you applied? Yes, curve-free, you can do it. You take the granules and you have to be careful of the homology. You can take good care of the homology working on the The graph of the heart of the graph for equal the homology, you can see the homology in the mesh. I I said the word spanning tree to constant. You can also construct a better Construct a better high-order response thing if you have to take care of the homology. Is that clear? No, but again, there's the point. Okay, we can discuss the sorry. Some other things? Oh, just to say very nice presentation, very interesting work on this Lodasque constant extension. Lebesgue constant extension. I'm curious. So, you were mentioning that, so a lot of the work that Warburton did was just moving points around basically to optimize the best constants for these standard functions for like zero norms. And you were talking about the idea of maybe trying to figure out how to optimize this more general Lebesgue constant. Do you have any ideas of how you would go about it? Do you have any ideas of how you would go about doing that? No, I don't know if Gudovico that I think is connected. I don't know if Gudovico was a former PhD student or from just now. I'm not sure, but I think that he now is working on this direction. I don't know. Okay, it seems like you might just be. It seems like you might just be able to take the ideas that Warburton had with just like these warping and blending functions and then just evaluate or do some opposition process with your new Lebesgue constant. So you may not actually minimize this one. Yeah, you might not need to actually change the mechanics of how you move the points necessarily. I have a comment related to that. That so, uh, at least, um, so you mentioned that maybe we consider okay the principal actors for interpolation, so the recruit distributed points and also variation of low back. As long as you do with, say, bipolar interpolation, there are also other, say, points quite famous for the minimization of the levels constant, which are called that. With other points, no, sorry, we don't touch. So we don't try PowerPoints and there is a reason why you don't use or you did not try just you did not we don't try the vehicle now is in PowerPoint I thought about that because you mentioned the vehicle maybe we can have a look if there is something from the web is there not so if we have no more So, if we have no more comments or questions, we thank Anna and Ela again.
