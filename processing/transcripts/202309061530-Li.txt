So, today I'm going to talk about some recent progress on understanding the compatibilization of some polarized K3 surfaces. So, this is a joint work with GRIA, Lazar, Tian, and Splice. Okay, let me just first give a short introduction about the motivation of this. The motivation of this project. So the motivation comes from the story of completification of modular space of curves. So let Mg here be the modular space of smooth curves. And we all know that there is the remote for combatification by adding nodal curves. And actually, Mountford and GCODA show that the delimit. Show that the demand for commodification of Mg is isomorphic to the GIT quotient of Cho or Hilbert scheme. So you choose different canonical embedding and you get a variance of GIT model and we can identify them by taking identify them as the remote magnification. Okay. So this is for So, this is for using the GIT. And here, note that the embedding we use here will be larger or equal to 5. Okay. So, you may wondering what about less than 5. And it happens that we have some other complexifications by allowing some. By allowing some singularities of other types, maybe some worse similarities. For example, you can consider the modular space of pseudo-stable curves. That's just adding caspo curves, okay, and forbidding some elliptical tails. And similarly, you can allow in techno then the forbid elliptic bridge or forbid elliptic chains. You get some very classical construction of. Very classical construction of the compatification of Mg. And as I said before, you can also vary the GIT models by using different embedding of curves into project space. So if you use the triple nano embedding and take the geodetic potion of the choke variety, and you can identify the geologic quotient with the pseudo-stable curves, Stable curves. We just pursue those stable curves. Yeah. And if you use the bike nano embedding, you will get the C semi-stable curves. And similarly, for using Hibbert scheme, you get the H semi-stable curves. This is basically due to Silvert and Hassan Piln. And there is a way to put them together in the unified way that is using. Way that is using the so-called Hazer Q program. So you consider the birational geometry of this modular space. So you can consider the Law Kane models M G bar and with a parameter alpha. So this defined by taking the approach of the section ring of the divisor, the kinetic bundle plus alpha times the boundary divisor of the 3D Muffer static. But then you vary in the alpha, you can obtain all the models I mentioned in the previous page. So, for example, when alpha is larger than 9 over 11, you recover the Limanfer combatification. And then when alpha is between 7 over 10 and 9 over 11, you got pseudo-stable models and so on. So, here are just some typical examples for alpha is getting smaller. Uh, for alpha is getting smaller, yeah. So, this is the first flip when varying alpha. Okay, this is of course recently there are some more progresses, but uh, but this is uh not known in general when alpha is very small. Okay, this is our motivation, and one can ask what happens if we replace the modular space by model space of higher dimensional varieties, polarizer. Of higher-dimensional varieties, polarized varieties. And so, this talk, I'm going to talk about our main player, the modular space of projected K3 surfaces. I just want to quickly recall that the polarized K3 of a given genus is just a pair. S is a K3 surface, and L is just the ample line model, and it's a self-intersection. And its self-intersection is 2G minus 2. So just means the generic member in the linear system of L is a curve of a genus G. So there are some typical examples of such a polarized K3 surface. And actually, these are basically the main examples I will show you in this talk. So when G is 2, and this is double cover of P2. And this is double cover of P2 branch over a smooth sexic. And when G3 is quartic, and then the next one will be our main player today: is G equals 4 is a convenient section of a quadric and cubic. And then one can consider the modular space of such a polarized K3. So we let Fg0 to denote the primitive polarized K3 of genus. Primitive polarized case three of genus G. So primitive just means the first term class of L is a primitive class in dash two. Okay. And it's known that F naught is a quasi-projective variety. Here Fg0 is cosmonaut space. It's quasi-projective, dimension 19, and it's quotient singularity. And actually, there is a natural partial compatibility. So just like the MG bar. So, just like Mg bar, you can allow some nodal, some nodes, so allowing AD singularities. So, you add a delta G, which parametrizes the singular K3 surface polarized K3 surface with at worst AD singularities. And then you get Fg. Okay, FG is our modular space for polarized K3 with ADE singularities. And this one is almost a projective scheme. Yeah, it's not still not compact, but it's close. And you will see why. Let's first recall how to construct, how to get the positive vergeity for F naught. Recall that for the on K3 surface, the linear system is pretty simple. It's just as simple as the case on curves. So like Sendona showed. So, like Sendona shows that the ML induced embedding if n is larger or equal than 3. So, you can use this embedding to construct the GIT models. And when n is less than 3, they do exist the polarized K3, which doesn't embed by the YL. So, there are unique nodes like this. And once you choose N larger enough, you get. Once you choose n larger enough, you get embedding, then you can use the gee quotient of child variety or paper scheme to compatify your f naught. And like Vivac and Thomason, they all show that such K3, the smooth one, will be stable. Yeah. So basically, the jetty quotient of Hilbert scheme or to chow, they compatify FG naught. But unfortunately, Donaldson's proof is Donaldson's proof is not an algebraic proof, it's purely differential geometry. So we don't have algebra proof so far. So we don't know whether the exists are purely algebraic proof. And so they show that this is quasi-projective, but a more natural object will be Fg, but it's still open whether the geodetic quotient, they can compatify Fg. So you have to show that. You come so you have to show that the K3 surface with at worst the ADE singularity, GIT is stable. Yeah. So it becomes very hard. Yeah. Although you know that you can take a quick and you get smooth K3, but in a GIT theory, this seems extremely difficult. And this is why that FG is better because Better because due to the global twiling theorem, we all know that this Fg is isomorphic to a Shimura variety. Okay, so if you only consider Fg naught, that's an open subset. And when you give a partial compatibility, it becomes a Shimura variety. So here, G is orthogonal group of signature 219. Okay. And what is the And once it's a Schumer variety, and quickly you use the theory from asthmatic, you know that there is a static commodification due to the work of Bally and Borel. So basically, this can be taking the charge of the second ring of the Hausline bundle on Fg. Okay, then that's this will be exactly the value commodification. Okay. And later on, that we have And later on, that the younger, they show that not only just taking a semantic computation of the Shimura variety, one can also compatify the open subset of Shimura variety. So they basically this construction is once you have a completement of some Shimura sub-variety, and then you can also take the hyper-arismatic compatibility, like a static test. Like a static test, this is a semi-toric combatification. And roughly speaking, if you use the words of section ring, that it's taking the second ring of the hosh line model, okay, restrict to this open subset, okay. And you take the product that will be this complication. Of course, there are some modular complications. That's what I think the geometers we should care the most, whether you have the real. Most whether you have the previously the GIT and the arithmetic, they don't have a clear modular meaning. Also, GIT has some weak modular meaning, and the arithmetic very few, maybe the hot theoretical. But yeah, we, of course, are seeking some modular, purely modular meaning of these commodifications. So there are some. For example, you can use the commodification from the minimum model. From the minimum model program like the Cola, Shabbaro, Alexi, they have the KSB commodification by considering the module space of the pair, the SLC pairs. So such pair form a project scheme and it admits some forgetful rational map to FG. So here, the pair, the C is a divisor. is a uh divisor in the system forget the forget c then you can get uh you get the version map and then if there is a is this a section then basically you can compatify this model space by picking the closure okay and the elixir angle they show that uh it does Show that it does exist some section by choosing some recognizable divisors. Another modular classification is from the theory of case-label modular space. So this is recently widely used in construction, in constructing some nice modular combatification. Commodifications for K3 surfaces. So HR, Davlaming, Liu, they show that if you consider the moduli space of K-stable stable pairs, so X, C, S is the final stable pair, and you fix the numerical invariants, and this forms a project scheme of finite type. Okay. And you can imagine this if you are case three is often. If you are K3 is often from taking the anti-canonical divisor of a final threefold, this is naturally occurred in our compatibility of K3 services. For example, if you consider P3 and with boundary device of quartic surface, this is a natural candidate to compatify the modular space of quartic surfaces. So the problem here is that we want to carry out the birational morphism. Carry out the birational morphisms between those commodifications and with modular interpretations. So we have so many choices of complications. What's their connection? So this is comparable to the case of MG bar, and you can use the level minimum model program to connect them. Okay. Here, there is a similar story and And the motivated example, the most famous motivated example is for g equals two. And I can just show you how big they're connected. So when g equals two, the case three is a double cover of p2 branch oversecting. So there is a natural GIT compatibility of such a plan sex. So it's just taking the GIT quotient of OP2. Of OP26, okay, the sections of all the sections. So the projection space by the SL3. So this is GIT. And on the other hand, you can also consider the log final pair of P2 and with boundary is sexic. And of course, you're adding coefficients. You can vary the coefficients. Another one is the modular space of K stable case we pairs by choosing some, yeah. Some coefficients. And this diagram is due to many people's work by Shaw, Laza, and ADL. Okay, so you can put them together into this diagram. So you start with the ball communication, and there is a vibration from the KSBA communication to the value borel. And the right and And the right hand side, okay, here, this map, the F2 hat to F2 star, this is a categorization map, okay. And then the map, the vertical map, pi, will contract a divisor. So this is a divisorial contraction. So the difference between the bail boreal and the GIT is they differ by a divisorial contraction. So, roughly speaking, the device which has been contracted in the vertical line is the unigonal local. So, where that it cannot admit a map to P2, a morphism to P2. So, if you use this polarization and it maps to P2. And uh so it maps to P2, its image is uh is a curve, it's not uh it's not subjective, okay. And then we can also use the log of MP. Okay, so we again we construct them in a unified way by putting them into this log of minimal model program. So we choose the boundary divisor to be the unional uh loci, okay, and we. Low side, okay, and we define this Laukanium model F2 bar alpha by scale the boundary divider with alpha. Alpha is varying between 0 and 1. And then we have when alpha is 0, this is just the variable real. When alpha is between 0 and 1, this is the categorization map. And then when alpha goes to 1, it's the GIT. That is the GIT. Okay. So all the models will be connected by this family. Okay. And here is just the one can try to generalize this picture for hygieneers. And there are many choices. So there are some nice GIT commodifications of FG by using S work. So we have the Uh, so we have the Mukai's GIT models. So, when G is three, then that's a quartet surface. Again, you get a GT quotient of projected space. And when G is four, it's a cubic hyper surface on a quadric. And again, you get jet quotient of project space and so on. Here, I only stop at 8, but you know that you can go to 12. It's getting more complicated, so I stop here. The point is: Mukai's jetty model always have a PKI number one. So that means if you consider the map, basically the rational map from Balli Boreal to the Mukai's GIT model, they will contract the many divisors. And here, this is the so-called Haza Kio Vianha program, I think first raised by Laza and O'Greedy. And they try to find some integrating lockling models to connect these models. Once it's Pican number one, this is the GIT model, and the other is the value real. This is the canonical communication of FG. Canadical complication of FG. And we wish that these models have a nice modular, and also this is why this Luyanga has nice mathematical interpretations. So the basic idea is still we run some mean model program and on the valuable real quantification. Okay. So So, before construction, let me just review the divisors we need to run this minimum model program. The divisors are no-selective divisors. So I use DDH to parametrize. This is a divisor on the module space K3, which parametrizes the pairs that power as K3 containing a special curve. Okay, this curve will. Okay, this curve will, this additional curve will give you this lattice. So, this is the showed up in yesterday's talk. Yeah. This is this. So, for simplicity, you can just regard DDH is some Schimer sub-variety, okay, if you wish. And we know that the Picard group of the smaller space is spanned by such divisors. So, this is. Such divisors. So, this is a natural choice to run the MMP. And some examples. So, when D0 hash is zero, that means it contains exceptional rational curve. Basically, this is the nodal loci, we call nodal loci, because you can contract these exceptional rational curves. You get a K3 surface with AD singularity. And when this one, one, it means it contains the ideal curve with degree one. Elid curve with degree one, this basically is the unigonal low side, and then degree two, uh, genus one, this hyper elliptical side. Yeah, but hyper ellipse low side that will give you double cover to some final surface, the pedal surface. Okay, and here this is the pickup group of the bad borel with Mokai models. This is the old work of Gria myself. Of Grian, myself, and Tian. So when G less or equal than 10, so this is a list of all the generators. This table will show up again, just so I will explain the connection with our model. Okay. Yeah, so Namda survives everywhere because you have Haushland bundle. So every aptitude, there is alpha line bundle, right? Namda. So generators is Namda plus those divisors. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so this is a general construction. The general construction is you just choosing this approach of section range and you choose the boundary. And you choose the boundary divider choosing this way. So B alpha is a linear combination of DDI HOI. So DDI, HOI, this is non-selective divider, it's given in the previous table. Okay. And the coefficient is some linear functionals in alpha. And the expectation is that this model, by some nice choice of the coefficients, there will be a chamber structure. There will be a chamber structure on alpha, and we get the chamber structure will give you the factorization of this directional map. So we will decompose into some elementary wall crossing maps. I think before I proceed, I just tell you some difficulty of this program is the essential difficulty is the existence of this model. Is the existence of this model? Okay, so we don't have the finite generation of this section range. This is very different from the MG bar case, okay, because the Balliber complication has worse singularity than the Deli-Manford complication. So far in generation is missing. I know, of course, that the computation of wars is another cause another problem, but compared with the first one. But compared with the first one, it's relatively easier. Okay. And our prediction is like this. So for KFG with Mukai models, and there is a shortcut that is, of course, you have different paths connecting the GIT and the valuable RHEL, but we predict there is a shortcut to connect them. The shortcut means there is a list of work crossing maps between the valuable RHEL and GIT. The valid real and GIT. So here is the prediction. So we have a choice such that when alpha is zero, this is Luanga's semitological commodification. And this is well understood from mathematics. This is pretty kinetic construction. And then when R varying between zero and one, it's a VGIT model. Okay. And of course. Okay, and of course, if it's VGIT, you have a chamber structure, and they'll give you this war crossing maps. Okay, so when alpha is in your chamber, then you give the same model, and when alpha goes to war, you have these flips or divided contractions. Okay. And why it's called at Uyanga is also. Because at Luyanga is also because the last one, the centers of those birational maps, there are some Shimura varieties, and they are lying in the Luanga stratification of this boundary divisor. Let me just explain what's called Luyanga's stratification. So, a Shimura variety basically is looking like this. So, it's an arithmetic quotient of the period of n. Of the period domain, okay. So the period domain is associated with the autovenot group in our setting, and uh uh on our divisor basically or a Schimer subvariety looks like the hyperplane on the pure domain, and then take them the union of them and the quotient this arithmetic group. Okay, so this is the divisor, and you can consider the stratification of the divisor often in this way, so you can. Optim in this way, so you can so because it's optim by taking the union of hyperplanes, then you can make that these hyperplanes do the intersection. Okay, then this will cut down the dimension of the just you will obtain some subdomain of high coordination, and then still you can do the quotient. You can obtain some Shimura sub-variety with a higher coordination, and you can continue this process and to obtain all the all the sub-varieties. Okay. And then this construction, you can clearly see this gives you a tower of Shimra sub variety because each one is given by cutting the previous one by one, dimension cut by one. So this gives you a tower structure. Okay. And actually this torque structure will be very useful in starting the Hasaqanga programming set in this setting. Okay. And the connection to our program is the potential center of the birational map will be the stratification of the boundary divisor. And the potential war is given by the following formula. So the war happens. So when you do the restriction of your line bundle to this stratification, and it must be of this form. And it must be of this form. So it's one minus some linear function of alpha times the Haush line model. And plus, some rest of the divisors are lying in the Duane gas stratification. Okay, so it's always of this form. So get a wall, this will be zero, okay? So alpha, f alpha will be one. Alpha will be one, and provided the rest of the divisors are extremal or not effective, okay, at this critical value. So we can get a number of critical value if we know the restriction of this line model to those stratifications. So that's a prediction. So there is an ideal situation. So we can Situation. So we can just consider such a map and the birectional map between this one is valid, this one is valid, and this is you run this minimum model program and it will factor through a series of elementary transformation. So the centers basically will be the irreducible component of Uyanga's stratification. So this is the ideal situation. Let me just give you some examples. Let me just give you some examples. So, the example, a typical example, is the map from the balliberel to a Luyanga complication. That's in the ideal situation. Another one is the quartical case for module space, quartical surface, basically the modulus space for K3 of genus 3. And that's already they make the conjecture and HR. Conjecture and HR Laming Liu, they prove verify this conjecture and shows that this also in the ideal situation. So it affects through a series of elementary transpirational transformation and the centers are in the Luanga stratification, irreducible component. Sorry. However, this situation never happens when G is larger than 3. And you will see why in a minute. Usually, the center of the biological map will become much more complicated. So, there are some useful tools by arithmetic method. So, will help us do the work crossing computation. So, one thing is the PCR group of the, so we have computer, we have. the so we have computed we have computed the the picard group the chimro variety is essentially the space of some modular forms so you we have a very good understanding of the pica group and with this understanding so in our joint work we have a very effective algorithm to compute the restriction of the nl divisor to the luanga stratification so we have an explicit So, we have an explicit formula of this restriction. Okay, so we can quickly write them into a linear combination of our divisors and with explicit expression of the coefficients. So, usually this is kind of difficult because the right itself is not smooth, and the junction is a little complicated. And there are some multiplicity concerns. And in our case, we know how to. In our case, we know how to effectively do this, but we need some needs the aid of computer by, because we have to make use of the Jacobian forms, that needs the help of the computer. But we have an algorithm, so it's not a problem. And another one is once you write this one into a little combination of NL divisors, you have to understand the effect. you have to understand the effect of cone because what i said the when the when the war happens uh you you need you need the uh luand gas ratification is extreme okay so we need to now understand the effective cone and uh actually arritson had asked whether the effect cone is generated by unl divisors so so the this one is the sub cone generated by nail divisors so it's not By only divisors. So it's not known yet whether this is true. What we only know so far is when that for the given NL divisor, it will be extremal if you satisfy this inequality. That will be extremal. But other than that, it's not known yet. So let me just show you a picture here. A picture here. So, this gives you this is the previous table. Just the difference is that we add color. I'm sorry, I should add red color. This is blue color. Okay, this one gives you the generators of this subcone. So the only difference between this table and the previous table is that we added D00, the nodal ML divisor here. Okay, and the rest of them are already known to be extremal. Are already known to be extremal. And for the nodal locals, the D00, in this subcode, it's extremal, but we don't, I think so far it's open, even in Geno SQL 2. Yeah, the PICA number 2 case, we don't know whether this is actually extremal in the effects cone of FG star. So it's quite difficult. Okay, so let me just tell you the story for F4. So for a polarized K3 of genus 4, its Persian model is well understood. So the general member is a compensation of a quadric and a cubic. And this happens if and only if this polarized K3 is not lying in the uniganal or hyper-elliptical loci. Okay. And there's another interesting loss I call the triple elliptic or tri-elliptic. So this is the case when the quadric is not smooth. Okay, that will be D31. So you can compare the difference. So it's lying in a smooth quadric if and only if it's not lying D31. Okay, this is a triple use. This also shows up in Bobius' work on the Fronta conjecture. This is On the front shadow congestion. This is actually pretty useful in considering the Haseki Langa program in Genes 5. So if you know the project models, you get in some natural parametrization space. So first one, you can parametrize the 2,3 complete section by a projected bundle. Okay, the open subset of. Okay, the open subset of Project bundle. Another one is you can fix the quadric. Okay, because the smooth quadric is unique. Okay, so you can fix the quadric. Then you can parametrize this complete sections by this project space. And this gives you some geodetic models. One is the geodetic quotient of the project bundle. Okay, we know the project bundle is the pickup number two, so it's looking like this one. So it's looking like this one. And due to the work of Benoa, we know that this line model is ample when t between zero and one half. So this we know this exists as a projective scheme. And another one is you can also take the geodetic portion of cho variety. Okay, consider two cycles in P4 of degree six. Of degree six, and this is the GIT. And the last one is there's another classical construction. Every 23 complexation, there is a bijective due to the nodal cubic. You fix the node and the equation is given like this one. So Q and F, they give you the 2, 3 complete section. And this one, of course, gives you a non-reductive jet. Give you a non-reductive jetty model. So the delta zero parametrizes cubic, which is singular at this fixed node, and g is the stabilizer of this point. Okay, it's not reductive. So this is a non-reductive GIT. So you obtain at least four GIT models. This page just curious for people who are curious about the boundary strata. So like the Muka. So, like the Mukai models, the boundary has nine components, and for valuable, there are 10 components. And the boundary is module 10 curves for valuable rel. And for GIT, you can see that the boundary dimension is pretty large. Okay, so this is the conjecture. Let me just make the conjecture. So, here is the choice of our coefficients. So, B alpha is a linear combination of these two. So, Bα is a linear combination of these three divisors. So, it's constant in front of D11 and D21, and with a linear scaling in front of D3, one. And you take a section ring and take a parage. And we conjecture that this section ring is finally generated when alpha is varying between zero and one. And the walls of this Of this Mori chamber decomposition of the cone are located in these critical values. So this starting from one, one half, one third, one quarter, and so on. Okay. And ends at zero. So this is a prediction. Just remark that one over nine is not missing. Okay. And now, further, we can describe the center of the Barushan map. So, this one forms a descending tower of Schumer sub-varieties in this way. There are three types of towers. One is we call the AN tower. So, it's starting from D31 and descending until some Shimura variety of coordination 9. Okay. And there are DN tower and And there are dn tower and the e n tower. So here, uh, this one just given by the orthogonal group associated to this lattice. The lattice is given by this formula. So it's uh, sorry, it's hard to use. Sorry. Okay, never mind. So the number A. Mind. So the number A n is the orthogonal complement with the root lattice E6, direct sum with AN, and you can take an orthogonal complement in the Boltzmann's lattice. So here the Bolshevik lattice is a direct sum of two hyperbolic and three E8. And DN is the same thing, just the orthogonal complement of E6, direct sum with DN, and so on for En. So there are three. Yeah, yes, that's right. So they actually these are the Luanga stratification of D31. Yeah. So this is very different from the quartier case. In that case, the Luanga stratification is almost irreducible. But for this one, you can see from code minus three, it will have more components because it basically is a root lattice. So from A3, you have. So, you from A3, you have two choices: A4 or D4. Okay, and for D5, you can also have D6 and E6. So, that gives you more irreducible component. That's why this wall crossing is more complicated. So, those are all irreducible components of a Wyoming gas stratification. Okay, and just tell you the geometric number of those in Lagan's complementation. It's pretty clear. So for the A and tortries the computer section in this way. So because the Q will be singular, it's lying in D31, which is singular quadratic, it's quadratic cone. And this computer section will have a n minus one singularity at the vertex of this cone, quadruple cone. Okay. Okay, this corresponds to an for dn, this corresponds to, so the case, the rank of the quadric will be three, so correct two quadric. That will be where the dn shows up. And then the k3 will have two singularities. One is the d minus two singularity, and another is a1 singularity. Okay, and also for en is simple. For En is similar, just the rank will be three of the quadratic will be three, but the similarity of S is more complicated. It says A5, D6, and E7. Okay. So when in six, it has A5 and in seven, D6, and when is 8, you see E7. Okay. And there's another one is the modification. So when I add a prime here, it means there are some modification. And this basically parametrizes the complex section contains a special line passing through the vertex of Q. Everything has a clear geometric interpretation. And here is our main result. And here is our main result. So when alpha is one minus epsilon, this is basically isomorphic to the Mokai, the GIT models. When alpha goes to one over 10, this is the Cho quotient. Okay. And when it's zero, this is the Louisiana combatation, and it's also identified as the non-reductive GIT of the nodal cubic. Nodal cubic. And for the existence, we only know that this model, the locking model, exists when alpha is larger or equal than 1 over 10 or alpha equals 0. Because of the following isomorphism, we can identify our model with the GIT of the P projective bundle by this formula. So it's alpha when equals. alpha when equals to one minus t over five t okay and we should uh remark that this conjecture will so the the work coursing conjecture will hold once this exists so as i said before the most difficult part is to prove the existence of our model okay so once there is a git we know the existence then we can verify this okay Can verify this. Okay. So the proof basically makes use of the variation of GIT, but we give some purely arithmetic explanation, which is also useful to study other modular spaces. And just show you a quick glimpse of the word crossing for A and tower. So we can use our arithmetic algorithm and we can quickly compute the restriction of The restriction of our line bundle to the Luanga stratification. Okay, this will give you this formula. So the coefficients in front of lambda is 1 minus n minus 1 alpha. So when alpha equals 1 over n minus 1, this becomes 0. So that's the critical value. Okay. And we know that, so there are remain. So, there remain four divisors. So, for the red ones, we know that they are birationally contractible and hence they are extreme in the effective cone. So, this one we don't worry about too much about it. But the problem is the a n tower is no longer directionally contractible when n is larger. Actually, we show that this a n tower is moving. This n tower is movable when n is larger than 5. So, and this will cause in the process of the wall crossing when n equals 5, this number a6 will be contracted at alpha equals 1 over 4, and it's not at alpha equals 1 over 5. So, when alpha equals 1 over 5, the biracial map doesn't no need to contract the need to contract this A6. Instead, it will contract its modification. So the A6 prime. So this is purely from arithmetic. There is an explanation why this is getting more complicated. And this doesn't happen a lot in the in quartic case, but in hierogeneous case, it will happen a lot. That will happen a lot. Actually, our algorithm can work for all the genus of chi models. And I do some attempt to do the computation. It's the walls. I think this one is the easiest one. Let me just tell you another story for the K models. And then you'll see why our model I call it a shortcut. So there's another nice natural complication. You can consider You can consider the K-modular space. So it's a modular space of K-semi-stable final pairs, which is smooth into the, so the Q is a quadric, smooth quadric, and S is a cubic hypersurface on this quadric. Okay. So we know the advantage of this model is we know the existence from the work of HR Dav Laming and Liu. Uh, Dev Laming and Liu. Okay, and we can identify this model with uh birational model on the variable real of f4. So this this is giving you the expression of the setting range. And we conjecture that this one it can be identified with our model when C is less or equal than one half. Okay, and the problem is the wall crossing is. The wall crossing is more complicated for this model. So we know the existence, but the price is the wall crossing very complicated. You can see, so there are extra walls in the red color. So our shortcut, we don't need to affect through those word crossings. So there are more than 10 extra words if you use the decay module space to connect. Modular space to connect the value boreal and the GIT. Okay, they can be connected. Okay, you can vary the coefficients and then you get a new connection. Okay. So just some remarks is on arithmetic side, this method can work for modern space of Latin power K3 and also hypercalor manifolds and some log final pairs in high-dimensional. Dimensional, so uh, this part is relatively easier, yeah. But geometric side, uh, because on RSMS side, the problem is we don't know the existence, but we know the work crossing. But on geometric side, the problem is we don't know the wall crossing, we know the existence. Okay, and it's because it's quite difficult to determine the case stability for higher-dimensional funnels. Yeah, that's the problem. That's the problem. And recently, I should mention some work for modular space of hyper-elliptic K3 and for Lava Depazo surface and also the Hazaqi on M6 bar. Oh, sorry, there is a typo surface note here. Due to the work of Pan Sufei and Hao Yu Wu, and also a student of that, the Junyian Sao. So they basically use. So, they basically use the k-module space to connect valuable real and the GIT. Okay, and they can describe the work processing. And also, there also arithmetic with the aid of the ethic. Okay. I think I will stop here. Okay.
