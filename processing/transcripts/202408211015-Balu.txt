So, still, supersymmetric is of very much interest. It solves several, if it becomes true, it solves several outstanding theoretical problems. So, now I'm going to approach this from the mathematical view, basically using group theory representations. Okay, so this is. Okay, so this is the outline of the talk. So, quantum field theory is basically a reconciling of quantum mechanics and special relativity theories. So, the symmetry of the systems are described by Lorentz homogeneous Lorentz group and the Poincaré, which is the semi-direct product of homogeneous Lorentz and space-time translation, which is typically R4. Is typically R4. Now, I'm going to be using SI stands for systems of imprimativity. It's a MAC imaginary set of tools that generates irreducible representations, all possible irreducible representations for locally compact groups like Poincaré. So, I will define what are called co-cycles, and from there, we can derive. And from there, we can derive S i. Deriving an S i is equivalent to getting all the irreducible representations of the group. Point carriers of interest because that describes the states of all, quantum states of all fundamental particles. So our focus is only on non-interacting quantum fields. So we will use this single particle Hilbert space, which are covariant with Poincaré group. With Poincare group to build symmetric and anti-symmetric Fox spaces and then derive the superversions, supersymmetric versions of these Fox spaces. Then we will derive the whale operators that is primary objects of interest to the study. Whale operators, you heard a lot from the previous talks. So from the whale operators, you can set up the field operators, the creation and aniheliation operators on the Fox phase. Operators on the flux phase, those are the most important quantities to physics. Now, the way we are setting up is that both the fields and the field operators are covariant with respect to the Poincaré group. So, the group representations we ultimately obtain are all projective unitary representations in terms of the wheel operators. So, we've already defined what is a superfox phase, super Lie groups, and super Lie L. Space, super Lie groups, and super Lie algebras towards this goal. Finally, we're going to talk about the fermion-boson correspondence. So, this is based on quantum stochastic calculus, Pathasari-Hudson version of the quantum stochastic calculus. So, bosonic version of that is well developed. Fermionic version, they made this correspondence. So, basically, they mapped the fermionic plus. Basically, they mapped the fermionic processes to the bosonic processes. And then the mathematician said, Yeah, we are done. But I will show you some examples where that's not exactly working out very well. But we can use these fermion-boson correspondence to create supercharges of the supersymmetry. So we'll see that in detail later. Okay, so what is a G-space? So G space of a Borel group G is a Borel space X with the Borel automorphism. With the Borel automorphism. Now, what is a Borel group? If it supports this map on the right, XY to XY inverse is Borel, then it's a Borel group. The systems of imprimativity, that is the Machi machinery, is based on these G spaces and the Borel structures. But we are going to be working primarily with R4, which is the spaced time translation group, where this setup is. Where this setup is valid. So basically, T is the identity, and then the group homoism works like that. So G acts on X transitively. Okay, that's what a G space is. Using that, we can define what are systems of impermeability. So it's a pair. You have a group and then you have a configuration space. You can think of them as the configuration. The configuration phase of a quantum particle whose symmetry is described by G, which in our case is would be Poincaré, which will come, we'll come to that later. So Si means that the red box on the top right, if that equation is satisfied. So UG is the unitary representation of the group on a Hilbert space and P is projection valued measure on the configuration space. Configuration space. So suppose you have a sigma infinite invariant measure and G is a locally compact second countable group, then the red box on the left is an example of systems of improvisability. So your X is the same as the G not, the group acts on itself, and then you can create an M space where, I mean, you can create another. I mean, you can create another X, which is the quotient group. So the projection value measures are homogeneous. That would correspond to the canonical observables from the Hahn-Hellinger theorem framework of quantum probability. Okay, so the canonical computation relationship of a quantum system can be cast as a system of improvidity. To see that, so consider a quantum system. So, consider a quantum system whose dynamics is described by a group. In this case, the real line, right? Then the momentum operator is nothing but unitary. It's a unitary operator, and the position operator is a spectral measure. And then you can, the top red box, that is the canonical computation relationship described in physics literature, which is nothing but SI. So, SI has more applications, not just CCR. And not just CCR, you can establish the localization of a quantum particle using systems of impermittivity. It's a very powerful tool which we are going to use it to study supersymmetry. Now, one way to obtain systems of impermittivity is using co-cycles. Suppose you have a group G, you consider the homomorphism into the unitary group on a Hilbert space. On a Hilbert space, then if you set up the map V this way, then there are first order and second order cocycles. So this can lead to systems of impermeability. That's a very standard way of constructing SI from co-cycles. So later we can see that when G is Rn, we can get infinitely divisible distributions on a bosonic box space. The standard classical The standard classical stochastic processes can be realized on bosonic flux phase. So, weight representation of a group. So, we saw the co-cycle in the previous slide. So, one way to construct a co-cycle is on the very top equation, which is the infinite sum of these operator combinations. So, that is a co-cycle. Now, use that map to create a whale operator. map to create a whale operator. So we know that whale operator has two parameters. One is a unit vector and another is a unitary operator. You can create whale operators. So using the way you can show that this whale representation of a group, any arbitrary group G, is a unity projective unity representation whose multiplier is given by the sigma below. Sigma below. So we can get from the first order co-cycle defined at the top, we can get the second order co-cycle, and then we can define the infinitely divisible distributions on the symmetric Fox face at the vacuum state using this whale operator. So they are powerful to keep that in mind. And then we are going to play with them more. So now we now from the previous slide, what we have done is that we are whale operating. What you have done is that we have whale operators that are indexed by the members of an arbitrary group. So, once we have the whale operators, we know how to set up the creation and annihilation and conservation operators using this relationship. These are all very standard setup and methodologies in chronostochastic catalysts. Parthasaradi's textbook has all these details and the discussions. So, now we want to apply. So now we want to apply that. We want to consider the semi-direct product of the group. So, what is a semi-direct product? You have an abelian group A and then a group H in such a way that the TH is an automorphism of A. So basically, H acts on A, right? And then you can see the relationship H of A is H A H inverse. And then you define the identity element and then you define the group multiplier. You define the group multiplication. So, the group multiplication defined at the last three lines, how the two components of the group gets multiplied. Now, Point Carrier group is basically a semi-direct product of homogeneous Lorentz and space-time translation, typically R4, but you can also discuss them at a lower dimension. So the coverage. So, the covering group of Poincaré is also interesting. That's where we are going to obtain the representation. So, the covering group of homogeneous Lorentz is SL2C. And then you take the semi-direct, that is also a semi-direct product with P4, which is the space-time translation group. So, then now you can induce a representation. So, the way the methodology works is that you take a subgroup of this group, get a representation of that. Group, get a representation of that, and then induce a representation for the whole group. For example, the equation I showed that is the take the rotation group, rotation subgroup of homogeneous Lorentz, and then you can get a representation for the entire point gray. They are all irreducible representation, they are all projective, and then you can do the multiplication. So, the way because it's a semi-direct product, H, the homogeneous Lorentz. H the homogeneous Lorentz has R4 as the G space, right? So the configuration space is R4. That's what I'm showing. Basically, they are the orbits of the homogeneous Lands. That's what the mass hyperbola is. Positive energy hyperbola is what we are considering here. But I will make some remarks about the negative energy hyperbola later. So any system described by these are called on-shell reflections. By these are called on-shell representation, they are irreducible representations that come out of the Machy machinery. But there are systems that are off-shell that is of interest to physicists. We are going to see some more details about them, but there are a lot of open problems. That's what I'll be getting into in the future. But I will give some idea about what they are about. Okay, system of infirmary of the point carrier group can be visualized here. The point carrier group can be visualized here. So, the circle is basically the configuration space which we saw in the last one: the mass hyperbolus. We are going to, for the moment, we are going to consider only the positive part of it. Okay, so I don't know. Okay. All right. So, what we do is we consider a subgroup and then we consider the stability point of the subgroup, which means when the group acts on that point, When the group acts on that point, it becomes invariant. Okay, so get a representation of that stability point for that group and then do a unitary map across the configuration space. If you do that, we are done. That is, we get the unity representation of the entire Poincaré group. So there are very three specific subgroups of Poincaré of interest to physics. We are going to see them in one in one after the other. One after the other. So our primary focus is on spinners. Basically, that the red X, basically that stability point. So you define a fiber as a spinner, and then you create a fiber bundle for the whole thing. We'll see the details of the fiber bundle in the next slides, next few slides. The one more interesting point I want to say is that we are. We are still dealing with the simple single quantum particle. We are going to generalize these results to supersymmetry. What that means is that the supersymmetric system has both quantum particles of spin, half integers, as well as whole integers. So, fermions and bosons will be combined to make these supersymmetric systems. So, I'm showing that the Systems. So I'm showing that the three diagrams, three graphs on the right, somewhere in the middle of the slide. So the open circles are the bosons, the closed circles are the fermions. So you can define maps between them. They are called the superchargers. The mapping between the bosonic and the fermionic part of the system is called the superchargers or the odd operators of the Lie algebra. We are going to see that in detail later. But you can also see. Later. But you can also see the diamond on the right where you have a pair of bosons and fermions are connected. So you can see that this can, they are called multiplets. They can get quite complicated. We can have systems with the 2 power 32 bosons and 2 power 32 fermions. Those kind of multiplets are relevant in 10-dimensional supergravity. So, how do you deal with that? So, you have to So, you have to generalize the spinner I'm talking about at the stability point to these graphs. These are called adhinkras. The graphs of complex multiplices are called adhinkras. But there is a way to derive real Clifford algebra for that. From that, you can go to the spin R. But I got to still work out all those details. Okay, so the fiber bundles, the details of the fiber bundles, basically, you create the total space. Basically, you create the total space using P and V. V are basically the spinners. Actually, C4, not C4 tensor, C4, just a C4. For the simple case, later I'll say why the tensor is relevant. So basically, there is some odd convention. The vector conduct B stands for, the plus stands for the positive hyperbola, which we saw earlier. Which we saw earlier. M is the mass of the quantum particle. One is basically it's two times something. So it's a half a spin system like an electron or any other regular fermions like a proton and so on and so forth. So construct a bundle and then you can create the total. This is the base space. You can create the total space and then get the representation of the Poincaré group. So here we saw this orbits. We saw this orbits earlier, the same thing here. So, when the Clifford algebra is simple, when the dimension of this underlying vector space is even, so then the associated simple algebra has a spin representation. When the dimension of the vector space is four, then we get the Dirac matrices, which appears in the Dirac equation. For higher dimension, you will have a more generalized Dirac matrices to. Dirac matrices to set up the spinners. So, associated group is isomorphic to homogeneous Lorentz, which is the cover to whose cover is SL2C. So, both the components of the total space transform simultaneously by Lorentz group. So, basically, the covariant with respect to Lorentz. Okay. So, again, some more details. You can set up, you know, by changing the Uh, by changing uh the spin, you will get a different bundle for different uh quantum particles based on the underlying spin. Um, and then uh the mass also gives a different bundle. So, you get a family of bundles, each one for a different fundamental quantum particles, right? So, you um, the once you create the bundle, the sections of boreal sections of the bundle they form the Hilbert space. They form the Hilbert space of the single particle, single quantum particle. The invariant measure is always guaranteed. Once we have a single particle Hilbert space, we can create the symmetric Fox space. So those are all very standard constructions. So we have the bundle, we have the base space, we have the bundle. Then we can create the whale operators using the CoCycles, which we saw in a simple. Cocycles, which we saw in a simpler case. Basically, that's for an arbitrary group, but when you specialize that construction for Poincaré, then you get the Weila operators indexed to by the members of Poincaré group whose single particles correspond to the quantum particle of interest to you. Okay, so once you get the Park space, bosonic Park space, we can create all the infinitely divisible distributions and the quantum noises and so on. Distributions and the quantum noises and so on. Okay, so the three subgroups I mentioned, they are time-like, whose momentum is, you know, the S000, they are called time-like particles, and then 0, 0, S0 are space-like, and then the light-like particles. So, these three groups are subgroups of interest to physics. First, you get the representation of these subgroups, and then generate the representation for the whole point, correct? That's the name of the game. That's the name of the game. Now, space-like particles are crossed out because supersymmetry doesn't allow these types of things. Basically, space-like particles come from the negative cone of the mass hyperbola. Those negative energy solidarities are forbidden in supersymmetry, so tachyons are not allowed in the supersymmetric framework. So you take a group, little group, and then take the stabilizer. Middle group and then take the stabilizer point, get the spinner for that, and then define a unitary mapping across the configuration space, which is basically the R bits on the R4, and then we are done. Now, that's what I meant. Space like particles, like attachions, they have negative energy solution that's forbidden by SUC, and we will see how our framework forbids these types of solutions. Okay, so then Then there are a couple of remarks. I mean, if you want to derive the Dirac equations for these quantum particles, then you have to do a Fourier transform and Swartz distributions. There are technical points, but these are all in Varadharajan's book, detailed very much, but we want to generalize them to supersymmetry. So before that, Supersymmetry. So before that, so we know how to build the build operators. From that, we can create the annihilation and creation operators. But these are all for the bosonic box phase. So the cartoon on the right, that gives photonic circuits. The pink box is basically a beam splitter. No, pink box is the laser beam. So that is input into a beam splitter. The output is fed into cavities, a couple of cavities. So this is can be thought. Couple of cavities. So, this is can be thought of as a quantum optical network. So, using this framework, we can derive a whale operator that is a solution for this quantum optic network. So, you can build the computational solutions. Well, most successful application of quantum stochastic calculus to quantum optics is examples of circuits like that. So, a few years ago, we thought that why not generalize this to electron circuit QED. Circuit QED. So that is fermionic Fox space-based system. So instead of these optical components, you can think about circuit QED, quantum electric dynamics devices like superconducting wires and Josephson junction. So we were able to map using the boson fermion correspondence. You take the fermionic noise and the map it to a bosonic noise. So for each A bosonic noise so for each cyclic QVD component, we can get a corresponding one in the bosonic flux phase. But then when you start feeding, so the output of that is a bosonic anoise, but then we had to convert again to a fermionic anoise to feed to the next component. So it completely got messed up. So it's not easy to treat a full circuit of fermionic noises using this corresponding. Fermionic noises using this correspondence. So I lost interest on this correspondence. But then, once I started studying supersymmetry, then I could make the connection. So they are a way to generate supercharges. Superchargers are the operators that map the fermionic sector to bosonic sector and vice versa. So we are going to see a very simple example of the supercharge that comes out of this fermion-boson correspondence at the very end of the On boson correspondence at the very end of the talk. Okay, so now we want to set up the supersymmetric framework. So we start with the Z-degraded vector space. So basically there are two sectors. We call them even and R, R sectors, R, you can call them bosonic and fermionic sectors with the inner product defined by that bracket. You want to define a parity operator if it belongs to the bosonic sector. Bosonic sector parity is zero, otherwise, it's one. Then we can define a super Hilbert form. The way it is defined is that if the X and Y comes from opposite parity, it is zero. If it is from the same even sector, it's X Y and if it is in the odd sector, both come from the odd sector, then it's IXY. So then the commutator, the very last green line, that is the supercomputator relationship that satisfies. Relationship and that satisfies that. So, this is an example of a Z2 graded vector space, this super vector space. If you want, if you prefer to call, this is what we're going to set up. So, what is a super Lie group? A super Lie group is a pair. It's a super Harish Chandra pair. Harish Chandra, so the G naught is the classical Lie group, like our original Poincare can be the G naught. The small G is a super. G0. The small g is a super Lie algebra in such a way that it's a Lie algebra is a module for the Lie group. It's an action. The action is nothing but an adjoint action. So it's a differential action. So this is the definition of a super Lie group. What is the representation for a super Lie group? That's triple. So you have an even representation of G naught in the super space and then it is. The super space, and then it is a it has a super representation or representation on a super Hilbert space, right? So, if you have these three objects, then you have a representation for the super Lie group. Now, super Lie algebra. Super Lie algebra is again a super vector space with a bracket. The bracket is slightly more than the Lie algebra bracket. Algebra bracket. The even part of the G naught is nothing but the ordinary Lie algebra of the group G naught with the action as we saw in the last slide, which is the adjoint action. And then it has to satisfy the last equation, the AAA is equal to zero. So that is kind of non-trivial in many cases. One way of to ensure that that equation is satisfied on the Lial geograph interest to you is to make this ray. You is to make this range of g2 is within g naught. In that case, it gets satisfied. So, that is the trick we will use to build the super algebra, Lie algebras. Okay, so super Lie algebras has a linear endomorphisms and a super vector space that is they are the maps that preserve the gradings, okay, and then satisfies the super commutator relationship. Committee relationship. So, again, this is how Varadarajan's and his collaborators have generalized these ideas. So, most of the work, I mean, Varadarajan's book is primarily based on Mackie's missionary, the original book. And then he lifted a lot of these ideas to supersymmetry. And then we are basically lifting them to the second quantized setup. So we saw the definition of a supermetry. Saw the definition of systems of impermeability. What is a super system of impermeability? So that's a tuple, the four components. The super League group G naught G, which is the Harish Chandra pair, it lives on the configuration space, which is a quotient of G naught by H naught. We take a subgroup, H naught, and then we get, see, the subgroup is also. Subgroup is also a super Lie group. So there is a corresponding Harishandra pair for the subgroup, right? It's a special subgroup because the Lie algebra part of this subgroup is same as the Lie algebra of the whole group. Okay, so that is an assumption. It's not very hard to satisfy, but that helps with all the derivations. So it has to start with three conditions. The first three components. First three components are the unity representation of the superlie group. We saw what it means to be a representation on the previous slide. And then pi HP is the classical system of impermittivity, which again, that's how we started with the whole discussion. And then the P, the projection value to measure, which is part of the classical system of imprimativity, that commutes with the representation of the superli algebra. So that's it. Once you have this, then we have a super. You have this, then we have a super system of improvement. What that means is that we have an irreducible representation of the super League group, which is the point, right? So again, we are talking about semi-direct product. So super translation group. So again, it is the abelian part, which is the space-time translation. part which is the space-time transformation group that is going to be the super version the L is usually classical version classical okay which in the next slide we are going to see that L is nothing but G the homogeneous Lorentz group and then you have a super version of the space-time translation group and once you take the semi-direct product we have a super semi-direct product of these two groups okay um so So suppose T1 is the L1. So T T naught T1, okay, that is the T is the tangentialization group, T naught is the even part of the super Lie algebra, T1 is the odd part of the algebra. Now, as I want to emphasize that, odd part is basically the operators that map from fermionic to bosonic sectors and vice versa. Sectors and vice versa. So the supercomputator is L naught invariant. And then this is basically the definition setup. Now we briefly saw about a super little groups and the stabilizers. So you can construct, we know that the two groups, the third little groups of Poincaré is not relevant for supersymmetry, the light-like and the time-like. Light-like and a time-like super, I mean, sorry, little groups can have a super version of them, and then you can construct system improvement on the corresponding configuration space. So there is one extra thing to worry about in the super situation as opposed to the classical situation. Not all stability points are valid here, some are called admissible. Admissible if the representation of the subgroup is of the form that is in the middle of the square, the boxed expression. If that is the case, those are admissible. Physically, what they correspond to, that is, they correspond to the positive energy solutions, which is means the positive cone of the mass hyperbola, which we saw several slides ago. So, this is a way to eliminate. Way to eliminate tachyons and space-like particles in a supersymmetric setup. Okay, so our main result is basically light-like particle whose field representation of the super Point grade group on the super Fox space. We saw in detail how to build the single particle Hilbert space, right? So, in this case, what you have done is we are the I don't know whether I can see. Okay, so in the middle, there is an equation gamma. Gamma S is the symmetric Fox phase of H naught plus 1. What that means? Plus stands for the positive hyperbola, where the configuration is on the positive cone of the hyperbola. One is the spin, and there is no mass zero because this is a Hilbert space for a photon. A photon, right? Now, the super partner for the photon is a 4-NO, which has a half-spin plus again in the positive cone of the mass hyperbola. And then it has a mass zero. So you know how to construct that Hilbert space. Then take an anti-symmetric Fox space, right? That's a fermionic Fox space. So take a disjoint union of two of these Fox spaces. The two of these Fox faces, and that is your Fox phase, super Fox phase. Then we can define supersystem implementivity, and then you will get the operators, the wheel operators. See, the wheel operators are applicable only for the bosonic park space. Again, so we saw that the even part of the superly group is mapping into the bosonic box phase. So we get still. So we get still the whale operators on the even side of the superfox phase, right? Indexed by the Poincaré group. Now, for the odd part, I mean, the fermionic part, we can still create the creation and annulation operator whose indexes are members of point current, right? This is a standard construction how you do it from the anti-symmetric Fox phase. Anti-Symmetric Fux phase. So before that, yeah. So we have the wheel representation of a super Poincaré group that is second quantized setup. We are the wheel operators indexed by members of Poincaré. From that, we can create the creation and annihilation operators and for the Fermi. For the fermionic side, you go through the usual construction and get the creation and annihilation operators. So, with that, we will go to the boson-fermion correspondence, right? So, the top equation basically relates the bosonic equation to a fermionic equation. So, dv is fermionic process, and the right side is the bosonic process. Then Then you can set up what are called superchargers. Q plus R minus. I mean, there are charges. Supercharger means, right, you maps bosonic to fermionic and fermionic to bosonic sector. So using the conservation operator, conservation. So you have a creation, annihilation, and conservation operator. The lambda, capital Lambda stands for annihilation operator. So 2 pi i lambda. So 2 pi i lambda. So the top equation in the red is nothing but, you know, I just write it, I wrote it in 2 pi i form. Basically, they are the same. So you can set up the charges and then you can set up the Hamilton in this way. Then you can prove that this is supersystem improvement duty. Now we want to have them in completely in terms of the The whale operators, right? The creation and annihilation and conservation operator. So, in Pata Saras' book, basically he defines the reflection process, very top line J T of which is equal to gamma of ut. So, the gamma is a whale operator. So, it's a whale. The whale operator has two parameters. Operator has two parameters: unit vector and a unit operator, unitary operator. So, in this case, this gamma has unit vector part is zero, and then it only uses the unitary operator where he chooses ut to be minus one, then it satisfies the cono-stochastic equation dj equal to minus two j to j d gamma, right? Gamma one. So, um So then he sets up the fermionic processes FM and FM dagger as J D A and J D A dagger. So I modified that to include I plus J times half and I plus J times half with using them. So there are a series of propositions you uses, he sets up to prove that starting with the canonical That starting with the canonical commutation relationship, you can reach the canonical anti-commutation relation. That is from a bosonic to fermionic side, you can go. So basically, I'm following the same proof from the textbook, except that instead of J, it is I plus J. So most of the thing goes through using the quantum meter rule. And then the martingale and the The martingale and the no jump process establishes that relationship. This is the first proposition, but the similar, all the other propositions follow using similar logic. Then from the first expression from i plus j to i minus j, we get another supercharge. So we can get a extended supersystem, supersystem of supersymmetry, supersymmetric system. Supersymmetric system, n equal to 2 means you have two supercharges, right? So that's how we use the boson-fermion correspondence to build a supersymmetric system in the second quantized setup. All right, so what you have seen is that we got a relativistic group representation of weld operators. Then from that, you can have the field operators of the Fox spaces. Fox spaces. So Lorentz group homogeneous and then Poincaré is what we used for the group. So basically, quantum field theory is reconciling quantum mechanics and special related theories, but non-interacting situation, interactions, which is more complicated. And our manifolds are again has no curvature. So curvature has other complications. So in the next steps, we are going to. Um, so in the next steps, we are going to consider quantum embedded quantum symmetry in the second quantity. So, see, quantum symmetry means the topological systems. People use subfactor theory. So, those type of the braiding of tangles and so on, on those can be incorporated into second quantities to see. We are working on that. We don't have all the results, we made some. Have all the results, we made some progress. Um, then extending from spinners to adinkaras, um, so spinners, what we are saying are on-shell uh systems. We saw that in the mass cyberbola, if it satisfies the wave functions, they are called on-shell systems. But we wanted move to off-shell systems. Um, half-shell systems are described by adding ras, right? Adingras are the graphs at the bottom whose nodes are bosons and. Whose nodes are bosons and fermions, and there are rules to construct those arrows and color the arrows and so on. So these diagrams are called adding crash. They are representations of half-shell systems. But once you set up the adding ras using a set of rules, we can derive a real Clifford algebra, then we can make them as a spinner and then use it in our setup. That's what I'm thinking, but I got to work out a lot more detail. Thinking, but I got to work out a lot more details. But then eventually, you got to use the fermion-boson correspondence. We saw it on a very simple multiplet. So the first multiplet is what we saw. But for a more complex multiplete on the right side, with the diamond-shaped graph, what would be the boson-fermion correspondence would look like, right? And then scale it up. As I said, Scale it up. As I said at the very beginning, there are systems with the 2 power 32 bosons and 2 power 32 fermions that are relevant to 10-dimensional supergravity theories. So I started a collaboration with Jim Gates. He's an expert in supersymmetry. He's been working on it for 30 years at College Park. So he's introducing me to these problems and we are trying to tackle them. These offset systems. These offset systems and the representation are not necessarily irreducible representations. So that's another challenge we have to worry about because the whole Mac emissionary and these induced representations are all valid for irreducible representations. So where things are of those things we have to take into account and then get a description of these open problems of interest to physics. And thank you for your attention and I will take questions now. For your attention, and I will take questions now. Okay, let's thank the speaker now. So, do we have any questions? Yes, please. Hello. So, you say that you use the Bose-Fermi, the Hudson-Partridati, Bose-Fermi correspondence to construct super-symmetric unitary representations. A unitary representation. I don't understand very well how do you do because the osifermic respondence requires factorizable typical problem. And typical unitary representation of Lorentz group are not types. How do you and moreover, there is a problem of dimension. Uh uh as a paradigmatic construction, you need one dimension because you need to speak of adaptive, which has no meaning at least up to now in more dimensions. Okay, yeah, the Laurent representations are on our fourth. How do you put together all these okay? So basically, we are mapping everything to a bosonic fax phase, right? Bosonic Fox phase, right? Where everything is defined very well. All your whale operators, unit representation, everything is defined very well, right? So you basically use the on which one particle space. This is the crucial point. In the Hudson-Pertaseratic Age. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, yeah. So if you look at the constructions, the single particle Lilbert space we are considering. Particle, but space we are considering photon and photino, right? They basically differ only by the um the spin part of it, right? But no, okay, let me come to this. So basically, the boson and fermion comes only on the space-time part of it, right? Space-time is R4. So, R4 is where you are going to create your Fox space. So, both for Both fermion and boson distinction is made only on the R4 side of it, not on the Lorentz side of it, not on the Lorentz group. So, basically, defining the forms, so that Fox, that single particles Hilbert space and the resulting Fox space would be the same because we are using the same R4 space-time group. Well, maybe the discussion. Discussed. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I will send you my manuscript. I updated the manuscript, but I'll add these details. Yeah, I see your discomfort where it is. I mean, but the super semi-direct product is between the classical Lorentz group and the space-time group. So space-time part alone is becoming super. So both fermionic and both. And bosoni-Hilbert space would be based on R4, which is the same dimension. I have just another curiosity, which is the simplest and non-trivial example of super Lyago. Non-trivial means that it's not a direct or a direct product. You want an example of a super system quantum mechanics or quantum system? Just super layout, just a super lay algebra, which is not. Super Lie algebra, which is not a trivial, not trivially obtained by composing. Okay, super Lie algebra. Yeah, so yeah, as I said, you take R4 itself. That's a Lie group, gets a Lie algebra. Then you set up the Z to graded Hilbert space using R4 itself, and then define the bracket. Define the brackets and then you are done. You get a superlative drone, right? So you define the inner product between the bosonic side and the fermionic side, and then put I over there. By hand, you can construct that. Then you'll get a super Lie algebra. So R4 itself can generate, R itself can generate a super algebra. Super Lie algebra, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Any other question? Yes, we have another question here. Thank you, Professor, for the inspiring talk. I have this question. You talked about this veiled presentation of the general abelian groups. And I was wondering, we know very well that this one-dimensional, two-band, two-dimensional R through R4 or C and V. R for or C and me, if you take the boxpace or that and the wheel represents, these are all, these, all these objects have a lot of applications. But I was wondering if you take, if you start with the infinite dimensional Hilbert space, many people in this group are actually interested in talk space over infinite dimensional Hilbert space. So your abelian group is an infinite dimensional Filbert space. And then you build this uh whale representation over that. And do you know any applications for real world applications of such Real-world applications of such real-world applications for this infinite-dimensional representation built over box spaces of infinite direction. Yeah, see the quantum optics, guys, the number of degrees of freedoms are finite. Yeah, that's why. Yeah, so I was wondering whether some field theories. I was wondering whether some field theories do need such kind of a mechanism. Um, yeah, half-kind I can't think of. Um, yeah, so unless those things are finite. See, the configuration space of a quantum particle that's R, R4, those things are again finite dimensional. Um, no, I cannot think of anything uphand, but um, that's a good question. Yeah, if I think of something else. Question, yeah. If I think of something, I will. Thank you. I'll just shoot an email to you. I'm very interested in this stuff, and I could not find any applications for that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know you guys are funded by ARO, the MURI review. So I hope to meet you on the next MURI meeting. So we'll discuss that. Sure, thank you. So, do we have any more questions? No, okay, let's thank the speakers again. Thank you, Professor Pradak. So we'll have a
