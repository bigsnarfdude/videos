So first acknowledgement really is collaboration with many people, but I know there are highlights are not the people who really do the work. So we know cells can exist in different cell types, and then they can transit between one type to another one. It happens in developmental processes, physiological processes, and even pathological processes. Even people can hear. Can hear this EMD we have heard from the first day, right? So they know so we know people can artificially reprogram themselves from one atom at a time. So we know so it's a dynamic system. So mathematically, first thing we need, if we can find the representation, as I heard, okay, so then we can represent the south state in this multi-dimensional south state space, right? You know, how to find the representation that they're How to find representation that is a problem. So, well, let's say, so then each cell state will be point in this phase space. So, then the regions corresponding to one type, regions corresponding to another hype. Then, if a cell transits from one type to another type, it needs to follow a continuous or farther continuous path. So then when a cell transit, we know the transition path will form kind of either concentrated at one or few regions. One will few regions, then cells can have different phase. So, biologically is very important. If I understand how this happens, how to regulate it, we can't regulate them. Since the cell is a dynamical system, so mathematically, well, I think I have to have, okay, yes. So, this is actually a problem. People have studied in physics for physical chemistry for over a century. So, it's like, you know, if you've got chemical translation. Like, you know, if you've got chemical translation, that's a fall to this category. So, this is a well-known review on this topic many several decades ago. So, we know mathematically, we can say, okay, cell state, you know, we can describe the dynamics by a generic set of equations. So, question, how you determine this coordinate, how you find out what's this equation. Let's say we go already finally one. Let's say we've already found one. So we know, let's say, generically, we can use this set of equations to describe the cell state dynamics. So we use this tolerance dynamics. So we assume we have sufficient cell state resolution. So equivalently, for a single cell, for a population of cells, we can write down this PDE, represent how the density, density distribution change, evolves in this Evolves in this state space. So, clearly, I see here, I, you know, for simplicity, I neglect this cell-cell interaction, which can add on this, right? So, there, but there, you see, you have this convection term that's due to the cell gene regulation, which changes the cell state. Then, also, if you relate to this stochastic ODE, if you use extra noise. If you use extra knowledge interpretation that's given by this, and you use others like NITO, collector terms, not so important. Then you have this capacity diffusion term. Then this is about self-death, births, all things. We can cover that here. The add-ax terms, you have internal factors. So, as I said, if you want to really include self-interaction, I do this agent-based model, right? But each cell has those kind of described dynamics. So then a lot of effort trying to do is how to learn these equations. So one idea is, you know, okay, you have you already have a lot of you already know, you know, you have, you can measure this distribution function and at different time, you can do some regression. One method to use optimal transport, right? There are definitely, you know, and there are some assumptions, and we're Some assumptions, and where, and also, you notice here, numerically, a challenge here, you need a real accurate measurement of this multi-dimensional density distribution. Another thing is if you have not just the coordinate, but you have this instant velocity, then you can utilize this, right? The dirt function can replace it a little, but anyway, you can inform the bins, right? So then, because, oh, you assume all the... And then because you assume that all those factors are kind of slowly varying, you can easily show, you know, you end up with this average in the bin, and also this is much less sensitive to the actual accuracy of your testing actually. Okay, so I'll mainly talk about this whenever we try to use. One thing not relevant to this, not so relevant to this workshop is that we have a work, means you have a single cell genomic data, although this formula is more general. This form is more general. So it means you have a measurement of x, the fornich, this here, things are RC. You have this called the velocity. Now you try to learn this function again. Although you do function space, and you try to use variational methods to learn this function, which I will not talk about in detail. But the problem for this, you have this snatch-ally, a fixed destructive method. Constructive method. So you really, the dynamics does, you know, you don't know whether it's reliable. So to do that, you have to do LAX energy. But LAX energy has its own problem. You have to really take care of the cells for a long time, almost several days. And you know how many you can measure. That's a major thing because if you use fluorescence-based matter, then you have to constrain how many you can label. And you have a lot of technical issues. Seeing how to technical issues, we spent several years trying to crisp this. Then, as a facilitation, I thought, okay, that's not the way to go. So, when we realize, we can use this collective morphological features, which can easily measure with just transmission light. Well, we can combine with fluorescence. So, we have heard a lot in this workshop use morphological features to work on state. Importantly here is we Important here is we utilize a dynamic variable. So, here to reference our state. So, here I'm going to talk about a few papers published recently, led by my former postdoc, Wing Pang, and his several students. So, this is the EMT, Ashoka mentioned. You know, this is the human A5.9 cells. And so, people really want to know, okay, so how cells take from this state to this state? This state. A lot of open questions to talk about. And so, how do we do that? We do have some line from ATCC that have this endowment for interlabeling. So then we end it with a DIC channel. So this is what you see. And we can qualify this morphology by the we just use the active sweep model. Then we have less internal fobanes, but this intermediate filament to have texture features. The filament to have texture features. So we use the parrot features only by this to have this, you know, you represent the cell state by this composite cell shape, a texture feature space. So the idea is that we have all the data, you know, several days of imaging. So you first do segmentation, we do some deep learning how to segment cells. Then we just need to represent cells. We use this active ship model, right? You know, it's a By the way, for this one, we start with 2D. I have heard a lot of fancy 3D studies. Here we all start with, initially we use 2D, which my calculators are simpler. So you can rub down a shape, right, with points, reference points and layers. Each one has a Cartesian coordinate. So then, every shape, you can have a point in this two-n-dimensional shape space, right? So you can do even do. So, we can do even do some more principle analysis thing. We can form a basis, essentially. Mathematically, it means we have a complete orthonormal basis function set in this shape space. But then, that's the mathematical representation. So, with that, well, here's summary procedure, imaging, segmentation, extract features to represent the cell state, then we'll have individual single-cell trajectories. So we can do a Our trajectories. So we can do analysis using a lot of techniques we have developed when we study chemical reactions. So here's a representative cell. You see the yellow is the light intensity detected feature. So this is, I think, two or three days, I forgot to remember, with the imaging, extremely teacher data. We use EMT. So what we do is, as I mentioned, yeah, here the writer is, you know, this is the The writer is, you know, this is the shell shape. So, this is in this composite cell feature space. You have a trace over time. You got this morphological trajectories. So, this is a high dimension. I only represent the beating two dimensions. So, you got many trajectories. If you look at them, you already see they're quite different, right? We know that there are two types of trajectories. And you can really quantify them. To do is, you have a single To do is, you have single-cell trajectories, you can, with your set BTW, essentially try to match that similarly, you define distance, right? Then you can do clustering. You found out that you can cluster two trajectories, two types of trajectories corresponding to this gene. Okay, now you have the data, then we can apply theory. You know, I, my background, yes. And the previous light and the second scatter plot, each point is one trajectory. Yes, yes. Oh, good. Thanks for pointing it out. Yes, yes. Yeah. Up. Yes, yes. Yeah. Alright, this one init point is one image, right? This is one init point is one trajectory. Yes. So, so this is what, you know, in chemical physics study, chemical reaction means you have starting from a region, then this reactant, this product, you ask how the molecule, like, change from molecular system change from here to there. Then we have, you know, we have defined two regions. You have traditional. You find two regions, you have a trajectory, you see some trajectory leaving this region, and up this region over the radio trajectory. You collect all those radical trajectories and do analysis. And neo-trajectory, they move, leave, then go back. They try to attempt to do direction, but it fails. So this is a two rule of two directories. So there are a lot of techniques that have developed in the past century to study. So now what we can do is So now what we can do is do a single molecule studies for a company, right? But with Cell, you see even at the same thing as me, we can have a lot of goods. So here I show you in chemical reaction, there's one key point. What's the reaction coordinate? Essentially, you think it's an order parameter. So from here he is quite a one-dimensional manifold connect. You can think about, you know, from here to here. You can have many possible ways to go from here to there, right? So this is, you know, each one has a certain probability. And this is essentially a fine possible. So then, but in a multiple trajectory, you see, okay, you're concentrating some regions. You're trying to define the centroid of those trajectories as this order parameter. So this is, to do it, you know, our technique is that. You know, technique is that you do, you know, divide the region. You first have a trial, you know, you have a trial, then you have these points, and describe the state, you go ballooning cells, then you have data, data assigned points, then you say you try to find a new centroid, then repeat, like those things. So this is this people have done this in the simulated data and now have single trajectories. Sigma has signed out trajectory. Sigma model is just a self-trajectory and it apply from our data. So we got those things. So this is what we got from our data. So as I mentioned, I have two groups. So for each group, we do this. We see there are two paths. Then we already see this right, we represent a three-dimensional and this is individual structure simple both at this, the fluctuator ones at this. We can remember I mentioned, you know, if a data have here, we have a last time, right? Here we have a large image. I do have an x, I have a b x in t. I do have that. I can even try to infer what this is matching field equation. But here I want to do something simpler because we didn't have enough data at the time. So we say, see, I want to just focus on the dynamic function along this one-dimensional reaction coordinate. So in this case, then I can easily reform my. And I can easily reformulate this one-dimensional, no matter if it's ultimately some of the equilibrium, right? We can still define a pseudo-scalable textual and rewrite this. So what do we do is, you know, we have the region, right? We have Walooni cells. And for each cell, Waruni cell, we look at the data, look at the S and T, do the average, F5, 50S. Then we integrate that over. Integrate over. So then, but where the human constants relate to this data by this eigenstat relation, we can also get from here. So, all this from data. Okay. So this is what we know. This is the ambiphibial cells. It's a stable phenotype as a tractor. So I just monograph of the spatial distribution. And this one is what we got from the data. So we see this is along this radio coordinates, that's one rectangle. Regiment ornament, there's one red ornate. You see, there's a new attractor. Originally, there's a tractor, but you see already a black. And so the system relaxes start continuing, relax to the new attractor. And this is another path. Well, so we see some remnants of this original epithelial tractor. If you lower down the T diabetic concentration, you can even see more average. More more averages of the original tractor. Okay? So this is what we get from the data. So I want to say this is a very cheap experiment, right? But if you do quantitative analysis, you've already got very rich information. So and also may I think about what's the mechanism there? And you really think about this you have a tractor that can destabilize and Tractor that kind of destabilize and relax this. You know, if you're a mathematician, you think about this second mathematician thing, right? But I will ask, the value asks, okay, but I want to know the genes. So, one question, just for clarification, you know the starting and the ending points. Yes. But how do you define in-between metastable attractors or any other things? Can you do that also? Oh yeah, so you uh right, you you the the face span you have a region, you define this uh tractor, uh region is uh I see it's a methane star. The exact uh uh region doesn't have much. Right, this is what we did in the campaign spherics. Okay, so uh this one, well, we happen that we have a set of uh single-cell R-seq data, uh, but for the not a cell, we do have an A54. Another satellite. We do have an A59 satellite as well. What I talk about later will be essential to the same. So, my student Sophia just applied what I just talked about that work. I didn't talk in detail this one, right? To the single-side R-seq data. And this is what she found, right? So, this is the vector field we construct from single-site R-seq data. So, what they do is that, you know, we just two-dimensional representation. This is a cell cycle. Representation. This is a sub-cycle, so it's periodic. Remember, it's periodic, okay? So this is the this one turn out, it's an epithelial to massotum, epithelial to massothum. Okay, you see this is attractive. Well, where I can see those, see this is the region of the bifurcation holes. Okay, so then we can do a trajectory analysis because we can reconstruct, construct a transition model out of there. So define, symbolize what I did for the last emitted. Similarize what I did for the life-emitting data. You have this absolute region, massive human region. Your long trajectories, some are non-reactive, some are reactive. Those simulations are done in the full space. I only shown here in two dimensions, okay? So this is a different reputation with some UMAP. So this shows you what the correct boundary is. So you got those trajectories, you collect those reactive trajectories I mentioned, right? I mentioned, right? Then you look at the new reaction board, and you see this. This is one, this is another one. By always, you will see, okay, this is GYS arrest. This is G2M arrest. Then somehow they merge. Well, exactly what I said, what I've mentioned and shown in LASA imaging. Well, this one actually is very surprising to me because you see always in the sub cycle, it's an arrow plan. You only go forward, then we'll go backward. But this one actually shows that, you know, really go backward, merge, you know, meet with this one. What does it mean? Please with this one, what does it mean? So, I, yeah, this is another representation of the two vectors. I talked to my colleague who biologists, he showed me, oh, we observed this in our system as well, in their study, cell cycle. He is an expert usually on cell cycle rest. So he said, oh, we can see there's cell cycle. We use multiplexity to show this, you know, central layer, G1F, C2M, and the rest. So, what happens? C2M and the rest. So, what happens is they already duplicated for copy, right? For copy DNA, but then they couldn't go through as a mitosis. But then instead, you know, their cyclines got degraded, so it looks more and more like G1S. And we have the right field. We can even try to look, because this one contains the gene regulation information. We look at those, and then combine with literature, do this system biology type of analysis thing, and our Now, see, end up something like this. So, this is SM1, the transform factor for EMT, and this cyclin D, cyclin B of a cell cycle. Then you realize, okay, there's positive feedback, then this one inhibits cyclin D, cyclin B, then you have this feed forward. So what happens, this is more suggestive, what happens, this, you know, this is a cell cycle, and then normal cell cycle, you have signaling D, it drives TMIS, then go here to T2M. Then go here to G1, there's a bigger cycling B, right? So what happens? Go to G1, then Zaba can activate. So then start to inhibit the cycling AC. Well, if you pass there about here, then ZAB will start inhibiting cycling B to program this G2M. So then all those drive along the side will drive this, right? Second D drop, sitting D drop, then the EMT could go forward, right? So that drives the E. So that drives people to show this kind of path. Okay, so actually we are doing an experiment to further conform this, but we haven't finished yet. So you see what I show here, you know, this is Laxamity, and this is from the SIMS RC data. And this is, I show that I can destruct the pseudo-potential from the last image data. This is from the SIMS sequence data. So we know when we do mathematical biology, When we do mathematical biology modeling, we always talk about macro field bifurcation or things. Here I show you from the data. Okay, really, really return from the data. And this one, you know, with more data will get something like this as well. So this is, well, also, you know, to get all data, we need to really refine our image analysis procedures. So this is an effort led by my student. We are developing a whole because my students, we have a lot of Because we have a lot of image analysis package, but mainly for the fixed cells. But lots of imaging, there's certain new challenges. So he developed a method to improve it. So at the end, I want to summarize this. I think this is really, I want to kind of relate to what Eschoff mentioned at the beginning of it. So we have a lot of big data things, a lot of statistical approaches, but for me, as a background. For me, as a background computer, I want to go statistics, statistical physics, including biology physics into the study. So, specifically from quantitative data, we got the governing equations, got the dynamics there. And so, the goal is that you have the last cell, we really can write down several mathematical equations. Then we can do all those in cylindrical studies. So, this is something remotely already also mentioned several times in this workshop, this molecular dynamics lab. It is a more like a dynamics level simulations. There, those main thing is about the equation easily. You have Newton's equation, but then keeping that force field. There are a lot of ways they try to get that fourth field. But the cells are much more complex, right? But now we have so much data, fun data. So there is hope, you know, we can make the puzzle repeatable. We can really get those equations. Then we can really get a lot of information. So this is my last slide. This was my last time. So in your linkalarian in an NXT way, it's okay to have those a white mouse. I'm assuming this is a white mice. Yes. It works. Yeah, that's why. It's a matter of meaning. I assume the self-state is fully resolved, so I can do a lot better. Otherwise, you could be the either at one degree freedom or use colour noise, right? You're sort of also assuming it's an autonomous system, so you're like fully observing the autonomous stochastic process? Well, I imagine. In principle, you can add more terms, right? You can add external driving force, can be time-dependent. Yes. So, how because this Equinians fit in lazy space, how dependent is it on the Yes, it's the way switching we sift. That's a very important type of question. So this is a, so you need a lot of efforts really to explore to what's the best representation. And also actual methods. So also method checks. So data source. You see morphological features are not enough. You have texture and how you represent texture or things. So there are a lot of detailed things. But you would turn certain features of the parallels and then see when they don't see that the answer. That's right. You know, that's the whole point of doing it. Yeah. You know, what the best features of the people are. Yes, yes, yes. Although, as I said, a lot of things we can do. Now we can join it because combined with those morphological set of features. Morphological set of features, and that's what we talk about here. And biological media, biologists, we talk about all the genes, which is how we can actually then make a this is really predictable. So, did you also listen to nucleus? Or was this only vanantin and shape? Yeah, we talked about nuclear things, so we haven't. Yeah, that's also you have futures, right? So, this is I told you the thing is become dynamic, you know, really, a lot of ideas. Really, a lot of ideas, a lot of uh plans to hold that. I like this idea of like a feature basis, but what guarantee do you have that your pathways that you're that you get are going to be nice continuous pathways between the Well, whether this is a good representation, that's one thing, right? But you asked whether you get our character get a continuum ask. Yeah, that's also, you know, need a representation. If you need a careful reach for the representation, you have this continuous wolf, right, and more from one or another. So, yeah, there's and also definitely, you know, when cell division happens, notice in my function, when cell division happens, that can And when cell division happens, that can jump, right? You know, two daughter cells that divide and you have a really jump diagram. Do you have an example? All your examples are well fit with a single representation, or do you have, like, how do you know that this problem has a unique solution? Yeah, there are a lot of things you need to explore. No, I haven't. So if he if you t if you take this yellow and this blue trajectory that you are showing, right? Yes, right, so how do you know that these trajectories exist? I mean do you know that they did exist or? Ah, so I mentioned that this is from things RSIC data predicted, right? And this is what we measured. Now, we want to make sure these two they're coming. To make sure these two there's correct boundaries. That's what we are doing is parameting. But you have a joint measurement of morphological change and single-cell RNAC? That's what you have. But RSIC data probably tools. We can do something. Also, this is not single-cell RNAC, by the way? This is from R-Sig data. Yeah. We can in principle definitely can do the drawing data. But the current line is not this is R-Seq. I think this was separate. Yeah. I think this was separate, but I don't know. Yeah. Okay. No other question. Let's take this together.
