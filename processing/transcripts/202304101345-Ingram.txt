So our first speaker of the afternoon is Fablis Inbelma from York University and he talks about arithmetic of anonymous. Thank you very much for the introduction and thanks to the organizers for the invitation. And thanks to everyone for coming to the talk. I mean someone who did the talk. So I want to give the intention of the spark. But the intention of this talk is to sort of give a bit of an overview. I won't mention anything particularly new. I haven't proven anything particularly new in this area, except for a few observations I made while writing up this talk that will appear at the end. But I want to give sort of an overview. And in particular, the talk is sort of aimed at people who maybe don't have the arithmetic background theory types and so on to get people sort of on the same page. So it's intended as sort of an overview, an intro. Intended as sort of an overview and introductory talk, although at the end it will degenerate into conjecture and heuristic and observations and accusations. So I want to start with too simple a question, but I'd like to start with a very simple form up. So the first question is, and let me try to move the cursor here off my slide. Okay, so a very easy question: what are the automorphisms of A1? So, a very easy question: What are the automorphisms of A1? Obviously, so this is a reminder. This whole slide is a reminder to me to say that the whole talk is taking place in the algebraic category. So, everything is a polynomial, automorphism. But don't worry about me. Okay. Okay. So, at this point, I mean, A1 obviously is a fundamental object in algebraic geometry, and I like to think of things algebraically, so I'll think of it as spec of C as N. And then you're really asking about isomorphisms from. Isomorphisms from C of Z to itself, and just a moment's reflection tells me that the image of Z is also of degree one, but doesn't mean it's rejected. And so that describes the automorphisms of A1, these in your maps. And as probably everyone knows in this room, but I will continue in this sort of introductory style, you can, of course, if you want to think about automorphisms of V2, you can generalize this construction. You can look at linear maps and two variables and just fall somewhat short of And this falls somewhat short of giving you all of the automorphisms of A2. For example, there are these elementary maps here. P is a polynomial. And I guess I want to specify that A to be earned. So in fact, you know, the linear maps are now just not all of the automorphisms, but they're essentially none of the automorphisms in some sense of dimensioning. And two fundamental results, which sort of mentioned following. Sort of mentioned as well in Eric talk before. First of all, the result of Jion that the automorphism group of A2, and again, the automotive automorphism here is generated by maps of these two forms. And then a little bit more sort of algebraic information, the automorphism group of the factor. We amalgamated the product of the affine subgroup. I have a question mark here, but I think I've confirmed that this is this statement as written here is also in this paper. As written here, it's also in this paper. The question mark on the computer or on the first one? The question mark was because, I mean, I had encountered this fact in this paper of Feedlining, and I think they don't mention Federica. And I also write some reference to this fact in this paper, but I never choose to read that paper. So I didn't want to assert that that exact statement is in that paper, but I believe it is. But the study of Friedland and Milner is more detailed, a lovely paper. Detailed lovely paper which has already been mentioned. So, in fact, every conjugacy class in A2 is represented either by an elementary map or a composition of these generalized hang-on maps, which we've already seen. So, here P is a polynomial degree at least two, and delta is non-zero. The original example of The original example of being a family of the Chechen is written in a different convention, but I'll adopt this in a minute, but it's used as well. So the purpose of this talk is, you know, what can we say if we think about these sorts of maps, and these are entirely algebraic things, if we think of these sorts of maps over any field, really over any brain, if we're feeling. Over any ring, if we're feeling ambitious, but let's stick to fields for most of this. So, we might ask what can we say about maps of this form over q, over ft, over a field like c of t. And I'm going to be asking about a very basic dynamic of each of these kind of. And then, okay, so I have this comment here. I'm actually not really going to talk about it. I think there are lots of interesting questions we could ask about the dynamics of finite fields, and none of them would be asked in this talk. Talk. All the points are periodic, sort of obviously, and still there are only many periodic points for a finite field. But I won't talk too much about FP. I'll be talking more about global fields. Okay, so in putting together this stuff, I found it almost impossible to talk about this without also talking about sort of arithmetic dynamics and morphisms and morphisms of PNS. Morphisms and morphisms in PN, that's sort of a comparative case. So, I want to mention a result of North Carolin from 1950, which may be sort of the first results of quote-unquote arithmetic hydroxy. And this is not about, not applicable to Hanumanx, but let me keep the statement first. So, let X be a projected variety over a number field K, so a finite extension of Q, with an ample line bundle L and a morphism F from X to X with the thar. From x to x, with the property that f pulls l back to some tensor power with their d at least two. So this is referred to as a polarized dynamical system. This line alternative polarization gives a polarization. Then the result is that there are only finitely many k rational pre-periodic points for f on x. This is a earliest result. Earliest result. If you want to keep things simple, I mean, if you just imagine x to be pn, then f is just something given by genes 10 degree d with no common zero. And then you don't need to worry about the line bundles and go along the strict brackets and then do the algebraic code or elementary code. And I'll also point out as an example of sort of an application of this, although it's an application that's already known. I mean, if you have an Agelian variety over k, the k rational points The k-rational points form a group, and if you take as your endomorphism doubling on the abelian variety, or something like that, then a corollary of this is that the can only find at least many torsion points. Now, this was already known in this particular case. It's a result of Mordell and Bay from the 1920s that K of K is a finitely generated group, so it's a finitely generated building group, and so of course it has only finitely made. Improvements as only finitely finite order, but we just want that factor to deduce it as an effort. So, what I want to do is sort of give a sketch of the proof of this as a mechanism for introducing the theory of heights. And maybe not exactly at this level of generality, not that difficult to do. So, I want to introduce the notion of heights for those who have not seen them before, and I'm going to start at sort of ground level, but you can go very quickly from ground level to the full level of abstraction that you need. So for a rational number, as a filter intimidated, you're going to see the lowest terms. The height is just the log max of the absolute value A. So it's just the amount of data you need to store that rational. And you could generalize this to algebraic numbers. This is not the optimal way of doing it, but just sort of roughly speaking, you could just define the height of an algebraic number to be, you know, write down its minimal polynomial over Q, and then compute the heights of the coefficients that hit the largest one, and then d dividing by the degree of f, just as sort of a that turns out to be a natural normalization. So heights measure complexity evaluation. Complexity of algebraic. I'd like to be able to apply this on arbitrary varieties. First of all, I'll mention that there's a sort of better way to write down heights over number fields and hence over the algebraic closure. Namely, if k is a number field, there's sort of a standard set of absolute values on k. For example, there are several embeddings of k into the complex numbers in every one. Embeddings of changes and complex numbers, and every one of them changes complex numbers. And if we have a point in projected space, we can just define its height to be, in every absolute value, we'll take the log max of the absolute values of the word mass, and then we'll compute some weighted sum of them. So the weighting is just to make this independent of the number of k equals the height, so it extends actually to the elsewhere enclosure. So So if you know exactly what all these absolute values are, then we can sort of write down heights of algebraic points in space. And this theorem of Morphat takes place in some projected variety. But that's actually not that much more complicated. So I mean, in order to define heights on projective varieties, you just need to relate everything back to Pn. So for example, if you have any morphism from x to pn, you can define a height associated to that morphism by just pulling back. By just pulling back on projective spaces. In particular, if you have an embedded stick of your primary sitting inside projective space. And it turns out that this, the height that you get by pulling back the height on Pn by this morphism depends mostly just on the line bundle P start of O1, the pullback of O1. And if X is projective, If X is projective, you can always write a line bundle as a difference between two semi-ample line bundles. And you can define the height on X relative to L as the difference between the heights that come from those two maps. So for example, I mean, you could do this in particular if you like, with feed and cv and embeddings. And then you could just define the height on X relative to L as the difference between the heights relative coming from those two embeddings. Do you get negative heights and maybe L? Get negative heights if you do that? You definitely get negative heights with respect to, like, though, if you have a divisor, then you take the height relative to negative that divisor. So at this level, like on T1, you can take the height relative to minus the point, and you get a negative. So this height function here, each XL on the surface depends on a million choices that we've just made. Depends on a million choices that we've just made. How we write this line bundle, which particular morphisms we choose, etc. It turns out that more or less all comes out in the wash in the sense that two different height functions constructed in this way on x relative to the same line bundle will differ by a bounded function. So it's not true that these things are sort of well defined, but they're well defined up to the boundary function. And that's also true replacing L by something inside of the class. Something is isolated as a class. So, all of these high functions, at least for the purpose of this talk, you can think of them as being a coal one equivalent velocities or something, not necessarily well-defined functions. So, I guess I already called something Northcote theorems, the sort of the other Northcote theorem that's the main lemma in the previous Northcote theorem. But I mean, this sort of thing was known probably to people like Jay. Probably to be the right J if you'd asked if in exactly this one, but I think Mark probably was like exactly this one. And the abbreviated version of this is that sets of bounded height and algebraic length are to be line. For that to be true, I need my line bundle. So if you have any objective for IDX and a handful ample line bundle, then if you Line bundle, then if you look at the set of points up to a certain height and up to a certain outbreak on x, then that's always going to be a finite set. So these type functions are a tool for proving finite results. And maybe at this level of generality, if you haven't seen this before, this might look tricky, difficult. So I want to give a quick sketch of this argument that proves this, because in fact, That proves this because, in fact, again, just like the definition of heights, you can go from nothing to full generality fairly quickly. Okay, so for rational points on P1, this is pretty easy because this height is just, if you write your point in homogeneous coordinates as two relatively prime integers, then if you bound this, you're bounding your choices for A. So, of course, you've got to find it. So, for P1 over. So for P1 over Q, this is sort of a trivial, it's just a hyper integer discrete. For P and over Q, you can use the same idea, or you can just dehomogenize. And you dehomogenize your coordinates. Each coordinate is bounded in height by the height of the whole tuple. And so if you only have finitely many choices for your coordinates, then you only get finitely many choices for height. So in fact, Rodefat's theorem for rational points on Pn is fairly. For rational points on Pn is fairly easy. If you think about points of degree D on P1, you can send, so that's basically an algebraic number of degree D. We can associate it to its minimal polynomial. And its minimal polynomial, the tuple of coefficients, is a point in d dq. And I mentioned that the height of that point should be basically, not just some scaling, the height of logic numbers. Scaling the height of algebraic number. And so, if you want to think about all the points up to a certain algebraic degree on T1, you can really just think about all the points in Td, with rational coordinates up to a certain point. There are only finitely many of those. Those polynomials have only finitely many roots. So that proves the full Northbot theorem for P1. And then by using the same decomogenization trick, if you know the full Northbot theorem for P1, you know it for Pn, just by going coordinate by coordinate. And then if you know it for And then, if you know it for Pn, your ample line bundle in the statement of Northcross theorem, maybe replacing it by a tensor power, gives you an embedding into Pn. And in embedding, of course, you can't embed a finite set. That's an infinite set into a finite set. So this gives you the full Northwak theorem without too much work. Sort of ex meaning a little the discreetness of the details. Okay. And then also. And it also gives you the other Northgott theorem once you make a sort of observation about what morphisms of degree D do to heights. And so if you think about that expression with a log max absolute value, if you replace all the coordinates with homogeneous forms of degree D, and then take the logs, you'd expect everything to scale up by a factor of D. And it turns out this is exactly how. And it turns out this is exactly what happens for morphisms. The height of f of p will be d times the height of p plus o of 1. And so roughly speaking, in an orbit, you expect heights to grow like d to the k. And so if you divide out by d to the k, you can sort of write down an asymptotic kind of coefficient of asymptotic growth of height in an orbit. And this is called the canonical height. Maybe at this level of generality for. Maybe at this level of generality first written down by Paul and Subleman, that there are earlier versions of this in other contexts. It follows from this limit definition that you get a nice transformation with respect to f. And it's not too hard to show from this property that this canonical height differs from whatever height function you started with by almost the bounded amount. So in the notation that I wrote down earlier, these heights should be the height on Pn with respect to all of the ones. And you almost immediately get that preperiodic points are exactly those with canonical height zero. If you only have finitely many things showing up here, then this limit. And so from that, three periodic points are a set of bounded height. And then from that over a number field or even over looking up to a certain algebraic three, you only get kind of many very points. That's the proof of this theorem of. This construction, coincidentally, is very similar in Eric's talk we saw these green functions. And this is sort of like if you do a find replace on some of these symbols, you get that definition. And it's not a point, it's a school meetings. Are there any questions at this point? So I will So I will now sort of attempt to segue back to hand-on maps. And in particular, what I want to mention is that we've been talking about morphisms on projective heightens. And for heights to work well, you need morphisms and you need projected variants. So of course, we can take these hand maps and extend them to P2, but they're not morphisms anymore. And just to give you some idea of what You have some idea of what can go wrong. So, you might, of course, ask, you know, how necessary was it in the statement that I made that the maps are morphisms? So, here's a rational map from P2 to itself, not an MAP, but some rational map I wrote down. And so, if this were a morphism, you would expect it to scale heights up by a factor of two. Well, some bounded error term. It's easy to show that this scales heights up by at most a factor of two. Scales heights up by the most effective. So, this direction of the relation is just the triangle control. But the other direction of the implied inequality on the previous slide is just not true for math matter. So in particular, it's easy to write down a bunch of fixed points that's math, and they have height whatever you want, or at least as high as you want, just by taking z because it's a large integer. So for rational So for rational maps, even from P2 to P2, it's not just that the proof doesn't work, it means that the statement is false. The statement is false is different than you find from any rational, irrational. Okay, so this statement is sufficiently vague that I can defend it. What I mean by the generalized sound maps extended to be two looks something like this. I mean, they haven't determined. That's the sense in which they look something maps. Okay, so this argument does not extend to rational maps from Pn to Pn in general. It turns out, however, that at least the conclusion of this statement of NorthCode is still something that you can say, at least generalized in on maps. Here I'm stating something a little bit more general. Maybe I should make a blanket statement. Should make a blanket statement about the talk, which is that some of these theorems I will mention hold in greater generality. And in some places, I've chosen to state them in greater generality, and in some places I've chosen to state them just in the context of the general phenomenon that we're talking about. It's a sort of arbitrary decision. But here's a particular claim. So here by a regular automorphism, a regular polynomial automorphism, I mean this definition was already given today. Sorry, given today. I mean, an automorphism of Pn with the property that at every point either F or F inverse is not, sorry, an automorphism of A N, with the property that we consented to P n, the indeterminacy of F and F inverse of the structure. So if you have such a thing, it turns out you can still give the same conclusion that the periodic points of a regular polynomial automorphism of degree at least two of a n. Of degree at least 2 of an would be a set of bounded heights. And so, in particular, over a number of fields, the rational periodic points would be a finite set. And I've attributed this here to three people. I think that, as stated, this is a result of Marcello. Laurent Denis proved this bounded height statement for a certain class of automorphisms of A2 that satisfy a certain technical. That satisfy a certain technical condition, which the general attendant maps here always do. And then Silverman, the earliest paper here, proved this in particular for the family of quadratic hymns. So that's the sort of the stuff I'm sweeping into one lunch game. And so I think I will also give a quick sketch of Denny's proof just for general. Just for generalizing maps, just to give you some idea of how this works. So it turns out Denny has a nice trick. Silverman's argument, which I'll mention in a moment, is much more complicated. Dinghy has sort of a nice trick, which lets you do this. So for just, this is not proving exactly the statement on the previous slide, because I'm just a fun for the special case, but just to sketch out the proof, we'll let F be a generalized animal degree at least B. And Denis's observation is that if you just take F and F inverse of F, Is that if you just take f and f inverse and add them together, just coordinate-wise, then that function does extend to an endomorphism of v2. And so you can apply the theory of heights to f plus f inverse, again added coordinate-wise. And since that's now an endomorphism of v2 of degree at least three, it scales heights up by a factor of at least three, up to some error trend. But then, essentially, the triangle inequality tells you. Triangle inequality tells you that the height of the sum is at most the sum of the heights plus log 2. And so on average, f and f inverse scale the height up by a factor of at least 1.5. So let's assume that f, now my without loss of generality here is a bold without loss of generality because this would be point by point in sort of without loss of generality assumes f that scales the height up. But a little argument, I mean, if you sit down for a moment. Little argument, I mean, if you sit down for a moment, if you apply f, sorry, if f is the one that scales the height up for p, if f inverse scales the height up next time, then your height has been scaled up twice, but you've got back to the same point, which has the same height it always had. And so you can sort of quickly show that that will bound the height of P. So if your goal is to bound the height of P, you're done in that case. And the other case is that it's always either F where F inverse that's what I've got. And then in that case, Up the height. And then in that case, if it's always that, for example, that scales up the height, then you can iterate this. And if f, sorry, if p is periodic for f, your lower bound becomes 3 over 2 to the k times the height of p, your upper bound becomes something that's a priori finite plus a constant times 3 over 2 to the k. And so it must be that the height of p is by, in fact, whatever constant is implied by this or so, if you know that constant, you mean the height of the k. Can you compute this instance? I mean, for a particular generalization, I'm not getting it. Yeah, I mean, and in fact, I think somewhere, maybe not exactly in this format, but I mean, you've been bounded in terms of the coefficients of the type. Like the coefficients. Yeah, yeah. Something in terms of the hyper coefficient of the coefficients. Okay. So Okay, so in fact Silverman proved a sort of stronger claim for these quadratic handling maps and the argument involves a sort of delicate resolution of the detriment. So Silverman's approach here is, okay, these things do not extend as morphisms from P2 to V2, but if you do some blowing up, then somewhere along the line they'll correspond to morphisms from projective rise to projective rhythms, you apply the theory of heights in those contexts. And then you just have to figure out what you go back. Have to figure out what you go back down to what happened to the extra parts of the height that correspond to the visors that were in your building. Yeah. Was you capital C there in your, is that like, what's where is this capital C in the end of poly? Yes, sorry, this is this should be case, oh goodness, no, it should not be, it should not be case insensitive, this should be capitalized. Yeah, this is not that C. Okay, this is that C. Thank you for pointing that out. So, in fact, Silverman shows that if you go forward in the orbit and backward in the orbit and add the heights together, then it grows like a little bit more than two to the k times. The height minus a constant, and implicit in this is, of course, if you have a periodic orbit, the left-hand side takes only finitely big values. And so, h of p better be smaller than capitalism. And as an example of sort of an application of this, someone writes down an asymptotic if you have a normal. An asymptotic, if you have a non-periodic point for f. Of course, if you have a periodic point for f, counting the points in orbit asymptotically, doesn't make more sense. But if you have a non-periodic point, you can count the points up to a certain height and get sort of specific asymptotic. So in arithmetic geometry, there's sort of a whole industry of counting points of bounded height on various varieties. And so, of course, the orbit is not a variety, but this sort of idea that. But there's this sort of idea that, again, arithmetic dynamics, maybe sometimes the orbits should see what properties they have in sub-varieties in their geometry setting. So there are all sorts of results about counting points, a boundary type of curves or surfaces, and so on. And this is sort of supposed to be of that favorable. So you can extend this somewhat further. I'm not actually going to go to the I'm not actually going to go to the end of the line here. So, this is one of the statements that I think in Chu's paper is probably for AN, and there's a later paper with even more results. But I just want to give a statement that is relevant to these generalized handling maps. So, Shinkawabuchi proved that you can actually construct a sort of canonical height for these things that's not exactly the same as the canonical height that you get for a morphism. As the canonical height that you get for a morphism, but shares some of the properties. And there's an inverse relation here between the importance of the property and the amount of physical space they have on the slide. So what Kawakuchi proved is that if you write down these limits, that you, you know, pretending F and F inverse homorphism is how you would define the canonical height. If you write down these limits, they do in fact converge. And then if you define a sort of two-sided canonical height to be the sum of these two one-sided canonical heights. One-sided canonical heights. And the vanishing of any of these things exactly picks out periodic points. There's a slightly more complicated rule for how the canonical height interacts with the iteration of f, like you have to iterate in both directions to get the relation. But if you go forward and backward canonical heights, this scales the canonical height by t plus 1. And I'll also mention we saw earlier read functions. So the basic height function on P2 or A2, if everyone wants to think of it, we write as this sum overall absolute values of the log max of the absolute values of the coordinates. So we saw the definition of these mean functions in Eric's talk. You can certainly the definition. Certainly, the definition where you take the limit as k goes to infinity of log max of the coordinates of fk pi by k, you can get out of any absolute value on any field, you can just write down the limit and see whether or not the limit exists. And what Kavaguchi shows is, in fact, for every absolute value on k, the limit exists. And if you take the sum defining the sort of basic height and you replace those log max terms with these mean functions in the same way that some, you get this canonical height, which basically Which basically means that you can, if you think of this as a limit of a sum overall absolute values, you can sort of interchange the limit of a sum, despite the fact that it's a sum. You get legitimate interchange sum. Okay, so oh, the last thing, sorry, see, I knew I was going to forget to say this. Maybe the most important property that takes up the smallest amount of space on the slide is that this canonical. Amount of space on the slide is that this canonical height. So, for morphisms, we got that this was in the same bowl of one equivalence class as the basic height. And here we don't get that, we get this weaker relation. So, this asymptotic sign in this context means that each function is bounded by a linear function of the other. So, for example, if you have a set, a set of bounded height relative to one height, it's still a set of bounded height with respect to the other height, but you don't have this tight relation of them being equal up to a bounded function. Than the equilibrium boundary function. So you're not saying that they're asymptotic with ratio one, you're saying they're some ratio. That's right, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. So they're they're the limit of the ratio is in some measure. So I want to briefly talk about some other questions about sort of periodic. Sort of periodic points. And in particular, I want to mention some results in sort of unlikely intersections. And to motivate this, I want to mention the result that I think of as sort of the starting point for questions of unlikely intersections, giving people a different opinions. This is an old question of Lang, not that old, I think, 50s or 60s or something. And Lang asked this question: Suppose you have an algebraic error in the complex plane, sorry, in the Plane, or sorry, in the A2 order of dependent numbers, infinitely points of which have both coordinates e groups of unity. What can you say about this? What sort of structure can you give for this curve? And this question was relatively quickly answered by Sarah and Kate in Lee that C has to have this particular form, X to an integer, Y to an integer, equals a root of the integer. So this is what you're hearing. I wouldn't have been able to purpose to look like. And if you think about every season here as being almost the same thing as two copies of the multiplicative, this is a torsion set of a cyclical set. So certainly everything of this form has infinitely many points whose coordinates are points of unity, but the reverse is true as well. And you can think of this as kind of a dynamical question if you want, up to a little messing around with one of the coordinates being zero, say, the reform. Zero, say, we could reformulate this question as the more or less equivalent question of which curves in A2 have infinitely many pre-periodic points with the square. Remember to throw zero in here. That's a so you're squaring both orphans? Yes, yeah. Okay. It's not always advancing when I press. When I press. And it's okay, we're talking about these generalized handout maps, and you might ask a sort of analogous question here: periodic points instead of periodic points. Or you might ask the analogous question if you have a generalized handle map F and a curve in E2, you know, basically replace the squaring map here with what we've generalized handle maps. How many finite orbits do you expect to intersect with this curve? And if you think Curve and if you think about for any k, if you're looking at points of period dividing k and intersecting that with a curve, I mean, if you throw whatever d to the k points onto the plane, probably not on the plane on this curve. So for most k, you expect there to be, generically speaking, no points of this form on this curve. And so the philosophy is, well, maybe even though you take the union over all k, you get a finite number. And here, And here, maybe I should specify that I mean over the complex numbers or over the algebraic closure or something like that. So at this point, we already know that this map F will have only finite meaning if you're wanting to start with over a number of closure, and this becomes a question. And so the first result in this direction I want to mention is a result of Thai. And this was And this result is one of the ones which is in more generality than I'm stating it here. And there are several different results in the paper under different hypotheses. So I'm just giving sort of a sample of one result, the type of thing you can say about this question for these generalized handling maps. Namely, so let's suppose we have one of these generalized handling maps over C, and let's assume there is an algebraic curve between periodic points of F, well then this puts some restriction on. Put some restriction on the delta in the y comma p of y minus delta. It's got delta parameter. So, okay, the first restriction is that delta is an algebraic number. If you're starting over c, that's a fact, that's a statement about your delta. If you're starting as I do over a number field, that is not restricting things at all. But the claim that all of the conjugates around the unit circle is some new information that you have. Information that you have. So turning this around, if you have some generalized handling map that does not have this property, then there's no algebraic period. There are, however, certainly examples you can write down of generalization maps and algebraic curves where there are infinitely periodic ones, which then must satisfy these conclusions here. Namely, if you take one of these reversible maps, so one of these maps where So, one of these maps where f and f inverse are conjugate by some involution, then the curve of fixed points of the involution will have any extra points on it. And so there needs to be some sort of statement here. I should mention also, I think there's another result in this paper, if I remember correctly, that if you start over a number field with an additional hypothesis, let's say 10 for Saladin hypothesis or something, that you get this all conjugate. This, uh, all the conjugates are on the unit circle in every absolute value. So, but to do this, this number is on the unique field. So, if you, like me, are starting over a number field, then you can draw a stronger field. Okay, so you can sort of generalize this question. So, in the question as stated, we had some particular curve in the affine plane. Curve in the affine plane, and a particular generalized hand on the map. But it's sort of natural to generalize this question by allowing the map to sort of vary as well. So more generally, let's let C be some algebraic curve, and let's let F be, sorry, it should not say in the, it should be defined over, so maybe it should be a splash for over. F is going to be a generalized henogene coefficient. I generalize how much these coefficients are in KSC's lift. Coefficients are functions on your curve. So you get a one-parameter family parameterized by your curve. And P is going to be a one-parameter family of points in A2 parameterized by your curve. And you can sort of generalize the previous question by asking if you define this pair FP to be the set of parameters at which the specialization of P is periodic to the specialization. Is periodic for the specialization of f, what can you say about this set? Is this a finite set in general? Well, of course, you can be some sort of assumption because p could just generically be a fixed point or f. It could be that this holds for every single t. But if something silly like that doesn't happen, you might ask, in that case, can we say that this set is finite? Presumably, there are some other cases that you need to worry about too. Cases that you need to worry about too, as it were in the previous results. Right, so you can ask this question with both the map and the point varying, instead of just the map being fixed in the point varying. In order to state one sort of very weak statement about this question, I'm going to mention at this point that we also define heights in function fields. In function fields. So, heights so far were defined over number fields. But it's not at all hard to define heights over function fields. So, here, k, to make things simpler, actually, it makes sense to think about function fields over algebraically closed fields. In which case, you can just think of replacing the height with the do. So, the height of a function on a purpose is going to be to be a function. And then you have to be a little bit careful in extending this to be algebraic closure in the function view. Very close for the function to do. But basically, just for every extension, you can take some model of that extension as a cover of C and then divide by the two different covers a way of extending the height to the algebraic. And so all of this stuff with these canonical heights and so on, you can write down these canonical heights as well over function fields. Many of the basic properties extend, but I want to point out one in particular that serves. But I want to point out one particular that certainly does not, which is this property of North Cot. So if k here, for instance, is the complex numbers, it's certainly not true over a function field with the complex numbers that there are only finitely rational functions of a given term. So that's what Northcott's theorem would say or would imply for, let's say, C of T. Northcott's theorem would meet the claim, among other things, that there. Claim, among other things, that there are only finite rational functions of a given degree, but obviously that's not true. It does turn out to be true over a finite field. But if you're interested in working over function fields of characteristic zeros, it's not generally going to be true. And I'll come back to that maybe. But just a warning that most of these things extend. And so in particular, as I mentioned, much basically in the footsteps of The footsteps of Kawaguchi, you can define a canonical height on the function field and sort of generic fiber of your family. And it turns out that you can show that if you have a family of generalized handle maps over a curve, and you have a family of points parametrized by that curve, then the canonical height on the fiber above T of the point specialized to T, so that's some function. So that's some function on your base curve, on the algebraic points on your base curve, and it turns out to be up to a bounded amount. It turns out this is a height function on your curve. The tilde over C here is just a reminder for me to say that I didn't make any assumptions on C. So I want C tilde to be like a smooth protective model. Just to avoid having heights on non-protected things. Having heights on non-projected things. And this divisor D here, its degree will be the canonical height on a generic variable. So if this number is positive, well then this is, I mean, on a curve, a divisor of positive degrees. So this height will be an ample height on the curve if this number is positive. And so at least the, so this set. So, this set pair FP is the set of algebraic values where this is zero. And so that would certainly bound this height function. And if this is a positive number, then this is an ample height. So you get a set of bounded height overfects in an animal divisor. And so you get at least financing over a number. If you're not finding it, it's over the optimal closure. Well, you get that at least this set, pair FP is a set of bounded height. If the kind of The canonical height on the generic fiber is positive. And so that prompts you to ask: when is the height on the generic fiber positive? So over a number field, this condition corresponded exactly to not being periodic. And so certainly, if p is periodic for f, it's easy to check that that number is zero because the converse relied on this term of North dot, which is not true in general over function. Over functionalities. And in fact, you can write down an example without too much difficulty of situations where you have infinite orbits where this canonical height is zero. Namely, so we're taking f and p to be defined orbits function fields, so the coefficients are coordinate for all functions, but we choose them to be constant functions. And if we choose the coefficients of f and the coordinates of p to be constant functions, then that will happen throughout the whole. Constant function, then that will happen throughout the whole orbit of P. And degree of a constant function will be zero. So heights of everything in all of your orbits will be zero. So you'll get canonical heights zero if you choose f and p to be defined over the constant subfield. But that of course doesn't mean that it can be just the fact that p has constant coordinates doesn't mean that periodic correct orbit. So you can certainly have non-periodic orbits of canonical height zero. Of canonical height zero on the generic fiber, if you allow things to be defined over the constant field, and then you can sort of make examples that don't look exactly like this by doing a change of variables over the function fields. Sort of masking the fact that everything's really defined over the function field by doing change of variables that makes it look like your family is very. And so that would be referred to as an isotrivial family. So an isotrivial family is one where you can do some change of variables, maybe not over the function field, but over the algebraic closure. out over the function field over the algebraic closure, which brings the pair fp to something defined over that constant. And in the isotrivial case, you always have this canonical height zero, and one might suspect that that's the only case in which you can get this for non-periodic purpose. And so I proved a result with a restriction here on the form of the MAC. So I needed my delta. Needed my delta parameter there to be minus one. I don't know at the time why I didn't choose one for a natural starting point. And I have the feeling that the argument would have worked if delta were one instead of non-stop. But anyway, this is the statement as it was proven. I certainly needed delta to be constant for the table. But the claim is that, in fact, if you take some example that is not isotrivial, sorry, here's Not isotrivial. I'm sorry, here there's some other confusion in that I'm using P both for my point and my polynomial. So we can try to disambiguate that and context will tell you which is which. Maybe that's why at this point in the slides I should show you the key thing that's the problem. So if you take some example that is not isotrivial, then it turns out that there are only finitely many q with canonical height zero on the generic With canonical height zero on the generic fiber. And so, in particular, positive canonical height on the generic fiber really does tell you that, sorry, the converse of that, non-periodicity really does tell you that the canonical height is strictly probability if you have a non-isotrivial example. All of this special form. And so I would have liked to have at least proven this for sort of an arbitrary delta, much more decisive. Delta. Much more recently, there's been significant strengthening of this result. Like Ma and Gabrielle, who I think maybe will be talking about this result later. So I'll pretend that's the reason that I'm not going to result. But at least this annoying assumption has been removed and also far more curious. And then I want to mention a couple other results. To mention a couple other results in the direction of this sort of unlikely intersections question with just sort of random results with the map varying as well. So here are two results in a paper of Yancheng Xia and Shu Kao Guqi about exactly this question. There are lots of other interesting results in this paper, but I'm just highlighting. Interesting results in this paper, but I'm just highlighting these two area on my intersections. So the first is sort of a negative result, and this corresponds to the reversibility phenomenon that I mentioned in the previous unlikely J sections we saw. So if you take basically a reversible, if you're in a case where F is reversible, and you take in your point P, again, I've got this. In your point P, again, I've got this annoying duplication of P, for which I apologize. If your family of points P generically lies on the fixed point of the evolution, the fixed point locus of the new evolution that does the reversing, then, in fact, again, this set of periodic specialization parameters is infinite over the algebraic enclosure. If you're If your map here is constant, then this is the remark that I made after the previous unlikely intersection result. But here, this is also true if you have a non-constant map by a very similar argument. So this is just sort of a warning that one ought not expect to always get finiteness, even outside of the silly case where p is generically periodic for f. And then there's an example of a family leak or a family. Of a family or a family of families for which you can prove this sort of finiteness result. In fact, here you get a much stronger result than finiteness, you get emptiness. So, for this quadratic family of generalized non-mass, if you look at the starting point 0B, so here the family is varying depending on c, and your starting point has constant coefficients, but that's fine. You just need something to be not. But that's fine. We just need something to be not a constant. If B is not an algebraic integer, so an algebraic number were not an algebraic integer, then this set of periodic specializations is infinite. So there's still a lot unknown here, but this is a particular example where you can get a highly effective sort of unlike game section. I just wanted to mention one other thing. I don't know if I have, there are a few slides here that I was thinking of skipping if I was low on time, but maybe I'll make a comment about this. You can sort of ask an arithmetic analog of this question. So, whenever you think about a one-parameter family of objects in algebraic geometry that are very Objects in algebraic geometry that are varying. If you have a single object over a number field, you can sort of think of it as a one-factor family that's varying. And the base that it's varying over is a spec of some ring of integers and some single group. And so if K is a number field and we take S to be some finite set of primes, I mean primes in the ring of integers of the number field, and let's let F be one of these generalized kind of maps that extends. One of these generalized kind of maps that extends over OKS. So this is the ring of S integers in the number field K. If you want, you can just think of actual integers in the number field Q. And to say that F extends over this in a sort of scheme theoretic sense, if K is Q, and if I'm really talking about honest integers here, I just mean that the coefficients are actual integers, they don't have denominators for S is. So more generally, S. More generally, s should just be some set of primes that contains all the denominators and all the proportions. And maybe if the polynomial capital P is not funny, maybe all the primes divided into numerator will. And then F will extend as an automorphism of A2, not just over K, but over the ring of integers, OK, S. So you can think of this as a family varying over what colour? Well, the curve spec OKS. Well, the curve spec Oks, so the spectrum, the prime ideal spectrum of the ring Oks. And then you can ask exactly the same question. So what are you specializing at? You're specializing at points, a spec OKS. Those are prime ideals in the movement integers. And you can ask the same question. So, for which specializations is my point P periodic for F and For F, and because you could read ahead and done this thing where you would be able to slide bit by bit, you find the sort of disappointing answer that this is a boring question because, I mean, if you reduce f and the point mod at prime, you're suddenly working over a finite field. And then you're asking, is the orbit of this point in this finite field under this match finite? And the answer is, well, it doesn't have anywhere to go other than this finite set of points. Other than this finite set of points. So, of course, it's periodic. And so, the answer here, at first, I thought the answer was always the same. The answer is not always the same because the generic point may or may not be in here. And that just depends on whether P originally was periodic or F originally. So there are actually two possible answers. Neither of them turns out to be interesting. But you might ask, okay, since this turns out to be not an interesting question, what if you sort of record not just Not just which primes p becomes periodic for f, but what the period is on that prime. And then there's sort of more to say, a little more interest in p. And so I wrote down this slide. I think I maybe won't make my observations about these sequences. But my original entry point into the whole world of dynamics was interested in Was interested in recurrent sequences, which is kind of a classical question in number theory. Linear recurrent recurrences, non-linear recurrences, and you can see obviously how if you're thinking about recurrent sequences, it doesn't take long for you to start thinking about recurrent sequences generated by rational functions. And you can sort of write down a recurrent sequence associated to a hang on map, which records The period of the reduction of p mod some prime or the reduction of f mod that prime. And the thing you have to write down is if it should be a lowercase n here, if you just look at the orbit of p under f and you compare the x coordinate of the end point to the x coordinate of the base point, and the same for the y coordinate. point and the same for the y coordinate you write down the greatest common division of these two things that will be the primes dividing that will be exactly the primes such that p has period dividing and mod p and this turns out to be a divisibility sequence so it fits into this sort of classical theory of divisibility sequences in number theory and unlike a lot of the divisibility sequences Of the divisibility sequences that come up in sort of arithmetic dynamics, it turns out in most of the attempts to sort of generalize these divisibility sequences to arithmetic dynamics, you have this phenomenon where most primes don't show up anywhere in the sequence. Whereas here, every prime has to divide some term in the sequence. And so somehow this sequence records here, my number here is Q, and I've just taken the good old fashioned integers to see it simple. But this sequence somehow records the period. Records the period of P for F, modulo every crime. So here you can see mod 2 this point has period 3, mod 3 has period 4, etc. And somehow the unlikely intersections questions in the case of curves in A2 should somehow be connected to properties of the sequence if you sort of think about this as an arithmetic equation. So, one of the questions you might ask. So, one of the questions you might ask is how quickly this sequence grows. There are other results, which I won't mention right now, but in number theory, sequences defined by TCDs like this, which indicate they should typically grow fairly slowly. This looks like it's maybe a slow-growing sequence. On the other hand, every prime has to divide some term. So, there are questions here you could ask about what sort of unlikely intersections phenomena would you expect to sort of show up in this. You know, like are there finitely many ones in that sequence? I don't know if there are finitely many ones in the sequence. And I think my suspicion is based on stuff that people like Silverman have done, that probably under some suitable Voyager conjecture type thing, they can show that the sequence grows very slowly. So there should be some sort of Defantine approximation of things saying this doesn't grow very quickly. But I haven't thought about this very much at all. About this, very much at all. The other observation I will make is that if you do an example here with reversible generalization and a point that's in the evolution locus, just as you might expect from what happens in the sort of unlikely detections world, this sequence suddenly goes extremely quickly. At least in the examples, I've done some sub-sequence, like every second term or something goes extremely quickly. So being in the fixed point locus of that involution fundamentally changes the behavior of the sequence that I'm sure in one direction has to show. One direction that's going to show, and then the other direction will be the hard, the hardest. So maybe one analog of sort of unlikely intersections plane would just be that this kind of scope in the okay. So I had a few more comments on the sequences, but I think I want to. This is just some facts about recurrent sequences like this and what you might expect. But in order to make sure But in order to make sure that I mentioned the things at the end that I want to mention, I'm going to skip to the next topic, which is the question of periodic points over U. So based on these results of, well, for these generalized handle maps, we just need this result of denying. We know that if you take one of these generalized handle maps defined over Q, they're going to really find it from many of the radical points defined over Q. But then, of course, the question is how many? And so I want to sort of put this in context. And so, I want to sort of put this in context. I already mentioned that this result of North Cross gives you finiteness of torsion on a beautiful ideas of a number field. And so there, of course, people ask, how uniform can you make that finiteness? And the answer there is we don't know. But in the case of elliptic curves, we do know. So if E is an elliptic curve over a number of E of K, then the number of Then the number of points of finite order of bounded degree over your number field turns out to be bound. I mean, for a fixed elliptic curve, there's going to be only finitely many points of bounded degree that have finite order. That was sort of an application in Luftwaffe's theorem or just a long-winded result. But it's a result of MASER. So, MASER, I guess, is the case where everything's happening over Q, generalized. Number q generalized to general number fields by Morel and to be one. Then, in fact, there's a uniform bound on the number of points of finite order, even as you vary the elliptic curve over extensions of a boundary degree. And so, okay, naturally, one might ask the same sort of conformity questions for the number of rational periodic points. And again, I want to. And again, I want to compare with the sort of arithmetic dynamics of morphisms. So here's a conjecture, a fairly specific conjecture from Human looking at quadratic polynomials. So if you look at quadratic polynomials over Q, that if you have a Q-rational periodic point, then it has period 1, 2 over Q. And from this, now I can. From this, now I can infer the exact value. So, one of the results in this paper, who means, is that if this is true, then the total number of preperiodic points over Q is at most eight. Basically, I can't remember if you count the point in, maybe it's not, but some small thing. So, of course, for quadratic volumes, it's more natural to think about preperiodic points because the two things are closely related. Similarly, a sort of obvious conjecture for any more. Conjecture for endomorphisms at the end, again, once you know that each one has only finitely many periodic points of bounded algebraic degree, you would naturally ask how uniform can you make that bound. You need some dependence on the degree of amorphism to avoid easy counterexamples, but you might expect that if you specify the degrees of everything involved, then you found the number of pre-graduate points. This is still open. If true, this implies that you have flown by. This implies the uniform boundedness of torsion on helium varieties. Maybe I'll also mention a result of Akrudin, that this conjecture of Morton and Silverman, if you can prove it just for k equals q and d equals 1, then it's true as stated. So you really just need to prove this over q. And again, this is sort of like the argument I made with Miles Guard's theorem, some sort of synchronization to give you algebra. The U algebra. That's not the case here because in order to use that symmetrizization, you'd have to know to deduce Morel's theorem for something over Q, you'd have to know the state for all of you values. Okay, so of course, one might ask the same question or an analogous question. Oh, sorry, first I wanted to give some examples. Forget the order of my slides. So just to give some examples of generalized example maps that are defined over queue and have periodic points over queue, you can write down some, in some cases, fairly simple examples. Here, the dynamics goes to clockwise. I think it goes clockwise in dynamics. Is that good? You just have to plug in some point to figure it out, but it goes clockwise. I couldn't get ticks to put the arrows on stuff. Here's another example of a generalized animal map. Again, the same form but a different parameter. And here you have a bunch of periodic points. You may notice that all of the periodic points have the same, the formats all have the same denominator. And the parameter has denominator, the square of those denominators. And that's not at all a coincidence. It's an easy exercise to show that that must be the case. Here's another example. This is a little This is a little confusing to parse visually, but you have an eight cycle here of rational points, and then in the middle in red, you have a two cycle, and then off in the corners, you have these two fixed points. I didn't draw a little loop. Again, I didn't want to spend a lot of time wrestling with things. So here we have, I guess, 12 rational QRI points. And so, well, one thing you might do. One thing you might do, one conjecture you might make in sort of analogy to these other conjectures is that if you take one of these generalized hand on maps, that there should be some uniform bound on the number of periodic points of bounded outgrade P in terms of the degree of everything. And you really do need to bound the degree of P otherwise you could do some simple, some simple thing. Some simple, some simple. I think if you take a polynomial p with a huge number of rational roots, and maybe take delta equals minus one, and just taking points as coordinates are those rational roots, you need a lot of fixed points. So you need some sort of dependence. I don't expect to have a dependence on the drag of the dependence on the drag of the data. I'm suspecting that no, we don't have a dependence on the value of digital data. Some of the conjectures, this isn't even the strongest conjecture, but some of the conjectures may turn out to be false. There's a question of what you call that conjecture. Is it supposed to motivate your thought, or is it something you really are claiming? This is maybe a conjecture that I would bet more money on. So, the previous conjecture, if you find a counterexample, you get a bottle of wine. A counterexample, you get a bottle of wine, maybe. This one, if you find a counterexample, maybe a case of wine because I thought about this more. So I did a slightly more careful study of this particular family in this paper 10 years ago. And the claim is for this particular family, this is sort of in analogy to this conjecture of Hunin. The conjecture is that you have no points of period, no rational points of period. Rational control of fee about period other than one, two, three, four, six, and eight. I have a slightly embarrassing confession about three, which I'll mention in a previous slide. So if you recall the examples I gave, I gave examples of all periods except three in those pictures. I'll also mention that one of the reasons I am a little more willing to call this a capital C conjecture is that I've done at least some computation that indicates that this is true. Indicates that this is true. I'm going to say just a quick word about this computation. So, a priori, for any fixed rational C, the set of Q rational periodic points has a set of bounded heights. So you could write down this height bound, which is not too hard, and then you could list all the points up to that height. So now you have some finite set of points in the plane, and then you could just start the array. And if you ever leave that set, then your point is not a periodic point. And then eventually you just get, you find out which points are periodic points. You just get you find out which points are figured out and which points are not. So, for any particular value of c, this is a finite computation. That's not a very hard computation, but it's also not a very fast computation. And so, doing this computation for this many values of c, this is in the neighborhood of a million values of the parameter. I certainly couldn't make the height approach work for this. And so I used a different approach for this computation, which uses an idea of PESDA. uses an idea of Potesda, which is, so if you have a periodic point mod Q, you can reduce mod some prime. You have to worry about making sure that prime doesn't divide at the denominator or anything. You can take a periodic point over Q and reduce mod P. Of course you get a periodic point because everything is periodic mod P. But you get a point in a period dividing a period over P. And if it were the same period, then you could just compute all the periodic points on P. Big disk from all the periodic points mod P and say, well, all my periods over Q must be within those periods mod P. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen. So you could have a periodic cycle over Q where when you reduce mod 17 or something, let's say a sixth cycle becomes a three cycle. So things can collapse. It could be that two things in the sixth cycle are probably 1017. And so things collapse. But there's this very nice result of PESDA, which tells you how much collapsing you can have. It basically allows you to. Collapsing you can have. It basically allows you to sort of reverse engineer the collapsing. And so, in most situations, you can sort of look, let's say, mod 17, and you get whatever, there are whatever periods they are for the matter, mod 17. And then, a priori, there might be periodic points of periods divisible by those numbers over Q. But using these results, you can construct some finite list of possible periods for ones over Q based on the possible periods modeled. Variants mod a given. And so if you do this, let's say mod 17, you get for a particular parameter C, you get some huge list of possible periods that contain all the possible periods that Q rational points could have. And then if you do this for a particular value of C for a few different primes and intersect those lists, the actual periods of points over Q must be in the intersection of this list. And after intersecting these lists for a few different primes, Intersecting these lists for a few different primes, you pair down to some subset of this list. And that's essentially how this computation is done. And one of the advantages of doing this is, in fact, you're then checking the conjecture, not just for that parameter C, but for everything that's sort of congruent to C modulo of those same time. So you can get big swaths of this range checked in a single computation. Now, for the family that I wrote down here, this is one of these reversible families. And I claim that, well, it is, I think, true, that a lot of the points that are showing up are sort of, they're more rational points than you should probably expect generically because of this reversibility. So, somehow, this reversibility puts an extra constraint on the Galois orbits of the periodic points of the operating closure that forces more of them to less. Closure that forces more of them to be rational. And so if you take some quadratic, one of these quadratic generalized kind of maps of some delta other than one or minus one or whatever, you should expect for sort of a general delta type far fewer of these reality rates. So just as an example of the sort of thing I mean, points of period three for this family, and just iterate this thing three times to write down what needs to happen at a point of period three a there. Points of period three are parametrized by this. Of period three are parametrized by this surface, but for fixed delta, it's a curve. And so, for fixed delta, you have some curve parametrizing the rational points on this curve will parametrize the examples of a map with a rational free periodic point. And you can just see here that delta equals minus one collapses a lot of terms in this case. So the fiber delta. So, the fiber delta equals minus one, which is the fiber I was looking at, has a lot of generously, it turns out to be a rational curve. But if you just take a sort of generic delta, by which I mean delta outside of some particular finite set, then this will be a curve for genes 4. And by Falting's theorem, we'll have only finitely rational points on it. So, it certainly follows from Falting's theorem that if you take one of all but finitely many delta over Q, there will be only finitely density such as you have a rational. Only finite thing is C such a rational thing. The slightly embarrassing thing I wanted to mention is that I don't know now if I ever actually wrote down an example of one of these maps with delta equals minus one and a q rational point in period three. And the fact that this curve is rational when delta equals minus one does not tell you that it's rational at point. It's geometrically rational. So if it has one rational point, it has many rational points. But it could also have many rational Many rational events, but it could also have no rational difference. And I never check this, so at some point I have to sit down and check. This might turn out to be a rational curve with no rational curve on it, in which case I can take the three out of the list in that conjecture and make it slightly shorter. So that's one slightly embarrassing fact that I never actually checked at. So for example, x squared plus y squared equals one is a rational for many rational points. x squared plus y squared equals seven is also a rational for no rational points. And so it's just the fact that. Points. And so just the fact that it's geometrically rational doesn't mean rational points. And maybe I assume that way. So that's something to be resolved. Either way, the answer to that question shouldn't be just a matter of actually doing the computation. So here's this wild guess I said I was going to make an even stronger conjecture. I'm willing to guess for this quadratic family that is in tape, all but finitely many. take all but finitely many delta and you look at the family pair C comma delta in fact except for finitely many values of delta I'm going to guess although this is one where you get the class of one finite example well it has to be infinitely many because it's all the finite link but I claim that in fact maybe in general you should expect the only rational predict points to be fixed points and points of period two and even Fixed points and points of period two. And you can't cut that list down any farther because you can parametrize examples that show you that for every delta, every rational delta, there are infinitely many rational c's so that you really do have rational fixed points. And infinitely many rational c's so that you really do have rational points appearing two. And then there are infinitely many rational delta for which there exist rational c which are the same. And so you get both simultaneously fixed points n. Both simultaneously fixed points and period two points rationally. So the fixed points and period two points really do show up a lot. But I claim that maybe for this family, if you avoid, for example, the reversible ones, you should really pair that list. It went up to almost, well, it went up to eight, way down to a list that went to one and two. So in the last couple minutes here, I want to Minutes here, I want to make a couple observations, present maybe a couple of heuristics that might suggest why you should possibly believe this sort of new point values from you. So for this one particular family, I mean, I've done some computation where it really starts to look like that's true. Of course, you have to ask yourself how far do you have to compute before you believe that it's not just the small numbers can often really see. Really seeing some sort of informal. So, I want to mention a couple of adjacent results and then consequences of these that I noticed while wearing this talk. So, first of all, if you look at this family, again, this is with delta equals minus one. But if you take some finite, now, so all of, both of these statements are true of. So both of these statements are true over number fields, but I'm just full at this point. I'm just going to work over Q. If you take some finite set of primes S and you look at these generalized canon maps, where P is a monic polynomial with rational coefficients, but more than just rational coefficients, I only allow the denominators to contain primes from my set S. Right? So of course, for a particular example, you could reverse this and say, let S be the set. Could reverse this and say, let s be the set of all primes of I. And it turns out that the number of periodic points you can prove is bounded by some constant to the number of primes. And I mean, maybe I should put it plus one to something here. S is the empty subject. But there should be the set of all primes plus one other prime for the RB influx of something, and then we don't get to make this zero. So there's some value. So there's some bound even at least your integer. So this is, I mean, this is a type of uniformity. It's not actually uniform because it depends to some extent on the map, but it doesn't depend on knowing the coefficients depend on the smaller the number of primes that I have from the map. And the proof of this is, I mean, the basic idea is that if you have two rational points that are extremely close together, they can't both have whatever. Extremely close together, they can't both have very small height. If you have two rational numbers that are very close together, they can't both have a very small denominator. One of them has that big denominator, they're too close together. And so, you can sort of, if you have a set of rational points that's large enough, you can sort of use a pigeonhole argument to show that some of them must have large height. And if you do this pigeonhole, not just in the usual absolute value, but in the p-adic absolute values for LEPs in here, you can show that if you have too many points, some of them need to not figure out. Points, some of them did not figure out if they're too close together to have small height. As a sort of again, a comparator from single variable dynamics, for a polynomial in one variable, it's a result of Benedetto, that the number of preperiodic points over Q, the number field, is bounded by something of size S log S, where it's the same, the same S, basically. So a much smaller bound, but still depending on the same data. Okay, so that's. Data. Okay, so this is one reason that sort of points in the direction of some sort of uniformity of the bound. A consequence of this, I noticed as I was writing up these talks, this talk, is that this bound is already enough to show a sort of uniform boundedness on average in some cases. And so this is less of a theorem, more of a remark. I just only used one environment to be in there. Use one environment to be in there, I guess. And I'm saying after Aleknovich here, Matt Aleknovich is a graduate student of mine who's been working on similar questions for rational functions in one variable. So this is sort of employing the ideas he mentioned to me, but not a specific case that he worked out. But it turns out this case is not too hard to show. That if you think about the expected number of periodic points, or a map of this one over Q, the expected number of periodic points is zero. Expected number of periodic points is zero. And so, what do I mean by expected value? Well, I mean, for each C up to some height, calculate the number of Q rational periodic points for that parameter value, and then add them up and find out the total number of parameters up to that height, and that will go to zero as x goes to 3. So, at least the average number of periodic points for a map of this one over q is. Is finite. This is, of course, very far from saying that there is a uniform bound, but it gives you sort of the idea that these two rational periodic points should be near. Yeah? Yes. Yes. Possibly on the next slide. So I was going to sort of skip over the proof. The idea of the proof is: so I mentioned for this particular family, you need your Well, so all the periodic points will have the same denominator for their coefficients, their coordinates, and the denominator c will be the square of that. And so, if the denominator c is not a square as an integer, and you have no periodic points at all, so already on a fairly thin set, sorry, off of a fairly thin set, you have no periodic points at all. So, all the periodic points happen for a sort of small, a thin set of these parameters. Set of these parameters and then using this exponential bound. I won't go through the details here because I don't want to go over time. But then for the remaining parameters, we had a bound on the number of periodic points based on the number of primes dividing the denominator. And if you do a little bit of analytic number theory using the prime number theorem, you get some upper bound on the total number of periodic points for A and B in some bar. For A and B in some box, just using the fact that this number is zero, except on some thin set, and on that thin set, you have some sort of estimate for what it is. And it turns out that for the parameters in some box, the total number of periodic points should grow. So here I've changed things so this is no longer the log of these, but just the actual absolute value. The number of periodic points should grow like this bound. Grow like this bound to the three halves, but the number of pairs AB in that box grows like the square of the size of the box. And so when you divide, I mean, this grows more quickly than this. So this divided by this goes like y is a negative one half. Well, there's an x half here. And so if you convert back to the logarithmic height, there's a sort of logarithmic genital gets a sort of estimate on the average term. So, one final argument I want to make, one final heuristic I want to prove, I will skip over that proof, that stinks, is another sort of very, very light push in the direction of uniform boundedness that you might make, which is to consider the question of twists. So, in general, a twist of an object defined over a number field, now a very vague definition, is some other Is some other object which is isomorphic to that object over the algebraic closure, but not isomorphic. Well, sorry, isomorphic over the algebraic closure, but still defined with the same number fuel. And if it turns out to be isomorphic over that number cube, we'll call it the trivial phase. So it's some other element of the k-bar isomorphism class of the object you started with that might be in a different k-isomorphism class. So, for example, for elliptic curves, all of these elliptic curves are twists. These elliptic curves are twists of this elliptic curve that t equals one. And you can realize the isomorphism here over a given field when you change the square. And so one starting place for these sort of uniform boundedness questions, or one I should say, easy case, is often the case of twists. And so there's a result here of Silverman. Here of Silverman. So, uniform boundance of torsion for Belian varieties is still an open question, but I can prove it for twists of a fixed forbelian variety. And in the case of dynamics on PN, Alan Levy, Michelle Mines, and Gianni-Thompson proved the same sort of uniform boundedness of pre-PRI points for twists of a unique morphism and the morphism of PM. And for these generalized Henna maps, of course, you could, whoops, that was two slides. Oops, that is two slides. You could make the same definition, right? You could say that g is a twist of f if f and g are both defined with a number of field k, but they're in the same kind of class over k bar. And here's an example of a family of non-trivial twists on these generalized handle maps. So once you know how to do it, it's not hard to write them down. This is conjugate to F1 if and only if t is a square in this loop. only if t is a square in this local. And so it turns out, again, I should not really call this a theorem so much as like an observation. For one of these all these headlines maps, it's true at least a uniform boundedness of pre-periodic point, periodic points, is satisfied for twists of F over K. And so I'll just mention very quickly the idea of the proof without going through the details of the proof. For this particular Particular family, any of these two twists to make them isomorphic, you just have to go up to some degree two extension. And so the k-rational points for two of these things might be different, but there's some quadratic extension you could make where the periodic points are the same. And by Yorkbat's theorem, F1 here only has finitely many periodic points over all quadratic extensions. And the periodic points of the twists just correspond to some subset of these periodic points. To some subset of these periodic forms over all the radio twists. So, for this particular family, this is easy to prove. You just need to show that there's a uniform bound on how big an extension you need to make to trivialize the twist. And so that's the key thing to prove, that you just need to go up to some bounded extension to sort of witness the triviality of the twist over logic break closure. And so, in the case of morphisms, I will skip through. The case of morphisms, I will skip through this very quickly. This result I mentioned of Levy, Minas, and Thompson, also the result of Silman, basically does a little bit of sort of very basic Galois homology to show that it suffices to know that the automorphism group of F is finite. So you construct a cross-homomorphism from the Galois group of some extension over which this relation is trivialized, and you map. Situation trivialized, and you map that somehow to the automorphism group of f. And if you know that the automorphism group of f is finite, then that tells you that gives you some bound basically on the size of this double group. It's a bound on the mean of the extension unit to go to triple out and put a st. And that's the whole argument. You can play this same game with these generalized hangon maps and very quickly reduce the problem to showing that the automorphism of f is finite. This is the centralizer. This is the centralizer of f in baud of A2. So all you have to do by mirroring the same proof is to show that the centralizer of f in baud of A2 is finite, but it's not finite, because for example, F is in the centralizer of F, and F is infinite order. So you quickly reduce the proof to showing the finiteness of this thing, but it turns out to be infinite. But it turns out all is not lost. All is not lost until there's a nice sort of description of, in this paper, it's referred to as a centralizer of f, or I'm talking about the automorphism group of f. You can write down some characterization of the automorphism group of f and with a little bit more work you can show essentially because whatever generates this part, some error of it is fixed by this colour group. And that's enough to show that the image of this cross homomorphism lands not just in the automorphism, but Lands not just in the automorphism group of F, but in the finite part of the automorphism group of F. And then now you have a bound on the size of the extension you need to go into realizing each risk, and you get this uniform back. So that is another maybe soup sum of evidence for why you might want to believe this uniform map in this, at least if you take the family of twists of a generalized synonym map, which often is just Which often is just a trivial family, but in some cases it's non-trivial in that family, can still get this uniform boundedness at least over this family of choices. And so that's a result in that direction.
