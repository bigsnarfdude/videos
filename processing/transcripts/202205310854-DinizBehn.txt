Looking forward to it. Okay, we're here. Okay, so I'm going to talk about, I talked about beta cells, beta cells are important for diabetes, but now I'm going to get to the meat of the matter and talk about diabetes itself. And this is work that was done with my former postdoc now colleague at Howard University Junior. University, June House. Okay, so let me recap what I said yesterday. I discussed the importance of dynamical features for modeling beta cells, and those included fast positive feedback and slow negative feedback, which were key for producing the characteristic bursting oscillations that beta cells do. But for today's talk, the more important thing is that it produces biostability. The system can be in two very different states. Can be in two very different states. Think here, health and disease, at the same set of parameters. So these concepts will show up in a model for the progression to type 2 diabetes. Beta cells are again central, but now with regard to the long-term success or failure of adaptation to insulin resistance, as opposed to yesterday we were talking about how they respond to a meal. How they respond to a meal. The focus question is: what are the relative contributions of insulin resistance versus beta cell failure? And spoiler is, it depends, and therefore our therapy should also depend, but we don't have good clinical tools for determining which group a person falls into or could be somewhere in between. So we measure the response. Response or metabolic status, you can do it with an oral glucose tolerance test. This is data provided to me by Kristen Ledo, Christine Chan, and Melanie Creegreen at University of Colorado. And this is done with adolescents who have cystic fibrosis, who are prone to diabetes because of the inflammation associated with cystic fibrosis. But the principles apply to many other categories. To many other categories of people. This is just convenient for the point that I want to make. So they have divided the group of people into three. Black is normal glucose tolerance. Notice the glucose doesn't go very high. I guess I should say what an OGTT is. You drink 75 grams of glucose in a drink. It's disgusting, but not fatal. It makes your glucose go up, your beta cells secrete insulin, and your glucose come down. So, how fast? Fast the glucose comes down and how close to baseline it gets at the end of two hours is a measure of how well you're secreting insulin and how well the insulin is working at promoting glucose uptake into muscle and suppressing hepatic glucose production. So these are the normal people. Those in blue are the ones with pre-diabetes. Their glucose goes higher, doesn't come down as low. And the ones in green are the ones who already have diabetes. Are the ones who already have diabetes. So, more precisely, we have clinically defined thresholds for pre-diabetes defined for both fasting and two-hour glucose. So, the black curve is below both. The blue curve is above the threshold for two hours. And the green ray above. And then we have similar thresholds for diabetes. So, we have a higher level for fasting. Level for fasting glucose, and that's time zero, you mathematicians. And then we have another threshold for diabetes at two hours. And so the green is above, the blue is not above, so this group is pre-diabetes, but not diabetes. Okay, so what happens over a long period of time? That was two hours out of a person's life. This is data collected over a decade by the group headed by Bobo Gardas. The group headed by Bobo Gardas of NIDDK in the Phoenix branch, which studies the Pima Indians who have extraordinarily high rates of type 2 diabetes. Half the population has diabetes by middle age. So this points here represent the means of 55 people. Not every person is every point, but every point is many people. Followed over this long period of time and looking at their two-hour glucose after having repeated. After having repeated glucose tolerance tests over the years. And you can see that the glucose stays low for a long time, but it's very subtly ramping up, and then suddenly it shoots up. So this is suggestive of a threshold behavior to a mathematician. And it's clinically important because progression is almost irreversible once the diabetes threshold is crossed. Well, it can be reversed in many cases. Can be reversed in many cases, but by extreme measures like bariatric surgery. And mathematically, what that means is that it's not enough to control a person's glucose levels, which is the main goal of therapy. We have to push them back below the threshold and hold them there forever. And bariatric surgery can do that. It would be nice to have a pill that could do that. We don't have that yet. But we may be getting somewhat close. So here's a simulation with the model that I'm going to describe showing that it can more or less Showing that he can more or less do this kind of thing. So we simulated a virtual person over a period of six years, and we're following their fasting glucose and their two-hour glucose. And you can see that these are the thresholds for pre-diabetes and diabetes. The two-hour glucose crosses the threshold for pre-diabetes called impaired glucose tolerance. So from this point on, they're pre-diabetic. And then later, the fastest. And then later, the fasting glucose crosses its threshold, but two hours already well above. And then finally, the glucose crosses its threshold for two hours. Can I ask a question? Yeah. Is the fasting good cause because even the prior is it ever really different? Could that happen that the they just like Well, people vary according to their setting points, and that's somewhat of a problem because we have fixed diagnostic thresholds for everyone. And some people have proposed that we should look at instead is whether it's rising. It might be low compared to the normal standard, but if it's rising, that's probably a danger sign. Yeah, that's what I was wondering. Yeah, that's what I was wondering. If it's more about where you start basically to where you end or if it's because you're not. Well, I think they both matter. Because isn't it also if you have during pregnancy, often your fasting causes? Well, that's a whole other story. The physiology of pregnancy causes insulin resistance, and if you don't have strong beta cells, you may transiently have diabetes or pre-diabetes during the pregnancy. Diabetes or pre-diabetes during the pregnancy, but if most people will recover back to normal glucose tolerance at the end of the pregnancy. However, it's a warning sign that if you don't take the weight off after pregnancy and you have insulin resistance, that you're at risk for type 2 diabetes later in life. So, one small point that I wanted to make, a tiny thing that we've learned from the model, is that if you looked at Learned from the model is that if you looked at this kind of person, you would see that if you only measured fasting glucose, which is what's most typically done in the U.S., then you would have a delay of years in picking up the transition to pre-diabetes and to diabetes. But it's cheap and easy, so that's why insurance companies are willing to pay for it. But there are other people also who actually go high in fasting glucose first, and the model can do that as well. That has to do with the That as well. That has to do with whether the insulin resistance is at the liver or the muscle. But I don't want to diverge too much into that. Okay, so how do we make a model that can do all this stuff? And this is based on ideas that were developed by Brian Topp and his colleagues in 2000. We've extended that somewhat. But normally, insulin secretion keeps glucose variation in check. You're five minutes from one to the other one. Okay. That's fast, negative feed. That's fast negative feedback. Obesity causes insulin resistance. Beta cells try to compensate. That's slow negative feedback. And that can be because you grow more beta cells, increase beta cell mass, or each beta cell secretes more insulin. That's increased beta cell function. If the resistance is mild or develops slowly, compensation is more likely to be successful. If the resistance is severe or develops rapidly, compensation is more likely to be successful. Rapidly, compensation is more likely to fail. And then, what happens is that the slow negative feedback flips over into positive feedback, or homeostasis becomes anti-homeostasis. And once this threshold is crossed, it's very hard to get back. So that's a public service message to treat pre-diabetes and not wait till you get diabetes. Okay, so let me, I don't know how far I can get through this. I don't know how far I can get through this, but I wanted to say something about this because it's going to come up in the other talks, and it refers back to Will's talk, surprisingly. This is the Bergman-Cobelli minimal model, which is kind of the grandfather or grandmother of all existing models today. You have a mass balance equation for glucose, but insulin is not here. Instead, what you have is insulin appears in, this is sort of plasma insulin. This is sort of plasma insulin, and this is thought of as delayed insulin or interstitial insulin. It has to go into the interstitial space to get to the muscles, and then it can act to remove glucose. So they measure that, and then from this they calculate these parameters, and they get a parameter called SI, which is insulin sensitivity. We have adapted this for longitudinal simulations by ignoring the delay, assuming that insulin is acting instantly. Insulin is acting instantaneously on glucose. We also, the SI appears in the glucose equation. Then we have to, we're not measuring insulin, we're simulating, so we need an equation for insulin secretion and insulin uptake or clearance. So that depends on the mass, the function sigma, and another piece of function called gamma. And the disposition index is very important. It was measured empirically. It was measured empirically by Berlin and Kobelli looking at SI versus basal insulin, which is a marker of insulin resistance. And some people use that as their whole story. Okay, and then it gets worse as you go through time. This shows that it differs by ethnic groups. This is insulin sensitivity. This is insulin secretion measured a different way. We have East Asians, Caucasians, and people of African descent, probably mostly African. People of African descent, probably mostly African Americans. And people start at the lower right and they move up to the left. And then these are adults, so they're sort of moved different distances. You move up as you compensate, as you become less sensitive, you secrete more, and then you, at some point, you may fall off the curve, and that's when you become diabetic. So people differ in this regard. So I'm going to just use a model quickly to simulate. I'm going to just use a model quickly to simulate how insulin resistance versus beta cell functions show up in oral glucose tolerance tests. Among obese insulin-resistant people, one-hour glucose, which is usually not measured, and two-hour glucose more or less correlate. But among lean insulin-deficient people, including the cystic fibrosis adolescence that I showed earlier, one-hour glucose rises much earlier. And we model this as impaired priming of insulin granules. So here we have two cases. So here we have two cases: severe insulin resistance with strong secretion, mild insulin resistance with weak secretion, and these are the paths of two-hour versus one-hour glucose over time. So the severe insulin resistance group is up here, the mild insulin resistance but impaired secretion group is down here, and the main thing that happens is that you cross the threshold for one hour glucose to be pre-diabetic before two hours. Pre-diabetic before two-hour happens. So this is for people in this group, we should track one-hour glucose. So, in fact, if you take the data that our colleagues provide us and divide the people with normal glucose tolerance into high one-hour and low one-hour, you see that the group in red here would look normal based on either two-hour or fasting glucose, but they are already abnormal, as bad as the blue group. As the blue group in terms of one-hour glucose. And so high one-hour glucose picks up people that are missed by two-hour. They already have impaired insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion according to our model. Okay, so this also is true of ethnic groups, severe insulin resistance, Cuba Indians, African Americans, less so, Caucasians, and then East Asians and people with cystic fibrosis. People with cystic fibrosis, also people who are on the way to type 1 diabetes but don't yet have. And so here's the summary. I'll just put this up in case anyone wants to ask any questions. I can roll it, maybe. So, Artie, I want to say that I did understand it. I've come to let you know that I understood what you were saying and I understood what you were saying and I think that it's really interesting and I guess my question is, particularly in your slide for the slow, the less insulin resistant versus more insulin resistant people, we are right now trying to justify to the Recover Consortium for post-COVID diabetes, incident diabetes detection, that they need to let us do a true They need to let us do a true oral glucose tolerance test. And they wanted to sort of take away the 30-minute and one-hour time points. They thought that's really, and I told them we're not trying to diagnose diabetes, we're trying to understand what COVID is doing to progression of diabetes. So I think you've armed me for the discussion I have to have tomorrow. So I want to thank you for that. Okay. Happy to help. And that's the model we want to use for that work, Jake. For that word, Jay. Right, right. And this is also to expand to recovery. Excellent. Yep, because you go back the other way, we hope we do. Thank you, Jane. Okay, great. And hopefully what I'm talking about is going to dovetail with all of that. I think I already set up what I want to say really nicely, but I'm really focusing more on what some of the challenges are that come up when we're trying to model. Are that come up when we're trying to model glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test, and then also when we're trying to talk about it with clinical collaborators and others. So we know we've just seen some details about the oral glucose tolerance test. I'm thinking about it in the case where it's frequently sampled, so we have a pretty good sense of how things are changing over time. This is just a quick image from the RICE Consortium. From the RISE Consortium showing some of the differences between adults and adolescents, where you can see here that the rise in glucose that we expect to see with the oral glucose tolerance is similar here between the adults and teens, but we have this much larger insulin response as a result of the increased insulin resistance that we expect to see in adolescents. So we want to think about modeling this. And I think I heard that there are other people who are talking about the difficulty of this word model. The difficulty of this word model, right? When we're talking about it in these interdisciplinary contexts. And so, when I'm talking about models, I'm not talking about the beautiful people and I'm not talking about the animals that we use as animal models. But there's still a lot of confusion in what we mean by models, right? So a lot of times in talking with my clinical colleagues, a lot of these kinds of diagnostics that Artie was just talking about, one-hour glucose, two-hour glucose, these things are thought of as models. These things are thought of as models. There also are things like the Matsuda Index or HOMA IR that are built on those things. So basically sort of equations that involve basal glucose or amine glucose and insulin levels. And those things are also thought of as models. And then we also have differential equations kinds of models like the oral minimal model here that we talked about before. That we talked about before. So, a few things to say about measures as models. So, we really think that the dynamics of glucose and insulin interaction really reflect a lot of features of the underlying metabolism. So yes, the data are very sparse compared to all of the different physiology that's going into this, but if we really think about the time dynamics, there's a lot of richness there in how quickly things are going up and down. In how quickly things are going up and down, how quickly they're responding, at what levels they're responding, all of those kinds of things. And this is just a sort of similar trajectory to what Artie was showing, where we have people with normal glucose tolerance and periglucose tolerance and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. And we see that there are these different time points where we can kind of take a snapshot and see that. Snapshot and see that there could be some differences between these different populations, but what is the most important snapshot to take? I mean, one hour is kind of convenient and it rolls off the tongue, but what if it was better to look at 75 minutes? What if that was better at discriminating between groups? Or because we are thinking about inter-individual differences, whenever we sort of reduce everything down to just one slice in time, we're going to lose. Just one slice in time, we're going to lose information that we have about the overall systems. Another thing that we can think about: so, when we looked at those adolescent curves, we saw that there were these differences in insulin secretion. So, we think, okay, so we could detect that by picking one point in time, but we could also look at the area under the curve of something like this. So, if we think about the area under the curve, we can get into trouble. We can get into trouble because we may have reactive hypoglycemia that happens. So, a lot of times, if you have a robust insulin response, and this can be exacerbated if there's some insulin resistance, and so that initial response is delayed, then you could have glucose that shoots up and then shoots down really low. So, you have this kind of glucose crash that's coming on afterwards. And if you're thinking about the area under the curve, right, it Under the curve, right, again, that sort of rolls off the tongue. But which area under the curve are we talking about? Where are we going to cut it off? And so, you know, typically it would be the area under the curve for the first two hours or the area under the curve for the first three hours. And for some people, that's going to pick up this negative contribution. And how do you treat that? Because you don't really want to treat it as something that's subtracting off and bringing the overall glucose level down, especially because. Overall glucose level down, especially because this person may have shot up really high in their initial response. But it also becomes very difficult then to think about at what point you want to cross this off because you couldn't do it at an individual level because then you're not consistently measuring the same sort of thing in terms of the response. So there are a lot of difficulties that come in when you're only thinking about one of these kinds of general measures. So one of the advantages of thinking about So, one of the advantages of thinking about the differential equations type approach is that theoretically, then we're taking into account the whole curve, right? We're capturing some features of the entire curve when we do this. And so this is the model for the oral minimal model for glucose that I presented or that I mentioned briefly yesterday, where we're thinking about this glucose with the insulin-independent and insulin-dependent uptake, and then with Uptake and then with this contribution that's coming from the glucose that the person ingested. So we're and then we're representing this insulin action that's again being forced by the insulin data. And so this is thinking about this as sort of some balance representing the glucose and often does a good job of representing that glucose, but again, when we talk about That glucose, but again, when we talk about this as a model, we need to think about how we're representing each piece of it. And one of the things that's really challenging when we're thinking about this oral glucose tolerance test is that we don't know exactly what's happening with that glucose coming into the blood. The glucose that the person drank, there's some time delay that's happening as a result of the absorption from the gut. And this can vary from person to person. There's the general, so and then you have the dynamics of that release, so that we see eventually that's getting absorbed, that's getting released into the blood. But then as that exogenous glucose comes on board, the glucose from the liver needs to be suppressed, right? And then there are different dynamics that happen associated with that as well. And all of that interaction is getting sort of mushed into this term, right? Into this term, right? Because it's something that we're not able to pull apart. And so the way that we represent that and think about that in a model is something that's really important and something that is important for communication with people as well. So there was a nice paper when this was originally described where they looked at a lot of different functional ways of representing RA meal, thinking about splines and other things. And other things, and found that really it didn't matter that much as long as you could basically do as well as you wanted with a piecewise approximation, piecewise linear. You thought the components for your two. Okay. So piecewise linear approximation. And with that piecewise linear approximation, again, okay, that seems good, but then where are you going to take those time points? That could be something as free. That could be something as frequently sampled as you have data for, or that could be something that you again approximate in some kind of way, and you need to think about that as you're trying to represent these things. And then, as already mentioned, when you estimate the parameters of this model, you can get this representation of insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity. And this is again a key measure that people want to look at that theoretically is taking into account more features of the dynamics than just one of these individual time points. But one thing that we found was that it really mattered over what duration you thought about looking at your data. And this was again particularly true for our population because we were working with a population of obese adolescent girls that were very insulin resistant. Were very insulin resistant. But here, because their glucose was staying high for a long time, it was important to think about the time course of them coming back to baseline and looking at these sampling schedules. So we actually did a six-hour OGTT, but then we could also truncate that and think about what kinds of estimates of insulin sensitivity do we get if we think about shorter durations. So say two hour, three hour, or four hour glucose. Four-hour glucose. And one trick that people have used if they're, say, only measuring, only have data for two hours, but they see that they're not back down to baseline, is to assume an exponential decay. And so with this exponential decay here, you can fix this parameter t, or you can estimate the parameter t for an individual and say, okay, so now I'm going to have my piecewise linear approximation of RA over some period of time. Over some period of time, and then have this delay. And so this shows you some estimates of RA over different protocol durations. And you can see here in blue is the two-hour exponential. And so after two hours, it just assumes this exponential decay. Down. And here's a three-hour exponential with an exponential decay. Now, this is pretty jagged, right? It doesn't necessarily feel Right, it doesn't necessarily feel very physiological. So, we could change this by changing the sampling points that we're breaking up our casewise function. But this is going to give us a very nice representation of the glucose curve that we got out because this happens to be kind of a bumpy glucose curve. But you can see again that our simulation of glucose over the period where we're fitting to the data, we're doing a really good job with all of the different models. Good job with all of the different models, but then as soon as we stop fending to the data, so for the two-hour after two hours, and we assume that exponential decay, we're really not capturing the data well at all anymore. So that kind of assumption is not necessarily good. And we looked at this both with the recommended fixed time constants as well as estimating them individually for people. And we weren't able with an exponential to fit that data. An exponential to fit that data very well. So, and then when we extrapolated this and looked at the SI values that came from this, we found that those also were highly correlated, that they were different. So, again, if you try to say, oh, this person has an insulin sensitivity of some number, that means different things depending on how long you've looked at the data, what that person's individual physiology is, in terms of how well. In terms of how well your model is representing it. So, those are all things that you need to think about when you're trying to model oral glucose tolerance tests. And then just wanted to acknowledge my graduate student who did a lot of this glucose modeling work and thinking about the duration dependence of using the oral minimal model and my collaborator Melanie Kirkreen, whose data we have here. So, thanks. I want to mention really quick, so what you're seeing yesterday things started looking, they started out looking somewhat abstract, but you're starting to see the physiology, the physiologic models pushing towards trying to diagnose diabetes, figure out what are the right measurements to optimally diagnose diabetes. So these are starting to push into the decision support areas that could be very impactful. For example, if we catch people's diabetes much earlier, If we catch people's diabetes much earlier, we can intervene and hopefully put it off for much longer, for example. That's a good question to Cecilia. Just curious, so you showed one representative participant and the rate of appearance of flukos, which is like a forcing on the thing. So this has like this jagged kind of thing. Do you find consistent functional forms of that across people that would make you think that, you know, this is a Think that you know this is a the way that glucose comes from the belly into the blood, as opposed to this is how we fit the data? No. So you can get really fancy and put stable isotope tracers into the drink that the person is drinking and use that to approximate what's happening with the actual rate of appearance of glucose in the blood. And that's something that we've done. There are issues again with doing that because you have to make certain assumptions that aren't necessarily. To make certain assumptions that aren't necessarily justified by the data, but you can get a sense of what's happening, and it's likely not so jagged. But again, this is because it's a minimal model, essentially. And so we're pushing a lot of interactions, both the interaction from what's coming from the gut, as well as the interaction of how things are changing with the liver and with other physiology, as that insulin is being released all into that one term. Because there's not really anything else fancy in the model. Anything else fancy in the model that's happening? So the giant, I guess, I'm less worried. I'm more curious about the oscillations. Because you have oscillations in the observed data, and it seems like that is driven from oscillations in the rate of appearance. So even if that were smoother, like do you see oscillations in that RA when you measure tracers? Or no, it's just like... Well, for that participant, you probably would, because they did have so many oscillations in the glue cup. Yeah, but across the board, you don't always see a glue. Always see a glucose response like that. You might so the typical response is that sort of nice up and down pretty quickly. That's not usually what we see in our participants, but oftentimes you see the two peaks where you have that sort of second or delayed insulin response that's going to be stronger enough to finally bring the glucose down. But not necessarily always those kinds of peaks. And the RA will. Those kinds of peaks, and the RA will generally follow that because it is generally the four sense. All right, thanks. Yeah, sorry. Okay, so part two of female reproductive endocrinology. So it sounds like I'm just like going way left field from what you've just heard about. But there is a connection. So I want to sort of think about challenges to sort of the modeling that I talked about yesterday. So basically, just like, I don't have a picture of the Basically, just like, I don't have a picture of the recap, but we have this sort of complicated system in the ovarian cycle that incorporates feedback between the brain and the ovaries. And we sort of solely sort of built this model. This is again based on the Cell Great Group's approaches to modeling the ovulatory cycle, where we develop compartmental models that separate sort of the brain from the ovary and then include interactions. Interactions and the signaling that occurs between the hormones that are produced in either of those tissues. So I ended with: we have a model, and magically we fit the model to data. So this is sort of a visualization of that. But I want to talk about some of the additional challenges that we either need to keep in mind for future modeling efforts or things that I've thought about in terms of where we are now with the models. So the first thing is that when we're First, thing is that when we're thinking about ovulatory cycle data, we are assuming that there's sort of perfect data when we're fitting our models to it, in the sense that, right, so we're relying on data that maybe was collected over a period of, say, a month's time. And in order to fit the models to the data, we sort of have to make the assumption that this gets repeated, right? So we're just sort of saying, like, there's one thing that can happen, and that thing keeps happening over and over and over again. Happening over and over and over again, which we know is not necessarily true because of the variability that happens between people and also within people. There's also just sort of capturing the data itself, there's limited data due to the invasiveness of experimental procedures in terms of, you know, like how participants are measured, what they have to do, and it's not necessarily all that feasible. All that feasible. The other thing that we need to keep in mind is that reality is messy, as I mentioned, and it's not always quantitative. So there are a lot of other factors that can affect the function of the ovulatory system. And those are not necessarily things that we incorporate explicitly into the model, but these are things that we want to sort of keep in mind. And then also, in terms of like data and being explicit about everybody sort of behaving. About everybody sort of behaving the same, these tend to give limited insight into historically vulnerable and excluded populations. And so that's another thing that we have to keep in mind. So where we've been in terms of the data sets that I've used in my modeling efforts are data that have come out like, you know, in the early and late 90s. But this sort of speaks to the invasiveness. So I've highlighted these terms, but like sort of like after admission, an intravenous catheter was inserted. An intravenous catheter was inserted into a forearm vein, and blood samples were obtained every three hours until 48 hours after the disappearance of the dominant follicle, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right? Like, so these are things that take time, and it's a very sort of selective group of individuals. And sort of the wealth data just has like, you know, is it similar data set that's been used to fit? But again, it's sort of like blood samples were drawn daily for a duration of one menstrual cycle in all subjects, right? Again, not something that I. Again, not something that I want to do with 30 days of my life. But I'm glad that these data sets exist. And so the thing that I'm starting to think about is: you know, this is great for a modeler like me because I care about how things change over time, but the data that is being collected currently sort of goes beyond that. It pushes beyond that. And these are the things that I want to sort of be able to take into account. So if we can inform our models by trying to bridge the gap. Our models by trying to bridge the gap between that sort of longitudinal data and things like just, you know, not just, but like 600,000 menstrual cycles. Like, we're not going to get menstrual cycle data for 600,000 individuals with the previous methodologies, but you can certainly do that with technology nowadays, right? So, how do we use that data to our advantage? These happen to be sort of plotted either across age or across BMI. Or cross-BMI, we can look at cycle lengths as being self-reported. We can come up with sort of probabilities of ovulation, all of these things happening, and those can also inform treatment decisions when you, say, have some level of dysfunction. So that's one challenge that we are sort of experiencing, and I'm sure that this is also something that's happening in a lot of different physiological models. So, another challenge. So, another challenge is just in the modeling in general when we think about the complexity of the biology, right? So, I leave out a ton of biology, the models, because, well, I'm not sure how much of it I need to include, but also the more I include, the more complex the math models become, the less tractable they become. And so we have to sort of bridge the gap between simplifying assumptions of complex biology and Complex biology and the accuracy of the assumptions that we're actually making and the things that we're sort of pushing under the rug, if you will. Another thing that we have to keep in mind is the fact that there are also demographics that would alter some of our assumptions and also the model behavior. And how do we input that into current frameworks or how do we sculpt future frameworks to deal with that? I mentioned yesterday that large-scale parameter estimation is difficult. Scale parameter estimation is difficult to put it lightly. And it was also mentioned yesterday that identifiability is always, always, always going to be an issue when you have complex models. So the framework of the model that I worked on with Jim Selgrade starting about 10 years ago now basically just does, you know, the compartmental thing. We think about things that are happening in the brain. We think about things that are happening with the We think about things that are happening with the ovarian follicles. We think about things that are happening within those follicles in terms of steroid production. And so, what we come out with, and I will talk about sort of more detailed aspects of this model tomorrow, or sorry, on Thursday, is a system of 12 ordinary differential equations to describe what's happening in these three subsystems and 43 unknown parameters. I am not a statistician, I am not a probabilist, I do not do optimization on all. Optimization on a large scale, that is a ridiculous number of unknown parameters. So it's sort of like, how much can your model actually say when you have that much uncertainty? And also, do you even have a prayer of identifying these parameters? No, but we do the best we can. So that's another challenge. And in addition to that, the beauty of math modeling is that you can create models that bridge multiple scales. Models that bridge multiple scales, right? So we can have these sort of multi-scale models where I'm looking at things in the brain. I could be looking at things within the cells within the brain, within, you know, the ER of the cells within the brain, right? So we can sort of span these multiple scales, but it becomes a lot harder to validate those because we're measuring outputs, right? So we have all of this underlying machinery, and all we have, quote unquote, to measure is hormone measure. To measure is hormone measurements, right? And so all of this stuff is happening, and then we can't necessarily validate the mechanisms that we're actually trying to describe. And so the last bit that I wanted to talk about, and this is more just sort of like keeping things straight in my head when I think about language and what that means. So again, this is just sort of a baby example of an output of a model that I'll talk about tomorrow. Model that I'll talk about tomorrow, but one, just from a language standpoint, what do we mean by a cycle? Right? So, as a mathematician, a cycle to me is very different from what I think about when I'm thinking about the ovulatory cycle. And so when I'm talking to someone who envisions sort of ovulatory cycle as the thing that we want to talk about, I have to come up with another way of representing what I mean by, you know, the sort of trajectory locally asymptotically stable limit cycle, right? Ontopically stable limit cycle, right? Like, that's that's not what I'm going to say, but I'm going to call it an interovulatory interval. But the idea here is that we have two trajectories in, and one might be regular, one might be irregular. And so where you have these sort of regular behavior, I can use cycle interchangeably because I'm referring both to the ovulatory cycle and I'm also referring to the limit cycle that the solution is sitting on. However, in this sort of irregular case, and what does that even mean? Even mean. We sort of see that there are multiple ovulatory events, but in terms of the actual cycle that or limit cycle that this is sitting on, there's a difference between what happens, right? So we have one mathematical cycle that goes from this LH peak to the next LH peak, but there are actually two ovulatory cycles in between. So that's again something that's more specific to the work that I do in terms of ovulatory dysfunction. And then finally, And then finally, this idea of like right versus wrong. We need to know what works in order to understand what happens when things don't work. And the primary example of that, again, that I'll talk about on Thursday, has to do with polycystic ovarian syndrome. And the idea that there are all of these things that are happening underneath the hood. For example, hyperandrogenism, right? So having large amounts of androgens in your system and what that actually does. And what that actually does. We know it's bad, but if we don't know what antigens do under physiological circumstances, we don't necessarily have a hope of understanding further how it can complicate things from a pathological perspective. So those are the things that we sort of need information on, but those are also the things that we get to incorporate into the models to see what the overarching effects are. So there are a lot of things to think about in that system, but I will stop there. I will stop there and again I will go more into detail on Thursday. George and No Amy should be And I think what I mean it was a
