Zoom. A honor for me presented to usuri Alvisú is the Mathematica and more possessed Master, a Mathematica otter professor of secondary profession, ambos of the University of Granada, and more Master in the Studio Feminist and General Studies of the University of Pahivac University. Actually, you have doctorate in the program of feminist programs and general students of the University of Pahivac. General of the University of Ahivaco y Tamien is professor in the Faculty of Education and Porte in the Department of Idactica Matemática de la Mijo University. Mucha gracias usuris or todo porque seque para tiso la que de la noche así que mucha graci por a septar a una si dar está chalda. Mien menía. Gracias. Mueno pus quería yodar las gracias la organización y estre tiermente a tiandrea. And I could invite me to here to implement the opportunity to live in Mexico as well. Yes, it's a piece that many. Well, you also present me, but it was because we realized my doctor. And so in study study in Mathematics, I think with the mathematics and all the transmission, for the study that I professor in Mathematics, and also because audio scripts, if we are also a little bit standby because submerged and operated. But a word of a party of invites that I duplicated general in crucial interstitials, reflections between optical events and practical events, feminist scientific scientific and good structure of the presentation, with a queen of the paradigm. Theorical relatives at the end of the investigation is identifying the results in what expand reflections that provide conversations with scientific feminists, intercalary subsequent reflections, vinculadas with the time that government engagement in this process to plan that surge can. And other simple invitation to compare events or to reflect more intimate or one that is formulated. In the intent, Well, the point of part of this question is often the idea of more. This question, Evelina Foxque in their reflections on the. Reflections on general analysis: how characteristic scientific knowledge in 2008 for accidental science is the classic and the modern analysis, the service or influence to see that the form of characteristic forms of scientific knowledge. In Cadavera, we are very sexual dominant. It is told that the scientific system is conditioned by the general system. How this, well, we are a little in that analysis what I was to marry as representing plastic and Francis Bacon, as representing the Atienta Placid. How representing modern science and describing the form in which characterization the science and other philosophical philosophy, the scientific conception, the process of scientific knowledge. So, we have a little description to the platform, as representing the clásici distinguished complementarities, the material, the world The material and the world ideal, so natural nature are part of two worlds, the material and also the world, and the condition consists in all dimensions and material. It is contemplar scientific consistency in contemplar the forms of natural forms. Las formas of natural form of regional dimension of the dimension. Platonism that is relations between natural horizontal relations, and that is why this characteristics as relations homo entry. And this is the form of relations that more prestigious in Latinas and that. Francis Bacon confronts natural family and general para natural feminine natural and masculine master. For another part of the people that contemplation, this platon contemplate, when it needs to control, including dominating the natural nature, and conceive this relationship between. And concise relationship between subjects, however, a matrimonial cast between them. What conclusions can the first conclusion is that the construction is a social construct, very disparate forms of characteristics of scientific condition, and the second is that the construction recalls condition for the general system. Of general. But also for the general, also a constructor to condition by the scientific system, and the cartean is what we can say, this implication. Characteristics human fragmented in 2005. Unfragment of conflict, and the scientific as a process binculated away. This congo que cuerpo se a sociar natural and women and feminine corporation characterized as reproductive machines, and the masculine as a productive masculine sexual division of work between transport. Travajo between other questions. This explains Silvia Federal Supervisor and Bruja. This university is between the scientific system and general system, and I will focus on the plant that the characteristic of the scientific knowledge determines in some way the scientific subject. And there is no science that is with the promise of. With the promise of a prior and objective object of study, select a type of individual type so that this promise subject with marginal similar forms can articulate the dominant nature, selection here individuals so here the pod y el control constituents propagate centrality. This model of scientific modern adoption. Ado, much of configuration, the masculine modern masculine. And well, the character scientific character, as an expression of general expression, we are talking about the expressions of general expressions constructed by identity of general identity, performing the form for the most community of puppies, and the case of this performance. In consequence that you can result in problematic for women, as well as in a construction on the basis of natural nature, with the attributes of feminine attributes and numbers of parallel subjects, with the attributes of masculine attributes, there is a lot of things. How materialistic all this in scientific system. And scientific, well, we can see what I mean in the academia. Well, the united are hierarchical units, their ideas, more affairs. It is a meritocratic system that promotes the opportunity, but in the pilot, with this categorical por exemplary, they are in the idea. And in the vase of the piramides, for the privilege, there are many more, for example, in professors. I don't know that figures are in our university, but the figura and categorical figure is the figure that are more trustworthy, with the figure of emeritus, and the professor are queuing prestigious. In the literature of discriminatory discourse, in scientific literature of phenomena, for example, the correlation and alert of a correlation between these phenomena and scientific characters. Jara unlawful scientific. So the lineage with all the dictionary, the objective, one of the objectives of People is within relatives and general feminists to normal and generate oppression characteristics of the world scientific. But also we have to discourses and practices that confront and. Confront and enter the normal oppression for feminist scientists, in the question about events that techno-scientific, also the question about trajectory systems and about their experience with feminism. A criteria. A criteria to selection the participants in the investigation can identify as a idea because a situation can be a more complex that the provenance of social privileges. Other criteria that identify as feminists, because away the vision requires visual instruments, and these nuances, if not the position, other criteria. Other criteria had studied scientific technologies with all mathematical components and also diversity and all the participating in the investigation to scientific investments in the country based on and all accepted proposals. They are in the table. We can create and practice between a city of Adan in the monster of the modern world. Three stats to recognize the scientific systems that confront and that there are conflicts but also synergy. And they are the And that are the inertia, the prevalence in the first contact with the contact. To the emotions that are scientific, for example, mention the commodity, the diversion, including the passion. There is, for example, a record the moment to the year, when you have the effort that studies, that And mention also the alliance between companions of classes. Alliance between companions of classes that the many majority of trajectories of interest is characteristic for a mentor that impulses to scientific. This interest because the ninth meeting is estimated the intellectual capacity of the feminine capacity of 60, and that preparing their decisions, academic decisions, futures. If we embark in the scientific And this could be inculcated, because we start to pay for people significantly as padres Professor or amigos. If we look at the tensions a lot with their fient progress, of course, the relatives of the enterprise. The relatives of the entry vistas will configurate a retreat of academia semester at the campus of Abataya that describe Jane Jackson. Jane Jackson died in a public article in the news that the academia is a regulated space that some of the explicit regulations, but many implicitly, there are vigilantes that are already there and also that. And also that in the day of academia, it was a campaign of a dedicated personal and professional person. The title is that with here, for example, when everything is studying, I can doctorate and do it. Obviously, seminarios of students, in the seminars of students, and professors, in what. And the seminarians in what students pass and various professors and more directly. We have more companies, because the professors of the world. The title that the competitivity and aggressivity is. Competitivity and aggressivity are patronies not only the admitted but the world that is when the student wants to valor aggressive activities and competitive activities. Clara by identifying different ideas as work very present to the experience as students of mathematics to administrate this and create this different case In essence, the hierarchy of academic history. Hierarchies, academic, scientific academic stretchamente vinculades to the authority. The union of ideas suggests that the admitted forms of authority are the masculine histories, the criteria that permit the hierarchy are also masculine. The list of discriminatory actions reported by this. Reports for the student. Rosa, for example, describe some of the comments exist of the Professor and the university that studies superiority students have secretariats of direct and engineering directors, and that the professors commentaries and their classes of the types because it is secretary of direction, I used to do it. Marido Aquino, the animal aqueous study, secretary of election. Ester por support of the paternalism participate when study congress in his Dr. Anda mention that the choice of this investigation study is very interesting and what is interesting and transient. In this lineage, the work that the position of women are. Feminista are detention, scientific. In relation to tension, derivatives of feminist position, saxi collaborators account that the activist is much frequent in scientific knowledge that our ambitions. And this suggests that the dividends or the idea are structural and not a false correlation between the scientific identity and feminist identity. And feminista. Well, the toddler that are conflict exo, they are conflict that proven, microaggressions, activities, aggressive activities, or competitive activities, but the conflicts have also a component or not. And this has to see with what we mentioned. With mention of the principle, and that Jean Leifa is not aquir with us, but this also processes apprentices in the identity and participates in the world. And also, this process is potentially conflictive. Conflictive for the women and general to people who do not with the certificates or allows them. Well, somebody else performs the authority to identify conflicts between the condition of women and the necessity of. And the need to perform the authority to certainly be different in the presentation of the advantages of substances in chickas and chicos. The present communication in Congress, chicken and chicos occupancy in the space of forma different space. The chickas colloca de la mesa or junta la ordinador, ni entras que los chicos se plantaban en el centro. In the session of prejudice, the chickas respond with. The chicken respondents with all more dubbing and in the chicks have more assertive. All that marks a different. Here to try the idea that part of this authority as social masculine and how scientific. Otar entrevizas danca department. Clara, for example, that my study of mathematical characters are very frustrated because of what is studying the construction of social connections. And we can work this way of correlation between scientific activities. Clara is. Por parte clarity that are the jobs when the article choke with social typical of the live. There is creating studio estar with the impostor, and that is that the strategy to not sufficiently buena or the sufficient sufficient. We know that between us. And here, so interesting that the speaker is only one of the possibilities of the syndrome of the impostor. The opportunity to look at the impostor syndrome because the music syncretic ensues. In there, is it Cadillac and the original in France for this? And in this book, there are the symptoms, of the impostor, and the passivity that would be just the contrary of this other symptom of this pattern of and this is very interesting because. Because the sensation that sensation of the significance of them and our workshop who had to be in the impossible, I could assist, but we don't think that it was. But we think that it would sonar many things that work on this one. This is about the symptom of the impostor, which is like a specifics, many things of the semi-enabled and good and analytic part of my technology. Well, we are talking about what identities and in the In the analytics between scientific studies, in medicine of these things that identify the moments of crucifixion, of decision moments, talent like the description of the ball. Again, some of these moments are especially because there is interest to interstitials, or evidence, the truth. I identified in the relations of four of the interests, and the idenomines because these moments have profound implications in the formas of understanding and practicing the science of stadas. Stars. Voyager, we related to some or somewhere for Rosa, for example, to say that to clear scientific and ideology. And that doctoranders do not context that. Of context that we investigation. When suggesting that the material that is investigating a company of tests, and military applications, if the variables of tube quality, part of there, when you came from CIDI, who did not investigate material, Clara queen, Matemáticas or work in a multinational Not their options and studies of cooperation. This service to career is a new perspective on education. When students are studying students, if you can see how one of the relationships of science and critical education, I think that it was put a number. But as I said, the click of value. I've seen where they are in the podcast with the things that I. Conjugate things credentialed with a feminism, the idea that we want to consume investigation. It is a revision of scientific evolution. And the objectives include the positive very competitive project. Projects very contextive, and there are concrete trash scientific knowledge. When I was my doctor, there is no clarity that normalized, but this feminist perspective to identify and this. Apart from societies, in the state, a particular sport, the scientific and feminist, and that sports translucent. And that is traditional in some cases. That is the spatial country. The spatial academic space or social inclusive and experiences of discrimination and to construct stereotypes. In that case, the creation of the educator of what is found in the What is this foundation? In the present work, from a perspective perspective, we have feminism and sustainability. This is a more social space that transcends academia, but the authors are and co mention that some space created by academia can consider control. In this sense, the academic program is a program. Academia is a program of universal programme to see that academic women and occupy positions of the position and university. Here only two of the spaces in the interviews, but there is a more and all these spaces who have some elements in how between all the spaces. These questions all the part of the basque of a more equality. But continued the model and the development objective in the case of natural science and there is a lot of observables and practical more critics and critics. But in the case of the program for the leader of academic programs, what there are regulars on the numeras, no? We mentioned. We mentioned that the academic general bin is quiliberated and the objective of these programs that are programmed, but the existentialism of parents does not question. We know that if the point of parties parade the context of the model of objectives, they are in some cases contradictory between The states also of the importance of the public, the majority of the people, and the utilization to promote the feminism. And a first prior work of general. Above the general, and I think that the volume produced a subject, and also the data of a form. And if they were in the maximum project of the table, there is only in space of evolution, the space in the top is spatios of evolution. They have not spatially feminists, that I know. Is that yo this year in these spaces? Because I want to see here. And one attribute to one cosmetics. No in these states, but like this first, the ayudo empodarse in this, and to talk. There is a part, the important part to the movement society. At the social movements and diversity. And when we collaborate with a community of society, and a national country is scientific, that these spaces. For last, the association has a mental collaboration in a feminist review. In a feminist article of work of scientific work, and this work or science with knowledge that has academic recognition relations with civil recommendations for women for the test work with visibility a part of the sabre. Product also the works the historically with these ideas that scientific system in the form of the world. A population in the form of internet feminism and the form of practical authors. Rosa, for example, the feminism in terms of inclusion and creating the diversity is the power of the series, we are part of a continuum, the sex is a continuum, the generosity is a continuum. We need to sebupler, prompt and construct a society, more In concordance, describe their scientific practice in the manera. Our investigations during the space. Well, they work in the architecture so we have investigations, very inculcated to do the space. If we more habitable space in our space, there are the general jue, the need to depart the architecture and urbanism with general perspectives. Urbanism with perspective of general perspective. The general is one of the parameters, not unique, but if it is a essential transversality allowance. There is a part of the feminism of the Manera. For the feminism, it is a lucha form, it is capitalism. It is the feminist power, we are living to put in the Poner Ashadas in the center and the systemal service of the Reverend. And describe their scientific practice or what gustaria queen scientific practices of the manera. Temo clear that the type of investigation that is disturbed, but if we investigate the militants, like the energetic transition. We correlate that there is a correlation between the format between feminism and the practical form. Feminism and the forma of practical form of some authors. If Elizabeth Fi in academic feminists the society of sexist socialism of a feminist science, like many could be a feminist critic of the science. And this is the question: how feminists are How feministas confrontamos or also the norms that regulate the scientific system. It is only criticamos or we also have a question that I surgery to identify from the analyst in the entrevists and the idea in the literature. The segment that we use has. So we know if we have a problem in this, these problems or have a science or a feminist mathematics. Tamienne gustario. Tamienne gusta invitar las a reflecionar on what the synergies, tensions, or choke tensions, the inclusion, the interstitios, or the sides in their itinerario for the scientific system or mathematical system. And also interesting that people are workshop station. Because a comment that the idea about many interesting questions and question if this function has the space, it is not. And to do interesting identifiers and references. So these two voyages finalized the charge and one minutes to the device can be planted or about other things that can be. And we are very glad to see a plate. Much of your investigation. Well, I think that commentaries the question that I said in the interview that I relative to us who generated in study relations with this is generated. Via sorry. Viet algos or space, but we are presented if the time. For example, for example, in the academia, ultimately, the menu can study general studies problematic. I present if you investigate. No, special. There are things that the mention, because this fund to understand the academic characteristics, to accredit. Por accrediting Professor Agregado Cathedral and other parts that just program that mentioned academic para. Program to the women are in leadership, and promote a lot like the need of activities, like to be a problem that generates. Genero, era, era that the puestos of liberated occupados por hombres. I think we include one of them, who is the faculty or who is the director, or university, but also who the principal investigator or principal investigation in our investigation, etc. Instigation, etcetera, and promulgated much necessity in proactive, but not recurrent in the vistas, how the problematization of these hierarchies, more queer enough, whereas. The puesto dandal sombre. No explico. Yes, yes totally. I variously para, but also Chile in general is a country that the political neoliberal policy is and that the capitalism academic capital volume and the time is important. So when you see that, we are going to be able to do it. There are some questions that can depend on the academy in this question that also institutionalized. And how institutionalized academia our country is to say, because this political, evaluative policy that we have not affected differently, in Spain, also the evaluations are very important productivists, like that general sentences. In that dependency, In that dependency, this question of the time and the fond queer receiving para investigation, no, no, how our works, no. Okay. In that sense, how work with these other types of reference nada, for example, nada and false para. Claro, because it has also much to be rode a project, which is not a queue, affected people, a mind, but also because it is cognizant as investigation. How do you investigation of what first, in the academia, in between the capitalism also? So, my personality is very close, but the brains, I think the characteristics, the majority of them, five of them. I say investigation very well financially. No, that is how it goes with many, with this relatable, that is how this, but our cordo, with this ideological. But with ethics, well, with many problemas ethics, And the data Canada, as other forms of people, but I think we don't have this problem, like the answer, or not very much, a little bit, our question is important. No question, but no, it's perdo es albo queas. Subrayan gracias usury. Here mano elementada, trio que María Isabel. Y de la question el chat y voila, but thanka. En una questiona respecto que commentadaj al principe, like this difference of directitur. Of course, the hierarchy that occupies or other queen, but we see some relationship of different activities with the discipline. I think with Chile, we are visiting that in certain disciplines where Disciplinas where elaborate work and example disciplines have more hierarchical disciplines per se. I can super important. And mathematical final solar is that it is difficult, but it could be difficult. So I presented different respects the discipline of the entrepreneur. In this case, they are not, but also cannot be statistical. No separate statistics, but in this case, the person that we problematized hierarchies and more work between the education of this university, but our campus so that they are investigating mathematics that is well, I. But I think there are no sique if there are connections. If connections between Forma final identity, I think with the discipline. I create and for example identities that are in general, for example, because I think this form hierarchical. But more intuition, no tengo here also is a idea. Gracias, thank you very much. The chat? No, okay. So, Julio, this tega aduda, se como que sus estápensando en principo la vas mucho sobre la valación de. The relationship of the general structure with the science, or how constructive and science. And many aspects of this work and creating these processes of colonization and control is the same. And so that also flexion that. Once reflection queen, all this aspect of colonization and process of varialization, you are also generating these classes, and the practices of feminists, and for the points for the reflection. For example, that significantly pensar in coloniality, in vaciality, in the moment that we think we are preguntas, no? So, for example, that class of contrast. Example: that class of contra espacio is that this generando in this workshop, no? It's a colonial space, we have interest for Carlo la Calle, because in more than 20 years, you classes confronted, which is transformative, we generate. If the final day also is in this, we do not colonialism, also religious, because the universities in America, Latina, surge of conventions, and these conventions in practical patriarchal practices are not priests, nobies, and all these things. So, however, La pregunta predusa cualos. Es just like the aspect of the colonization or the vacialization others, this systemic phenomenon, how limited for the construction of a feminist science, or a feminist space, or a garage in the puzzles for the dichotomies, of the natural case. I think more limitation is an opportunity for you. It's like. Pasaismo with the feminist movement that will understand racialized race, of the feminism, of the feminism that is peripheral, and that you can translate this space, This spacion. This presentation that I here, but in the term of Mathémática, for example, Mathémática secret as scientific discipline in the years and the pretension of And the pretension of basically good needs for work qualificated, and there is important that the mathematical studies, no? So there is mathematical or the idea of mathematical ideas, as scientific disciplines. And the more people of Brazil, of Mozambique, and other countries impoverished, a reclamation that forms in mathematics, you. Because colonial form, and there was a critical and very interesting education and coloniality and therefore homige, so I think more limitations. More limitations is an opportunity, torture in this intersectional also, generating inclusive actions, don't have to respond to it. Thank you, Surya. We have a question. Hola, goods. Well, no, paradí. Mucha grace for the presentation. I quería, a little more in the second question that you jahí os aprita tiéonde generalía. I don't know if it doesn't live or more fundamentally age conceptions of feminism and science that are able to contradict them. Yes, there's a lot of things. If in the If in the case of the mathematics, for example, evidence because we are positioned differently, there are not the objective character, universal, neutral of science, of mathematical science, not as a question. No there is a question of their values that we have for mathematics, and there are other things that if problematic problems in these values, and that is how they are investigated, also professors. So, how is that? Professors, so that tradition in their form of education, in mathematics. And the epistemic different, simplical or educated different perspectives, and this has been. And this has to be feminism, from the feminist epistemology, also, whereas the form of position to be different. And how academic system problematic problems of characteristics are not, that also many forms. Chambía mucho la forma en la que túas estientien paramí para mies como como interestante ver esto, que toda se identifam, like feminist, but very disparate forma. So So there, you have to have a feminist because there's to better history of the mathematical mathematics and people can put it together. So that is. I think that there is a party that is what we change. Well, thank you. I'm going to terminate the end of a commentary that we have. But I think that also the norms are not simply direction. The sense of the feminism in Latin America is that. Feminism in Latin America is penalized in various Mexico and impact all professor inclusive of the university, which has been studied for men who live in the basis, not the authority and the puppets of power. I think that the definition of contradictory definitions exist nuclear common name to feminists, understanding also that these categories are dynamic categories. Mien that these categories are dynamitas, but more queer like definition, but you know, as scientific and feminist intersecting. Much for the space no completely segue, no science consider completes, but we say, but if you have closed. Gracias era for the commentario. Y well, mucha, gracias, usuri, gracios moment. Gracias are thank y well here we are a break of mediabra que esteemed gracias
