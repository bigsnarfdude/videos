Right, so our next talk is by Shang Xia Dai, who will continue the mass theme and tell us about positive mass theorems for manifold compassing fiber and nucleonids. Thank you, Eric. Yeah, I'd like to thank the organizers for the invitation. This is one of my many visits to Banff. I never wanted to miss a chance. Chance. And in fact, if I remember correctly, my first invitation to them is also from Eric. So, like it was said, beautiful place, beautiful mass, beautiful people, what's not to love? Right. So, yeah, so I like to talk about positive matter, but for different kinds of Different kind of ALE and generalizations. Okay. So, right. First of all, I'd like to talk about the classical positive math theorem and then introduce the different asymptotic geometry that we'll be looking at and then state the main results. And then state the main results, and then indicate the ideas of proof. So mass is an important concept in physics. However, it is quite a mysterious concept in general relativity. And in fact, if I understand correctly, there are only a few instances where this is well understood. Where this is well understood. And one of those instances the isolated system or isolated gravitational system. And if you look at the spatial slice of this isolated gravitational system, you will be looking at what's called asymptotically flat space-time. Sorry, asymptotic flat. Asymptotic flat manifolds and or LE or AE manifolds. Okay, so the mass concept in this setting is introduced by three physicists, Anawit, Besser, and Misler. And so it's called ADM mass. The ADM mass. And the setting, as I mentioned, is for asymptotic flat manifolds. So basically, the picture is like this. Well, we see a lot of beautiful creatures here, like elks and mountain ghosts. I'm yet to see a beautiful creature like this. But basically, our infinity looks like Euclidean space. And then inside could be any compact control system. And then the metric is supposed to be, looks roughly like the Euclidean metric. So in other words, it it it's the Euclidean metric plus some error term, and the error term should decay sufficiently fast. Sufficiently fast in terms of the distance from some fixed point. And the order of the decay is referred to as an asymptotic order. In general, we impose the condition that this asymptotic order is bigger than n minus 2 over 2. n is the dimension of the manifold. Okay, and then plus some derivative decay restrictions as well. So in Klaus' talk, he presented more elegantly in terms of weighted sublime spaces. And in addition, we reply that the scalar curvature is integrable. The reason for that is because the next quantity The next quantity, what's called the ADM mass, will be well defined. So the ADM mass is given by this so-called flux integral at infinity. So you look at larger and larger And larger balls, and the boundary of those will be a sphere at infinity. And then you use the first order information of the metric to define this quantity. It's called the ADM mass and And the reason why we are assuming that decay with particular restrictions on the asymptotic order and the intuability of scalar curvature is to assume that this quantity is well defined and is independent of the coordinate chosen. So, once again, I'll give a brief indication for why this is the case in a more Case in a more complicated asymptotic hyperbolic setting, but the idea is basically the same. So in the asymptotic flat setting, that's due to Botnick. So these physicists derive this quantity from physical considerations like formulating. Gravity, like in terms of Lagrangian formula formalism, and they derive this quantity, and then they check that if you're looking at the gravitational field generated by a point map. Okay, so if you have a like Like, well, imagine this is the point of thinking about it as being concentrated at the center. And then you can write down, you can solve the Einstein's equation. So that's done by a Schrotzhov. And so the metric is called the Schrotzchild metric, and it's an isomorphism. And it's an asymptotic flap. And then, if you compute the ADM mass using this formula, you end up with the mass that you started off with. And so it makes sense to call it mass. Okay, so that's the reason. Any questions so far? Okay. Okay. There's one particular situation in this quantity is very easy to compute, and that's when you have exactly Euclidean at infinity. So up at infinity At infinity, you don't have any error terms. Your metric is exactly the Euclidean metric. Then that's A L E. And in this case, the mass is clearly given to be zero because the first derivatives of the metric will be zero. It's a Euclidean metric. So that's. So that's an easy case to consider, and that has some important consequences to be seen later. Okay, so the classical positive math term is stated as follows. So that's due to Rick Shung and Yao, and later. Yell and later Wixen give another proof. It says that if you look at asymptotic flat non-compact, well, that's that. Sorry, that's kind of a redundant. Okay, I also discovered some okay, so SM30 flat manifolds with non-negative With non-negative scalar curvature, then the mass is also non-negative. Okay, so the implication is that if you have non-negative scalar curvature, then you would have non-negative mass. So that's called positive mass term. And moreover, if the mass is zero, then your manifold must be Your manifold must be isometric to the Euclidean space. Okay, so this is the rigidity part of the statement. All right. The scalar curvature enters here because of its physical interpretation as a local mass density. So intuitively, what it's saying is. Basically, what it's saying is that if you have local mass density non-negative, then the total mass must also be non-negative. However, in general relativity, this is a very non-trivial fact. Okay, so uh precisely because in general relativity, your total mass is not the integral of local mass, that's it. Were local extensively. Well, not apparently. So, some historical remark. First of all, Shung-Yao proved this in 1978, but with the restriction on the dimension to be between three and seven. And so the reason for that is because they use minimal mass, minimal. Minimal mass, minimal surface technique, and for regularity, you need this assumption. But most recently, in 2017, that's where the pre-tring came out, and it was recently published. They removed the dimension restriction. So now it's good for all the dimensions. And Whitton, so right after Shun Yao's original paper, Wheaton gave a simple proof for a spin manifold. So that's for all dimensions, but you need some kind of topological restriction on your manifold. Those are called spin manifold. It's a condition similar to the R. Similar to the orientation. So, but it's more than orientability. The reason for this spin manifold is because Witten uses Dirac operator. In order to define the Dirac operator on a general manifold, you you need the spin condition. Okay. All right. Any questions so far? Questions so far? Okay, so there are many consequences of this famous positive math theorem. So the first one is the so-called Gerosh conjecture, and that corresponds with this picture. So as I mentioned, that the I mentioned that the mass, if your metric is exactly Euclidean, then the mass is zero. However, from the positive mass term, if you know the scatter curvature is non-negative, then the rigidity part of the positive mass term will be the same. Master will tell you that this can happen only when your manfold is exactly your feeling. So that means this is no, no, it's impossible. You cannot have non-trivial topology inside. You cannot have non-trivial metric inside either. So it has to be. So it has to be exactly flat. So that's referred as the Gerosh conjecture. And it has also motivated a number of rigidity problems for scalar curvature. So like this is the Euclidean situation. You could look at the spherical situation or hyperbolic situation. And another application is in Shun's resolution of the Yamabi problem. And yet another application is Preyos inequality. That's inequality for the mass in case you have a black hole. You have a black hole in your system. Okay, so the mass in that case should not only be non-negative, but it's bounded from below by the black hole information. Okay, so Hugh Bray gave a solution of this inequality in dimension three using positive mathematics. And of course, Hurst can yeoman the idea of another proof using the inverse mean curvature flow. And I'll also learn from James' talk that positive math theorem is quite useful in dealing with the black hole uniqueness. So yeah, so those are the some of the Those are some of the well-known applications of positive math theorem. And now back to the approach to positive math theorem. There are two similarly different approaches. And Shun Yao's approach, they use minimal surfaces. And in primoplosin, sorry, actually I meant wit. Actually, I meant wit. So yeah, that's another typo. Okay, so that's Dirac operator. Okay. Yeah. But Grandma Flossen came in here. They do come in for different reasons. All right. Right, so what we would like to look at is some other asymptotic geometry. So in this setting, your manifold at infinity looks like a Euclidean phase. There are many motivations for considering the following asymptotic. The following asymptotic geometry, which I'm calling it asymptotically fibered Euclidean end. Okay? So your space will look like a Euclidean space times, it looks like a Euclidean space times another manifold, a compact piece. Which we call X. Alright, so the precise definition is if you take away compact set, then The complement of compact set looks like the Euclidean space of a k-dimension, take out the ball, times another manifold, which is assumed to be compact. And moreover, we have a metric on this manifold, which is supposed to be scalar flat. And so And so your metric on this near infinity will look like the product metric plus some error term where the error term is supposed to decay. So it's kind of similar to the asymptotic flat setting, except that the derivative now is these are Now is these are covent roots. And for some reason, technical reason, we also need to assume one more order of differentiation. And here the asymptotic order is given by the dimension of a Euclidean factor. So tau is bigger than k minus 2 over 2. Shoal like two and in addition we need the scalar curvature to be integral. Okay, so that that's the reason for assuming the scalar curvature of this compact piece is zero. All right, so that's the asymptotic geometries that we Cody geometries that we would like to look at. And the motivations from physics is string theory. Basically, string theory says that our universe is not the four-dimensional Minkowski space that we observed, but rather there are some tiny curved up dimensions that we cannot see. Dimensions that we cannot see, and those compact pieces, X. So instead of S and putting flat, it looks like flat times something. Okay. Yes? You don't allow non-trained operations? Very good question. We have some results, but in this talk, I restrict to trivial vibrations. Yeah. Okay, so there are some issues. Yeah, there's some issues that one has to deal with. Yeah. Okay, maybe I'll mention it when we come to it. Okay. All right. Any other questions? Okay. So once again, the AD. So once again, the ADMS can be defined. And in this case, it's again given by, first of all, the information of your metric at infinity. And so the sphere at infinity is more like the Euclidean sphere times x. Okay? And Okay, and so you also normalize by dividing by the volume of the compact piece. And so there's a very classical example called the Euclidean Trotschau metric, and that's a metric on And that's a metric of R2 crossed with the n minus 2 dimensional sphere. And the metric actually looks explicitly like this. And to make this metric well defined at its singularity, which is when this factor becomes zero, you need zero you need to actually sort of compactify the t parameter to to to make t actually lie in a circle of certain radius. And so that makes it asymptotic to R and minus one times the circle. So this is an example where the geometry identity Where the geometry at infinity is not Euclidean, but Euclidean times a circle. And this metric has a Ricci curvature zero, so it's a Ricci flat. And the mass you can compute it using this formula turns out to be exactly this parameter m. Thanks for that. Yes. Can you remind me what K is again? So if it reminds me. K is the Euclidean dimension. Okay, so at infinity it looks like X, which is my k dimension. With this formula work, if the X is not compact, so this guy has a circle at infinity. So what happens if the circle has, you know, doesn't have a bad. Hasn't have a bounded size. This still apply? No, no. No, we're only dealing with the compact X for our. Yeah, yeah. So you are interested in the case when the circle occur kind of creates a circle. We can talk about that after that. We can talk with that after. Yeah, yeah. Would it be possible to relax the follow-up conditions a bit in the sense of you only require follow-up conditions for identity part invariant, like a constant part in the radar direction, something? What condition, sorry? Would it be possible to relax the follow-up conditions a bit like specifying particular components all of like that or like know the mean value The mean value over the x. Can I answer the question for you? Yeah. There's a counterexample due to Witten, where you have an S1 at infinity and a sphere, and it does not obey a positive bass theorem. But I think that circle roams unboundedly at infinity. I'm not sure. So you can't ignore those four own conditions, I'm sure. Non-supersymmetric movements are fine compact immediately. Maybe those aren't too big, but there could be something in between. Because growing up as a constellation of images, something like that. Care should take control of the colours. It's fast away. It's best that we have questions answered by the audience. Sorry, so this metric is complete. This is complete. And has a high amount of symmetry? It's not common to me. It's even. What do you mean by high model symmetry? No, no, I mean I mean the Schwarzschild is coming to V1. Yes, yeah. But here, I did not see immediately the, I mean, there's an isometric group, and the organs have some certain co-dimension. It's going to be short. I did not see it. So you have the spherical symmetry, you also have this one symmetry. Okay. I guess that looks like a codivist one. Okay, yeah, that's an interesting question. I haven't thought about it. That looks like a codivision one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's good. All right. Okay, so yeah, so I mentioned some previous work. Motivated by string theory, I considered the case when X is The case when X is the colour or some other special holomy metric, the common feature of this is you have a parallel spinner on such a spaces. And so the corresponding positive math theorem is proven finally. In that setting, I also discussed Setting also discussed a counterexample from physics and some compactability issues for spin structure, which exactly causes the positive NASDAQ to be violated. And then in 2009, Energy, his motivation is slightly different. He is motivated from Motivated from considerations of gravitational instant tons, and he considered four-dimensional spaces asymptotic to Euclidean space times a circle or even circle vibration. And he proved Hausley Masorem by assuming compatibility of thin structures. And most And most recently, Neu Schlu II, they are motivated yet by a different problem. That's the Gramov's filming problem for positive skeleton geometrics. And they considered circle product or Taurus product and proof the positive master. The positive mass theorem, but imposing some kind of incompressible conditions, those are conditions about pi one of the circle or torus being injected in the total space. And they proven some partial rigidity results. And later, Chen, Liu, Shu Du, they They extended to general flat manifolds. So X can be flat manifolds in particular torus. And once again, the rigidity result is partial. They only prove that if the mass is zero, then the manifold must be flat. Okay. And so this is our main result. So once again, we're looking at the scalar flat metric on the compact piece. And we are interested in proving Pausiti Man theorem for manifolds which asymptotically look like a Euclidean space times X, where X is this given X. And so that means we wanted to have non-negative scales. We want it to have non-negative scalar curvature. And then you want the mass to be non-negative. Now, our condition is a little bit complicated in the sense that if you know that this manifold, which is what we call connected sum or generalized connected sum, Has no metric or positive scanner curvature. So, in other words, we are assuming that for any closed manifold which admits an embedding of X with trigger normal bundle, if you look at the generalized connected sum of this guy with the torus Tk times X, well, this. Well, this torus times X obviously has an embedding of X with stream of normal bundle, and then you can do some kind of surgery similar to connected sum. You obtain a new manifold. And if this new manifold has no metrics of positive curvature, then the positive mass theorem pulls up. That's where it works in the subscription. Okay, that's going to be. Okay, that's going to be explained in the next slide. Okay. And moreover, we do have the rigidity result that if the mass is zero, then your manfo has to be isometric to RK product with x. Okay, so what's this? So it's just to distinguish the mm one from the n. Distinguish the MN1 from the MN, is that right? Okay, so M1 is any closed manifold which has an embedded like to its trigonormal bundle. Okay, M has a natural compactification which will become M1. Okay, so just like in the asymptotically Euclidean case. As a perfectly Euclidean case, you can compactify this guy to by just one-point compactification. You'll end up with a compact manifold. So, this is like a large ball wood pack in here, and in this And in this sort of more general setting, you just go back this. So it's a one-point compactification along the Euclidean factor, and you end up with this one. So this is a compact uh manifold. Yes. Just rather comment. I'm surprised that X doesn't need to be richer than X doesn't need to be rigid flat. That's right. We only need X to be scalar flat. Because, I mean, if X is scalar flat but not richer flat, you can deform into positive scalar curvature. Yeah. And you're saying it's like kind of nuts? But we are specifically looking at the metric which asymptotic to Euclidean metric times this scalar flight metric. Yeah. So So, right, I you're thinking about deforming to a different metric, and then the asymptotic geometry is somewhat different. Yeah, that's right, but deforming it and then somehow like anyway, go ahead. Yeah, so the generous connected sum is explained here basically. Explained here basically that's a lot a lot of words. The picture is quite simple. You have two you have two nanopodes which are called F1 and F2, and Belis has Has acts embedded in it with trivial normal bundle. Okay, so if you look at the tubuna neighborhood, they look like exactly the same. So in particular, you can remove two buddha neighborhoods from those manifolds. Manifolds, and then you have the same boundary, and then you can glue them together. You get this connected sum, or generalized connected sum. If you're at, it's just a point, that's the usual connected sum. All right, so that's the notation connected. Notation connected some along X with this. So we have M1 is a manifold which has embedding of X with trigger normal bundle. And this guy obviously has an embedding. You just embed X into just the second factor. Just the second factor has a point that has normal trivial normal bundle, and so you do this generalist connected sum. And so our condition is that this has no metrics of positive scalar curvature. But in your assumption, you're not assuming that the manifold MN has no negative scalar curvature. There was no assumption. There was no assumption on there's no assumption on M. N is assumed to have now negative scale coming to it. Oh, sorry, I see. Yeah, for the positive mass. Yeah. But the newer CRF. Sorry. Yeah, okay. Yeah, it's a little bit. Okay, so first of all, you have to. Okay, yeah, and then you have M1. And yeah, in answer to Robert's question, I mentioned that M1 comes out as a natural compactification of M. And so you're assuming that the scalar curvature of M is non-negative, then you're proving that the mass is also non-negative. All of that, under the All of that under the assumption that this guy has no positive scope. Yeah, okay. So you don't just need that the one-pointation of the M connects some along X, T, has no positive scalar. You need every possible guy. Every possible actually we just need a pa particular one. We just need just a to yeah, to save the results to the full. Yeah. Results sort of will yeah, yeah. So, in effect, the truth goes like throwing that, yeah. And you will show us examples I understand correctly, right? You need some condition like this to eliminate the short shield example because that would have zero mass, or no, it doesn't have zero mass. The short shield example. Does it satisfy your assumption or yeah it does yeah okay so well this condition well yeah it even takes a while to understand you you say can you show us examples okay show us examples right so indeed So indeed, so for the this is related to this so-called contact version of the Geros conjecture. And it basically says that for any closed bandfall, n connected some with the torus has no positive scattercometry. Okay, and so you can think of it as a consequence of positive mass. As a consequence of positive math term, and like Grammar Lawson, they gave a proof for manifolds which are spin. And in fact, for non-compact manifolds, this is also true. So that's a recent result by Chordish and Li was again under the restriction emission between three and seven. Or if you Or if you assume spin, but any dimension, so that's a recent work by one and zone. So for the generos connected sound, this condition can be verified by using, so in Tran, Lio Shu Du, they're using compressible They're using compressible conditions to rule out plastic scalar curvature on such land volts. And then, so for us, we can use Grammov's lossing to rule out plastic scalar curvature metrics if you assume X is enlargeable or the A roofed genus of X is non-zero. Okay, so what do I mean by X is enlargeable? mean by x is enlargible. I don't want to give a precise definition, but one typical example is the torus. Taurus is enlargeable, okay? Or torus connected with a spin manifold that's also a manifold. Okay, so I'll So, our result covers the torus situation or a roof genesis non-zero that covers the situation, for example, when you have K3 surface. K3 surface has a roof genus non-zero. That's a topological invariant that can be computed explicitly. Expressly. All right. So in this torus, I would have thought that if X is a torus, that's good enough. But you have this additional assumption. Is that new to be needed or? No. The additional assumption, what I'm... Okay, so what I'm saying here, the additional assumption is satisfied if x is in 1. So, this, okay, in other words, yeah, I apologize if this is not explained too clearly. We have this additional assumption that this guy has no positive scalar curvature metric, and if x is indigible. Or the a roof generates of x is non-zero, then we could deduce that. So at least are the examples that maybe have like two. It's a great situation, but yeah. Yeah, I know, yeah. So this is a satisfying. Yeah, yeah. So this is satisfied, but does it this recovers my previous positive method? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Yeah. All right, so a couple of minutes to go into the proof. The proof. So, there are, as I meditated, that there are two approaches, and one is Shungyao and one is Witten. In my previous work, I used Witten's approach, and that's why I needed parallel spinner at infinity. But that restricts the geometry of X and has to be special hollow. Special hollow. And in this work, we use Jean-Yao's approach. And that means we make forward deformation. And then we also need to do some extra work to prove the rigidity is. All right, in Chonyal's approach, it's done sort of by a contradiction. It's done sort of by a contradiction argument. You assume you have a manifold which looks like Rk times x at infinity and non-negative scalar curvatures, but the mass is not zero. And then you try to deform it. And so the first thing you try to deform is to make the metric nice. Make the metric nice at infinity. Well, so by subtracting an even nicer metric, so that basically looks like a short shot. And well, it's a conformal metric to the product metric. And then And then the remaining pieces called Tuma. And so the first one, which is explicit, has all the mass, and the second one has zero mass. So that follows from an easy computation when you make forward information of the metric that the mass is quite nicely computed using the It using the asymptotic information of the conformal factor. Okay. And so what you need to do is to do something more drastic. You need to cut off the metric at infinity to make it like a product. Like a product, but it's conformal to a product, exactly conformal to the product. Okay? And then the trouble is that you cannot maintain positive scalar curvature that way. If you do this cutoff construction, the scalar curvature is going to be... The scalar curvature is going to be, it's no longer non-negative, it's no longer non-negative. So what you do is to make another conformal deformation by solving this conformal Laplace equation. So the effect of this is then your new metric is conformal flat. Okay, so sorry, your new metric is scalar flat. Your new metric is scanned flat. And then you can this conformal Laplace equation has good asymptotic behavior at infinity and with the coefficient determined by the scalar curvature and what you can so this is some lemma where you need to Some lemma where you need to solve this conformal deformation, conformal Laplace equation. But after that, you are still able to estimate how the mass changes. And so in particular, you can make sure that the new mass is still negative, and then you finally And then you finally modify the conformal factor so that it maintains superharmonic and it's constant at infinity. So that makes use of the mass being negative. So that's very crucial. And so what you then proven is that So you can uh make your metric non-negative scalar curvature, but the metric looks exactly like Euclidean metric at infinity. And then what you do is just box up the Euclidean pot. So just like cut off a large box and then do the opposite side. opposite side and and that's going to give you that's going to give you this compactification and connected some torus under and what you end up with is negative stellar metric on this guy and that's where the contradiction is yeah Yes. Yeah. Okay. So I'll stop here.
