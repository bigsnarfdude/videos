Professional development session. Today we're going to be talking about coaching. So, first, before we get into that, I just really want to thank all of you for being really good sports on this professional development stuff. I get it. When you signed up for this conference, this was not what you signed up for. So I really appreciate that you were, you know, you were willing to try it out, listen, play with some of the tools. And who knows, maybe you can use this in your day-to-day life. Maybe it will pop up. It pops up for me all the time. That we need all the time. So, you know, in our career, people tend to come to us asking, like, sharing a problem, asking for advice, asking for help. This happens often. And as the good-hearted, kind people that I've gotten to know all of you to be, our natural instinct is to want to help them. And part of that is giving them an answer, right? Giving them a solution. Giving them a solution. But one of the challenges with that is that sometimes the answer that you give them is not the answer that works for them. So for example, suppose I came to you and I said, I have all of these projects that I really need to do, but I have this long to-do list. I have all of these demands. I'm feeling really overwhelmed, really stressed, but I really need to finish these projects. What do you do? What do you do? What do you do? Like, what do you do in this situation? Right? So, one possible solution is you hear the deadlines and you say, well, you know what? Just keep pushing through. Like, just keep working hard, working hard. Once the deadlines are over, it's going to be freedom, right? And that sounds nice. That sounds well-intentioned. But maybe, like, I really am not getting enough sleep so that when I'm trying to work on those projects, like, I'm not at my peak state. Like, I'm not at my peak state. I'm not in my optimal vest, right? Then, another answer, maybe, because you've read, you maybe do personal development on your own, and you're like, you know what, I heard this concept of like self-care, you know, be kind to yourself, just take a break, like don't worry, work will always be there, just, you know, be super kind to yourself. And again, that sounds really, really nice and well-intentioned. But maybe, you know, telling me that, hey, just take a break, that might. Hey, just take a break that might cause even more stress for me because during the break, there's going to be even more things that pile on, and then I'm just going to be rattled and right, just upset. So, two very well-intentioned solutions, but they don't work for me. And this is, you're fine. So, this is kind of the difference or the key difference between consulting and coaching, where consulting is where you get, you are the person coming up with the answer, whereas coaching. With the answer. Whereas coaching, you are asking questions to help them find their answer that works for them. Now, I want to give two caveats here before we move on. When I say coaching, some people think I'm talking about therapy, right? And I am absolutely not talking about therapy. If you are, you know, if someone comes to you with a situation that you really do not have the capacity to handle, you are not a Capacity to handle, you are not a trained therapist, don't engage with it. I typically say, Wow, that sounds really tough! You know, thank you for sharing that information. There is this really great resource on campus that I'd really like you to go to. So it is not, we are, as far as I know, none of us here are trained therapists. I'm not asking you to be a therapist. Okay? Second thing, there is a contrast between consulting and coaching. And I'm not saying that you have to do one. Saying that you have to do one or the other, you can absolutely combine both. So, for example, someone comes to you with a problem. Some things that I do is I say, Well, you know, for me, I would do this, but I'm not sure if that's the right answer for you. Let's talk it out. So, there I'm giving my answer, but I'm also opening space to coach. Okay, so here are some techniques to start engaging with coaching. Start engaging with coaching. So, again, the main goal is the onus, the challenge is not on you. The goal is to help the individual find their own solution. What that means is you get to ask really, really good questions. The more advanced you get in coaching, the better you are asking questions, actually. So, this is, I'll share at the end how I think this also relates to research. How I think this also relates to research. But anyway, it's about asking questions. So, what do I mean by asking good questions? There are three, like, I believe three ways to think about this. I'm going to, as baby coaches that we all are, I'm going to encourage you all to ask what and how questions that do three things that help you understand that person's situation. Ask questions so that. Ask questions so that you can understand where they are coming from. Then ask questions that help expand the person's view of their situation. Maybe they are stuck over here thinking, oh, I'm super stressed, I'm overwhelmed, but your questions can help expand their viewpoint to see other ways, other possibilities with their situation. And then finally, ask questions that help them move into taking an action. Taking an action. Okay, I will put this up in just a minute again, but a couple ground rules with this coaching stuff. So, first, you want to avoid asking accusatory what and how questions. So, for example, what do you mean you don't understand? Right, that is a what question, but it comes off very accusatory. Now, I'm focusing on what and how questions. You can certainly ask why questions, but as baby coaches, Questions, but as baby coaches that we all are, as a baby coach, you have to be really good at asking questions because typically why questions can come off as accusatory. For example, why haven't you fixed your situation yet? Contrast that, why haven't you fixed your situation yet, to what do you think is in your way in fixing your situation? Just same question, but just asking it as a what comes off. Is it comes off better? I don't know why. Okay? And this is the main question. This is the main thing that I get myself tripped up on. You want to avoid asking leading questions. For example, have you considered walking to get into shape? That's a leading question because it has a solution embedded in it. You are asking the person, hey, here's the best one way to get in shape, just go walking. To get in shape, just go walking, right? But maybe when that person's asking you for advice, hey, you know, Brian, I want to get into shape. What do you do? Right? Or like, tell me some things. You know, maybe walking just isn't for me. Maybe it's more about, hey, I just want to, maybe the real challenge is I want to love my body exactly as it is. Or, hey, I want a different eating style. Right. And maybe not even about walking, like exercise at all. Right? So by asking, avoiding asking leading questions, you get to. Avoiding and asking leading questions, you get to learn about the person, right? So, we're going to play a game where you all are going to coach me, okay? And so you're going to get a chance to ask me what and how questions. And I'm going to coach you on your questions so that you know if you're asking a leading question, I will coach you and guide you: like, hey, how can you make it not a leading question? And we'll see where we go, okay? Um. Okay, so here's the situation. This is not really me, but close enough to me that I can really get into character here. So imagine I'm a clinician, I'm a first-generation student, and to advance in my career, I'm evaluated on two things: my clinic productivity and my research productivity. And I work a lot of hours helping patients right now. Patients right now. But I come to you because I really want to be director of this clinic. That's like really my goal here. But I need at least 25 research papers to even be eligible for this director role. And right now, I only have 12 papers because I'm working a lot of hours here, right? So I'm coming to you and I'm saying, I don't know what to do. I really want to be a director here. I don't know what to do. How can I get to 25 people? Know what to do? How can I get to 25 acres to be there? So, I want you to ask me what and how questions to coach me on this situation. Where, again, oops, I'm encouraging you to start by asking me what and how questions to help you understand my situation first. Maybe we'll get to helping expand my view on this issue. And I don't know, we'll see how far we can get. I don't know. We'll see how far we can get. Will you move me into action? So, first, start here. So, I, yeah, ask me a what and how question to help to coach me. Yes, go ahead, Lila. What is it about being a director that is attractive to you? Great question. Yeah, I just, you know, I just see that there's a lot. Oh, sorry, one thing. And then, here, if you want to up-level, I don't, this might be too hard. You can, yesterday we talked about. Yesterday we talked about listening. So you might want to, if you want, you can try to listen for any emotions or values, but that might be too hard at this stage. Great question, Layla. So, you know, I just see that there's, I just don't like the way that the clinic is run right now. I think that, you know, my clinician colleagues, they could learn a lot more and they're not getting that training right now. And I have ideas for how to get them that training. And if I was in the director role, I could make that. In the director role, I can make that a reality. Yes. What resources have you needed and not had to complete more papers? Very good question. Right. Yeah. So, gosh, that's a good question. So, I don't know if it's really about the resources. Like, I mean, we're at this top-notch place, UNC. So, I have, I mean, there's a lot of research opportunities coming my way. Research opportunities coming my way. It's just that right now I feel like you know, I just really care about my patients too, and I don't want to leave them behind. Like, if I, every time I start writing a paper, I feel like it's a trade-off between either helping my patients or writing a research paper, which I don't even know if it's going to make an impact. I don't even understand why it has to be 25. Why can't I just go at 12? What, why? Yes, sir. How does your love learn? Load nominally distributed between paper writing and patients and property? Yeah, good question. So how is my workload distributed? Yeah, so right now I would say I spend, so like if total time was 100%, I'd say I spend like 70% of my time with patients and, you know, because it's just really hard for me. You know, because it's just really hard for me to find time to do these papers. So I honestly, I just spend 10%. The rest of the time, I'm just trying to sleep. So, yeah, it's really hard. You're allocates patients to additional patients? That's a great question. Actually, that's a really good question. So, actually, it's the director. I'm a really good clinician, so people, they keep giving me patients. Actually, now you're making me realize maybe. Now you're making me realize maybe yeah, the director, maybe I need to talk to the director about this because they're just keeping giving me too much work. Yes, Lupe. Could you engage with another of your colleagues to help you and maybe to share these papers that you have? Okay, great question, Lupe, but you're having a solution in there. Like I like, I need some. How can you rephrase that without a solution? Still giving a solution. Try to phrase it maybe as a what and a how. Okay. Who do you work with? Okay. It's still, I might not get to what she's getting at, but I'll answer it anyway. Yeah, I have, so in my field, we have like 30 other clinicians, but I mean, we're UNC, like we're like the best of the best, so we get Like the best of the best, so we get lots of patients coming. Yes, I have a question. Another question: Is it still a leading version of Luke Bay's question if I say, Do you have to write these papers alone? Yes, yes, because you're implying that I, like, you're giving me an answer of, like, hey, maybe I just need to start working with other people. Oh, but what about like, what are the requirements in terms of number of authors in the papers? Number of authors in the papers. That's it. Okay. That's it. So that's it. So she's not yeah. So yeah. Do do you see like there's a difference, a key difference here? Yes, Mary Claire. Is there anyone else in your role who is publishing that? Ooh, good question. Yes, and it's not leading. Yeah, yeah, but you know, I see them and I'm just so much better than them. I'm just so much better than them. Like, I mean, they're, I mean, like, David, like, I really care about my patients, and these other people, they just, they just go through their patients like, like, they don't really care. They just rush through them. And, I mean, maybe that's really, maybe that's what I need to do. I don't, like, they just rush through them and just power through and to get to their papers. And I don't do that. So I don't know. That's effort yet. In terms of your trading position, the clinical work. Ah, okay. Good question. What is the best, well, for my field, I mean, my field really, that's a good question. It's a really good question. Well, wow, that's a good question. I would say, so for my I would say, so for my field, you know, as like the hospital that we work at, we really actually, the news is about helping the patients. But it doesn't make sense to me why, but for some reason to be director, I need to give these papers. So my field appreciates helping the patients, but based on this requirement from my department, my unit, it's about the papers. The papers, so they're making me think: is there a conflict between my department values and my field values? That's a good one. I don't know. It's a good question. I saw others get Molin, yes. I think my question really relates to the previous question. So, do you really enjoy doing this? Or do you want to publish people or economies? So, can you rephrase that in a way? In a way, because you're kind of, it's a slight hint. You're kind of saying, like, I'm not sure if I'm, like, you're not hearing if I'm really enjoying what I'm doing or not. How can you rephrase it without giving that implication? So, what's, yeah, I know that I know you want to become a director, so is that a reason? I don't know. So maybe we can say, maybe another way, or actually, can someone help her out? Why don't you say, like, what about your job brings you joy? Yes. What about your job brings you joy? Research or patience. Right, but leave that part up. So, what about your job brings you joy? Right. So, another thing, I don't know if this helps, but it's kind of like But it's kind of like you want to ask questions that you generally don't know the answer to. So maybe you're hearing that I'm not really having fun, right? So you're kind of like leading me into that, but you don't really, so you think you have an answer. But if you ask, what do you enjoy? That you really don't know what the answer to that is. Do you see the subtlety? It's hard. It's really hard. Do you want me to answer? What do I enjoy? What about your job? Or, what about your job brings you joy? Oh, what about my job brings me joy? Yeah, I just, the patience, like, they just make me so happy. Like, I like, I love working with them. I love helping them. And I just think that as a director, I could help them more because I have ideas for how to make other clinicians better and can help even more patients. So, you mentioned that update. So you mentioned that a big part of why you're motivated to become a director is to help other directors. What other avenues do you think you could explore by those training opportunities without being a director? Cut out the last part. What other opportunities, what other avenues could you explore to give opportunities to your colleagues? That's a good question. Question. I haven't thought about that. Well, so I really like this thing, like professional development stuff. And I never, I haven't even talked to my clinician colleagues about doing that. So yeah, I could try teaching them, and then maybe they could pass that on to others. That on to others. But it still makes me mad. I had to get 25 papers, I'm not even close. I don't, yeah, I don't know if that would really compensate, Jean. What opportunities are available in your institution that provides you some protected time to publish papers? Okay, so can you rephrase that? You're giving me a solution that I need protected time to do my work. Can you rephrase it? Work. Can you rephrase it without that leading part? What opportunities are out there? Okay. Yeah, so yeah, that could work. Another way to phrase it is what resources exist at your institute to help clinicians. To help clinicians or to help people at your level. Because actually, I'm thinking, even the productivity, maybe it's not an issue of productivity. Do you guys, I know it's really small, but do you guys hear the differences in the question? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Do you want me to answer that question? Sure. Okay, and then we'll get to others. You know, okay, what other resources are there? Well, I mean, it's UNC, so we have a ton of stuff. You know, one thing I haven't done, actually, because I've been complaining about this issue for a long time, but I've never talked to, actually, I've never even talked to any of the senior leaders in my unit. Any of the senior leaders in my unit. I don't even know how they got their 25 papers with all these demands. I don't even know what they did. So you're making me think, you know, I just keep complaining to my friends about it, but maybe I could talk to them and see ways to help. Like, maybe figure out what they did. Maybe I could do something similar. I don't know. That's a good point. I never really considered that UNC has resources to help me do this work. Resources to help me do this work. I just saw some other questions. Yes, and then that's probably related to the question I was about to ask. So, how the current director balance time with seeing patients with writing research? Good, okay. And I would direct. Right, so sorry, I cut you off one more time. How is the How is the current director balance the effort to be seen data? Very good. Yeah, so I like this one. This was not a leading question because it's not giving me an answer. It's like having me think about other people. Yeah, that's a really good point. I don't know, actually. I never talked to the director about this. I don't know how they got there. Because they're a really nice person. I mean, they're a really nice person, and I like them a lot, so maybe I mean, I don't know if what they did would work for me, but at least I could see what they did, and maybe that could help me, actually. Yeah. Baruch, I think you had a question. Can you imagine the situation where you can't do that? Okay, that has a solution embedded in it, and that it has it's implying that like research is the glory thing. So how can you rephrase that? Going for the expand view? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So how, yeah. Which is good. I see you guys all doing that, which is awesome. It's hard. It's hard, you guys. Imagine uh research that would lead to some event. Yeah, I think I'm gonna give you one possibility. This is not, you know, not, I don't know everything. You know, maybe one way to say it is what type of joy does research bring you? You know, so that's kind of. You know, so that's kind of like making me see: like, is research joyful or not? Kind of thing. Or maybe even, how do you feel? How does research make you feel? And that's even better. So it's not assuming whether it's joy or not. Like what I was going for, Peter Brock. No, that's right. What I was going for is I can kind of understand your situation now. Yeah. I kind of understand your situation now. Like, you love working with patients, you really, really want to help. Right. You really love your clinical work, but you have to get this done. Right, so like the expand view, I was trying to, I was, what was I trying to, I was trying to say, rather than, like, like, can you, could it, I was trying to expand your view in the sense that, oh, maybe my research could have an impact. My research could have an impact on the very patients who are trying to help in a way that my clinical work couldn't have been. Yes, I like that. I can't, because I can't find the question. Yeah, that's a great question. Yeah, actually, does anyone have ideas for how we could have asked that? I have a question, though. Does Rinbad have a solution embedded? It does, it does. It does. He's trying to get me on board with like, just do the papers and look how much more you can do. I get it, but it's out of kindness, right? But it's out of kindness, right? Like, yeah. But, but, and, and me, I'll have an ideas after, but I just want really want to help Farouk try to ask that question. Does anyone have an idea of how to ask that? Brian, and then for what research do you find fulfilling? Yeah, yeah, or yeah, or what about research? Yeah, what about a yeah, yeah, that could work. That could work. Yes. Yes. That's nice. I like that even better. And I'm wondering if that didn't also have the opportunity for one finding meaning in it and if not moving one towards the other in a way that kind of streamed one. Right. I was, yeah. This is great. This is really great. I get like, yes, go ahead. Please. What does your daily schedule look like? That's great. That's a great question. That's great. That's a great question, right? So, yes. And I know we only have five minutes up, but so I did want to wrap. This was wonderful. You guys did great. I hope you can see. It's hard to ask these kind of open-ended questions, right? When you have, like, this situation, I'm sure, comes up when you're like, come on, just power through. Just, you know, PhD students, right? Have to get those three papers to book, like, graduate. Come on, just do it. What's the big deal? Yes, sir, we mumble. Deal, yes, sir. Sure, yes, yes, yes, definitely. I like that. I like that. Um, so a couple final like wrap-up remarks. Um, this stuff is hard, okay? Um, and I think just yeah, a couple points. One is, um, yeah, we all have our biases in terms of like what we think is better or not. Like, I think, uh, I think last night we had discussions about like the department had. Discussions about like the department head role. Like, some people are like, I would never want to do that. Maybe some are like, sign me up, I want to do that, right? We all have our biases, but it's really about asking questions to figure out what does the person really want to do, kind of putting your biases aside, right? Even for PhD students, like, don't you want a PhD? Just do the damn work, right? Like, all of this stuff, right? And then, secondly, another point I wanted to make. Point I wanted to make. Yeah, and with this particular situation, you know, maybe your questions could have helped. I really liked your questions to make me think about talking to senior people because I hadn't thought about them. But another point is like maybe by answering these questions, I could have realized, hey, director is really not what I really want. I just want to help people, and that's exactly what I'm doing already. So do I really need the director role to keep to do that? Right? That could have been. To do that, right? That could have been another option. Kind of like, I don't want to leave the PhD students out, like, do I really need a PhD to do the work I want to do? You know, like, I know that's like big life questions, but this counts for many different things, right? So I wanted to end, like, these questions, in my view, maybe you see this as well. This is actually very similar to also how we can approach research. Research in the sense as the following: understanding the problem as is, right? Asking questions to really get a depth of where does the problem sit? What is going on in the field with that problem? Second, expanding your view of the problem. You are like, maybe some of us, I don't know, like I'm like semi-parametric all the way, right? Like, I'm like focused. Right, like I'm like focused on semi-parametric, that's the only way to do it. But by asking questions, can I expand my view to consider maybe Bayesian approaches? Right? So expanding my view to see other possible solutions. And then asking those questions to finally move into action, right? How can I tackle research in another way? I really, I used to, the Deepak Shopra, he has a really great He has a really great quote that I just constantly say to myself, you know, I think the quote is, I'm butchering this right now, but like, every problem is an opportunity in disguise, right? And it's about expanding your vision to see those opportunities. So that can apply for research all the time. Like when I'm stuck on a research problem, I know it's because I'm just like so narrowed focus, but can I expand my view to see other solutions? In my view, to see other solutions. All right, that's it. Thank you, everyone, for doing all of this. I really appreciate just your participation and something that you didn't sign up for. Thank you. All right. And we'll come back in 10 minutes for our next talk.
