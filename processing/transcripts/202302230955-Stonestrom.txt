It's been an amazing experience so far. So thank you for the opportunity to be here. Okay, so I'm going to be talking about Skolem arithmetic, which is this theory just of the natural numbers with multiplication. So let me fix a bit of notation at this start. So throughout the whole talk, T will always denote this theory. Blackboard M will be a monster model. Blackboard P will be the primes of the monster model. And radical M will be the set of square free elements. Radical m will be the set of square free elements. So maybe I'll start with a few remarks about this theory. So, from a neostability perspective, it's very untame. So, it has DP2, has SOP, not hard to check those things. As Jimhan showed us the other day, it has ATP. Somehow it lies on the bad side of all of these dividing lines. And it's also, I mean, if you play around with the theory a bit, you also find out quickly that forking and dividing behave very poorly. Dividing behave very poorly. So I actually started this project trying to understand how forking and dividing behave in this theory. And there are still a lot of very basic questions I don't know the answer to. So for example, I think this is an interesting question. Just forking, equal dividing over models. Is there any example? Is there any example where forking defaults from dividing any examples? Yes, absolutely. So you can have types that fork over their own domains. You can have types that fork over their own domains. So when you say forking, you put dividing. Over models. In the sense of types. In the sense of types. So for formulas, it's not good? I actually don't know. I don't know. So either for types. For types or formulas. Or formulas. I don't know. So, as I said, a lot of very basic questions that I don't know the answer to. So, in general, kind of the point of this is that from a neostability perspective, T is very poorly behaved. But, in other respects, it's a very tractable theory. So, you can get some understanding of the definable sets at least. So, in my view, that makes it a good test case to see how stability. To see how stability-theoretic notions behave on the bad side of all of our good dividing lines. And so that's really the motivation for this project. And with that in mind, I'll state the two results that I want to talk about. So theorem. Okay, so first is a classification of the zero-definable stably embedded sets of the theory. So if you have So if you have, suppose that D is the zero-definable set, then D is stably embedded if and only if its definable closure is one of One of, well, okay, either it's trivial, so there are two trivial cases. So this is just the definable closure of the empty set. Obviously, this is the whole structure. And then the one non-trivial case is that it has the same definable closure as the set of square-free elements. So why am I considering just definable closures here? It's not hard to see that if you have two zero-definable sets and they have the same definable closure, And they have the same definable closure, then one of them is stably embedded if and only if the other is. So if you're trying to understand at least the zero definable stably embedded sets, it really only makes sense to look modulo this relation of having the same definable closure. And then the content of the theorem is that modulo that relation, there's only one non-trivial stably embedded set, which is the set of squared three elements. So that's the first theorem. And the second theorem is just T has weak eliminated. Weak elimination of imaginaries. Okay, so again, it's not hard to see that it doesn't have full elimination of imaginaries, but at least it has weak elimination of imaginaries. And so for the rest of the talk, I want to talk at least about the proof of one. I don't think I'll have time to talk about the proof of two, but I want to give some flavor of how some of this machinery kind of works in this, you know, very, very poorly behaved context. Okay, so that's. So that's the structure of the talk. Could you say one word or a couple of words about the proof of two? I mean, proof of two. If there's time, absolutely. But you're not going to be using canonical basis, I guess. No, no. Ah, okay. So, okay, the very general shape is start with a set of n-tuples definable with parameters and find some finite tuple over it, which is definable, that has finite orbit under the automorphisms fixing the seven. Under the automorphisms fixing the setwise. So I mean, I do it directly by hand. Like I do it by hand. And if I have time, I can say what the shape of that tuple will look like. But there's a very, very explicit description. Basically, okay, in the case of one tuples, it looks like the greatest common divisor of the set, and then maybe a finite couple of square foot elements. That's it. That's what the almost canonical parameters are saying. Okay. I will add a question. Okay. Hello, Adikas. Hello. Hi, Anna. Just can you remind us about the QE industries? Okay, the QE is, there's a kind of Pfefferman-Woth type QE. It's technical and I don't want to get into details. But basically what it looks like is, okay, so let me put a bit of notation up and then I'll be able to give some answer to your question. Be able to give some answer to your question. But it's a sort of Pfefferman thought type thing. Okay, so let me just put a tiny bit more notation. Okay, so suppose you have a prime p. I'm going to use p to the infinity to denote all the powers of p. Powers of p, by which I mean just things whose only prime factor is p. And then also corresponding. And then also corresponding to P, we have a p-adic valuation map. Okay, so right, and this will take an element of the structure to the highest power of p dividing it. What can be affinity? Uh no, no. Okay, so I should this is powers of p in the monster model. Okay. This is powers of p in the monster model, by the way. So, this thing as a monoid in its own right is a non-standard model of Pressberger arithmetic. Because if you were to look in the standard model, you would just get Pressberger arithmetic. Press market is definable for. Yes, uniformly definable in P, as are these p-adic valuation maps. But then the point is that the valuation maps, they're not taking their values in the standard natural numbers, they're taking them in this non-standard. Natural numbers, they're taking them in this non-standard model of pressure arithmetic. Is that okay? Okay, and so on. And the answer to your question is basically that you can reduce all questions about the type of a tuple to questions about its type over the various primes. And you need some kind of way of counting how many primes a certain formula of Pressburg arithmetic is true of. I can tell you in more detail. I can tell you in more detail. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So that's the last bit of notation that I wanted to go through. Great. Wait, so when you say primes, meet primes in the most important stress settings. Correct. Correct. This is all, these are all, I mean, you should think of these all as definable sets, not as primes of monster model. Same with this, square free elements of monster model. Sorry if that wasn't clear. Yeah. Okay. Okay, great. All right. So now let me try to give what I think are kind of some of the key key lemmas behind the proofs of the two theorems. So first, just a very easy fact. Suppose you have, let's just say one tuffles, a definable set. Then D has Divisibility minimal elements. This follows almost immediately just from the fact that the standard model is well ordered. And of course, the visibility minimal, the visibility is a partial order on the whole structure, so it makes sense what I mean by divisibility minimal. Alright, so this very easy fact. And now I can state really two key lemmas. Okay, so the first is something that gives you some understanding of the shape of what these minimal elements look like. So suppose now D is definable, again, just of one tuples for convenience, but it's definable over some concrete finite tuple C. And I should say, sorry, non-empty here, obviously. Here, obviously. Okay. So suppose you have a non-empty C-definable set and that you have a particular divisibility minimal element in it. And we want to conclude something about the relationship of D and C, what we get is that the p-adic valuation of D lies right here. The p-iadic valuation of D Of P lies in the definable closure of the p-adic valuation of C. Maybe you have to add P just in case P doesn't divide anything in C for all primes. So there's no hope that D itself might be definable over C or even algebra A. You can't get that, but you can get it locally. So in every one of these models of Pressburg arithmetic, Of these models of Pressburg arithmetic, after you apply the p-adic valuation, these things are definable. And maybe just to make one remark now, so I don't have to make it later, this definable closure, I mean it in the sense of Skolem arithmetic, in the sense of the Monster model, but you can also think about it as being the definable closure just in this model of Pressburg arithmetic, and you can prove that these are the same thing. Sorry? One of the pieces. By Pressburg arithmetic, I mean omega with addition. I mean, it's by interpretable. Okay. So I guess normally one means this, right? But these things are bi-interpretable. So we do get this kind of local definability. So it tells you locally the minimal elements have to be completely specified. Elements have to be completely specified by C itself. And DCL is entertaining. Either one. You have to prove this, but it turns out to be the same both ways. But I mean, later I'll want to think of it in Pressburg arithmetic, so maybe think of it that way. But you can prove that as long as you have the parameter for the prime, it's the same as if you were to compute it in the whole monster model. So that's the first of these lemmas. Sorry, was there. Sorry, was there. Ah. And then the second. So this is not too useful. This one is not too useful on its own, but it becomes much more useful in conjunction with the following. So suppose we have two tuples A and C, and I'll give a criterion for when A is almost in the definable closure of C. So suppose A and C have that That the p-adic valuation of A lies in the definable closure of the p-iadic valuation of C for every time P. Then the conclusion, again, in general, there's no hope of concluding that A is actually definable over C, but you can conclude that modulo may be some square free elements. So then A lies in the definable closure. In the definable closure of the tuple C and the square free elements. So it's a kind of local global principle, which says that if you're willing to name as many square free elements as you need, then to check that a tuple A lies in the definable closure of another tuple C, it just suffices to check it locally in all of these models of Pritzberger as mentioned. And so the two of these things together wind up being very useful. So I want to give a sample. So, I want to give a sample application of this. And I actually would say that these two lemmas are somehow used critically in both of these theorems. So, today I'll talk about how they're used in one. So, sample application, we knew that the little distribution minimal element is definable of all the parameters. Is it a question? Are the parameters definable? If we know the division minimal element, do we know the set itself? No. Do we know the send itself? No, they're already menu, probably. Yes, yes. These are minimal, not minimum. Right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So sample application on cofinal subs. So lamma, suppose D, again, just of one tuples for convenience, is zero-definable. Is zero-definable and cofinal with respect to divisibility. Then the conclusion is that the definable closure of D is the whole model proof. So this proof has two steps, and I won't really talk about the first. So the first step is to show that just To show that just all the square free elements are definable over d. And this is really, this is not hard to do just by hand. So you need to know about quantifier elimination in the structure, but then you could just play around with automorphisms and get this directly. This is very easy to check directly. But don't want to talk about it in detail. Okay, so that's step one. And now step two, you can show what you want. So fix some little sequences. Some little C. And consider the following set, which will be all the little D in big D that divide C. This is a non-empty set by the hypothesis that D is cofinal, right? So it has a minimal element. Call it little E. Call it little E. But this is also a C-definable set. Wait, right? C or C device C? I'm so sorry, you're absolutely right. C device E. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. Sorry. Yeah. So this is also a C definable set, right? We're looking at a minimal element of a C definable set. We're in a position to think about our lemma. So the conclusion is that for every prime p, the p-adic valuation of p lies in the definable closure. Of B lies in the definable closure of the p-adic valuation of C from. Okay, and now this is why I wanted to talk about the fact that this is just DCL and Pressburg arithmetic. In particular, this means we have access to exchange in Pressburg arithmetic. So it's a fact that Pressburg arithmetic has the exchange property for DCL. So by exchange for Pressburger, Pressburger, we can swap these two things. So p-adic valuation of C lies in the definable closure of the p-adic valuation of D for every B. Okay, and so now we're in a position to apply the second lemma, right? We have something all of whose p-adic valuations lie in the definable closure of the corresponding p-adic valuations of D. Of the corresponding p-adic valuations of D. So now by our second lemma, so C lies in the definable closure of D, maybe with some square-free elements. But now we're done because I told you in step one, we know that all the square-free elements are definable over D. So C itself lies on the definable closure order. Sorry. What about D? D? D doesn't matter. D doesn't matter. It I mean it's it's just one of the parameters that we use to define C. Yes, the primes are also definable. Yes, absolutely. So I mean that's even stronger. What do you mean? If you want it to be cofinal, meaning. Yeah, so the primes are not cofinal. Not in our saturated model. Of course not. Yeah, yeah. But from the time when you can define them, that means that you are looking now at definables. Now, a definable subset of N plus, right? It's complaining one. Yes. So they're either everything or I'm not. No, no. I mean, you can have 2n, for example. I think maybe I'm not understanding your question. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yes, absolutely, yes, yes. Absolutely, yes, yes. So, but I, okay, I'm not sure I'm understanding your question. Maybe, maybe we can talk about it after, if that's okay. So, it's not sufficient to just have the primes here. Because if you look at the primes, the Primes, the primes, the definable closure of the primes is not. Because you should continue your talk. Okay, we don't have much time to add. Okay, no problem. Yeah, okay. What time do I have? 25. 25. Okay, great. Okay, we can talk about it after. Okay, so this shows that the finable closure of a zero-definable co-final set is the whole structure. All right. And so now actually, those are all the ingredients that I wanted to talk about, the proof of theorem one. The proof of theorem one. Okay, maybe I'll talk about the proof idea of one. Okay, so proof idea of one. Okay, so uh for the background. Okay, so for the backwards direction, so assume we have a zero-definable set, and suppose its definable closure is one of these things. For the backwards direction, it just suffices to show that the square-free elements are stably embedded. Right, as I said at the beginning, if you're zero-definable and you have the same definable closure as a zero-definable stably embedded set, Is a zero-definable stably embedded set, then you're also stably embedded. And these are both trivially stably embedded, so it would just suffice to show that this is. But I actually don't want to talk about the proof of this. So this is quite technical. You need to code certain sets of primes by square-free elements, and you also need a good understanding of this kind of Pfefferman-Thot-type QE that I've mentioned. So I don't want to talk about the proof of this direction. Instead, I'll talk about the proof of the fourth. Instead, I'll talk about the group of the forwards direction, which again has two steps. So fix our zero-definable set D, and suppose it's stably embedded. So, and suppose also, let's suppose that it's not a subset of this. So its definable closure is not in this first case. So one. Suppose D is not a subset just of this, but that it's stably embedded. Stably embedded. And now we want to show that its definable closure contains all the square free elements. So assume for contradiction that you have some square free element R which is not definable over E. So now we consider the following definable set. Look at all of the Look at all of the elements of d, all of whose prime factors divide r. So all the little d, such that for every prime p, I should say, every prime p, if p divides d, then d also divides r. And now And now, what you have to show, okay, it needs a proof, but the idea is you show that this is not d definable. And I can't talk about the proof of this in detail, but hopefully it's believable that if this set were definable with parameters from D, then you should also be able to define this square-free element. You show this again, basically using this QE that we have. And so now this is a contradiction. And so now this is a contradiction to the assumption that D is stably embedded, because we have an externally definable subset of D, which is not definable with parameters from P. So this is a contradiction, and so the conclusion is that the definable closure of D has to contain all the square free elements. So all the square free elements are contained in the definable closure of D. So why is it possible to empty? No, that's right. Why is it not empty? Okay, so what you can show is that if you have something in D, then there has to be something in D with finitely many prime factors. Okay? This is a zero-definable set. So in particular, D intersect N is non-empty. You see? Is that okay? So there's something in D with finitely many prime factors. Now there's a square free element, which is just the problem. Free element, which is just the product of. Ah, no. And so, so. So, okay, there's something more you have to show. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay, so there's something in D with finitely many prime factors. Moreover, you can also show that if you have a zero definable set D, you can show that the primes are contained in the definable closure of D. So this element R has to have infinitely many prime factors. And then you move things around by automorphisms to show that you can assume that. You can assume that the prime factors of something in D divide the prime factors of that R. Is that okay? So R has to have infinitely many prime factors. Is that all right? No, because we're all moving around yet. So R has to have infinitely many prime factors. Meanwhile, there's something in D with finitely many prime factors. And now you can move the prime factors of that so that they're all factors of R. Is that okay? Okay, great. Okay, great. So that's step one, and now step two. I'm going to leave this here. So now step two. Okay, so we've shown that if you're not contained in this first set, then you do contain this set. And now we'll show that if it's a proper containment, then you're actually the whole thing. So again, very vague sketch, but here's the idea. So So uh suppose that little d is not in the definable closure of the square free elements. And then you show that little d isn't big d, yeah. Yeah, so little d, I mean, d is maybe a set of n tuples. Little d is one of the components of one of those n t tuples. Little d is one of the components of one of those entrals. So sorry? I'm not doing the case n equals one, but you're doing the DCL V. Yeah, I mean this L V. Doesn't matter. Yeah. Yeah. So now we show that the automorphism orbit of this little B is cofinal. And again, this is actually really not. And again, this is actually really not too hard to check once you have the kind of quantifier elimination I've been mentioning. You just play with automorphisms and things work out. So the orbit of D is cofinal. So D is cofinal. Cofinal? With respect to divisibility. Yeah. All with respect to divisibility. And so now by this lemma, it's definable closure, it's the whole structure. Structure. So the definable closure of D is of the structure. And then you're done. Excellent. So that's really kind of the idea of the proof of one. So seven residents is only used in this problem. Absolutely. That's absolutely right. If you're any zero definable set that is not contained in the definable closure of the radical of M, then you're co-final and so also you're definitely. Then you're cofinal, and so also your definable closure is the whole thing. So, yes, so now I can come back to maybe the questions you were asking. So, you're trying to prove the reverse direction of one, right? Yes, yeah. What about take just uh to be d, means you you are just the set of powers of a net for H5. You are stably embedded in that case. Are stably embedded in that case? Yes, that's right. But you're not zero-definable. No, yes? Oh, you mean the set of powers. No, you're not stably embedded in that case. Because of this. Because of this? Yeah. So let R be a square free element with infinitely many prime factors. Yes, but then, okay, so nothing. Then, okay, so let me, let me, this is a good example. I'll do this in detail. Okay. Okay. So D is the set of powers of a prime. So anything that's the power of one prime. Let R be square free. Any prime. Yes, of any prime. Of any prime. R is square free with infinitely many prime factors. Prime factors. Now, this set that I define here is the set of all powers of a prime dividing. And you can't define this. I mean, if you have a finite couple from D, you're only going to have finitely many. D, you're only going to have finitely many prime factors represented. No, no, no worries. No, this is a very good example, so I'm happy to bring it up. So, yeah, this is an example of something that's zero-definable and falls into this first case. So, it's not stably embedded, basically, because, I mean, things are not somehow wide enough. You don't have enough prime factors of the elements of D to define this set. So, actually, that was all I wanted to say. All I wanted to say about the proof of one. So I think I have five minutes, so I don't know. Oh, no, I don't. I'm sorry. 1025. Okay, so that was all I wanted to say. So thank you very much. Any questions? You have an example of finance. Yes, absolutely. So let's take your four favorite. But take your four favorite distinct primes, PQ, R and S. This thing has no canonical parameter. Basically, what you can show is that if you had some topple over which, you know, there was a canonical parameter for this, then its p-adic valuation, q-addic valuation, r-addec valuation, s at a valuation would all have to be the same, like, height somehow. But then any set definable over that thing would also have to contain q. Over that thing would also have to contain QR, PS, all the odds. Is that okay? I should say, so any definable set of primes will have a canonical parameter. And you can actually choose that canonical parameter to be a square-free element. So you can't get a counterexample by looking at a finite set of primes. You could just take the product of the primes. So this is somehow the next best bit. So, how much of this analysis of stable embeddedness would work for more general Pheprom and bot products? So, this is a big question that I have actually, and something that maybe I might want to work on in the future. So, I mean, in Tom's question, we're in a kind of general Pfrom and Bot situation, right? Because the standard model is just the direct sum of countably many copies of Pressburg arithmetic. And some of the, I mean, the question is basically. Some of the, I mean, the question is basically how much can you reduce the proof here to understanding Pressburger arithmetic and then just using general facts, general Pfefferman-Vot type facts. And I'm actually not sure that's something I hope to think about more in the future. And as a follow-up, this question you asked about forking equals dividing, does that just come from the Berlin algebra? What do you mean? I mean, that the issue that forking is not dividing is because you have this interpretation. Oh, yes. Is because you have this interpretation. Oh, yes, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. So, I mean, it's exactly the same as, I guess, your example or whoever's example. Yeah, yeah. Because, I mean, if you look at a single square free element with infinitely many, so if you let R square free with infinitely many prime factors, And then you look at all the things dividing R. This gives you a family of subsets of R that's closed under complementation. I'm sorry, a family of subsets of the prime factors of R closed under complementation. And then you just do exactly the same argument. But it doesn't actually, that argument doesn't work if you want to show that this forks. But this works over there. Over there, this one. Sorry? Yes, absolutely, yes. Sorry? Yes, absolutely. Yeah, so over the empty set, that argument doesn't work. But this gives you an example of a type with parameters from R that forks over R. But for the empty set, that argument doesn't work because there's no way, there's nothing in here divisible by all the primes. Does that make sense? You want to sort it. But you can do it, but something default. Yeah, so this is another lingering question I have. So, I mean, a very basic thing: all of the models of Pressburg arithmetic, these are stably embedded. More generally than that, I don't know how good of a classification you can get, because somehow, well, at least I couldn't see a clean way of getting a classification of these things. But I mean, a very basic example, the models of Pressburg arithmetic, those are all state-based. Those are all state data. That's it. Yeah. I forgot. Is this example straightly maximal? Yes, it is. Which, I only learned about this notion a few days ago. What is it? I, okay. Straight maximality. I hadn't heard of this notion either, but... It is. Oh! Okay, so it's some. So Shella, in one of these more philosophical papers he has, he defines this notion, which basically... Defines this notion, which basically is meant to generalize kind of most of the dividing lines that we have. You have a binary formula, and you have certain patterns of either positive instances of it or negative instances of it that you want to be able to realize. And straight maximality says you can realize all such patterns. So, I mean, thank you to Alex for explaining this notion to me. So, like, these. These I mean, these are all examples of straight maximality implies all of these things, for example. So it's somehow very badly behaved. But this example is straightening maximum. Okay, so let's add a kiss again. We have to take and we resume at eleven. Uh Ula? Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, I'm gonna be
