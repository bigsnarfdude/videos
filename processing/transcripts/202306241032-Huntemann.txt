Thank you for inviting me. So it's a bit of an interesting week for me. Many have heard I am actually moving on Tuesday. So it's been a bit of a week kind of getting here and at the same time acting. Alright, so values, temperatures, enumeration of placement games. Very nicely, Martin actually already told you a lot of what my introductory stuff would be, but because a few people showed up after Martin's talk, I'll still go through it. Talk, I'll still go through it. And we had just done coffee break, so everybody's digesting food. I'll give you guys all the reminder of what these things are. Okay, so combinatorial game for me means a two-player perfect information no-chance game. Some examples, chess of course, checkers is the English word for it. Let me think for a moment. Go, hex, we've seen just. Hex, we've seen just in the last talk, and NIM, the piles of tokens, these are pretty well-known ones. For our purposes, so the two players are called left and right. So with left, as Martin said, is assigned positive, right is assigned negative. Instead of white and black, I usually use blue and red. And so we'll have that left has blue, right has red, and so you can kind of remember. And so you can kind of remember red, right, and blue has the L in it for left. So that way. And then we also have the convention that we use female pronouns for left and male pronouns for right. And of course we have quite a few people here from Calgary. I'll actually tell you guys why this is the convention. This is for Richard and Louise guy. So Richard, right, male, Louise, female, left. So that's why female left left left left left That's why female is left and right is male. Okay, so these are the sorts of games that we're looking at. Now, I'm going to be talking mostly about placement games. Those are essentially my specialty. A bit of history, so to give you a bit of a scale idea, so NIM was solved in 1902 by Putin. That's really the first proper combinator in theory paper. Theory paper. Based on this, Sprake-Grandi theory came around in the 1930s. So, Sprake and Grandi basically say that if what we call an impartial game, so where there is really no differentiation between the two players, they both have the same options, you always get that every one of these games is equivalent to some NIM game. And so, that Sprague and Granny proved this independently in the 1930s. So, that is kind of in very So that has kind of advanced things quite a lot. And then Burlekham, Conway, and Guy together discovered the algebraic structure of combinatorial games in the 1970s. And this is really what started modern combinatorial game theory. And there's been kind of since then waves up and down with how much activity there's been. There's definitely been explosions in topics lately. Now, common natural games here. Now, combinatorial game theory, and this is going to be a bit of my focus of the talk. I'm basically trying to convince people why you should be interested in combinatorial game theory. So, I'm going to talk about some of the problems I look at and the connections to other areas. Of course, there is loads of connections to combinatorics. There's lots of graph theory, design theory. I will talk about enumeration later. All kinds of areas from combinatorics that are connected to combinatorics. That are connected to combat world games. There's the number theory connections. As Martin mentioned, you have all of these, you have all numbers that show up. And then we have these other things that are not numbers. But the combinatorial games basically embed into Conway's surreal numbers, which is an extension of the real. So you have all kinds of number theory things showing up. Showing up. Set theory as well. So there is loads to do with post-sets because we have these games that are incomparable with zero. We have lots of things that are incomparable with each other. So we have partially ordered sets and you can do all kinds of things with post-set theory. Algebra as well. And so this is actually something that I'm not going to talk too much about it in this talk, but these games that I'm interested in. But these games that I'm interested in, these placement games, turns out that they are in a one-to-one correspondence with square-free monomial ideals. So you have all kinds of abstract algebra, commutative algebra that you can do things with here as well. And then on the computer science side, so combinatorial games is really a spectrum from math to very computer science-y. So there's lots of questions on computational complexity, and I've done a little bit of And I've done a little bit of work on that, but I'm definitely not the expert. It's always my colleagues who are the experts, and I do the mathy side of things. And then, of course, you have the artificial intelligence, machine learning sort of stuff going on as well. So, and that is still not a full list of connections. So, whatever your interest is, there's probably something with combinatorial games that might be interesting for you. Okay, so talking about games. So, talking about games, Clobber doesn't quite fall into this category of games that I'm looking at. So, I'm going to tell you instead about two games that I'm quite interested in that fall into this category of placement games. The first one is Domineering. You play this on any grid. Traditionally, it's played on a chessboard. I drew a 6x6 grid here just to make it a bit easier. And you're going to place dominoes. And so the left player will place vertical dominoes. Player will play vertical dominoes and the right player will play horizontal dominos. So we can have here's an example game and I'm absolutely not claiming that this is optimal whatsoever. This is just a random game. But as you can see, I have red dominoes are horizontal, blue dominoes are vertical. And after a while, the game might look like this. It's not done yet because we can still put dominoes down. The other game that is Another game that is going to be my example game is a game called Call, named after Call and Vouch, but also has to do with graph coloring. So it kind of works both for that. This one we're going to play on any finite graph. I give you a grid again, but you can play it on any finite graph. So you're going to claim vertices slash color them, and we cannot have that two vertices of the same color are adjacent to each other. So as kind of similar to graph coloring, except that Similar to graph coloring, except that we will have empty vertices as well. So we're not going to have a complete coloring, essentially. So here's again an example game. So blue might kind of color this corner vertex. Red might go in the opposite corner. Blue can go here again. And so in this vertex now, blue can go, but red might go in that vertex. So you can have the opposite colors next to each other, but not the same. And the game might. And the game might continue, and now the game is done because the remaining two are adjacent to blue and red. And again, I'm not claiming that this gameplay was optimal whatsoever. Now, both of these games, based on their rules, seem very simple. They're not, unfortunately. So there's even games that seem very simple in terms of rules become very difficult to analyze playing wise as well. Playing-wise, as well. And I'll talk about both of them a little bit more. Okay, so I'm gonna say strong placement games because we have a classification of placement games. These strong placement games or SP games are what Domineering and Call fall into. And so basically, here the rule is we're just going to put pieces down, we're not going to move them around anymore. So that is different from Clobber, where you were definitely moving. Where you were definitely moving pieces and removing them. So, here we're not going to do that, we're only going to put them down and they're going to stay where they were put. And then this strong property is this last sentence saying that if I have some sequence of moves that led to a position, I can change the order of those moves however I want. Who has played the game Blockus? You people. Few people have. So, in blockers, blockers is what we call a medium placement game. You still put pieces down, and once the pieces are down, you're not moving them again. But there is rules as to where you can put a piece, which has to do with it has to be in some way be adjacent to previously placed things. Now, that can't be the case in Strong, because the piece that I put down now, I couldn't have put down before the one that it is adjacent to. So, we don't So we don't want that. We want something like in domineering and call where if I put it down now, I could have put it down at any point. So that is kind of what we want. And this gives us all kinds of nice properties. Besides call and domini, snort is another example. That one is kind of opposite to call, where again you're coloring vertices, but this time you're only allowed to play next to your own color, not next to your opponent. To your opponent. No-go, Martin had mentioned it very briefly. It's like go, but you're not removing stones, so which is why you're not allowed to surround. And then Arc Chaos is a graph game that has to do with matching, so it relates to matchings. There's another one called Note Chaos, which relates to independent sets. So you can see there's all kinds of graph theory connections already showing up. And then if we're fudging the rules a little. If we're fudging the rules a little bit, NIM and hex can kind of fall into these categories as well. NIM, you can make it equivalent by saying every pile is equivalent to a complete graph, and we're just going to remove nodes from the complete graph. Hex, you need to fudge a little bit more. You need to actually play until the board is full, and then I mean, the winner is still whoever had connected. So then we can count that as a Then we can count that as a SP game, but we're not usually going to count it as an SP game. Sorry? Yeah, yeah. So we can fudge, like I said. Basically, we don't stop once we're connected. We're going to stop once the board is full, and then we can kind of count it. Alright. And then within this class, even though it seems Class, even though it seems like very restricted, actually, a lot of games that we are interested in fall into this category and have a lot of nice structures. And then we're going to have two subclasses, and I'll remind you guys of those later on when I talk about them, but two subclasses that have some extra nice properties on top of it. The first one is independence games. So there's basically all minimal forbidden formations are pairs. Like in call, it's always iconic. Like in call, it's always I can't play it next to one other one. So it's two tokens of the same color next to each other: the forbidden ones. Nogo does not fall into this category because by no-go it's kind of these groupings and you can't just surround the groupings. So it's not pairs of things that are necessarily the minimal forbidden things. And they're called independence games because they have to do with independent sets. So, and then distance games is And then distance games is so call falls again into this category. Distance games are ones where we basically have forbidden distances between either the different colors or the same colors. So call and snort are like that, where I'm basically saying I'm not allowed to play at distance one of either the same or different colors. Okay. So this Martin had shown you guys already as well, but I'll remind everybody. So our notation Remind everybody. So, our notation is for a game, we're going to use curly brackets, we're going to list the left options, we're going to put a vertical bar, list the right options, and put a curly bracket again. And now, Martin did not actually mention this one, but there's different winning conditions that we can consider. And the one that Martin was looking at is called normal play, because that is the usual assumption. And for the rest of the talk, And for the rest of the talk, if I don't say what my winning convention is, it is the normal play. And this one is: whoever put the last token down wins, slash, if nobody put a token down, whoever, if on your turn you can't make a move, you will lose. Now, Ryan, of course, and Hex, Hex has a very different winning convention. It is a connection game. I'm not going to consider those here, but the other convention that I will talk about briefly later. Convention that I will talk about briefly later is called Miser Play. And that one is: if you can't move on your turn, you're going to win. So it seems like it's just the opposite, but Miser Play is often called miserable for a reason. A lot of our analysis that works in normal play just falls apart. Okay, so again, Martin told you guys about disjunctive sum, but I'll show you guys how disjunctive sum looks like in domineering. Looks like in Domineering. So, Domineering, it very naturally happens that as you play and you put tokens down, your board breaks into these different components. And so, in this case, again, this is just a sample game, but you can see that these empty spaces are, there's no connection between them anymore, so there's no interference between these components. They're entirely independent, and so we can write these as a sum of the components. And on your term, Opponents, and on your turn, you're gonna pick one of the components, you make your move in that component, and then your opponent can pick either the same component or they can pick a different one, and you continue playing like that. And so I didn't write down the formal definition, but informally, the disjunctive sum of two games is exactly this: you pick a game, make a move in there, and go from there. Now, usually, like we said here, it naturally happens in a lot of games. It naturally happens in Clobber, it naturally happens in Domineering. But we can also have what some consider unnatural sums. You can quite literally have a chess game and a Domineering game. And again, on your turn, you're going to choose: do I play in the Domineering game or do I play in the chess game and make your moves there? So, those are a bit unnatural. So those are a bit unnatural, but I'll talk about again later why in general we do consider any possible sum. But as Martin also pointed out is when we have these components, so suppose it is red's turn, so right goes first and right is going to say, well, I'm going to move here. And then left is going to go and left says, well, I'm going to go here. Well, right can go again. Well, right can go again in the same component that they moved before. So, when we do the component-wise analysis, we don't necessarily have alternating play anymore. So, that is kind of a bit of a disadvantage when we do the component analysis, is we now need to analyze all possible turn sequences, not just alternating. Okay, so this is kind of my very quick introduction to basic. Very quick introduction to the basics of combinatorial game theory. I'll have a few more things that I'll talk about later. Of course, this is very hand-wavy definitions, but hopefully people are good. Do we have any questions right now? Okay, excellent. So in terms of topics, outcome classes are kind of the first question. So it's basically asking outcome classes which player is going to win. Is going to win. So between left and right, who is going to win if we play optimally? And the outcome classes in general are N, P, L, and R. So we have N is first player or next player. That's why the N is formed. Second player is called P for previous player. And then L wins, L is left wins no matter who went first. R is right wins no matter who goes first. Is frequent no matter who goes first. And so we can kind of look at outcome classes, of course, is basically the question we have for a game in general. The issue we have is when I do my component-wise analysis, different games with the same outcome class in a sum can act differently. So here's an example. So, this is again domineering. And so, I'm going to give everybody a moment to think about in this first game who is going to win. And I'll put as a reminder, so we have that left puts vertical and right puts horizontal. So, who was in the first game? Was in the first game? Left. Left. Left can always go in. We can reserve in the left piece. Yeah, exactly. So here it is. Basically, left going first, left is not going to be stupid and play here. Left is going to go here. And then right has no move, so left one. And if right goes first, well, right only has this option. Left goes here and left wins. So that first one, and by the way, this is a first player win. This is a first player win, this is a left win. So we have a left win plus a first player win that is a left win. But here in the second game, what happens here? Yeah, it's whoever goes first is gonna win because basically by moving in this component, you're reserving another move for yourself. Another moon for yourself, right? And so the value for whoever goes first of this game is much better than this game. And so we need to quantify this in some way because we now had we had the same left win game and then we had two different first player win games and we got two different outcomes in our sum. So that is kind of where really the next thing comes in, which is this values idea. So why Martin talked about we have So why Martin talked about we have values of one and two and so on, but why were we interested in that is because of this, because we need to quantify how much or what is the value of this position to whoever wins. Okay, so we're gonna like we have a formal definition of when we say equal and I didn't actually talk about canonical form here too much, but the canonical form is kind of The canonical form is kind of part of this. But in an informal sense, we're going to say that two games are equal to each other if, as long as we're in a disjunctive sum, I can swap them out for each other without changing. And this is saying in any disjunctive sum, including these unnatural ones. So I can have a domineering game and I can put a chess game next to it. And if I want to be able to say that two games are equal to each other, I need to be able to replace them. To replace them. But so that this is kind of our idea of equality. It is an equivalence relation, which means we get equivalence classes of games. And so we say the game value of a game is the equivalence class it is a part of. And then the canonical form turns out is the unique simplest game in the equivalence class. So we have this idea of equivalence class. Of equivalence class, and then we usually just replace a game with this unique, simplest game that is in that same equivalence class. Okay, so some game values, some of these you guys have already seen, the integers happen. So in, since I do have a bit of time, in domineering, this would be this game that is called one because it's one move for left, no moves for right. moves for right. This is still one because it's still just one move for left. As soon as she's made a move, there's a single square which neither player can play in. And then we have four squares. This would now be two because left playing smart would not play in this middle, instead she would play on the top and then this is a two move advantage for left. advantage for left. And then if we do 90 degree rotations, we're going to get the negatives because then they are right advantages. So we get all the integers this way. We get dyadic rationals. So there's kind of weird positions that are still a bit of an advantage to one player, but not a full move advantage. And I'm not going to go much more into these, but they happen as well. If we talk about any other fractions, so fractions. Any other fractions, so fractions where the denominator is not a power of 2, those can only happen in infinite games. They can't happen in finite games. But we're not going to talk about those. And then this is the star game that Martin had shown as well. And in Domineering, that this game right here is a star game. Because whoever goes first is going to move, and then there's no moves left. So this is this game. Left. So, this is this game that is 0/slash 0 because both players move and then there's no moves left. So, and this game is quite interesting because it's incomparable to zero. We kind of often think of it as this weird cloud that sits around zero. But it is smaller than any dyadic rational, so it is an infinitesimal that's incomparable to zero. Some interesting stuff there. And then this. And then this other game that I had shown you guys, and I'll race over here. So the 2 by 2 square, so here whoever moves first moves to one move advantage for themselves. So left moving, left will move and moves to one. And right moving, right will move and move to negative one. And we just use as a shorthand this plus or minus one for this. And this is called a switch. And that's going to become important later on because basically if you go, you get a one-move advantage for yourself. Okay, so there's way more than this. There is, again, Martin showed you guys, there is, you know, pages and pages of non- Pages and pages of canonical forms. There's infinitely many, but these are some commonly seen ones. So, one of the questions that I am looking at when it comes to these values is, if you tell me NSP game, like call or snort or domineering, can we figure out if we get all possible game values or do we have a restricted amount of game values? Given that we're not talking about everything anymore. Given that we're not talking about everything anymore, can we still get everything? In general, there's very little that's known. So it's for very few games that we actually know that either we get everything or we don't. The only games that are known at the moment where we get absolutely all possible game values are not strong placement games. So there is a few that just in the last five years, a few games have been. Five years, a few games have been found that have this problem. Call is one that has been known since the 70s. In Burlikam, Conway, and Guy's book, Winning Ways, they actually proved that call, you can only get numbers or number plus the star value. And so that was long known. And I had an undergrad student, Lexi Nash, working with me last summer, and she showed that this is actually correct. And she showed that this is actually correct for all kinds of generalizations of call as well. So there's kind of this neat little argument where you can show that you only ever can get one of these two. Interestingly enough, call is still PSpace complete, because figuring out which one it is is difficult. But it is, you can only get one of these things. So that's kind of one of the few things that is known. Few things that is known. For Domineering, there's probably been about a dozen papers looking at game values in Domineering, but nobody has been able to prove either way around, that either you get everything or there is something that you can't get. And so that is definitely a problem that I am looking at and I am interested in. And then we can ask in general: well, instead of looking at one specific SP game, what if I look at all SP games? Can I then get all possible game values or not? Get all possible game values or not. And this is called a universal game or a universal class of games. And so, this question here, like I've done quite a bit of work on this and working with this connection to abstract algebra. So, we've been kind of using this idea there where we can look at these square-free monomial ideals. And we know that if I have one of these square-free monomial ideals, I know it always. Ideals, I know it always corresponds to an SP game, so I can actually work with the ideals instead of with the game specifically. So there's been some work there. We haven't been able to solve it though. So and the question is going to be interesting either way. So it doesn't matter if the answer is yes or no. If the answer is yes, then it turns out that every single combinatorial game is going to be equal to some SP game. Similar to House Break and Grundy in the 90s. To how Sprague and Grundy in the 1930s were able to prove that every single impartial game is equivalent to a NIM game, and that improved the analysis of impartial games a lot. If we would be able to show that SP games are universal, we could do the same. We could say every single combinatorial game will map to some SP game. If the answer is no, on the other hand, if we find that certain values are not possible, Certain values are not possible, that could improve our analysis quite a lot. Because if we know, okay, this value can't appear, or we have certain simplification rules that apply for SP games that don't apply for other games, we can kind of improve the analysis of these SP games quite a lot. So this is definitely a research question that I'm quite interested in, and a lot of other people are quite interested in as well. Okay, and then I said. And then I said under Mazer Play, things are miserable earlier. The reason why, under Miser Play, the only game that is equal to zero is the game where neither player has an option. So where under a normal play, we had that every second player win was equal to zero. Under Mazer play, it's the exact opposite. There's only one game that's zero. So that already makes it difficult. There are no additive inverses under Mazer play. No additive inverses under Miserplane. Again, that makes it very, very difficult to do things. So, in general, things are a lot more complicated under Mazer play. And I have this word here called restricted universe. Because we pointed out earlier that in general, when we talk about values, we're saying, or the equality definition is that under any disjunctive sign, Any disjunctive sum with no matter what game I'm looking at, I need to be able to replace. But like Martin said earlier, well, sometimes it doesn't make sense to do that. Sometimes it makes a lot more sense to say, well, what if I'm only looking at disjunctive sums in my specific game or in a specific class of games? And it turns out, so there's been a lot of papers in the last 15-ish years on, well, what if we restrict? Well, what if we restrict which disjunctive sums we are allowing? And then suddenly, under some good restricted universes, you get a lot of structure back from the Zerplay. So you get additive inverses, you get things that are equal to zero, you get a lot of simplifications happening. And SP games have a lot of similar structures to some of these restricted universes. So this is something that I've dabbled in a little bit here. I've dabbled in a little bit here and there, but we will be concentrating pretty soon a lot more on this. Is what if we say kind of I'm only allowing sums within SP games? And can we get a lot of these structures as well? So can we get additive inverses? Can we get things that are equal to zero? Can we get simplification processes that are a lot easier? So that is kind of a thing that we are looking at. Then, of course, again, you can look at At. Then, of course, again, you can look at just within games. So Rebecca Milley at Memorial, together with two undergrad students, she actually looked at, well, what if we look just within domineering? And they've gotten quite a lot of interesting stuff for that very recently as well. Okay, so that's game values. Questions about that? So, if you find that there is a nice restricted universe under Mystia play, does that imply anything about the normal play of these games or not? Unfortunately not. Because then you would solve question one. Yeah, I know. It would be nice if it was, but unfortunately not. But yeah, it's kind of like still under Mazer. It's quite interesting to look at these terms. Quite interesting to look at these different setups. But if there's some restriction that is true under miser conditions, it doesn't imply the same restriction is true. No, unfortunately. It's true but not. All right. Okay, so then, so that's game values. And then I pointed out earlier, like one of the things we can say is here, when you're moving first, you're gaining a move. So when we looked at the little hook, yes, you want to go first, but you're not really gaining it. Go first, but you're not really gaining anything. You're just finishing the game. While here, yes, you want to go first, and you're gaining something that can be an advantage to you later on. And this is where this concept of temperature comes in. And again, I'm not going to be very hand-wavy. There's a full formal definition for temperature, which is a little complicated. I'm going to hint at it a little bit. But the idea is, it's the urgency. The idea is: it's the urgency of making the first move. So we can either think of it as how much do I gain, or how urgent is it for me to be the first one to go in this component. So I didn't actually put any formal definition in there. So one way, like there's a few different ways how you can think of it. So one is how much do I gain by going first. Another way is sometimes called the penalty idea. Penalty idea is how much of a penalty would I be willing to pay and still go first. And so, in this scheme down there, the little hook, you wouldn't want to pay any penalty because you're not actually gaining anything. But here, you would be happy to pay anything just less than one. And then you still go first. So, that is kind of in some way what the temperature is. We're going to say the boiling point is the maximum temperature that we can get in a game or. That we can get in a game or a set of games. So, what I mean here is I can say either for all possible domineering positions, what's the maximum temperature? Or for all possible SP games, what's the maximum temperature? And so we call that the boiling point. Problem is, calculating temperature is very difficult. And I know Martin is going to show me some stuff later on that he found where it's a little bit easier. Formally, what we do is we go. Formally, what we do is we go to this canonical form and then calculate the temperature from there. So the step that's difficult is usually actually this canonical form issue. So one of the things that we do though is instead of kind of finding exact temperatures is we're going to try and find approximations and bounds to simplify things. So one of the results we were able to prove with Richard Narakowski and Karlov. With Richard Narakovsky and Karlos Santos, we proved that we have this, basically ignore a lot of this, but we have this kind of nice bound that we can say that as long as you can bound this other parameter, we get an upper bound on the boiling point. And so basically what we reduce the problem for is trying to bound this other parameter called the length of the confusion interval, but it doesn't really matter for this. And for SP games, Games finding a bound for that parameter, we have a nice little trick that we can use to do this. So we have been able to get some upper bounds on temperatures that we've been able to prove for some games. Now, those upper bounds are still quite a lot above what the conjectured bounds are, but we were able to prove some upper bounds where before no proof was available at all for these. So, one of the ones that we were able to do is that we have a proof of So, one of the ones that we were able to show is for certain domineering positions, we found an upward one. So, or I have distance games here first. So, distance games, again, remember that these were the games where your restriction is just what is my distance to the same colored pieces and what is my restriction to the different colored pieces. So, what we know here is for call, because we know for call what the possible values are, it turns out that is zero. Out that is zero. So we can't, we don't ever get anything that's hot or exciting. We don't have anything where both people are like, oh, yeah, I really, really want to go first in this one. It's just kind of like a, meh, I can go first or I cannot go first. And for snort though, it's the exact opposite. So snort was the one where you can play next to your own, but you can't play next to your opponent. And so if we think about a group And so if we think about a graph like a star, whoever goes first in this is going to go in the central vertex and reserve all of the outer ones for themselves. So this has very high temperature. And I can get infinite temperature by just adding more and more leaves to this. And so in snorts, we have infinite temperature in general, but But what our computational evidence so far suggests, and kind of some partial results on paths and so on, is that you can actually find an upper bound on the temperature by some polynomial in the degree and the second degree. The second degree is basically not just saying what are my neighbors, but what are the, how many vertices do I have at distance two? And so some polynomial in these two parameters seems to be an upper bound for the temperature in general. To be an upper bound for the temperature in general. So that is kind of if you have a student who wants to have an interesting project, if they want to kind of try and generate lots and lots of data for SNORT so that we can check is that conjecture actually doesn't seem to be true or not and go from there. And then we have the second one for domineering. So we had call was zero, snort was infinite in general. Infinite in general. Domineering, it's been conjectured that this is 2. And this is one of the longest open conjectures in combinatorial game theory, because Burlington conjectured this in the 1970s already. And we do have some partial results on certain types of boards. So there's boards called snakes. Snakes are basically like zigzags where we only ever have like width. We only ever have like width one, and then we can either be completely alternating, or I might have a few up, a few over, one up, a few over, something like that. And so there's some partial results for these snakes. The other thing that we're doing, and I actually have an undergrad student working with me on this right now, is try and look at all positions that have temperature 2 or close to 2. So we're doing a complete analysis. So, we're doing a complete analysis, and I think he's up to six by six right now. Of course, it's kind of you're getting more and more positions with high temperature the larger you're making the board. But we're looking at all of these because all of the ones we have found so far that have temperature two all have a common characteristic of what I call a hook that's basically a U-shaped shape inside the position. And we know that it's definitely not a sufficient condition for high temperature. Not a sufficient condition for high temperature because there is positions with that structure that have low temperature, but we want to know if it is a necessary condition or not, because that might give us an approach to proving this. Snakes, like I said, are interesting. There's a lot of results. And we actually used this theorem that I had up a moment ago to prove that, in general, you can get at most seven and a half. The conjecture bound is one for snakes. So it's still quite a bit of a distance. So it's still quite a bit of a distance between 3.5 and 1, but we were able to prove something as an upper bound. And then a big question that people have been asking for a long time is the reason why domineering has temperature at most 2 that we're playing on a grid. So, one of the things that I've been looking at recently with some of my collaborators is: well, what if we look at a generalization of this that is At a generalization of this that is not played on a grid. And this one is, this generalization is called partisan archaes. So we're basically playing now on any graph, and I'm going to designate some of the edges as red, some of the edges as blue. And so it's still a similar idea where if you're right, so red, you're taking a red edge and removing that and all the incident edges, and the same for the blue player. For the blue player. And so the question was basically: can we get higher temperatures here? And people have been looking at this for quite a while. And we've basically, probably for the last five years, at almost every workshop, we would sit down and work on this. And we've never found a position with temperature bigger than two until three months ago. And what we did, or really what my collaborator Craig Tannenhaus did. Collaborator Craig Tannenhaus did is he wrote a genetic algorithm where the fitness function is temperature. So it's basically: if you're not familiar with genetic algorithms, the idea is that you have a seed. So we're basically looking at a set of graphs. You're going to calculate the temperature. You're going to keep the X best amount of highest temperature position. And then we're going to do some random modifications to it. So we might be adding vertices, we might be removing. Might be adding vertices, we might be removing them, we might be doing, so it's basically motivated by genomes. We might be doing like a swapping thing, so we might take one part of a graph here, swap it out with another part over there. Again, we're going to calculate every temperature, we're going to keep the x amount of highest, and you're going to keep repeating this. And this genetic algorithm found a position with temperature 5 half. So we have a position in partisan. Position in partisan archaes that has higher temperature. Now, the interesting thing is that also has the hook structure. So it has a similar U-shape. If we kind of think of red going one direction and blue going the other direction, that does appear several times in that temper in that position as well. So we have some interesting stuff going on there. Now, we still haven't been able to prove anything in general for parts and archaels either. In general, for partisan RKLs, either, but this is kind of an interesting problem, and so we're trying to push and see if we can get it further. Can we get, does partisan archaeologist also have some sort of upper bound on it? Or can we get infinite temperatures in part of arcades? We don't know. But we have something with temperature 5.5. Okay. So I'll run through this one pretty quickly. I did mention earlier, I mean, of course, combinatorics, we might have enumeration. We might have enumeration. It's not been studied very much when it comes to enumeration. There's been a few papers on certain types of goal positions. These are usually endgame positions that people have enumerated. There's been two papers that enumerated how many second player win positions there are in certain types of games. And then there was a somewhat recent paper that looked at, well, what happened? That looked at well, what happens if we play distance games on paths? So, how many positions can we get? And this is kind of based on this. We've done a few projects on enumerating positions, and I'll give you guys another reason in a moment why we're interested in this. Okay, so this is kind of this idea where, and Martin alluded to this a little bit as well, when we do the component-wise When we do the component-wise analysis, the problem is again we need to consider non-alternating play in the components, which means we need to analyze a lot more positions than if we just do strictly alternating play. But at the same time, oftentimes the components are a lot smaller than the overall game. So inside the component, that might be a lot easier if we can kind of analyze the components relatively quickly, then do the size. Relatively quickly, then do the sum of these and look at the overall game. So, a big question is: when is it of advantage to look at component-wise analysis versus the overall game? And for that, one of the things we want to know is, well, what is the ratio of all possible positions when we don't alternate to just the ones that alternate? And so, this, we kind of introduced. We kind of introduced the polynomial profile for kind of enumerating all possible positions. This is basically saying I have a bivariate polynomial. We have a univariate version of this as well, but it's not that interesting. And so this bivariate polynomial, the exponent on x tells you how many pieces from left we have, the exponent on y tells you how many we have from right. And then the coefficient tells you how many positions there are. Tells you how many positions there are of this type. And so, what we can do, of course, if we're plugging in 1 into for both x and y, you're going to get all possible positions. And then, if we only pull out the terms where the exponents have a difference of at most 1, those are the alternating plane positions. And so we can pull out information this way. You can pull out a lot more information than just that, but these are some of the things we're interested in. We're interested in. And so it turns out that for distance games, you can find this by doing the independence polynomial of a specific type of graph product of the board with something else. So for we call this graph that we are looking at the auxiliary board. For call it turns out that it is just the Is just the Cartesian product of the board with a single edge. For Snort, it's a similar problem. This game called NoteCales, you're doing the strong product of the board with a single edge. So there's all kinds of different products that you're looking at. And you would have to find the independence polynomial of this auxiliary board is the polynomial profile we're looking at. So this is a question if you are in graph theory, if you want to kind of look at this a little bit. If you want to kind of look at this a little bit, this problem, and that might be interesting. Okay. And this is basically what this paper had done. And then Lexi Nash last summer had looked at values the summer before we did enumeration and we actually have a paper out where we enumerated it for all kinds of other distance games on paths and for snort and call on non-path graphs as well. So we have a bit of stuff there. So, we have a bit of stuff there. And then, bipartite matching. So, for domineering, it turns out that it's really a question of bipartite matching, since we're taking edges, more or less. And so, with Neil Mackay, we've been able to do this matrix construction, recursive construction, where if you go up to the nth level and take the nth exponent of one of the two matrices and take the first One of the two matrices and take the first entry, that's going to be your polynomial profile for dominant on an n by n board. So there's kind of a bit of an interesting stuff there. And we were able to do it not just for all domineering positions, but we've been able to do it for specific types of domineering positions as well. So the ones close towards the end of the game and so on. And then this is basically a table that we have found where this is now the rate. We have found where this is now the ratio of this strictly alternating to non-alternating, how many positions we have. And we just have the square boards here. So the play positions were the ones in strictly alternating play. We didn't list the ones in non-alternating play if we're looking at all of them, because this is really just the number of matchings in a grid graph, which is relatively well known what those are. But fortunately, Unfortunately, we don't actually have a good formula for what this is. So that would be an interesting problem as well there. Okay, and then I'm going to quickly go. This table is snort and column complete bipartite graphs. It's not an accident that I have both names here because the total number of positions is the same between these two and we have a conjecture there. If anybody would be interested in looking at that, again, it's a good one to stick an undergrad student on there or a master's. An undergrad student on there or a master's student and have them working on something like this. These are quite interesting problems. Okay, and then some other things that people might be interested in. I had mentioned design theory. So we can look at all kinds of games played on designs. So this is something I'm doing right now with Melissa Haggin and Brett Stevens. But a lot of design theory people do this as well. And then, like I said, computational complexity. There's all kinds of interesting questions. Of interesting questions, and I'm working with Kyle Burke, Matt Ferlin, and Shang La Tang on computational complexity of sums and of thermal graphs a little bit. All right, thank you everyone. Are there any questions for Shania? I just wondered if there's a connection between the temperature stuff and the enumeration stuff. And enumeration stuff, like can you enumerate everything at temperature minus one, for example? Or is that already way too complicated? That might be very complicated, but it would be interesting. I think it might be interesting to look at that. One of the things we had looked at is if, but not very long, is if the polynomial profile would give us some sort of information about a maximum temperature. So that is definitely something that. So, that is definitely something that's a very complicated question, but something that we're hoping to see because one of the hopes is that for strong placement games, because they have these nice structures, is that we can find some easier ways to bound temperature. Enumerated for each temperature, then you just see when you reach the total and then you bound it. Yes, of course, but that might be more complicated than the one I'm thinking about. But yeah, it's definitely some interesting questions there on can we do Questions there on can we do connections between these different things? So the switch has temperature one, right? Yes. So can you give a small example as Avanearing that does get temperature one? Yes. And this one was discovered in the early 2000s, and I think that was the first known one that has temperature too. Okay, and then we do Okay, and then we do. Oh, now is the question. Can I actually remember this at the top of my head? Yes, I do. This has temperature too. And that is not something I would expect people to know at the top of the head. The optimal move for both players is this metric move here. And then you get that. And then you get that this little part here has zero, and then this value has value two, or negative two, depending on which player it is. So this is a bit of a interesting. This is the smallest known one that has temperature two. And it has the hook that I was talking about. I have a silly question. Is Lexi Nash John Nash? No. At least not as far as I know. She didn't disclose that she is. More serious questions? Okay, let's thank her. So we have one more talk before lunch.
