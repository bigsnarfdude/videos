Okay. Okay, so yeah, I'm ready. Okay, I'm just pinning your video. Great. Yeah. Okay, so for our last talk for this afternoon is by Emine Yildirim. It's on row motion and the Coxeter transformation. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Tom, for the introduction, and thank you very much for the invitation to give me this nice opportunity to speak here. Yes, so I will talk about again raw motion, but its relation to the Coxer transformation. Yeah, so my starting postets will be communist queues. So if you don't know the So, if you don't know the definition, you can just think of them. I want to consider a grid poset, which is size of m and n. This is product of two chains, m and n. And yeah, this is one infinite family of bosets that I'm interested in. The second family is this triangular shape, and the size should be the same on the both sides. This is the second. Both sides, and this is the second infinite family. And here I have the third infinite family, which basically it's you have two lines of the same length and a square in between. So yes, so these are called communist posets. They come from sub-posets of the root posets. So here I just illustrated example. Examples. So, for instance, in type A, this is the root poset. This whole thing is the root poset. And the common skill poset are basically you can pick up any simple root and the highest root here. And this interval will give you a grid, namely the first infinite family of the communist. So, yeah, so yeah, type A combinatorics, type A root posets gives you this first. Posets gives you this first infinite family of the common square posets. And the second infinite family actually comes from the root poset of type C and D. In type C, it will come from this simple root. And in type D, here is the root that will give rise to this type of conus cohoside in the second infinite family. And the last Family. And the last infinite family comes from the other root in the type D poset here. We see this, which is in the third infinite family. So this is just where they come from. So they are my starting points. And I mean, your video seems to be shut off for the one that was showing you. Can you display that again? Oh, okay. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Sorry. No, that's right. Yeah. Okay. So this is my starting possibility, these communuscule. But what I want to do, I want to jump into the order ideal poset, or they are, of course, lattices. So order ideal lattices of these communuscule fossets. I can start with any communuscule from this three-infinite family. I will jump to the order ideal lattice of those. Idealattis of those. So I did one example here. For instance, if I take a 2x3 grid poset, here it is. This is my starting poset. Then I go to order ideal lattice of this, which is order ideals are basically down closed subsets of these posa. The first one is we have empty set, we have order ideal generated. We have order ideal generated by one element to this order ideal generated by this and this and so on. So we get this order ideal lettuce. So as a lettuce, I just, yeah, this will be the lettuce I'm interested in. And yeah, I denote them, denote them by J C2 by 3. I just try to show you one. Show you one bigger example. Here it's very difficult to see. There are dotted lines between these elements, these order ideals, but I didn't draw them with strong lines because then it's very complicated. It looks very complicated. But basically, this is a whole lattice of the order ideals inside this 3x3 common square foresaf. So, I mean, I wanted to show this because And I wanted to show this because even if you start with this small commuscule pulsar, three by three grid poset, the order ideal lattice actually is huge. Okay. Yeah. Next, what I want to do is I want to consider the incidence algebras over these posets. And this is And this is, you can think of these incidence algebras as Emily talked about the pad algebras, but we have some relation. So, pad algebra means you're taking the span of all the paths in this order ideal lettuce, and I impose a relation, commutativity relation, which means if you have two paths that start and ends at the same point, these two paths are equal. These two paths are equal to each other. So, here this one is equal to this one, and this one is equal to this one. So, that means in this order ideal lattice, if you take two points, two vertices, you will have only one part between them up to this equivalence. Because we make every part equal to each other if they are start and end at the same point. At the same point. Yes, so this is the algebra, instance algebra I'm interested in, instance algebra of the order ideal sets. Okay, so then I will write a matrix CA. This is just encoding if we have a part from I to J or not. If we have a part from R to J, the entry The entry will be one, otherwise zero. So this is actually, you can define this matrix more general if you have different incidence algebras. But since I have this nice relation which imposes only one part of the equivalence, it's simply defined by ones and zeros. So then what I want to do. So, then what I want to do, I have a title here. This A. Yeah. So, I take this matrix, CA, I take its transpose, I multiply it with its inverse, and I put a minus sign here. And I call the resulting matrix the Cuxter transformation or Cuxter matrix. So, the matrix I will be interested in is the Cuxter. Will be interested in is the Cuxter matrix or sometimes called Cuxter transformation. So it's basically minus of the transpose of the CA times the inverse of the CA matrix. And so, yeah, I will consider Caxer matrix for these incidence algebras coming from order ideal lattices. This was coming from a 2x3. Come from a two by three grid poset. And we have 10 vertices here. And then we will have a 10 by 7, yes, 10 by 10 matrix, even for the small communuscule possess. So when you take a random comminuscule posset, after that, you take the order ideal posset and the matrix you. ideal postet and the matrix you will get is huge. It will be very huge matrix for random communications from these infinite families. And yeah, looking trying to prove this metric somehow shows some periodicity is not an easy question. To me it's impossible to get a result by just looking at the A result by just looking at the matrix or trying to do some linear algebra or spectral theory. There's some work actually on using spectral theory and different techniques to get a handle on the periodicity of this Capture transformation. But we use another method to detect the periodicity of Captain transformation. There is an so we actually look at these actions. Actually, look at these actions using another functor in a special category. Emily mentioned this also on the writing translation. So there's a functor in some special category. And the action of this functor, when we consider it on the level of Grotangi group, it exactly coincides with the action of the Caxel transformation. So periodicity of such a matrix really Of such a matrix really rolls down into the periodicity of this function. So, this is how we actually translate this problem to the representation theory in peak sense. And yeah, so I proved that the Cox transformation, we call it tau A, has the order H plus one up to, yeah, plus minus. You can think of it to. Minus, you can think of it 2 times h plus 1 if you want the identity for the incidence algebras coming from the first infinite family, the third infinite family, and the exceptional cases. So, let me remind you these infinite families. So, if you start with a communuscular poset, if you take the order ideal poset and then the incidence algebra, then this Cuxter matrix has a finite. matrix has a finite order and it's h plus one up to a sign and the question is open for these infinite family of commuscules and then for the last one you take the again order ideal posit it will be just a little bit larger it is very similar to this one and then for this case also i was able to show that the matrix The matrix has order up to a sign h plus one, and h is the Capster number. So I, of course, I know, I believe that this order is H plus one after a sign for this case as well, but I wasn't able to prove it. And as I said, how we tackled this problem is really looking at these action of these much. This action of these metrics on the level of representation theory of algebras and understanding the orbits of this special functor we have, and then use combinatorics to somehow show this order. And of course, when we have this H plus one, the question is, we know this nice. Nice action on the order ideals. I just referenced Russian Chi, but there are many other people who has proved that this order, the order of raw motion on communist kiloset is H. I just usually use this paper because of that. I referenced it, referenced that paper, but yeah, actually, literature is quite wide for. For the order of row motion, we know for construction poset, it's H. So, then the question: are these two actions somehow related to each other? It's of course not, since this is H, this is H plus one of the sine, they differ by one, and then it becomes difficult to get an insight what is going on or conceptually, maybe. Conceptually, maybe it wasn't possible to understand what is happening really, because these are not exactly the same actions, but show some kind of similarity. And I analyzed the combinatorics of raw motion and combinatorics of this Coxen matrix in type A, namely for the grid posset. If you take a product of two chains and look at the order ideal posset. The order idea possessed, I was describing the orbits of these two and trying to understand why they differ by one. Yes, so yeah, this is just the same thing. Let me show you one example. Again, I start with two by smallest possible, maybe interesting example, two by three grid for set, and then I take the order ideal for set. Ideal for set of this communuscule. So this actually is somehow a description and illustration of the order of the Cuckster transformation. So if I start at this vertex, in representation theory, we can write actually these order ideals or collection of order ideals. Or collection of order ideals as modules over this incidence algebra. This is basically the simple module at this vertex. When I apply Cuxter transformation to this, Kuxd transformation takes it to here, and then here, here, at this point. And then Kuxder transformation, when I apply Katzer transformation to simple at this point, I get the whole posit back. And then after this, when I apply the Kuxter transformation. When I apply the Kaxter transformation on matrix again, I come back where I started. So the row motion, for instance, in this case has order five, but the Cax transformation have order six. And if you look at the orbit of the row motion in this example, so the row motion is actually going backwards. So if I start here, the row motion will go here and then here and then here. And then here, and then here, and then it will come back to itself. So, we can define promotion as the complement of the order filter ideal generated by the maximal element in the order ideal we started with. And then we have the same somehow direction with the Capste transformation. The transformation, but it's also nice to notice that raw motion is somehow going backwards and Capsta transformation going this way. Yeah, so they differ and in the larger examples, so here, for instance, you may see, okay, Capstone transformation takes this simple or this order ideal to this one and so on. But in general, when we apply Capstone transformation to a vertex, a simple To a vertex, a simple representation, you may get different modules over this algebra in different intervals of order ideals. So it's not as nice as this one, maybe. Okay, yeah. So, in this example, somehow, okay, we can guess what is happening. The Cox transformation has one more step right here, and but then it. And, but then, yeah, we have to see somehow a general picture of what is happening. And yeah, so here I showed also it's just for fun, I added this. This is the order ideal possib coming from the triangular communiscule postet, the type 2. And then, yeah, if I apply the Caps transformation to the simple ad here, as you see, it takes it to. See, it takes it to the module supported over these vertices or these ordered ideals. And if you keep going, you get back to where you started. But as you see, the elements in the orbit of Cox transformation, they are not just single vertex. So we have these intervals. They're quite nice. And one other And one other thing, actually, here you see they look like intervals. If I iterate the action of Cax to transformation, in this example, I seem to get intervals inside this order ideal for set, but this is because I started with something nice. So if you start with a random interval, namely random module in your algebra, you may produce non-interval. Non-interval elements in the orbit. So if I apply to Cox transformation a random interval, let's say inside this, I may get the composition of the two different intervals. So this was also a disappointment when we found a country example. And then, of course, it becomes more difficult to control these orbits combinatorially. This is maybe one of the difficult. This is maybe one of the difficulties in the type 2 case to understand them combinatorially. But the one nice thing is if you keep an eye on these elements, you will see the orbit of row motion inside the orbit of Capstone transformation. So the element, for instance, row motion takes this one to here, it's right there, and then row motion takes this. And then raw motion takes this element to here, you see it, and so on. So, you will be able to see actually the orbit of raw motion inside the orbit of Captain Transformation. Okay, yes, so then so I want to show you just one example how we see the orbits of the Cuxer transformation. So, as I said, we use representation theory and We use representation theory and we use projective resolutions of modules inside the orbit to be able to see some combinatorics because you can just assume them as some labels corresponding to elements inside the orbit of Cuxter matrix. If you look at the indices of these resolutions, these elements, I mean, they are quite nice. I mean, they are quite nice. You can actually get a handle on it, what is happening if you look at. So, yeah, this is one object in the orbit, and when I apply Coxer matrix, I get this projective resolutions. And in the indices, there's a combinatoric going on. And what I wanted to do is, I wanted to somehow capture this combinatorics and the indices to be able to see the orbit. To see the orbit of Gaxel transformation. So then we developed a nice combinatorial object correspond to the elements in the tau orbit using dominoes, let's say. So here maybe I should first show one example. So this is the first, let's say we start with these objects in the orbit. These objects in the orbit, and I just need the information from the indices, right? So, these, if I want to write these indices combinatorially, okay, I can use two dominoes. This is labeled by two, three, this is one, two. And by using this configuration of dominoes, I can read off the indices of this projective resolution. It's really Projective resolution: it's really if I write it two, three, one, two. What how we are reading the third element is, and these are going binomial. So we have, you know, how many objects we will have in each degree, and so on. But we read off the labels as follows: two, three, two, two, one, three, and one, two. And then, okay, I apply. And then, okay, I apply the Caxter matrix and I get to this object, this projective resolution. And on the level of domino configuration, it corresponds to just shifting these dominoes to the left, left of me, left by one. So this is nothing but one, two, zero, one. And if I read the labels, I have one, two, one, one. 1, 1, 0, 2, and 0, 1. Now we can forget about representation theory. We know what are the orbits inside the Cux for the Cax to transformation. They are just these dominoes and their shift. And obviously, if you take these dominoes, and yeah, I have to say this numbers is really coming from 2 by, we have 2 by 3 common skills, so I have to have. three common skills so I have to have minus two minus one the two part and zero one two three this is always we have to put zero because the order is h plus one so you might get a sense of why I choose this label because of the order so you can think of it as a cylinder so when I start with these two dominoes if I start shifting them to the left by one then I will of course obviously end up at the same place At the same place after h plus one step. In this case, it's six. So nice, I describe the orbits of Cuxer transformation by using these nice combinatorial objects, dominoes, domino configurations, and the order, the action really corresponds to shift to the left on these dominoes. Shift to the left on this domino configuration. And actually, so this will be actually the base of my combinatorics. And if you have, yeah, in this case, this is two by three grid because of that, I started with two dominoes. But in general, if you start with M by M grid, you will place M dominoes inside such a cylinder. knows inside such a cylinder and without knowing representation theory you can write down the orbits of the customer transformation if they will and they will just correspond to shift by one okay now what i want to do i want to see the this combinatorial somehow dynamics for the orbits of raw motion and so I that this would be So this way, this direction will be the action of the row motion. But since I know that the Haxel transformation goes in the other direction, I will consider the action given by this direction. And then I will try to write down this orbit inside my combination. Orbit inside my combinatorics. I have so what do we do? So the order is H, so it is not H plus one. So I should get rid of these columns. So for the order of row motion, the combinatorics will be inside a cylinder of length five. And then, so here I rewrote. And then, so here I rewrote again, rewrote the order of raw motion, the elements. I have, there's a small technicality I have to change these minuses to pluses, but it's very intuitive. It's not very difficult. What will be the orbit of raw motion inside such combinatorics? In this case, in certain. In this case, instead of dominos, you will have singletons. So let's say you started with 2, 3. You will go back to 1, 2, right? And then 0, 1, 0, 0. It's really shifting the singletons by 1 to the left. Since in the row motion, you don't have this column in the cylinder. After this step, you will come back here. And then when you shift one more, you're When you shift one more, you end up with the same position where you started. So, in this combinatoric, obviously we see why the order differ by one. So, for dominoes, you have to do one more step, but in the singletons, you came back to where you started because these are just singletons. So, this is, of course, this works, this combinatoric only works. works this combinatoric only works in for the grid posets and it's just looking at these difference by one combinatorially this really doesn't give me any conceptual understanding of why this order differs by one again but at least now I can somehow I have this combinatorial description that captures Cuckster transformation and raw motion at the same time. And raw motion at the same time, somehow. Yes. And it's about time to wrap up, Emine. So if you could. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, yeah. I will just mention that one thing that was interesting. So during this conference, something really nice happened. So there was a conjecture by Sam Hompkins, and Renee mentioned it to us, which Hugh that Q that yeah, the raw motion, the row motion matrix times the cuckster transformation. If you take this multiplication, it has order two. That's true, sorry. And then actually, we were able to show it with you using again the presentation to your file chips. And thank you very much. Great. Thanks so much. Let's thank Emine. Are there any quick questions? Can I ask? So H plus one is the order of real motion on a minuscule poset across a chain of length one. And these orbits you're looking at, like a lot of them look like real motion orbits in that kind of poset. Motion orbits in that kind of poset. Is there some way of relating those two things? So you mentioned which poset? A cross B cross one, something like that. Aha, change of size two. I see. Yeah, I haven't looked at it, but it might be interesting. Yeah, because I was listening to your talk and it came to my mind. To my mind, if the order of row motion inside these commonuscule A cross B cross 2 is H plus 1, maybe I should try to relate this to these type of posits communist cues, but it's not the capstone transformation is really working in this dynamic, right? The order ideals. So I don't see a quick connection, but I also, yeah, this is a good question. Yeah, this is a good question. I should do examples and see what is happening. Anything else? Other questions, comments? If not, then let's thank Yemina again. Thank you.
