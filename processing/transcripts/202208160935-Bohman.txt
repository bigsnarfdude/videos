Yeah, yeah, I listen. The recording will start, you know. First real slide. Okay, so here's the problem. So there's n plus one runners, and they're running on a circular track. Okay, so they all start at the same time and place, and it's not a race. Okay, they all, everybody runs at a constant speed forever. Okay, so every runner has a different speed. They all feel the gun goes off. They all feel the gun goes off, they all run. And we say that at some point in time, a runner is lonely if the distance around the track to the next runner is at least one over the number of runners. So if there's two runners running at different speeds, there'll come a moment when they're, you know, at typical points on the track. At that point, the distance around the track is a half, and at that moment, both runners are moving. And so the conjecture is. And so the conjecture is everywhere personally at some point in time. So that's the that's the long runner conjecture. Okay, so now I'm just going to restate it. Different times, same time. At some point in time. Every runner is lonely. Right. Loneliness is an individual thing. I'm not. For every runner, there is a time. Yeah, for every runner. Every runner is lonely in some way. Right. Every runner is loaning some point. Otherwise, they are perfectly distributed. Right, yeah, yeah. That I cannot guarantee. But do you look only in one direction along the circle? Either direction. Or at both times. Yeah, either direction. Pair or both? Both. Both. Right. Yeah. The distance, you know, to the next year further in either direction. Good. It's important that we understand the question. The question. Okay. All right. So I'll say it again with some more notation just to be super clear that we got it. So I define the fractal part of a real number. So V1 through Vn, those are our speeds. And the claim is that if we choose N of them, so I had N plus 1 runners before, now I have N speeds. And the claim is there existed time. And the claim is there existed time such the fractural parts are all between 1 over n plus 1 and 10 over n plus 1. And I get this from the previous formulation. I want to show one individual runner is lonely, so I'm just going to subtract that runner's speed from everybody else's speed. And now that runner is just standing still, right? And now I've lost a speed. Instead of n plus one speeds, I have n speeds, and now the loneliness can be. And now the loneliness condition is that these fractional parts are all. But are this speeds positive? Don't we get some negative speeds if you believe it? Sure. But the condition is symmetric, right, for positive or negative speeds. So yeah, I could have gotten rid of that here. I just don't want them to be zero. Okay, and so this conference is about geometry, so I want to mention that I can actually view this version of the conjecture as a view obstruction. Conjecture is a view obstruction problem. So the way to think about that is, so I'm in, you know, I guess in n dimensions. And the idea is I go to the, you know, the half-integer points and I put a square At each half-integer point, and ask the question. And so these are, those are the squares. And so the question is, is there a way to see to infinity without touching any of the squares that's not along any axis? Right, so I guess. No, conjecture is no, right? Right, the conjecture is that you can't. No, right? Right, the conjecture is that you can't, right? So, in two dimensions, I guess, this, this is, you know, this brought it really poorly. So this is, you know, this is one-third, and that's two-thirds. And, you know, the conjecture is that you can't. But there is this ray that kind of just touches the corners. That's okay. So that's not good. That's like a trunk problem. Okay. All right. And so, yeah, I want to talk about this rate that just touches the corner. So, you know, why did I choose this parameter, this distance one over plus one? So it turns out that there's an example that, you know, for which this stationary runner is just barely lumpy. So if my speeds are just speeds one up to n. Are just speeds 1 up to n. The claim is that there will indeed be these times when the distance to the nearest runner is 1 over n plus 1, right? But there's never a time when the distance is greater than that. So the time when the distance is 1 over n plus 1 is just some time 1 over n plus 1, and that's fine. Or any multiple of that. But if there's some time, so at any time, so my claim is. So, my claim is for this set of speeds at any time, you know, there's always a runner whose distance is at most 1 over n plus 1. So, if I consider such a time, if I look at the set of positions of the runners around the track, including the stationary runner, then I have n plus 1 positions, there's going to be some pair of those that are at most distance at most 1 over n plus 1. And now the point is that. And now the point is that the right, so those are speeds j and i, then if I look at this, you know, the position of runner j minus i, that's going to be the same, that's going to be the same distance that we had, which is a plus one over m plus one. So there's this kind of canonical example which is right, which shows that this condition. Which shows that this condition, if it's true, is okay. So, here's some history. And I'm, you know, I'm leaving out a whole bunch of stuff, but this is roughly speaking the history. So, it was conjectured in the context of Don Fantine approximation by Wills in the 60s, independently raised by Kuzik as this, as a view of structural problem. As this is a view of structural problem in the 70s, and then it was confirmed for small dimensions by various people. And Godman is responsible for this nice Lonely Brother formulation. So a number of variations have been considered: different track configurations and random speeds and so forth. And I'm skipping a little a bit. Okay. Okay. Okay, so. Sorry, d if I approve it for n equals to six, does that mean I get approved for n equals to five? I don't know that necessarily. Yeah. Is you have to prove for hundred then? So right, I mean so so for example uh this argument uh really uses the fact that n plus one is prime. The fact that n plus 1 is prime, right? So maybe you could prove it for primes and not know it for other numbers of runners. Okay, so I'm going to want to talk, to motivate what I'm doing, I'm going to want to talk about tied instances. And so a tide instance is going to be an instance like this canonical example, where there's no point in time. There's no point in time when the distance to the nearest runner is greater than 1 over n plus 1. So the tight instance would be one of these rays that touches, doesn't touch the interiors of any of the squares. That's a tight instance. I already explained the examples of tight instance, but there's other tight instances. instance but there's other time instances and so this is you know indication that the you know there's something tricky going on right that there's other ways to come up with configurations of speeds that have this problem in particular there's a big class of them so got and wong show that in certain situations you can it's And they're all kind of similar in spirit to this example that I wrote down. So you have the canonical example, which here is eight months. So the canonical example is just the speeds, one up through seven. And I took six and I just doubled it. And got it along observed that this is a broad class of tight instances. So there's a bunch of situations where you can just take some speed k from the canonical example and double it. And the thing is that K has to satisfy some number theoretic conditions. In particular, there needs to be a long interval of somewhat long. There needs to be an interval of numbers in the right place, none of which are co-prime. Place none of which are co-prime with k. So if k contains, has this condition, then I'm this I would be in this other instance. Okay. All right. So now I want to say that just as a matter of fact, and it's not so hard to show, we can actually assume that all the speeds are integers. It turns out that if there's a counter. You know, if there's a counterexample, then there's a counterexample where all the speeds are images. So we're just going to restrict our attention to that space. And so Terry Towell wrote a paper about the Lonely Runner conjecture several years ago. He was after, he was doing a few different things in that work. One of them was: you can ask the question, You can ask the question: so we have this, you know, this distance 1 over n plus 1. What's the largest value of that function for which we actually can prove this thing is true? And so proving it's true for 1 over 2n is easy, I submit. And so one of the things it did in this paper is it gave a pretty minor, I would say, but still difficult improvement in the water. Difficult improvement in the one over two n. Another thing that he did was show that it's, you know, deciding, it's decidable, the conjecture is decidable for any fixed value of n. So conceivably, you know, there's, you know, infinite collection of speeds that you need to check to confirm the conjecture. And so he showed that there's a bound on the kind of the fastest speed you need to think about. The fastest speed you need to think about. And so then it's decidable. On the other side, he asked the question: well, you know, can we prove that the conjecture is true under the assumption that all the speeds are sloped? And maybe, you know, you could work in from two sides, from the two sides, and this could be a route to proving the thing. It's to kind of. The thing is to kind of lower bounds and upper bounds on the maximum speed you need to consider. So he showed that if the maximum speed is at most 1.2n, then the conjecture holds. And he suggested that the next natural thing to do would be to prove this just replacing the hormone 2n by 2n. And the reason that that's interesting is these. Interesting is these examples that come from God and Wang: that we have these tight instances where the speeds are a little bit less than 2 times n. And so that if we can prove it up to here, then we're kind of at least able to handle this difficulty in question. Okay, so the thing that we're able to do, so this is joint with Hay Pang, who was a Who joined with Fei Peng, who was essentially a master's degree student, is a kind of an approximate version of this next step. Okay, so we show that if you choose whatever out some greater than zero to join, and this is actually log squared, or one over log squared. Anyway, for any epsilon greater than zero and is sufficiently large, that the largest speed is most 2 minus epsilon n, and it's at least. Supplement. And it's at least n. I just want to get away from the canonical example. Not only is the conjecture true, it's not, you don't even have a ton instance in this situation there. Yeah, so that's the okay. All right, so we're going to, when am I supposed to end? Five after. I'm halfway, yeah. Okay, so we're going to get to this. Okay, so we're going to get to this through co-prime matchings. So a co-prime matching of two intervals is just a bijection from one to the other such that the pairs are co-prime. And this is an object that has been historically, kind of classically studied. There was a conjecture of Newman that was resolved by Pomerans and Selfich that said that the first n integers have a co-prime matching to any interval of length n. To any interval of length n. So, what we're going to want to think about for this result, I'm going to describe, is co-prime actions where we get away from this interval. They're going to need to be intervals that are arbitrarily placed. And they don't contain one. One is super useful, right, in this realm because I can match it with anything. So, if there's a particularly different With anything. So if there's a particularly different, difficult number in I, I can always measure before. So in particular, even if I move this off by one, look at the interval from two up to n plus one, the other interval contains the product of the primes up to n plus one, then we're due, right? No, you can't find it. So this is actually, I'm skipping also over here, here I'll. Skipping also over here. Here, I'm also skipping over. So, the question of kind of generalizing this result to intervals that don't contain one was actually studied in the literature, but I'm just going to jump past that to what we need. And what we need is the following, which I think is a completely natural question, once I bring up the definition of co-prime matches. So, for a given integer n, So for a given integer n, what's the smallest length of interval with the property that for any two disjoint intervals among the first n integers, there's a co-prime matching between them. Some length. You know, and for the theorem that I was proving, I just need this to be little low thin. With fe, we, you know, With Fei Pang, we proved this bound. This F of n is bounded by e to the log log n squared. And pretty soon after we posted, Carl Pomerant's improved this to bigger log n squared. And this is actually essentially best possible for this question, as I'll describe in a second. Second. Right, so I'm not going to say too much about the proofs of these lemmas, but there's a kind of a number theoretic fact that's needed to kind of deal with situations like the one that I talked about on the previous slide, where you have one particular number that may be very hard to match in your co-prime matching is because it has a ton of prime factors. Just because it has a ton of prime factors, right? And that could cover up some big interval of numbers, and we've never went matching. And so you need to appeal to kind of some classical results from number theory. So the Jacobs Thal function for any integer, L is just the largest length of an interval, which has this property. So it's a property that all the integers, no integer in the interval. Integers, no integer in the interval is co-prime to L. So it's also, I guess, the gap, you know, largest gap between things that are co-prime to L minus 1. So this is class result of Erdős, which bounds this function in terms of the number of prime divisors of L. This is what Fay and I used, used this fact, and Carl Bommerence's approval. Carl Hammerenz's proof uses as the improvement due to a voniac, which is, for our purposes, clearly better. I don't want to talk about this so much, but I wanted to mention what's going on inside the length. Oh yeah, and so it could be the case, actually, that this function for n large, this function, the large This function, the largest length of interval that guarantees that we have these co-prime matchings between any pair of intervals among the first n integers, is just determined by this general solo function. Because it has to be at least this big. There's going to be that one number in there that requires an interval of that length to match, and it could be that they're the same. And okay, good. So. Good. So now, in 10 minutes, I'm going to turn off the projector and attempt to show you the proof of this theorem about the momentum. Okay, any questions at this stage? Okay. Stage. Okay, so we're going to so right. I want to, okay, so I have some set of speeds. They're, you know, it's up to from the first two minus epsilon and integers. And I want to show that, you know, I can find this time, this point in time, with, for those speeds, this station. With for those speeds, the stationary rubber is length. Okay. And so to do this, I'm going to focus on, there's lots of times we can think about, there's lots of constraints that if this is, you know, there's just a lot of constraints on the problem. So it's going to turn out that it's efficient just to consider the times of the following forms. For us. So the first is times, say, 1 over k for k in two-thirds n up to n. Okay. Okay, so that's a time. Now, if, so my claim is that if k and 2k, if neither one of those are a negative, then we have the loneliness condition at times 1 over k. Because the speeds are all integers, so they're all going to be at integer over k points, right? And though all of them. And all of those are distance at least 1 over n plus 1 from the origin, except for the origin itself. And so for the origin not to be lonely at that time, somebody else has to be at the origin as well. And the only two candidates get so long as this condition are going to be are going to be K and 2K. Right? So if. Oh, yeah, I guess I should say. Right. Well, maybe I'll say that in a second. But okay. But anyway, so that's that's the first. The next one is slightly trickier. So just times the form y over k for k now it's going to be between 2 minus epsilon n and 2n. So here we're really leveraging the fact that I didn't use that bit at the beginning. I didn't use that bit at the end. And that bit at the end is going to be hard to deal with, but I'm going to use that. So now for times of this form, there's going to be, again, all of the runners are going to be positions like an integer over k. But now they're going to be some that are close to the origin. There's going to be origin and zero itself and plus minus one module k. So if I find some I find some number which is coprime to k and x and k minus x are not in A, then we'll be lonely in time y over k, where y is just the multiplicative inverse of x. Inverse of x modulo k. Yeah? So, you know, xy is correct. Okay, so that's it. That's all we need. All right. Okay, good. Now, this morning, this is the picture that we draw. So, okay, so So, okay, so that's what I'm going to use. And I'm going to assume for the safe contradiction that there's no time when the origin is lonely. So, assuming the safe contradiction lonely. And now I'm going to choose some L which length which just comes from that lemma. So we have this lemma in our pocket about co-prime matchings that says that up to, this is 10, this is 2, right? This is 10 and this is 2, right? And up to an intervals of length L among the first two length things, I'm going to be able to find my look right now. L is a length from the lemma. And then we're going to divide into intervals of whatever the hell. Okay, that's Oh, okay. So I guess we'll call this I1, and then this is I sub A, and then this variable here at the end is I subax things up. Okay. Oh, yeah. So I really want this is. This is L is is, you know, one half the length of the R, you know. Okay, so by assumption, there's nothing in here. Okay, so that's, you know, we only take our integers go up to 2 minus epsilon n, so by assumption, these last two little kings don't have anything in them. Okay? Okay. So, okay, maybe I'll write these down. So, A intersect minus 2A is of the A intersect I sub 2A minus 1 is often. That's my assumption. Okay. So now the next claim is that ice of A is a subset of A. So this last one, you need to put them all in there because of what. Uh because of one. Okay, one, the doubles of all of these things fall into this bit that I told you. Right, so this stuff is going. And now the next thing I'm going to do is, I'm going to And now the next thing I'm going to say is that i sub 1 is also a subset of x in this very first interval right here. That's because I can find instances of 2 which are something in here. I can just choose this choose basically any x in here. Basically, any x in here which is relatively prime to a number down there, right? And that's my x. And then, right, so that's, I guess that's k minus, so I choose an x here. I find something in here which is relatively prime to that. That relatively prime one I call k minus x. And then I have the triple. I have this triple k minus x, which are relatively prime. k minus x, which are relative to the so that's so this is by 2. Okay. And now for the rest, what we do is now my claim is that we're going to pair up the rest. So we're going to pair up I2 with what this is? I2a minus 2, right? And then the next one with the turn. Right, and then the next one will put a pair of them like this. And when I pair them up like that, so that they have the property when I take something from this interval and add it to something in that interval, it ends up in this open piece. That's going to happen for every pair. Right, so then, okay, so now consider pairs. So I say Yeah, so I save j, i save 2 what what do I want to write? 2a minus j for j is 2 of a minus 1. Okay. So now my claim is that, okay, and I'm achieving this slightly, my claim is that I'm going to be able to find one of these pairs. One of these pairs, because look, I have about exactly, you know, half of that territory is covered by A. Half of the terrorists, that's not it. Half of that territory is covered by A. So now the claim is that there's going to be some one of these paired up pairs of intervals is at least. You know, at least half full. And then I'm going to say, oh, but I know there's a co-prime. Okay, maybe I have to show you it's a little bit more than half full. Actually, I don't. There's more than a co-prime matching. So, but anyway, I find one of those pairs which is half full, and then that's going to mean, by the co-prime matching or something close to it, that there's a pair, one from each interval, that are co-prime. And then we're going to have the loneliness. Then we're going to have the loneliness condition by 2. Okay, so that's it. So there's a slightly more general statement of the matching that I have to get, but that's the proof. So that's a good place to start. Any questions or comments? Well then set
