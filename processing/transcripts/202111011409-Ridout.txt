Which means that you can decompose the state space into products of irreducibles for the holomorphic and irreducibles for the anti-holomorphic vector. So that's very nice, but we want to understand more complicated conformal field theories because we're awesome. There are a few examples which some people in the physics literature call non-rational theories. So Liaville is one which has received a lot of attention and quite rightly. But we have to remember that the free boson. But we have to remember that the free boson is also such an example, and it's much more easy to understand. If we look at the discrete side, we can also move into the logarithmic realm where we have non-semi-simple actions of the Virasora zero mode L0. And so there we can distinguish between what some people call log-rational theories, which is where you have logarithmic modules as Drajan described them, but you also have a finite number of irreducibles. So here, symplectic fermions and triplet models are. And triplet models are key examples. I'm really interested in sort of the very generic case in which you may have a continuous spectrum, but you also have logarithmic modules. And so here, as I'm sure Simon mentioned, the beta-gamma ghosts are a good example. There are certain Wissamina-Witten models where one replaces your affine VOA with an affine super-VOA. And then there are Super VOA. And then there are some other examples, and we're going to be looking at fractional level today. All right, so let's remember rational CFT. From a physics perspective, what this means is that we have a vertex operator algebra module category. And so the definition is, for us, tied into which category of modules you use to construct your status. So the category should be semi-simple. Should be semi-simple, so all your modules are completely reducible. They should be finite, meaning you only have finitely many reducibles up to isomorphism. And what Rajan called ordinary, I'm going to call Q finite, which means that when you write down the characters just in terms of Q raised to the power of the Virusoro zero mode, then you get a generating function. So, what this means is that the eigenvalue. Eigenspaces of L0 are all finite dimensional. Okay, so in the log-rational setting, the VOA is list or C2 finite. So we lose semi-simplicity and keep both of the finite conditions. But one of the issues as a physicist is that these are very interesting examples, but we don't have so many examples to play with. So symplectic fermions and its friends are sort of our bread and butter in this corner of the CFT landscape. The CFT landscape, but it's difficult to really sort of go beyond that. One thing to note is that if you start with a vertex operator algebra, which comes somehow from an affine Lie algebra, and just about all the ones we understand well do in some way, then you're going to have some weight one fields, and in particular if you have some even weight one fields, which you do most of the time. At the time, then either you get a rational CFT, which are our Wisdomina-Witten models, or you break the C2 co-finiteness and you end up with things like free bosons, or more generally, the non-rational continual spectrum informal field theories that I want to talk about today. So in particular, we're going to be looking at non-semi-simple and non-finite VOA module categories, and our chief example will be admissible level SL2 model. Level SL2 models. So I hope that was vaguely comprehensible. If not, please bud in and tell me to make some sense. Otherwise, I'm going to go on to some ancient history. I told you this was an overview. I'm going to present some history and I hope that the history isn't too biased or completely wrong. So please feel free to correct. So everybody here hopefully knows back in 86, Goddard, Kent and Olive introduced the COSA. Goddard, Kent, and Olive introduced the coset construction from which you can take a rational SL2 West-Miner-Witten model. In particular, you can take the corresponding rational vertex operator algebras. You can perform this quiz construction on them and outpop the simple Birasora minimal model vertex operator algebras. And so that's really cool, but we Cool, but we know that the Veris or minimal models aren't just limited to the unitary cases, which is where the two parameters differ by one. There are also these lovely non-unitary models. And so, if you read Kent's PhD thesis, you can find some ruminations about whether or not this construction can possibly generalize. And so, what this would require is that if you wanted to get a Veroswara minimal model where the two parameters differed by Where the two parameters differed by some positive integer v, then if v is not one, so if it's greater than one, then you're going to have to figure out how to make sense of what physicists call fractional level with Simina-Witten models. So we want our affine vertex operator algebra, but we want the level to be a fraction rather than a non-negative integer. Okay, so it turns out a couple of years later, Katz and Wakimoto realized that these are precisely the levels for SL2 where nice things. For SL2, where nice things happen to characters. And so, in particular, they're able to prove nice theorems. And if you like, the highest weight category, the analog of category O at these levels was found to be semi-simple. It was found to be finite. It's not Q-finite, but you can't have everything. And Captain Wakamoto showed that if you take these irreducible characters, you can. That if you take these irreducible characters, you get vector-valued modular forms, and so this is something which led everybody in the physics community to say, aha, we actually now have rational conformal field theories at these admissible levels. And so we can do conformal field theory. Great. But unfortunately, this doesn't work very well. I'm sure this is all very well known to you, but in 88, Herlinda proposed his formula for the fusion coefficient of a rational conformal field theory. Of a rational conformal field theory. And then Lauren Zeiberg showed modulo some pretty non-trivial assumptions that you can get this formula directly from the internal consistency requirements for a conformal field theory. And so the basic take-home message there is that all rational conformal field theories should satisfy the Linda formula and Huang eventually proved this modulo some constraints on what it means to be rational, tightening that up appropriately. Appropriately. So that's great. But the problem is that if you take the Valinda formula and you plug in the S matrix that Katsunbokimoto wrote down for our admissible level SL2 theories, the ones which you might have thought were rational, things don't work. You always get negative fusion coefficients, always. So this is when k is not a non-negative integer, of course. And so lots of physicists work on this, and this was considered to be a rather difficult problem. Considered to be a rather difficult problem. And if you read the big yellow CFT textbook, you can find in the very last chapter a summary of what was known at the time, which was unfortunately not very much. And they famously included a little phrase which said that these fractional level Wessemina-Witten models were in some sense physically sick. So there's something badly wrong going on with these models. And the point is, of course, that. And the point is, of course, that these things are not rational. So I think there was a bit of a miscommunication between the physics and mathematics communities because already by 95, Droughton and Anton had already proved that these admissible level theories, VOAs, admitted an infinite number of irreducible modules. And in fact, what they proved was that they admit an infinite number of what we now They admit an infinite number of what we now call relaxed modules. More history relating to this. So, in 1997, we have Fagan, Semikartoff, and Tipunin who were studying the relation between SL2 and the Kazama-Suzuki construction for n equals 2 minimal models. And they showed that if you want to get all the highest weight modules for the Kazama-Suzuki N equals 2 theories, then you can't just start with highest weight modules on the SL2 side, you have to start with what we know. You have to start with what we now call relaxed highest weight modules. And so these were the guys who actually introduced the term relaxed highest weight modules. They also introduced what physicists called spectral flows of highest weight module in order to get a complete description relating n equals 2 and admissible level SL2. All right, so in 2000 there's a series of papers. So in 2000, there's a series of papers by Maldasina Uguri and occasionally some other people. And they were studying the Western Minneapolis-Witten model for the non-compact lead group SL2R. And so in their proposal, they had many, many, many relaxed modules and their spectral flows. And these were, in some sense, the centerpiece of the spectrum. So all of this sort of became bread and butter in a sense. In 2001, Matthias Gabardiel showed. 2001, Matthias Gabadiel showed that if you take the special admissible level minus four-thirds, which Drajan's also mentioned a couple of times, and if you look at the highest weight category, okay, well, that's not even closed under taking fusion products, which is a bad thing for CFT. And he showed that if you want a physically consistent category at this particular level, then not only do you have to include some relaxed modules and their spectral flows, but you also Flows, but you're also going to get what Dratten calls logarithmic modules. So there was lots of work done in the early days, which essentially said this is horribly non-rational, and that should be really how we should try to understand these fractional level wisdom in other principles. I will say very quickly that one of my entry points into this back in 2010 was. Was trying to understand how this related at the level minus one-half, which is of course very, very closely related to the digital ghosts. And so, here there are links to the singlet and triplet models. It's equals minus two. So there's, you know, as Grajman discussed right at the very end of his talk, heaps of relations between these models and other interesting models that physicists and mathematicians have been studying for quite a long time. Studying for quite a long time. All right, so overview: what is a relaxed high-sweet module? So, let's take the standard basis for SL2, E, F, and H. We're going to affinize in the usual way. I'm always going to assume that a subscript on a Lya element indicates that affinization, where the loop parameter is raised to the power of the subscript. So, once you have constructive So, once you have constructed your affine-Katz-Moody algebra, then you can make a triangular decomposition. In this case, we're not going to use the standard one, we're going to generalize the definition to allow the part in the middle, which would normally be the Cartenson algebra, but in this case it's not. We're going to allow this to be non-abelian. So, we're going to take all the zero modes, put them in the middle, take all the negative modes, take all the positive modes, where negative, positive, and zero. Positive and zero refer to the power of t. Okay, so this is a generalized triangular decomposition, so you can do generalized highest weight theory with this. And that's really all that relaxed refers to in this case. So a relaxed highest weight SL2 hat vector is really nothing more than a simultaneous eigenvector for the Carton subalgebra, but it has to be annihilated by all the modes with a strictly positive index. So this subalgebra here. This sub-algebra here. And if you want to define a relaxed highest weight SL2 module, SL2 hat module, you just copy the definition of a highest weight module, but replace highest weight vector by relaxed highest weight vector. Super easy. Okay. And once we know how to do this for the affine algebra, then of course we can restrict this to our favorite vertex operator algebras because as we know, all modules over affine vertex operator algebras are automatically modules. Algebras are automatically modules over the affine algebra. So that's what a relaxed highest weight module is. But sometimes it's better to sort of visualize these things. So not only do we include highest weight modules in this, we also include their conjugates. So if in a highest weight module, E0 is annihilating the highest weight vector. In the conjugate case, that just means you swap and F naught annihilates. But when we talk about relaxation, When we talk about relaxed modules, the emphasis tends to be on cases where you have a top space where you don't have a highest weight or a lowest weight vector for the horizontal subalgebra S of 2. So if I draw it, I might say, okay, here is my top space. This is a space of minimal conformal dimension, conformal weight. And so here I have a relaxed highest weight vector, and I can act on it with E0 as many times as I like. I never get zero. And I can act with F naught as many times as I like, and I never get zero. And I never get zero. So that's sort of an example of the typical relaxed module for SL2 that we might encounter. So the first thing to note here is that because we still have this generalized triangular decomposition, all of these relaxed highest weight modules are positive energy. There is a minimal conformal weight, and that means that you can do Jew theory on them and perform classification. And perform classification arguments. And in a sense, this is the natural category of wave modules for which Jews theory applies. So it's a very natural thing to do in VOA theory and comparable field theory. Okay, so if we look at LKSL2, my brief was to describe with an example exactly how relaxed modules work and what type of categories they form. So let's look at So let's look at Drashan and Anton's classification back in 95. I am going to use terminology or rather the, I'm actually going to follow a scheme which Simon and I wrote down in 2015, so 20 years later. We have two types of parameters, one which I'll call Lambda RS and one that I'll call delta RS. There's some crazy formulae, which Which I actually have written this down wrong, which is rather embarrassing. So, the thing is, I have the power to change these things. Let me just scribble out the minus u, not that it really matters. So, this is the formula for conformal weights of cell two highest weight modules, and this is the formula for the highest weight itself. So, the classification for admissible. For admissible level SL2 VOAs, the simple VOAs, is in four parts. So we have what we call the ordinary or Q finite highest weight modules, and these are labeled by one parameter R, which runs from U1 up to U minus 1. I forgot to say that here the level is being parametrized by co-prime integers U and V, each of which is at least 2. We have highest weight modules, which I'm going to call H. And so now two parameters. They're conjugates. So those are not isomorphic to the highest point modules. They're different. These would have the top space being a Verma module for SL2, and this would be the dual Verma module of the top space. And then, of course, we have our lovely relaxed modules. And so we have. And so we have finitely many Q-finite modules, finitely many highest weight modules, finitely many conjugates, but then we have a continuous or uncountable infinity of relaxed modules. And we have families with a discrete parameter, but then there's this extra label lambda, which can take values in basically a torus or a circle. A torus or a circle. So if I go back, what that corresponds to, this lambda is essentially the SL2 weight of these states. And because that can change by 2 as we move along, and it doesn't matter which one we start with, then in fact, this parameter is naturally an element of C modulo to Z, or if you prefer the Cartens of algebra, the dual of the Cartesian subject. Of algebra, the dual of the governance of algebra, modulo, the root lattice. Okay, so all right, so this is the classification. We know when these modules are isomorphic to one another, which is very rarely, and we know the vacuum module, just in case you care, that's the OA itself, and that occurs when we take the Q finite ordinary module with R equals one. So I've drawn some pictures so you can get a sense. So, you can get a sense. Q finite modules kind of look like this. You've got a finite-dimensional SL2 representation on the top. Here we go with the highest weight. You've got a SL2 Verma module on the top, and the conjugates have a dual Verma module. And the relaxed modules have what some people call dense SL2 modules, which means that the top is an irreducible module, but its weight support is maximal. And as I said before. And as I said before, here we get families. So the relaxed modules outnumber all of the heights weight modules and their friends by an infinity to one margin. All right, so we also have spectral flows of these things to worry about. And so let's just very briefly go through what this means. There's conjugation, which is not so important, but we saw an example on the last couple of slides. On the last couple of slides. So there's a conjugation automorphism of like so. And you can twist the action of SL2 hat, or if you prefer, of the corresponding vertex algebra by this automorphism and define new representations. Spectral flow is also an automorphism of the affine algebra. So it's defined in this way. I've written out the formula that you don't need to know about. Written out formally, but you don't need to know what they are, it's easy to work out. You can also twist by these, and so you can take a representation M of your vertex algebra and turn it into a new representation by twisting by spectral flow. And probably important to note that because these automorphisms preserve the cartoon of algebra, when you perform this twisting, what you're doing is you're constructing a What you're doing is you're constructing invertible functors on an appropriate category, right? Because we're preserving the cardinals of algebra, an appropriate category in this case, is a category of all weight modules of SLF we have. All right, now if you perform this twisting, then you're not going to preserve the notion of being highest weight or lowest weight, and this is related to the fact that spectral flow automorphisms do not preserve the Virasoro zero note. This is, in fact, the reason for the name spectral flow conspicuous. Reason to name spectral flow is because the eigenvalues are all not out of the spectrum. This is a nice little picture to sort of indicate what spectral flow does to the relaxed ice weight modules that we've already classified. So here is one of our Q finite modules. When you spectrally flow it, you end up with a highest weight module. And if you sort of inverse spectral flow it, you'll get the conjugate of a highest weight module. Of a highest weight module. But if you spectral flow again, you're going to get something where the conformal weights are no longer bounded below. And this is very bad from a physics point of view, but it's perfectly fine from a mathematics point of view. Perfectly fine. So in particular, this picture here represents an irreducible module of 50 away. It's not valid below, so it's not in our classification, but the way life is. And we can do this for the And we can do this for the other highest weight modules. You can see you also get these, and also for the relaxed high-sweat modules. And as soon as you start applying any spectral flow at all, you'll end up with modules which are unbounded below. Well, that's fine, but it's an immediate consequence of some old work of Fatorni and Filke that once you have applied spectral flow to the positive energy modules that we classified before, you actually That we classified before, you actually get every single possible irreducible in the weight category of your SL2 BOA. Feels like I'm talking a lot. Does anybody have any questions? Alrighty, so we've classified the irreducibles in the weight category. I'm going to call that WK, and this is a category. Going to call that WK, and this is a category which I'm going to be talking about pretty much exclusively. So, this category, unfortunately, is not semi-simple. You go back to the highest weight category, okay, that turns out to be semi-simple for these NVOAs. The weight category is not, and that means that one has a chance to do some logarithmic things. So, in particular, what I glossed over and didn't go. Oh, what did hang on? Here it is. When we had our classification of the relaxed highest weight modules, we said that there's this continuous parameter lambda, which naturally lives in this circle or torus, whatever you want to call that. Cylinder, perhaps. But you have to exclude a couple of points. And the reason why you have to exclude those is that those are precisely the point where these relaxed modules degenerate. Relaxed modules degenerate and basically decompose. They become reducible, and in fact, you can see very quickly that they have two composition factors: one of which is a highest weight module, and the other of which is the conjugate of a highest weight module. So that's pretty awesome. That means we've got some non-semi-simplicity happening, and it's in a very, very simple to analyze way. Probably the most important thing to remember here is that the relaxed highest weight module Is that the relaxed highest weight modules as a family are almost semi-simple? And I mean almost here in a sort of a measure-theoretic sense, right? So, we have this family which is parametrized by a measurable space. In this case, it's C mod 2Z. So it's just a cylinder. It's a measurable space. And so you can just put your Ha measure on it. That happens to be a Lie group. So you can have a Ha measure on it. And with respect to that measure, almost all of the parameters give you an irreducible. Give you an irreducible relaxed module. This is what I mean by almost semi-simple families. The irreducible here, when we take our parameter lambda so that the relaxed module and the spectral flows are irreducible, it turns out it's actually not hard to prove that these are both projective and injective in the category of weight modules. So that's that's sort of that's it's. That's sort of, it's basically the same as what happens in more familiar theories like rational conformal field theory. All of the irreducibles are projective and injective. And the same is true for the free boson. The fox faces are projective and injective in the appropriate category of weight module. So what does this mean for our category WK? It means that it breaks up into an uncountably infinite number. Into an uncountably infinite number of semi-simple blocks, which correspond to these 2Z here, and then you'll have a finite number of non-semi-simple blocks. So it really is almost semi-simple. And those of you who know Lee Super Algebra theory will remember that Kat introduced terminology way back in the olden days to say that when you have a semi-simple block, you refer to it as the typical. And if you have a non-semi-simple block, you call it atypical. You have a non-semi-simple block, you call it atypical. And the idea is that the atypicals are in some sense a bit rarer, more interesting for sure, but rarer. So that's exactly what we see for these affine VOAs, these simple affine VOAs. We see many, many, many typical blocks and just an occasional atypical block. And so if you look at what it means to be a typical module, all you can do is take finite direct sums of our spectral flows of irreducible relaxed modules. Of irreducible relaxed modules. But then there's the atypical ones. And in particular, you'll see that the vacuum module is always atypical. It is not a direct sum of spectral flows of relaxed modules. It's always atypical. And that's, of course, expected. Your category is going to be nice. Then you don't want the tensor units to be projective. Otherwise, you're going to have a boring category. That thing is important. All right. All right, so if you want to understand the atypical block of a weight category, WK, well, logarithmic modules. So, Drajan has talked about these at some length, and so I will refer back to Gabadiel's original paper in 2001, where he showed that at level minus 4-3rd, that there existed at least two logarithmic modules. He didn't construct them explicitly, of course. What he did was he used Did was he used what's called the Naam-Gabadiel Causch algorithm to investigate a fusion products? And these fusion products he was able to determine, he couldn't construct them completely, but he was able to construct enough of them to show that they exhibited logarithmic behavior. And so these are logarithmic modules. Anton Andrajin constructed these Constructed these examples explicitly in a subsequent paper. It's sort of k minus one-half fusion computations, which do the same thing. And of course, as Drajan pointed out in his recent work, he has now, using inverse quantum Hamiltonian reduction, come up with the correct way to construct these things, in my opinion. And this works for all the admissible levels for SL2. It's a beautiful story, which you've already heard. So the point is that you can get these. So, the point is that you can get these logarithmic modules. So, I'm going to call them PRS, where P stands for projective. And here we get a finite number. But of course, you can take spectral flows of these, in which case you can get an infinite number. But the point is, you still have a discrete number of these projected. And so the structure of these is this sort of diamond structure, which is very, very familiar to people who look at non-semi-simple algebra. It's sort of one of the It's sort of one of the simplest kind of structures that you can find. So, this is a nice familiar example. You'll see that the head and the soccle of the projected module happen to coincide. I should say that this thing here is what we call a Lervy diagram. So the soccle is the maximal semi-simple submodule, and the head is, of course, the maximal semi-simple quotient. Quotient. And what we have is we have the action of the Virusoro zero mode, which is non-semi-simple. And in this case, it has a rank 2 Jordan block. Essentially, what happens is that you have, well, let's start down here. In the soccle, you have a highest weight vector. This is a highest weight module. And it has a partner up here. Up here, right? So this is in the quotient. So instead of having a highest weight vector here, you have something which is only highest weight in a quotient. And when you look at the construction carefully, what you find is that when you act on the not quite highest weight vector, which generates our whole projective here, you act with L0, you end up getting L0 minus the eigenvalue. Minus the eigenvalue will give you the highest weight vector down here. So you have an L0 eigenvector in the soccle and you have its rank two Jordan partner in the head. And so this is the non-semi-simple action of L0, which makes this a logarithmic module. All right, so I've called this a projective module, but in fact, as far as I know, this is still conjectural. I think that for certain levels this is known rigorously, but in general it's not. So maybe Thomas can tell us if he has indeed found a proof of this yet. But what I wanted to do here was draw you a little picture to sort of give you a sense for what these projective modules look like. And so they look a little bit scary. So here is our highest weight module, the soccle, and of course the head being the same. And of course, the head being the same, so I've sort of overlaid that. So there's two copies of HRS, which is sort of sitting looking like that. And then we've got a conjugate highest weight module, which is also a spectral flow. And then we have a positive spectral flow of a highest weight module. And now we have something which is unbounded below. So these projective modules are also unbounded below, which is something which is perhaps a little scary to some people, but that's the way it is. Where it is. And what I've drawn here is I've sort of drawn the action of some of the modes on the generating state. So you can sort of see here the HRSs. There's like the highest weight vector of the Jordan partner. Here is the corresponding, I hesitate to call it a conjugate highest weight vector. And here is the spectrally flowed highest weight vector. And so what you can see is that if you start with the generated That if you start with the generator for the head, which is not a highest weight module, you can act on it with E0 and you end up over here in the conjugate highest weight module, or you can act on it with F1 and you end up up here at the generator at the spectrally flown highest weight module. And then you can come back down again, act with E minus one or F naught, and instead of landing back on the head, you land back on the highest weight vector of the socket. And from this picture, it's now very obvious if you look at the Superwaric structure that L0 takes you from the head to the top. Easy calculation. All right, so that's a picture of what these projectors look like, or these conjectural projectors look like. Let me finish by just describing this in a more maybe mathematical way instead of in a pictorial way. So you can look at these projectives as being extensions. Projectives as being extensions of spectral flows of relaxed bias weight modules, but now the atypical ones, the ones which are reducible. All right, so here I've got these relaxed biosweight module here, which corresponds to this red circle over here. So we have two irreducible modules which combine together to form a reducible relaxed module. And the same thing here, even though we have an extra spectral flow, and then put them all together. And then put them all together for projected. All right, so if you look at this, and if you talk to anybody who works with non-semi-simple category theory, or algebra theory, I should say, they will tell you that this is very indicative and suggestive that these spectral flows of relaxed modules should be considered standard modules for your weight. Standard modules for your weight category. And standard modules here is meant in the sense that sort of the analogue of Vermonter modules in category O. So in particular, you have standard modules, you have their duals, which you can call co-standard modules. And what this picture up here is telling you is that you have a filtration of the projective module by standard modules. And if you take duals, this projective is self-defense. This projective is self-dual, that's why it's also injective. That means that you would have a projective, sorry, a resolution, not a resolution, a filtration of this module by the co-standards as well. So in fact, what we have is a really nice situation where all the projectives are not only projective, they're also tilting modules. And you can check, pretty obvious, that you're also going to have Bernstein Girlfriend, Girlfund reciprocity holding. Of unreciprocity holding in this category, which means that if you look at the multiplicity of the standard modules in the projective, it's the same as the multiplicity of the irreducibles in the standard modules. So it's about as nice as you can get categorically from this point of view. But the hard point is, of course, that you have to prove things like projectivity and so forth. But the idea is that you. Is that you have a nice set of standard modules which sort of interpolate nicely in between the irreducibles and the projected covers. All right. Anybody have any questions at this point? How thought of the categorical picture that I was asked to get across? Can I ask you a quick question? Please. Yeah, so supposing that. Yeah, so supposing that the piece are really the projectives, which I understood is not for sure, then the fact that the sockle and the top are isomorphic is very interesting from the categorical point of view, because it shows that the Nakayama involution is trivial. Is this a generic feature beyond SL two, or is this specific for SL two? I would guess that this need not be generic. Need not be generic. So, for some other Lie algebras, it could be different. Well, in all the examples I know, this was true, I think. But I think what I would normally expect would be that the top and the soccer might be related by an involution, so for example, conjugation. Say, for example, conjugation would be my guess as to what might happen to generalize this. But I don't have any examples to substantiate that. Do you have SL3 examples? The only example where I know this structure is in unpublished work, which we're desperately trying to finish with Thomas and Matt Rupert. But in that case, Rupert. But in that case, the level is sufficiently small that we don't see any such involution. I'm not sure. Okay, thank you. And David, can I interrupt? Of course. No, I just wanted to say, since Christoph raised this, that Kazuya, Tomiyuki, and IV have approved that these pieces are projective. Are projective. So it is a theorem, but it will maybe take another month until it appears. You will mention it tomorrow. Great to meet you. That's good. Perfect. It will be announced tomorrow morning at one o'clock for me, 1 a.m. Yay. All right. So I had a quick question as well. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Do you know what property? What do you know what property of the vertex algebra leads to BGG reciprocity? Is it just a miracle here? Look, how generally would you expect it? Yeah, I'm not convinced that this is a miracle. I think that this is something which we've observed in almost all examples in which we're actually able to realize categories are very hard to analyze. Analyze. As you know, this is kind of a miracle if you just look at arbitrary finite-dimensional associative algebras, right? It doesn't happen very often. But when it does happen, it's super interesting. And as a physicist, I'm always very attuned to the idea that miracles happen because physicists are interested in nice algebra. So my guess is that this is a very, very common phenomenon for the types of categories. Phenomenon for the types of categories that we want to consider. Now, if you go to the universal VOA and study the weight category, it's a total mess. There is still a sort of a version of this, but yeah, that I wouldn't expect things to work out nearly as nicely. But yeah, for these admissible levels, everything is very nice. I think an excellent test for how generic this is would be. For how generic this is, would be to go to higher rank and look for some of the non-admissible levels which are not universal. So we don't have a lot of understanding of those cases. Drajon has studied a few examples, I know. And I think Tomi, Yuki, and Anne have a few sort of results for theory, but they're much better placed to talk about this, I think. I would be trying to. I would be trying to understand those categories, which is an incredibly difficult problem. But there, there, I think one might, you know, that would be a testing ground for me. I would expect admissible levels to see something like this fairly generically. I could be totally wrong. Thank you. It's very interesting for sure. Any more questions? All right, so I don't think. All right, so I don't think I have a huge amount of time. So, as I said, it was probably unlikely that I'd get to everything. So, let me try to briefly recap modularity. David, you started 10 minutes late, so you still have some time. Okay, so I still have what 10 minutes, 11 minutes, something like that. But if you keep to the 50 minutes, you have 10 minutes, yeah. But if you don't, yeah. Okay, so I will uh. Okay, so I will endeavour not to bore you too much with details. But for me, the interesting or the motivation for introducing these relaxed modules in the first place was modularity. So you know in rational CFT, modularity is everything. And as I said earlier, the key problem back in the mid-90s was the failure of the Belinda formula for these SL2 theories. So now that we know. So now that we know that we have to have a continuum of relaxed highest weight modules, we can ask: you know, can we satisfy the modularity requirement needed for constructing consistent conformal field theories? So just to remember, for affine theories, we don't necessarily have Q finite characters, so we need to introduce an extra variable to make the generating functions. To make the generating functions work, we need the multiplicities to be finite. So our characters are going to involve a Z and a Q. That's fine. And you remember that the modular group SL2Z is supposed to act on our characters. So when you have rational CFT, you have vector value module forms. So what that means is that you have finite dimensional representation of your modular group on the span of the characters. On the span of the characters, the irreducible characters. So, what I wanted to get across here was that there is a subtlety which is related to the character formula that Katsun Mokimoto wrote back in 1988. So, you know, you write out the character and it looks a little bit complicated, but for SL2, you can put it in a form which seems quite nice. And what you'll see is that the denominator, which is basically just that you. Denominator, which is basically just a Jacobi theta function, is going to have some zeros. And so your character potentially then has poles. The only way that you cannot have poles is if you have zeros in the numerator, which cancel the ones in the denominator. Now, this is also a theta function, so that's quite possibly true. And what you see if you do the math is that you see that the zeros in the numerator are only going to cancel those in the denominator if the zero. cancel those in the denominator if v is equal to 1. So remember that I've written k plus 2 is u over v, so it's the denominator of the level which tells you whether or not you have this cancellation. And what that means is that if v is equal to 1, then the characters, the poles cancel and you end up with nice functions which are holomorphic in z. But if v is greater than 1, which means that we're now dealing with our admissible level Now, dealing with our admissible level or fractional level applied VOAs, then they don't cancel. And so that means that you have poles in the Z plate. Here I've written it as Z squared plate, but whatever. You have these poles. And so what that means is that when you take the Katsuakamoto formula, you have to then expand it around z equals zero in a Laurent series to recover the multiplicities. To recover the multiplicities of the weights. And as we all learnt in complex analysis, when you choose your Laurent series, you're going to have to choose which annulus to expand it in, because the different poles will now delineate different annuli of convergence. You'll get different answers depending on which you expand in. And so this was first noticed, as far as I'm aware, back in 2000. As far as I'm aware, back in 2002 by these people. The upshot is that the character formula that Kats and Mokimoto write down is meromorphic in Z, but not holomorphic. And so if you don't specify the annulus of convergence, then how do you know whether you're getting the right multiplicities? And so it turns out that it's worse than that because the modular S transform. Because the modular S transform doesn't preserve these annuli of convergence. So that makes it very unclear as to whether taking modular transform of the Catwalk emotion characters is even meaningful. If you're not preserving the convergence regions, then arguably you're not actually performing a modular transformation. So the third thing which So, the third thing which one should really look at is that you can take the character formula and you can apply spectral flow to it. And what you find is that after a few iterations, you get back to where you started. And that sort of tells you that you've got many, many non-isomorphic, irreducible modules. But according to Katsukamoto, they have the same character. And that's extremely bad if you're trying to do module analysis. So, if you are going to take the sort of the meromorphic catswalker motor characters, then they're not linearly independent. And so, in particular, you can find that the character of some highest weight module is, in fact, even minus the character of some spectrally flown highest weight module. And then, if you go back to our study of relaxed modules, you find that according to cats and blocking mode. You find that according to Katz and Wokimoto, the character of your relax modules is zero. So here we're taking the atypical or the reducible relax modules, which have two composition factors, this one and this one. So when you sum them up to get the character, you get zero. So basically, this tells you that starting from the cat's booking motor formulae is a horrible mistake. You should not do that. And the reason is that you're not preserving the convergence regions with your modular. Convergence regions with your modular transforms. You can't use them. So analysts know how to deal with this kind of thing. And the remedy is to not look at these functions as meromorphic functions on the Z, but to regard them as distributions. So I really don't have time to go into this in detail, but the idea is that if you have two functions which are supposed to be expanded on Supposed to be expanded on different convergence regions, but those convergence regions are delineated by, let's say, a pole like this, then you should treat them as distributions so that you not only figure out how the sun behaves when you meromorphically extend, but you also figure out how the sun behaves at the pole. And that's really where the information. Hole, and that's really where the information is. So I'm going to skip that and just say if you carefully thumb these characters as distributions rather than as meromorphic functions, what you find is that you get zero everywhere except at the pole which separates the two annuli of convergence. And there you get a very specific form for the For the character of the relaxed module. And so, what you get is you get a delta function. This is a Dirac comb, I suppose, which is supported at the pole. And the prefactor multiplying it turns out to be a Virasoro minimum model character. And this was, you know, amazing. So, Thomas and I wrote this down in 2013, and we were blown away by this amazing coincidence. Why are there Virasoro characters? And Characters. And of course, such things were sort of known, old work of Mukai and Hander. It sort of said that you can get Virasaura characters as residues of highest weight SL2 modules. But this was literally just a factorization. It was much more explicit. And of course, Drajan's inverse quantum Hamiltonian reduction explains that perfectly. It's the right way of understanding this. Of understanding this. So, to cut a long story short, this is essentially how you fix the Katsua Pomoto module again for these affine VOAs. So what you do is you look at your standard modules, which in our case are spectral flows of relaxed modules, and compute their characters as distributions. Their characters as distributions. So there's a complicated formula here, which includes the spectral flow index L. And then you, as Thomas and I showed back in 2013, then you show that the span of the standard characters supports an action of the modular group. So the T transform is obvious, can't be bothered writing that down. But the S transform, this looks complicated, but it's really not. This looks complicated, but it's really not. There's some automorphy factor which is fairly straightforward to figure out. And what you have to do is you have to, of course, replace the finite sum that you have in rational conformal field theory by a sum over all the parameters of the standard modules. So you sum over the spectral flow index, you sum over the, let's call them Virasoro labels R and S. And now you have to also integrate over the continuous parameter. And here we're integrating over a circle. Integrating over a circle. So we're restricting to real weights. And when you do so, you find that the S transform is extremely simple. You get the S matrix of the Virusoro minimal models, and you get a mysterious exponential factor. And of course, after Drajan introduced his inverse quantum Hamiltonian reduction factors, it became extremely clear that this, of course, corresponds to the Virusor. This, of course, corresponds to the Nurasora minimal model. And this is, of course, the S transform for the pi-naught theory, pi-naught vertex operator algebra, the half-lattice. All right, and so you look at this S transform and you convince yourself that it has exactly the same properties that you expect in a rational conformal field theory. And so, in this sense, the category of weight modules is modular. Now, I'm out of time, so I am just going to say that is the S. The S-transform of the standard modules. If you want to study things like the Belinda formula, you remember from the Belinda formula, you can have any modules you like being fused together, but you need to have the S-transform of the vacuum module as well, and that is always atypical. And so, in this case, we have to do some work to get the S-transform of the atypical representations. And so, here's And so here's a formula. And I don't want to say too much about it, except that once again, you've got this, you've got something which looks like a pi naught, but now you've got a denominator. And this comes from resolving the irreducible highest weight module in terms of standard modules. And what this means in particular is that your S matrix element can have a pole, right? So lambda here is our continuous parameter, and so it's a function of lambda prime. function of lambda prime you can have poles that's very interesting but of course you're integrating over it so it's possible to integrate over poles and that that works very well and when you do the linda formula you find that your answers can be written out explicitly in terms of virasaura minimal model fusion coefficients and you'll see that the the the fusion coefficients are always non-negative integers so it's either this or this sign It's either this or this sum, always non-negative, which is something which is not true if you just naively apply the catapult emoto character formulae. All right, so I am over time and I apologise. There was a bigger picture, but you can guess this works for so many other examples, so many other examples. So we believe that this is the right way to understand a vast variety of logarithmic conformal field theories. There is a little outlook. There is a little outlook there, and I will go back to that in a sec. But I wanted to show you a little picture and ask you, if you don't have any questions for me, maybe you can just guess where this picture was taken. Thank you very much. I'll put the output back up just in case anybody wants to have. Up just in case anybody wants to have a sticky pig. Thanks a lot, David. That was very nice. Yeah, everybody, please ask questions. Can I ask another question, David? Please do. What is known about rigidity of these categories? Basically, nothing. I mean, we certainly believe that all of these categories are rigid, but Categories are rigid, but no, I don't know how to show this. So I think I unfortunately missed Simon's talk, but I assume that he talked about the rigidity of the corresponding category for the beta gamma ghosts. So it should be straightforward to convert that into a rigidity result for SL2 at level minus one half. I would guess that this is also something which Also, something which one can prove for all the other levels, but I think rigidity is always very hard. I don't know the state of the art, though, so if anybody has already proven that, then please raise your hand. And you would, in particular, expect that the tensor product is exact? Yes. So in order to even in order to, well, so we assume that the tensor product is exact. We assume that the tensor product is exact so that we can write down a we can we can write the fusion product down for the growth indicator group of the of the weight category. We don't know this to be true, but it surely is. Now, there are examples where we can apply the same techniques where we know that we do not have exact categories and that's super interesting. So in the in the In the list here, you can see that the same techniques work for the singlet models, and we've actually been able to apply it even in the case where the singlet VOA is not simple, and so the weight category is not rigid. And so, interestingly, the methodology in this case, what it does is it basically works in the quotient category where you have basically set all the non-rigid modules to zero. Set all the non-rigid modules to zero. It's sort of interesting the way it sort of does the best it possibly can with the information at hand. Okay, thank you. Very welcome. David, do you have an idea how to prove a Linda's formula? Of course not. No, I'm sorry. I have no idea how to prove it, but No idea how to prove it, but I mean, I really do feel that. I mean, if I can go back to the Moore-Zeiberg approach, which of course is not a complete proof, but it does point out very strongly that it's a consistency requirement of all CFTs that there should be some modular. Should be some modularity and some version of the Valinde formula. Now, there are some examples where we know that the Valinda formula doesn't immediately apply. And so, for example, if you try to apply the Valinda formula to simple epic fermions and the triplet models, so I guess the triplet model, it doesn't work. And the reason essentially why it doesn't work is that instead of having this. Instead of having this almost semi-simple behavior in your category, now you find that the atypicals take up a set of non-zero measure in your parameter space. And so in the case of the triplet model, you have sort of two projective irreducibles, and then you have two irreducibles which are not projective. You still have the standard modules. You still have the standard modules, but you only have two of them. And then, so two typical and two atypical. And so, what that means is that essentially the Blunder formula doesn't work because you can't integrate over the poles that you get for the two atypical standard modules. I mean, you're summing now because you only have four irreducibles. And so it doesn't work. So it doesn't work. But you can analyze that very carefully and sort of extract how you should modify the Belinda formula in order to account for this. And so I believe that in the literature, there are many proposals for the Linda formula. And the one which I get when I modify is actually one which I think Ingo and Matthias Gabadiel wrote down maybe ten or more years ago. More years ago. And you can also do this for the non-simple triplet, and then you get a more complicated version of the Linda formula. So what I'm trying to say here is that the Linda formula, which I'm using here to understand these nice affine VOAs, is not the end of the story. So for the C2co finite list VOAs, you need a more complicated Valinda formula. A more complicated Belinda formula, and it's still early days. People are trying to figure out exactly what that should look like in general. So, I think if we want to prove the Balinda formula, we first need to know what the Belinda formula is. And we may be able to prove in this particular case, but that's very far from being the end of the story. What I was trying to say, yeah, I um. Well, we have more questions, David, Ingo and Tudor.
