Signature, tolero invariant, and the surface subgroup representations in Hermitian semi-simple legions. In network, okay? Thanks a lot. Grateful for the invitation to see Mexico for the first time and to see Oaxaca and to see these wonderful people here. So I want to present some of my humble work with Pierre Pong Shi and Xua Yinwan. It's about try to find some meaningful Try to find some meaningful kind of invariant about some representations and geometric structures and so on. So I'll try to be very basic and try to give more background than the result. So I'll talk about some calculator theory that probably most of you know already. Already. And then, why do I care about some invariant, like totally invariant compared to volumes that David talked about yesterday? And then I move on to some Adia-Zinger index theory and then try to give some signature formula unifying Toledo invariant and some correction terms. And some correction terms. So, mathematicians, they like to classify things, right? If you have a knot, then can this invariant distinguish these knots and so on? So I think it's the same spirit. If you have some group action, some representation, can we tell this guy apart from the other ones? So, as a background, if you have Background: If you have a closed Riemann surface S of genus at least two, then by uniformization theorem, you can give always complex structures. And then that complex structure also can be given the unique hyperbolic metric compatible with these complex structures. But there are tons of different But there are tons of different complex structures. So, accordingly, there are tons of different high public metrics, right? So, just the cartoon picture is if you have just a surface, imagine this is a surface, then you can have a little bit chubby hypothetical surface, and you can. Surface, and you can just pinch along the way. So you can tell that they have a different kind of metric structures. And furthermore, Tychomo space care about how you mark these metrics. So for example, if you cut Cut this hypolytic surface along the closed geodesic here, you just cut it along and glue it. So rotate it by 360 degree and glue it back. I mean, there's an isometry from one to the other, but this isometry is not homotopic to identity. Okay, so we distinguish these two. So, we distinguish these two metric structures. So, Kaikimo space is just a set of marked type public structures or equivalently complex structures or equivalently conformal structures. And people call it Teichmoh space. So, once the closed or negative Euler number surface is given, Surface is given, you can always give a high public metric. High public metric means a constant negative coverature. And usually we normalize the metric so that the covert is minus one. If you put minus four coverature, then the area will decrease. So anyway. But you can also imagine this guy. You can also imagine this guy can be obtained as what is the model space for this guy. And by uniformization theorem, the complex structure given here is the universal cover is just the unit disk, is bi-holomorphic to the unit, the lifted complex structure of this guy upstairs. Structure of this guy upstairs is bi-holomorphic to one guerrilla disk. And this guy has some invariant high-public metric. So this one can be obtained as this one guerrilla disk by some group action. So this is a lattice. So the fundamental group of the surface acts on this guy. So it'll have some fundamental domain and identity. Domain and identifying the edges and so on. So, in that way, we can obtain a homomorphism from a surface group into a gamma, and gamma lies in the automorphism group of the surface. So, gamma is a discrete subgroup of the automorphism group of this Branca Rea disk, which is PS. is T S L 4 R. So for each hypobulic structure, there is a homomorphism, homomorphism, some row. People call for a given hypobulic metric, there is a holonomy representation coming from pi one of s into p s l two r. L to R. So hyperbolic metric gives rise to some homomorphism. So the Tychomo space can be identified with the collection of all these homomorphisms and whose image is a lattice. So it's a discrete and faithful representation from fundamental group of surface into PSL2R and up to. To PSL2, and up to conjugacy. If you just conjugate one representation, we regard them as the same thing because you can find an isometry between this row and rho prime such that the isometries isotopic to identity. Okay. So So, in terms of these representations, people, algebraic geometers, they study character variety. So you collect all these homomorphisms and the conjugate action act there. But there's some difficulties if you just caution out by conjugate action. By conjugate action, the resulting space will not be Hausdorff. So there is something called a geometric portion, anyway. Then this is a geometric portion, and it will have a bunch of different components. And Teichmo space form a component of this character variety. Okay. And so if you are given two different this high probability, Two different this high public metric or representation, how can you tell they are different? For example, if you want to use the area, then you cannot distinguish them by a Gauss-Bonet theorem. The area is just 2 pi times absolute value of the Euler number. So, how do they do you distinguish these two different hyperbolic structures? For example, if you choose like Example, if you choose like a complicated enough system of simple closed curve, like 9g minus 9 curve, and measure the lengths. And if they are different, then they are different point in Teichmond space and so on. So we need a little bit more sophisticated invariant attached to these representations or geometric structures and so on. So that's what I'm going. So that's what I'm going to do using some different KLA form and so on. We define some invariant, then this one belongs to this component of the character variety, and this one belongs to the other component of the character varieties, and so on. Also, PSL to R is an isometry group of Flan-Guerre disk, and PSL to C And PSL2C is the isometry group of the hypervictory space. So we can enlarge this target Lie groups, right? Yeah, so you can study the geometric structure included in a bigger geometric structures. Because this Buanca disk is a totally geodesically embedded object. So, if you use the unit ball model in hypobolic space, this is a unit ball in R3, you give a hypobulic metric here, then H2 sit as a totally geodesic. So, this is H3. So, the action here extends to the H3. 10 to the H3Rs, but the whole isometry group of H3R is PSL2C. And you can actually further embed this guy into a bigger one, something called like H3C, complex hypothetical space. So this one, this, you can realize this guy as a This guy as a round unit ball in C3, also. And you can embed this guy as a totally geodesically symmetric spaces. But the problem is that this guy embeds as a Lagrangian subspace, Lagrangian subspaces. So we are trying to enlarge the We are trying to enlarge the target lead group and see what good things come about this in enlarging these things. We can enlarge PSL2R into PSL3R also. And PSL3R is the automorphism group of RP2. Okay, PSL3R is an automorphism group of RP2. Group of RP Rp2. And this hypobolic structure is a subset of real projective structures. It's a part of the projective geometry, real projective geometry. So if I use PSL3R instead of PSL2R, I care about some real projective geometry. And this real projective geometry is bigger, bigger than this high. Is bigger, bigger than this high public geometry for two-dimensional things. So many people also study the PSL3 Lie group studying this real projective structure, especially convex real projective structures. So you can deform this unit disk inside. Inside P projective PR2, and you can deform this guy, some kind of open domain, but it's not around the circle anymore. And there is still some discrete group acting on here if the domain is nice. And the quotient will be a surface again. So, like Winberg and all these people, they studied nice. And all these people studied in the 1920s to find such kind of non-standard real projective structures. And the set of those marked convex real projective structures is much bigger. The Teichmohn space has dimension 6G minus 6, real dimension, but the convex projective structure has dimension. Convex projective structure has dimension, I think it's 16G minus 16. So it's much bigger. Okay. So in that sense, people call it higher Teichma theory. So it's kind of a Teichunla theory, but the legal group is bigger, and the Teichma theory is a part of this geometric structures and so on. Metric structures and so on. Okay. And the Nigel Hitchin, he studied this kind of phenomena using some equations, and people call it Hicks bundle theory. So he studied this PSL NR inside the PSL NC as a real point and he Real point, and he singled out some component. And people call it hitching component nowadays. So when n is two, this is equal to Teichm√ºller Gearing, but it's much bigger. And later, recently, I think Huang Shua Labui used some dynamics to characterize hitching component, and people call it a NASO representation. People call it anoxic representations. You know, announce of flow, right? If you have a flow, in some direction, it's exponentially expanding and some direction is exponentially kind of contracting. So there is some kind of such a property. And later, not just for a surface group. So Guichar and Vinard, they Guichar and Winard, they studied this kind of phenomena for grom of high public groups. Grom of high public group means for a group, if you have a generating set, you can give a metric. And then with respect to that word metric, if it is delta hyperbolic, people call it Gromov hypocolic. People call it Gromov high public. So they generalize this kind of analsov representation theory to a grom of high public groups. And there's some geometric version using Morse quash geodesics by Michael and Lib and Porky. Okay, so one is more algebraic. One is more algebraic, and the other is more geometric. So, this is a background about what I'm going to do. And if you have any question, you can just stop me and ask. Okay. So, today I'm going to use Hermitian semi-simple Lie groups. So, Lie groups. Lie groups acting on some bounded symmetric domain in complex space and is Hermitian. So it has a K-La matrix and everything. There's another kind of background why I care about this thing. The number theorist, they study this Dedekind function for decades. So tau is a So, tau is a point in the upper half plane. So, tau is a complex number whose imaginary part is positive. That's a Daddykin function. And there's modular group SL2Z. So, in SL2R, you take only integer coefficient, then you get some matrix group, and people call it modular group. People call it modular group, they want to find the modular form of this modular group. And they found it using this data kint eta function. If you raise this thing to the like six power and then the data kint function up to 24 power, and this is invariant under the action of SL2Z. Okay, so and there's a data kin. So, and there's a Dedekint also formula like this. So, this element A, this is just ABCD is an integer, and it sends the tau to like this, A tau B, C tau, then fraction, right? This is a fractional group. And you evaluate eta at this imagery point and take a logarithm, then there's an original one here, and there's a bunch. Original one here, and there's a bunch other here. And I don't want to write it down: what is the data can sum? It is an infinite sum. So there's none, but theories care about these things. They want to find some kind of invariant of modular groups. And by general theory, by the homological property of this modular group, there should be some section, non-vanishing section. Section, non-vanishing section, and that non-vanishing section is exactly this 24 power of this Dadekin function. So this Radmacher, he found some kind of a class function on this modular group. So this is A is A is a dead ABCD matrix. And he defined this thing. And it changed like a dead. It changes like Dadakin formulas. So class function means the value are the same for the conjugate element. If you A and any conjugate of A, they will have the same value. And he found it. And later, Meyer and Ziegl, they computed some value of some L functions at zero. At zero attached to real quadratic fields. Don't be scared by all this number-theoretic terminology. And if you want to know, ask me. So L function is like fraction of some zeta functions. And you know, algebra. Algebra, he calculates some singular defect of a. Defect of a cusp of four-dimensional manifold. So he studied this H2 cross H2 manifold. So H2 cross H2 and the PSL to R cross PSL to R, this guy acts on this thing. So the model space is a folder. So, the modern space is a four-dimensional manifold. So, people call it this is a Hilbert modular surface. And he calculated this singular defect and found out that they are all actually equal. They're all equal up to some constant. And he conjectured this kind of theory should hold for arbitrary. Should hold for arbitrary, totally real number of builds. Okay. And later, there's a history like Mueller, Witten, Killen, Busmu. And finally, Adia, Badudi, Zinger, they introduced some kind of a unifying way to calculate this kind of invariant called geometric L-function and L-ti-invariant. Invariant. And then the signature calculation of a local coefficient system on a surface with boundary by Adir Bato de Zinger, we will kind of use newly defined class function. So it's very similar to this Reidmahaus class function he defined for modular group SA to Z. modular group SA to Z, we are going to define some kind of a class function on this UPQ. And this is discontinuous class function. So whenever there is an eigenvalue one on the matrix, we deal with this kind of index. To calculate index, there's a jump. Collect index: there's a jump whenever there is an eigenvalue one thing, and it's not easy to define a correct. Oops, it became smaller. The screen became a little bit smaller I think this can share it. Thank you. So here's a figure A nod complement. So imagine these two ideal tetrahedra sitting in a high public grid space. If you glue two tetrahedra, If you glue two tetrahedrahedra using this instruction, you will get a figure eight-not complement. So, because these are already objects in H3, there's a volume, right? You can just add the volume of this two-ideal tetrahedra. And the volume become maximal only if this two-ideal tetrahedra is regular. Is regular and you have to glue them correctly. Then you get a complete hypobulic metric on this complement and the volume become maximum. And if the tetrahedra is not regular, obviously the volume decrease. And if you glue not correctly, sometimes there's a like con singularity. Singularity, and even it is not a manifold. But sometimes you can complete this metric structure and you get a dense surge ratings. Okay. You get an incomplete hyperbolic metric. You complete it, then you get a dense surge ratings. But it is known that whenever you do the dense surgery, the volume strictly decreases. So, you can attach a volume to any representation, actually. So, given any representation, how do you associate a volume? It's simple, right? You just take arbitrary some this representation activariant map from a universal cover into the H3, for example, here. For example, here there's no if m is kœÄ1, there's no obstruction to construct such things, and you just pull back the volume form, pull back the volume form on H3, because everything is equivariant. You caution it and this pulled back volume form descend on M and you just integrate over M then ideally. Then ideally you get a volume. Okay. For example, if the representation is a trivial representation, the volume will be zero. Just send everything to a point. So the resident DRM tells you when the volume is maximal, it should be a holonomy representation of the complete hyperbolic structure. That's kind of a rigid theory. This kind of a rigid criteria. Okay. Except that the volume always decreases. Then, oops, what am I going? Yeah. Now I want to change this high public tree space into the other one. So this So, this hypocrite manifold sits inside like complex hypocritic symmetric spaces. And this complex hyperbolic space, we have a K-la form. We have a K-la form. And some power of this thing will become a volume form. A volume volume form up to constant. So if I use this Klaus form instead of the power of this Klaus form, I will get some different kind of invariant attached to these representations. So for example, in H and C, H and R sit totally geodesically, but this is just a totally real thing. So this is a Lagrange. Real thing, so it's a Lagrangian, and this omega just vanishes on this Lagrangian subspace. Okay, so I want to measure how large the representation with respect to this K-love form. Then, for example, you know, you start from the representation. The function representation give rise to a hypothesis. Orientation gives rise to a hypobolic structure on the surface. And you just extend it up to like whatever H and C. And but the invariant I will calculate, it'll give us zero, number zero, because omega is identically zero on this Lagrangian server space. So it's quite different from a volume. So this omega. So, this omega is a volume form along the complex lines, but it's zero along any totally real Lagrangian space. So formally, if you have a closed surface and given representation into a Hermitian symmetric space, a Lie group, how do you measure the largeness of this representation? Measure the largeness of this representation using the K-La form is given by this toler formula. You go to any equivariant map, pull back, portion it down, and integrate, and divide by 2 pi to get some integer number when s is closed. And this is independent of the choice of these things. And people call it political invariant. Okay. So either it could be maximal. For example, you know, the complex hyperbolic space has a coverture between minus one and minus four, actually. Along the complex line, the cover is minus four. And along this H12, Lagrange. H12, Lagrangian, the coverture is minus one. And omega vanish on covert minus one, a Lagrangian space, and it is a volume form on this cover minus four complex lines. So this guy somehow captures where this representation kind of acting on, okay? Does it make sense? Makes sense. And there's an upper upper bound for these tooled numbers coming from covertures and so on. And when it is maximal, maximum is absolute value of the Euler number. Then to leder, he showed this is actually when it is maximal, it should stabilize complex line. stabilize complex line. When it is zero, when it is zero, it stabilizes stabilize the H to R Lagrangian space. So you can do the same thing for any dimension, for any Hermitian symmetric space, modification of this thing. You can even do for Even do for Petonian Kayla manifold. So there's a Kayler, there's a Portonianic Kayler. And you can study how many kind of distinct components in the character varieties. So Polidu himself with his Garashya Prada, they studied the representation from Representation from complex hypocritic space to quaternionic hypobulic space. By the way, there are like four rank one symmetric space. One is real hypobulic, second one is complex hypoblic, third one is quaternionic high public, and fourth one is octonionic hypoblic. These are only four division rings. Okay, so this talk focuses on the Focus on the surface group representation into some Hermitian Lie groups. And there's a general kind of upper bound for this Toledo number. It involves the Euler number of the surface and the real rank of the Lie group. Rear rank of the Lie group means an associated symmetric space. That's the maximal dimension of Euclidean. Euclidean space, which can be totally geodesically embedded. So rank one means the only maximal Euclidean space totally geodesically embedded is just the line geodesic. Oops. Geodesic. So that means the sectional cover is strictly negative. Rank two mean you can embed H R two, totally geodesically embedded, and so on. Geodesically embedded, and so on. So, and furthermore, I will deal with the surface with boundary. And historically, this kind of mineral, they call it mineral inequality. I think Wood studied the circle boundary of a surface, and then he wants to characterize when this fiber boundary is. When this fiber boundary is a flat fiber bundle, using this inequality. So in undergrad, we teach this Gauss-Panner theorem. Some Riemannian metric is kind of dictated by topology. And maybe in grad course, we teach, you know, there's a version of Gauss-Bernay for four-dimensional manifolds, a signal. dimensional manifold the signature of four dimensional manifold is one-third of the integration of the forced punctuation class so you you know everyone know what signature of four manifold right okay and then finally there's a bridge between uh topology and some analysis that's what adia zinger actually they they did it so if you have a some So, if you have some elliptic differential operator between smooth vector bundles E and F over a closed manifold, then this topological index is astonishingly equal to the analytical index of this operator. Okay, so this is one of the great work of Adia and Zinger in this century, I think. Entry, I think. So I'm gonna mimic their kind of things. So, first, they did it for manifold without the closed manifold. Then, if there's a boundary, then there should be a correction term. So, the signature minus one-third of the integration of the punctured class is not zero if there is a boundary. And to get a meaningful kind of a function, f, f should only depend on what? The metric involved in the boundary and then the orientation of the manifold. Right? And using user zeta function, using user zeta function, they cannot distinguish these orientations. So they did this kind of Did this kind of etiquette. For example, if you have some Laplacian operator, elliptic self-adjoint differential operator acting on some Hermitian vector bundle. So the boundary will be, in this example, the boundary will be a closed three manifold. Then you can use the eigenvalues of this self-adjoint differential operator because it's self-adjoint. Operator, because it's self-adjoint. The old eigenvalue is real and discrete. And you can form this infinite series, but they plug in this sign. So it distinguishes the orientation of the manifold. And this function known to be holomorphic at the origin, and the e-time invariant of this operator is given by the evaluation of the thing at zero. So it sounds comfortable. So it sounds complicated, but somehow it gives some kind of a magic formula. This is the formula they prove. The signature of the manifold with boundary is integration term and there is some correction term. Briefly, this is what they did. So I'm going to use a two-dimensional manifold with boundary, the baby example. Baby example. You might think it's trivial, but it is not because the boundary are just the circles, but it's not trivial. So what we are going to do is that the signature of the flat bundle coming from a representation into a Hermitian Legal signature is decomposed into this integration part. And we say this is a totally. We say this is a tortoise part, tolero invariant part, and correction part will be raw invariant. So it's kind of a modification of this edine invariant. And we because we found that this edine invariant is not conjugate invariant. So we have to modify it to be a conjugate invariant. Okay, that is my goal. So here's some kind of baby kind of Baby, kind of application, where do you use this at high invariant, those things? For example, you can ask: Is there any high public three manifold which is totally geodesically bounding like four-dimensional real high public manifold? Not every high public three manifold can bound totally geodesically, you know, four-dimensional high public manifold. Our four-dimensional high-power magnified, right? So, what is the criteria? If you look at this formula, a high-powered manifold is conformally flat. So, this integration vanishes. Okay, so there's a little observation by Long and Reed. So, the signature is equal to just the negative of the etiquette invariant. The etiquette invariant of three manifold. So the criterion that this other dimensional manifold bound this 4k dimensional real high public manifold, poorly geodesically, is that the et time variant of this other dimensional manifold should be integral because the signature is always an integer. But there are tons of hyperbolic three manifold which is not whose at I Not whose eta invariant is not integral. Okay, so this is a very short kind of applications. Then you can ask, are there any high public green manifold, for example, which bound complex high public manifold topologically? And there is one. And there is one, there is one. So using out of the figure, the tap for no figure A not complement, somebody constructed hyperbolic three manifold topologically bounding complex two-dimensional. So it's a real four-dimensional complex manifold. And this is unknown as far as I know. unknown as far as I know can you can you find high public three manifolds topologically bound in a quaternionary hyper public manifold this is unknown I'm not sure you are interested or not but you know as a geometer or topologist not every manifold bound the other manifold so for example if you have a four manifold can you symplectically fill this four manifold so Fill this four manifold so that the bounding three manifold is like a high context structure and so on. It's the similar spirit. Just, I don't care topologically, can you find a high public three manifold, a seven manifold bounding of some quaternionic hypocritic manifold? As far as I know, it is unknown. Now it's getting a little bit technical. Is getting a little bit technical. So, how do I define the signature? So, for example, let's take the easiest example into symplectic groups. Symplectic group is one of the Hermitian Leg. There are four classical Hermitian groups. This is most popular ones. Then you form a flat bundle out of this representation. Should I write how to form a flat band? So, E is a vector, vector vector space such that this S P symplectic group act is simple. You take universal cover cross E and you act by row of phi. That means point here and vector. Point here and vector here. What is the action of the gamma? This is just the gamma x by that transformation. And then phi gamma, this is an element in the symplectic group, and it can act on V. So this is the flat bundle coming from this representation. Okay. Okay. So now you care about the first this cohomology, but the coefficient in this in this flat bundle. So usually we teach the like R or complex constant thing, but here the coefficients are in the simple act, the flat bundles. And you can just use this H1 instead of the image of. H1 instead of the image of this thing. But if you use this quadratic form using a cup product and then there's a syntactic form, this becomes a symmetric quadratic form. So once you choose the basis of H1 of this thing, you will obtain some kind of matrix, symmetric matrix. You diagonalize it. Then there are a bunch of plus signs, there will be a bunch of negative signs. Bunch of negative sign, the difference will be the signature. Okay. But if you just use this thing, there will be like zero eigenvalues. To avoid these zero eigenvalues, we take the image of this thing. And in analysis, it is meaningful because the image topologically, the image can be identified as. Identified as electroharmonic one forms, actually. If you have like closed manifold, then there's always you can decompose the like one form into this harmonic representative. And it's the same thing. But here they do this kind of trick. You have original manifold and take some like a product structure and the bound. A product of structure and the boundary, and you attach an infinitely long cylinder here. Because this is an infinite volume manifold, you have to care about L2 things, square integrable forms. And they showed at the battle, they showed this is equal to this thing. Anyway, you can calculate the signature of these flat boundaries. And the And what we found is that the signature of this flat boundary is some total invariant plus row invariant things. So I'm running out of time. I didn't go halfway. So, to understand this tolerant invariant for the surface with boundary, it's not easy to do. It's not easy to define it as before, just the integration. So we have to go through this Gromov's bounded chromology theory. So how do you define formally? For K-La form, you make some element in the continuous bounded cohomology of the Lie group, and cosycle is given exactly this way. Is given exactly this way. Okay. If you have a representation, we have an element here in the bounded homology, you pull back. Okay, so kappa pulled back to here. So I will not define what is the bounded. You have ordinary kind of cohorts things, right? All these maps, but bounded co-models only care about the code chains whose value. Code chains whose value is bounded and it gives a really totally different kind of a Como's theory. And you pull back by some Gromov's theorem, because this K pi one group and the manifold has the same bounded cohomology. And bounded cohomology does not care about amenable groups because the boundary of surface or circle. Surface or circle, these are amenable, it's just abelian growth, they are equal. So you push this thing up here, and bounded co-chains are contained in singular just co-chains. So you just forget this thing. You treat this thing as if as in the singular relative cohomology, and then you pair with the relative fundamental class. This will be the Little invariant. Why I do this? Because depending on the representation, just you construct a covariant map and pull it back and integrate. The integration might diverge if there's a boundary. So you have to go through all this machinery. And I show you how you kind of. How you kind of calculate some bounded cohorts for the Lie group, this is extremely non-calculable. There are a bunch of definitions, and none of them you cannot calculate by hands. But there are a bunch of theorems useful by proved by Gromup or claimed by Gromuff and filled out the gap by a bunch of the others. And here is the diagram that. And here is the diagram that you have to look at. So, I want to make a concrete kind of integration out of the abstract definitions. I start from some bounded cohomology, a continuous bounded element in second, and you push it, come here up to here, and this is a forgetable map. You forget this bounded chains into ordinary ones. into ordinary ones. This is non. So this is equal to the compactly supported singular cohomology. And this can be isomorphic to the drum cohomology also. So if I just follow the things, you push this thing up to here, but I subtract something here so that this form. That this form is compactly supported. So, these are primitive of these KLA forms. For each boundary, I found this primitive and then multiply some cutoff functions so that they agree along the boundary. So they are zero along the boundary. That means they are compactly supported. And I claim as a bounded class, as a bounded class, they are the Class, they are the same. And there are some theory you can show. What I'm claiming is that as a bounded cohomology element, either you subtract this or not, they give the same kind of class. So abstractly defined, this thing can be actually integrated using this thing. So it becomes very simple. It becomes very simple form like there is a pullback and integration with the manifold with boundary, and then on each boundary, you integrate the primitive things. And then there's definition of this row invariant, actually. And this gives you Later, this gives you all this correct formula, correct formula. So the signature will give you some tolerant invariant plus the row invariance. So, you know, you can do, you can using this explicit form of tolerable invariant, you can prove this. You can prove these mineral root inequalities for different cases. And there is a machinery that we are going to use by this Adia Bato designer things. You have to calculate all these things. You make the Fredolohm operator and so on. And we use his formula again and again. Again and again, and we finally prove this thing signature is tolerable invariant for some row invariant. Row invariant is a class function defined on the group. Okay. And furthermore, there is a mineral inequality formula even for some, oops, even for not just the political invariant. Not just the political invariant, but also for the signatures. So this is completely new, new inequalities. And also, Berger used Venard data defined tolerant invariant using rotational numbers. And their invariant and our invariant are closely related for the elliptic elements. And furthermore, in one of the In one of the Adias paper, to calculate the signature of the flat bundle over a surface with boundary, he has to trivialize forced the Chan class along the boundary. And he used this central extension and he construct a section, section going this way from G to the central extension. And he claimed the And he claimed: so the idea was you chop this surface into a pair of pants. Okay, on each pair of pants, you calculate some kind of a cosycle, signature cosycle. And by gluing formula, you add them up. And then he needs to construct this section. So people call this. Section. So people call this a dear section. And he didn't. He said he can do it, but there's no proof. And here's a concrete formula of his section, Adia section, using our invariant, rho invariant, and lift of rotational numbers and so on. So this is one of the applications of this row invariant to the To the idea as claim. So there's a concrete example you can calculate by hand. It takes less than 30 minutes to calculate these things. So the raw invariant of the hyperbolic isometry is zero. And for elliptic case, it picks up some angles, rotational angles. And for parabolic case, it's always Case is always some value, and you can see row invariant is given by this way, and eta invariant is given by this number. And this number depends on mu, but you can always conjugate this guy to 1101. So you can see eta invariant of the ADIA is not conjugated invariant. But our row invariant, if you add up those things, they just cancel. Those things they just cancel out, and you get some numbers. Okay, so this is now you can play around our formula for hypothetic surfaces. Then you can we can get a better bound for Milner-Wood inequality. Ordinary Milner-Wood inequality just involves this one, but we can pick up like corn angles here, so it's a better bound. Bound and so on. And even we can write it down lower bound and upper bound of the tolerant invariant involving these cone angles. Okay. Okay. I'll stop here. Thanks. Questions from the virtual participants Susie from online questions from the online participants. Any questions? Okay, so if that may be that's thanks to the speaker again. Okay, yeah, next hug is at three.
