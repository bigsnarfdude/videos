This although I'm not currently working on so close topics to the main topic of the conference. So today I'm going to try to relate to some questions which also appear in the field. So just to recall some basic notion about radiating dynamics. So the basic question which we want to address is given two smooth systems, F and G for the discrete time dynamics or Discrete time dynamics or phi T and S for flows which are topologically conjugate, namely that there is some homomorphism which brings the first one to the second one, then when these two systems are smoothly conjugate. Then zero congest basically accounts for the combinatorial structure of the system while The system, while smoother conjugacy may represent finer properties of the dynamics. For instance, we may wonder given some topological conjugacy for two such systems, the first one preserving, for example, the Lebesgue measure, when the conjugacy will preserve this Lebesgue measure. So one instance of this question is in particular when there is some canonical models for the dynamic. Models for the dynamics which we are interested in. And when can we conjugate the system to one of the models? So, to be more concrete, just let me give some examples. So, for the case of the diffomorphisms of the circle, so here the basic model is the rotation of the associate rotation number. And so, if we know that our system is indeed conjugate to such a rotation, when is this conjugate? A rotation when is this conjugacy smooth? Another topic which I'm going to discuss mostly in the following is the case of hyperbolic systems, and the prototype for this is the case of Anosov systems. So with some expansion directions and some contracted directions. And here again, there is somehow some canonical model which comes from algebraic systems to suspend. Algebraic systems, so suspensions of some total automorphisms or geodesic flows of a constant curvature. So, one basic obstruction which I want to point out right now is it comes from periodic orbits. So, when you have some C-zero conjugacy, periodic orbits are indeed some obstructions for a higher regularity of the conjugacy. So, and there's And there is even more to that, which comes from Perdic Orbis in the case of continuous time dynamics. Because if you have zero conjugacy between two flows, then the two flows, if one of them has some periodic orbit, then the other one has to have also some periodic orbit, and the pairs have to match. So each pair is some potential obstruction to even zero conjugacy. About higher regularity of the conjugacy, the basic Of the conjugacy, the basic obstruction coming from periodic orbits is related to the notion of Lyapunov exponents. So let's just assume that we have some homeomorphism H which conjugates F to G. Then if it happens, if H happens to be differentiable, then we may differentiate the relation coming from the conjugacy equation at a given period and that conjugacy. And that conjugates the differential maps. And in particular, at each period point, our two maps F and G have to have the same eigenvalues or the eponymous exponents. So each periodic orbit is some potential obstruction to a smoother conjugacy. So one side of the spectrum is when there is no periodic point at all, when can we indeed go from C0 conjugacy to From C0 conjugacy to C1 conjugacy. So, for example, in the case of minimal dynamics. And in fact, it's a bit too optimistic in this case just to get C1 congestion right there, because even almost periodic things may be obstructions to smaller congregations. So let me just be more concrete in the case of. Be more concrete in the case of circle diffomorphisms. So I'll denote by T just the torus, Tν the complex extension, and T nu, the analytic defaults of the torus with some analytic extension to a certain strip. Then it's well known that a number alpha is called diaphanine if it's badly approximated by rough. Is badly approximated by rationales. And for such numbers, then we may hope that if the rotation number satisfies this property, then the almost periodic obstruction will not appear because, in fact, we are badly approximated by periodic by rational numbers. So, indeed, it was shown by Arnold some local result, namely that when the rotation number is diaphantine, Rotation number is diaphantine, and if we have some diffomorphism, some analytic diffomorphism with that rotation number which is sufficiently close to the rotation T alpha, then indeed there is some analytic conjugacy between our system F and the model T alpha, the rotation. So this is some local result and this kind of local result was improved. Kind of local result was improved later by Jokos and Hermann in particular. So just to recall the definition of Bruno conditions, it's another type of arithmetic condition, which is the following. So relating to the convergence of the rotation number. And then Jokos proved that if the rotation number satisfies this arithmetic property, then for an analytic diffomorphism with that rotation number, With that rotation number, which is sufficiently close to the rotation, then the conjugacy to the rotation is analytic. So in fact, this result by Yokos is optimal, namely, if this arithmetic property is not satisfied, then there exists counterexamples for which the system is not analytically conjugated to the rotation. Analytically conjugated to the rotation. So, this is again some local results. And for the global results in the smooth category, so this was obtained by Amman and Yokos, again for some Diphantine condition, they show that if the diffomorphism has a Diphantan rotation number, then the congenital C to the rotation is C infinity. So this is for C infinity category, and this can be done also in. And this can be done also in CR category, but there is a decrease of the regularity of the conjugates. So, this is just some basic results around these rigidity topics in the case where there is basically no obstruction coming from perdic orbits. Sure. Yeah, so regarding the previous results, is Bruno condition also optimal for, say, For say C1 con having C1 conjugacy? No, no, it's a diaphantine. For smooth categories, it's diaphantine, which is the natural condition. Is it known that it is optimal? I for C1, I don't know, but No, I'm not sure, but I mean, optimality, I think, was just obtained for analytic category, but I'm not an expert in this direction. Okay, thanks. Sorry. So, a conjecture in this direction was proposed by Pricorian, namely that for C-infinity diffomorphism of the Of the D torus, which is a C0 conjugate to the underlying rotation T alpha, then if alpha there again is a diphantine, then the conjugacy should be smooth. This was further generalized by Canin for certain for more general diffomorphisms satisfying some diphonine properties, namely that the orbits don't have two. Orbies don't have to, I mean, the orbies are not chosen to be periodic. In this direction, there are some works, namely by Fonny and Tanigowski, which show that the picture seems to be more complicated than that, and Diefantine condition may be too weak to avoid the existence of uvilent factor in higher dimension. So, there it seems. There, it seems more complicated. And also, even more than periodic orbies, there may be obstructions coming from invariant distributions. So, there are a bunch of obstructions, even for systems without periodic orbits or even with Diphantan properties, for this kind of ridiculity questions. So, in the following, I'm going to focus more on some different On some different topics for hyperbolic systems. So, there is basically the opposite of the spectrum. There is plenty of periodic orbits. And can I ask again another question? I don't see very well. It's a recent work by Giovanni and who? Adam Kanigovsky. And so what they say is that this Kricorean conjecture is false. Cricorian conjecture is false, or? No, as far as I know, they say that this conjecture, I mean, they seem to say that it's maybe too optimistic, but they don't have counterexamples to that, but they have counter-examples to the version of Canon, which is a generalization of quick current conjecture. But even, I mean, canon is also a conjecture, not a result. Yeah, yeah, it's a conjecture, it's a conjecture, just for systems. Just for systems such that the orbits are not, no, no of the orbit is too close to being periodic. So you just mimic the definition of diaphan time. Then is it enough to upgrade from C0 to C1 conjugacy, for example? And so they say that if it is kind of almost periodic in one variable, then it is bad, right? Is that something the gist? Yeah, exactly. Because you can cook up some examples with some two dimensions. Some, I mean, two dimensions: one direction which is basically diaphragm, the other one which is global, and this is already bad. And even there, you can have some global diaphragm property which is satisfied. Okay, thank you. But still, I mean, it seems, I mean, to me, a very interesting topic about this kind of rigidity. So maybe there is a, I mean, the conjecture by Kriporian, I think, is still, I mean, possible to. Possible to hope for something like this, and maybe also to adapt the version of Canva. But for high-public systems, the picture is very different because we have many periodic hobbies, so each of them is an obstruction. But there, so the picture is more differing. That if all the periodic obstructions are matched, then is it enough to guarantee C0 that C0? This C0 that C0 conjugacy can be upgraded to C1 or even smoother conjugacy. So, there, so C0 conjugacy is not too much to ask because of structural stability. So, know that if we put up slightly our system, it's still zero conjugate to our initial system. So, C-0 conjugacy is nice. And as I was saying, maybe because of the abundance of perdic obese, this is enough to show this kind of rigidity thing. And there. And there the kind of techniques are very different from those in minimal dynamics, where it's more about renormalization, this kind of techniques. For high public dynamics, we have all the stable, unstable foliations to work with, to split our problem according to the different directions. And also, maybe even the periodic information which you have is already too much in some sense. Too much in some sense, and there's some redundance in the periodic data, so which we may study, and this may be about the periods, about the Lyapunov exponents, or about finer quantities like Barkov inference, and so on. So one class of such hyperbolic systems comes from the geometry, and in this case, we may even wonder to what extent. Wonder to what extent rigidity can be upgraded to some geometric rigidity. Namely, if our two geometric flows are zero conjugate and share some paradigm data, then are they smoothly conjugate? And if so, then are the two underlying systems isometric in some sense? So, this may be about hyperbolic surfaces and they are the z-close, or this may be also about some billiards with some hyperbolic. Some barriers with some hyperbolic properties. And there is possible to phrase this kind of rigidity equations in terms of some spectrum, namely the length spectrum, that is the set of all length of periodic orbits. So the question becomes then, when our system have the same periodic length, then is it enough to get some geometric information so that the system has a metric? Are asymmetric. So, just to recall some basic definition which I'm going to use in the following. So, since we work with hyperbolic diffeomorphisms, so let me recall the definition of a hyperbolic set. So, given some diffeomorphism, we say that some invariant set lambda is hyperbolic. If there is a splitting of the tangent space into two boundaries, the stable one and the unstable one, each of them is invariant by the differential dynamic. Invariant by the differential dynamics and a stable bundle is contracted uniformly while the unstable one is expanded uniformly. So one rigidity result which was obtained in the 90s by the Lajav Marco-Morion deals with Anosov diffomorphisms, namely when the hyperbolic set is the whole manifold. So they consider two CR and Zoft deformorphisms. R and soft diffomorphisms of the two torus F and G which are smooth, which are zero conjugate by some homorphism A. And there they assume the least which we can ask, namely that all the periodic obstructions vanish, namely that at each periodic point the differential of the maps are conjugate. So in particular, same Lyapunov exponent. Same Lyapunov exponent. Then, indeed, they show that this is enough to guarantee that the conjugacy can be made almost as smooth as the dynamics which we started with, the ECR minus epsilon, so small loss epsilon. So this is when the hyperbolic set is full. Another interesting frame to look at is the case of continuous time dynamics. Mix and there as I was pointing, there's even more obstruction coming from periodic orbis, namely just the periods of the periodic orbis and not only the Lyapunov exponents. So there is a classical result that if you have two flows hyperbolic, which we can compare in some sense, namely that we can map the orbis of the first hyperbolic set to the orbit of the second. Set to the orbits of the second public set, so for phi one to phi two. So, if there is a way to match these orbits, and if the pairs of the associated periodic orbits match, then we can go from this orbit equivalence, so just associate orbit to orbit, to indeed some C0 conjugacy. So the problem of C0 conjugacy is contained Is contained completely in this kind of period data coming from the pairs. So I'll skip the proof. And there, so there is an analogue of the previous result which I was mentioning. So the result of Delayave, Marco, Morion and Polycott in the case of continuous time dynamics is the following: that if you have two flows which are Anosov transitive on 3D manifolds, so it's the So, it's the flow version of the deform of SM result which I was mentioning. And so, if they are conjugate, namely, already these periodic obstructions coming from the pairs vanish. And moreover, assume that the differentials of the prong carrier return maps for all the periodic orbits match. So, relief all the periodic obstructions, then there again the flows are smoothly conjugate. Conjugate. So these two results are for deformorphisms and continuous time dynamics in low-dimensional Hanosov systems. Martin, a stupid question. For Anosov diffeomorphisms, is it known that if there is a C-zero conjugacy, then it is unique? No. A priori, the defect of uniqueness is basically related to the centralizer. So if you have two such conditions, So if you have two such conjugacies, then the composition of the two things produces some deformorphism in the centralizer of the dynamics. And typically for hyperbolic systems, the centralizer is small. So for anode flows, for example, the centralizer is triggered. It's just the time requirement realization of the system. But I mean, for more generous flows, if you have some large, I mean, not too small centralizer. Not too small centralizer, then this is exactly the defect of uniqueness of the C-zero conjugacy. I see. But for pure Anosov, there is uniqueness, right? For Anosov, diffuse, I don't think so. But for flows, yeah. For flows, okay. And also for minimal systems, there is uniqueness, right? For rotations of the torus, for example. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, about so, as I was mentioning, if you have some algebraic model, so like the analog of what the rotations would be for minimal dynamics, when peridic data are enough to conjugate, to show that the same is smoothly conjugate to your algebraic model. So, I'm not I'm not going to. I'm this is the precise definition of algebraic systems, but basically we can just recall that it's a fan system on homogeneous spaces. And since I'm going to speak about three manifolds, basically we can just reduce algebraic unzero flows to either geodesic flows on surfaces of constant negative curvature or suspensions of hyperbolic torrentomorphisms. And you may wonder when these algebraic systems are indeed characterized. Systems are indeed characterized by perdict data. So, the answer is basically yes. So, in a result with Jacopo, Desimoikov, Vinhage, and Ewing Young, we show that for CK volume preserving another flows on a three-manifold, basically it's clear that if you are conjugate to such an algebraic system in a smooth way, then all the periodic orbits should have the same Lyapunov exponent. Orbits should have the same Lyapunov exponents, and what you show is the count burst basically that if the differential of the Poincaré maps at all the periodic orbits are these periodic obstructions are sufficient to show that you are smoothly conjugated to an algebraic flow. So if you have a constant Lyapunov spectrum, so all the Lyapunov spectrum, so all the periodic orbits have the same Lyapunov exponent, then this characterizes completely the fact of being algebraic. So, there, since we borrow somehow some part of the proof, the result of the Leia Mayo-Morcon, we have this small loss of regularity, but basically we are as smooth, the conditions are as smooth as the initial system. And this kind of results. A result is related in geometric situations to the conjecture of CATOC about how much this kind of entropy rigidity results characterize algebraic systems. So now I want to go back to this notion of length spectrum and Notion of length spectrum and about both geodesic flows and negatively curved surfaces and hyperbolic barriers. So, morally, as I was saying, the length spectrum is just the set of lengths of all periodic orbits. So, usually it's too weak information to work with. So, we may enrich it adding some combinatorial information from the system which we work with. So, if you have some natural symbolic dynamics for the system, so we may just label. So we may just label the periodic orbits by their symbolic coding, or this may be also about the homotopy class of the closed orbits for a geodesic flow or this kind of things. So this enriched length spectrum, how much is it enough to determine the geometry of the underlying system? So the question is basically the spectral rigidity question, which asks when Which asks when this length spectrum characterizes completely the geometry of the system up to asymmetry. And in particular, if you are able to show some dynamical rigidity, when can this be translated into some geometric rigidity? So one famous instance where this was shown is for hyperbolic geodesic flows on negatively curved surfaces. So there I was. So there, as I was mentioning, the perdic orbis corresponds to closed curve, which we may label by the homotopy class to which it corresponds. And so adding this marking to the length spectrum, so namely each closed curve is labeled by its homotopy class, then how much this mark length spectrum determines the geometry and And so there is a big conjecture in this direction by Burns and Cato, which was shown in the case of surfaces by Ottawa and Koch. Namely, when you have two metrics G1, G2 on some closed surface of negative curvature, then if the two metrics have the same Mach length spectrum, they are indeed, I mean, the two metrics are isometric. So there is a deformorism which allows to go from the first one to the second one. And there are some recent developments in this. And there are some recent developments in this direction by Guillamou and Lefevre in higher dimension, but there is just a, for now it's just a local version, while there is a global result. So in my work, I have been focusing more in the case of billiards. So just to recall this dynamics, so we consider a domain and the dynamics which we consider just And the dynamics which we consider is just the following: that we start with some point on the boundary, we choose some direction, which is labeled by the angle with the normal at this point, and we flow in straight line until we hit again the boundary at a new point S prime and following the elastic reflection law. So the dynamics can be seen as a discrete system, just the billion map, which takes Just the billion map, which takes S phi to the new pair S prime phi prime. This dynamic has a lot of nice features like being conservative and even more exact symplectic. And since we want to consider more hyperbolic situations, the analog of the negatively curved surfaces and their geodesic flow is what we call open dispersing belief. What we call open dispersing billiards. So, we take a finite number of strongly convex obstacles with sufficiently smooth boundary and we play the billiard between these obstacles. So, of course, there are many obese which will escape to infinity and never come back. So, there we don't have much information coming from the periodic orbits. So, to see something useful coming from periodic orbies, we restrict ourselves to those obese which are To those orbits which are trapped by the table, namely, those which will stay in this bounded region between the obstacles and never escape to infinity. So, this is what we call the trap set, and it basically corresponds to the non-bonering set on which you have some useful information coming from the paired orbits. And so, we restrict to the case where we are far from singularities, so we consider. So we consider the case where known of the obstacles is eclipsing some of the trajectories from between two other obstacles. And in this nice setting, the non-running set, so this trapped set is a true hyperbolic set for F. So there is not like an Azov situation, but it's just a counter set on which you have a hyperbolic type of dynamics. And even more than that, it's in fact axiom A-type. In fact, have some A-type dynamics. Then for such systems, we want to ask how much geometric information is carried by the mark length spectrum. So there, the marking is slightly different from the one I was mentioning in the case of Jetic Flows, and just some symbolic coding. Namely, if we go back to this picture, all the periodic orbies. Picture, all the perdic orbies like this one can be labeled by the different obstacles it visits. So for this one, it would be just one, two, three, just meaning that we bounce on the first scatterer, the second scatterer, the third scatterer, and then we go back to the first one. So we have this natural symbolic coding of the periodic orbits, which means that we have appropriately some C-zero conjugacy to Some C0 conjugacy to a subshift of finite type. And so for such systems, so we may mark the length data by this symbolic coding. And there, the inverse problem which we are interested in is how much this marked length spectrum determines the geometry of the underlying billiard table. So if the table is just C infinity, then there are many obstructions. Then there are many obstructions to full determination of the obstacles because of the structure of the counter set on which you have some information, because much of the geometry is not seen by the periodic orbits. So it makes sense to work instead in the analytic category, where if you are able to recover locally the geometry, then we'll know globally the geometry of the obstacles and of the table just by analytic continuation. And there, indeed, what we show. And there, indeed, what we show with Jacopo Dessima and Vadim Kalushin is that for such open dispersing barriers, there is a residual set, very explicit, in some sense we have some non-degeneracy condition, on which the Mach length spectrum is enough to determine the geometry of the table. So we have to one further restriction to add one further restriction, just one. Just one partial symmetry, namely that there is a pair of obstacles, say O1 and O2, such that each of them is symmetric with respect to certain axis, and O2 is the mirror image of the first obstacle O1. So under analyticity of the boundary and this times E2 symmetry, partial symmetry, then indeed the map length spectrum is enough to determine full Spectrum is enough to determine fully the geometry of the billiard table. So, this is just a determination of the geometry by some dynamical information. And just to finish quickly, to go back to the geometric dynamical problem of smooth conjugacy. So, we may So we may just note that the billiard flows, in fact, due to the fact that we take two tables with the same number of obstacles and the same non-eclipse condition, then there is some approximate conjugacy between the billion maps, and in terms of flows, it translates into some orbit equivalence. So this is the C-zero conjugacy which Zero conjugacy, which we start with. And we know that to upgrade this orbit equivalence to a true flow conjugacy, then we have to know that the periods, namely that the lengths of the periodic orbits match. And under this condition, so we know that we have a true zero congenial between the billiard flows. And one more remark is that billiard dynamics has some nice properties. So billiard maps is symplectic. Billion maps is symplectic and the billion flow is contact flow. Then, in terms of dynamical result, what you obtain for general axiom A flows on three manifolds, preserving some contact form like the BL flow. If we have some basic sets for the two flows on which you have some orbit equivalence, which allows to jump from the first hyperbol set to the first To jump from the first hypoly set to the second one. And if this orbit equivalence preserves the length data, then the C0 conjugacy can be upgraded to true CK conjugacy. And moreover, it preserves the contact structure. So this is for general axiom A flows. And in particular, this applies to the case of open dispersing bills since they match this hypothesis. And there, in terms of dynamics, what we show is so in the smooth category. So in smooth category, if the two billions share the same Marklane spectrum, then the billion maps are smoothly conjugated by some canonical deformorphism which preserves the area form. So these are just some rigidity results in this kind of geometric situations. So thanks a lot for your attention. Your attention, and thanks again for the invitation. Thank you.
