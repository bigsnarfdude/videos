One spaces. All right. Thank you. And thank you for the organizers for putting this together. It's been an interesting conference. I've been hiding from conferences since COVID started largely because I find the setup a little bit awkward, but I'm happy I came out for this one. You all have done a good job of making interaction work. So What I want to talk about today is really an outgrowth of some things that I spoke about several years ago at my previous Banff gauge theory conference with a significant overlap of folk. And let me actually tell you a little bit about what's going on. So, I guess first I'll tell you what I have coming up. So, I'm going to I'm going to give you an introduction and explain to you why I'm asking the rather odd sort of question that I'm asking. Then it'll require me giving you a little bit of analytic underpinnings just to put things in context. And also maybe these might be useful for if I don't know if we have anybody in the graduate student side of things here, but might be useful for them. And then I'm going to follow the analytic underpinnings with an explanation. Underpinnings with an explanation of the role of the negative curvature and the girth or fatness of the manifold. So, maybe everybody knows in times of COVID-19, your negatively curved spaces all have all gained a bit of injectivity radius. And then I'm going to explain what the consequences are of the type of estimate I want to talk about for compactness and smoothness for Yang mills. And if you all don't mind. For Yang Mills, and if you all don't mind me going off topic a little bit, also for harmonic maps, too. Okay, and then if I have time remaining, I'll tell you a little bit about the parabolic case. Okay, so as I said, this story started, well, it's a few years ago when I spoke about I spoke about globalizing standard local monotonicity tools that have been used to study singularities in Yang Mills. And these tools are fundamental in understanding singularities for various geometric variational problems. And I guess I forgot to repeat, this is all joint work with Luca de Cherbo. Luca de Cherbo. And we found ways to globalize these tools a little bit and apply them to topological questions. And in particular, we found new Betty number bounds for negatively curved spaces, which answered questions that were raised in geometric topology and addressed, in fact, even conjectures in number theory. And so today, what I'd like to do is somehow go full circle. So we took these standard. We took these standard analytic tools, developed them for application to topology, and we introduced more geometry into them. Now I want to bring them back to their home in analysis and Yang Mills and see what they can tell us there. So we'll be completing a circle or perhaps maybe spiraling since we've gained some information along the way. And everything. And everything, so in one sense, this is going to fall outside this conference in a massive way in that everything I talk about will be for supercritical Yang mills and supercritical harmonic maps. So it won't apply to many of the instances you all are interested in, but it'll apply to all the rest of the world. Okay, so the most Okay, so the motivating heuristic problem is one that is the one that I was labeling Quixotic earlier, is to find a reverse Eales-Sampson type result for harmonic maps and Yang-Mills connections. And let me explain what this means and why it's sort of a bizarre thing to think about. So remember that Eales and Samson told us that if you have, say, two compact Riemannian manifolds. Two compact Riemannian manifolds, M and N, and N has non-positive sectional curvature, then you can take any initial smooth map from M to N and deform it smoothly to a harmonic map. So, this is sort of one of your wonderful, the most wonderful case of harmonic maps is when you can apply them to You can apply them to these negatively curved manifolds. And of course, this has been used to great effect for analyzing arithmetic on negatively curved spaces. All right, so the work that I was talking about earlier in the Betty number bounds suggested that in dimensions bigger than two for harmonic maps, there should be some new kind of harmonic map regularity theorem. Kind of harmonic map regularity theorem. If you now, instead of talking about the target space being negatively curved, you ask for the domain to be negatively curved and fat. And for Yang-Mills, there should be similar results for the dimension bigger than four. So these are the supercritical dimensions. Now, in some sense, Now, in some sense, you know before you even think about launching on such a foolish project that it shouldn't be possible to get such a result because of this following well-known theorem. So if you have a compact Riemannian manifold and n is any number bigger than three, then there's no non-trivial stable harmonic map from m to sn and so this makes it really hard. This makes it really hard to believe that, I mean, M can be as negatively curved as I want and as fat as I want, but as long as I have a map to Sn, then I know that I can't deform it to a stable or energy minimizing harmonic map. So this makes it really unlikely that what I have in the first paragraph sort of reverse Yield Samption should. Paragraph sort of reverse Yield Samption should make sense. Nonetheless, sometimes you just have to pursue these things. And so we're going to look at how close you can get to a reverse Yield Samson, what sort of information you can get. And we'll find that it gives us information on these negatively curved manifolds of new regimes and where you don't get bubbling, where you have compactness of modulized spaces. Compactness of modulized spaces, and it even gives you a few intriguing results for harmonic maps. Okay, so that's what I want to talk about. Now, in order to do so, I want to start with the analytic underpinnings. And the reason for our belief in this reverse Yel-Sampson kind of result. Sampson kind of result arises from examining epsilon regularity theorems for harmonic maps in Yang-Mills. And so I'm going to recall a little bit about the analysis of these theorems. So I know this is fairly standard for the geometric analyst, but the last time I spoke here, quite a few people pointed out to me that not everybody here is a geometric analyst. So I thought it wouldn't hurt for me to. wouldn't it wouldn't hurt for me to to say a little bit about this so i can explain um how such uh how the results we're going to talk about arise and and why you should you could hope for even stronger things than we've obtained so far so let's start off and suppose we have a hermitian vector bundle over some n-dimensional riemannian manifold and let's suppose we have a connection compatible with the metric With the metric. And let's consider a strongly harmonic vector bundle-valued k-form, where I want k to be below middle dimension. Okay. Now, when I say strongly harmonic, just to be clear, I mean that it's closed with respect to the exterior derivative defined by the connection A, and it's co-closed. Now, of course, It's co-closed. Now, of course, here this has no comological meaning because in the situations of interest to us, we're never going to have this dA squaring to zero. Okay, so when you have such a strongly harmonic form, then you're going to have, we're going to study the energy density associated with that form. And in all the cases of interest to us, it's going to satisfy some Bochner identity, well, which is going to give Um, well, which is going to give it, I'm going to write as an inequality. So, for analysis, we need the Bochner inequality. And the typical ones that arise in the problems we look at is that if you take the Laplacian of E, and my Laplacian is always the one with positive spectrum, then that's less than or equal to some constant, which is coming from the Riemannian geometry of M and some other constant. And some other constant, which will vary depending upon the situations we're dealing with, and the fractional power e to the one over k of the energy, and all this multiplied by the energy. Okay, so I'll show you some examples, the obvious examples of this, but probably it's not the way you'd usually think of writing them. So if you have such a Bochner type inequality, then in these harmonic forms, then there's a constant epsilon. forms, and there's a constant epsilon not greater than zero. This is your epsilon regularity statement. So that if say for simplicity, let's keep r less than one and also less than the injectivity radius of the manifold. So that if you have a rescaled energy, take the energy, I always call the, well, the energy, the integral of the energy density is what I'm calling the energy. So if you take, you integrate this energy density. Integrate this energy density over a ball of radius r, then rescale that according to the degree of the form. So 2k minus n power. Then the soup norm of your energy is less than or equal to r to the minus 2k in a slightly smaller ball. Okay, so this is your standard epsilon regularity theorem. And it had it's And it has the following obvious corollary. So, you can always, if you have, say, injectivity radius larger than one, certainly we're interested in fat manifolds, which means injectivity radius big. If the radius one ball around any point has energy less than epsilon naught, then the Then the sup norm of your energy is bounded uniformly by one. So, given that you have the following obvious, but in some sense, rarely useful corollary, that if you start off with a compact manifold and say maybe let mt denote the moduli space of Yang-Mills connections of energy less than or equal to t, then m epsilon naught is. Then m epsilon naught is compact because, of course, the energy for the unit ball is bounded by the energy over the whole manifold. Okay. And when I say energy here, I mean the usual Yang-Mills energy. So the global integral of the energy density. So why is this really, I guess I should say, this is why we have this. So just for those people who don't think about it, Just for those people who don't think about things, this follows immediately from Wuhlenbeck's strong compactness theorem, which you remember tells you that if you have a sequence of Yang-Mills connections, and if you have an LP curvature bound with the P bigger than half dimension, then in all your favorite topologies, your connections are Your connections are going to converge to a Yang-Mills connection. Okay, so certainly, so in our case, this energy bound we're talking about gives us an L infinity bound, and infinity is bigger than n over 2, whatever your n is. So that makes life simple. Okay, so why is this rarely useful? Why is this rarely useful? Well, because for one, epsilon naught is typically quite small. And so I've seen theorems where people make assumptions about this. And it looks like the theorems only apply to flat connections or trivial bundles, things like that. So it's, it's, so when you use this, you have to. When you use this, you have to be careful that the epsilon naught doesn't make just kill all interesting examples. And the other issue for people who aren't geometric analysts and just want to apply it is that in most of the literature, epsilon naught is rarely given explicitly. It just given there exists. And so it makes it really less useful for off-the-shelf. It really less useful for off-the-shelf use. If somebody wants to sit down and say, Okay, I have a result for this particular bundle, then it's not available from the way it's written in the literature typically. So just for fun for this talk, and all this I worked out for this conference, all these computations. So I just noted, I'll play a little bit with Yang-Mills and dimension six. Yang mills and dimension six for an example in this talk, just to so I can give you numbers that are that are real. And as I said, we're always supercritical. So I'm never going to give you dimension four for Yang mills or dimension two for harmony maps. So supercritical means your favorite dimension won't be there. But anyway, so if you're if you're looking at six-dimensional Yang-mills and say a real hyperbolic manifold, then one-seventh works, although it's One seventh works, although it's there are lots of different ways of computing that's not remotely sharp. Okay, so the interesting issue is that for negatively curved and pinched manifolds with again k less than half dimension, we can often improve the energy estimate in the previous corollary, which I won't back up to. So, the energy balance by a factor which is exponential. By a factor which is exponential in the injectivity radius. So instead of having some super small epsilon naught, we'll be able to replace the number by something that, as we say, look at a tower of negatively curved manifolds, we have something which is blowing up exponentially in the injectivity radius increasing in the tower. And large injectivity. And large injectivity radius is what I mean by a fat or a fat manifold. And you frequently encounter such things. Certainly, I run across them a lot when you're dealing with number theorists and they look at towers of congruent subgroup quotients, for example. And then they're always interested in what happens as the injectivity radius is going to infinity anyway. So today, I mean, the So today, I mean, these I keep mentioning locally these hyperbolic spaces, for example, and spaces of interest to number theory, but these theorems apply much more generally just with various situations where you have pinched negative curvature. But I don't want to get distracted today by the sort of the optimal relations you can get. So I will focus on Focus on what? So I'll focus on, say, real and complex hyperbolic space. And if time permits, I'll discuss dynamical analogs of the results that we're going to come up with. So what happens with parabolic flows. And there, the story is much more on the wishful side. So things are much harder. Okay, so in order to explain how our results fit in, I want to tell you, just again, remind you how to compute these epsilon knots yourself and how the epsilon regularity works, just because something which all geometric analysts know, but maybe not all gauge theorists know, even though it's lurking in the background of many things they do. So there are three ingredients for any episode. Ingredients for any epsilon regularity proof. So, the first, you need some elliptic estimate. So, something like Moser iteration or whatever your favorite analog is for an elliptic estimate. And then a Bochner estimate of the sort I was positing before. I'm having some kind of collapse here of books at the side. I don't know what's causing it. I must have ghosts in my study. And local monotonicity. And this latter is the one place where we're introducing new geometry to the study. I'm not going to have anything new to say about Moser iteration, except that I compute constants there so often I can probably do it in my sleep now for the elliptic case, not for the parabolic. So let me just remind you, first I need to say that your manifold has some Sobolev constants. I'll define it. I'll put it on the left. Constant. So I'll define it. I'll put it on the left-hand side for your Sobolev inequality. So your L2 energy of a form is bigger than times. The Sobolev constant is bigger than the L2n over n minus 2 energy. I guess I don't want to, maybe you wouldn't call that an energy since it's not L2. Anyway, so we have the Soblev constant defined and normalized in that fashion. And if we for Moser If we for Moser iteration, as I said, we're going to require a differential inequality, which will look cruder than the Bachner inequality, or different from the Bachner inequality. I guess I shouldn't say cruder to look better. So we'll look at an inequality of this form. The Laplacian of the energy is less than or equal to some constant times or times the square root of the energy. It makes it a little bit easier. I could just as well have put energy here, wouldn't change anything, just change some constants later on. Constants later on, and so just to make constants easier, I've there are various places where you'll expect the first power of e, I put a square root. So then I'll just remind you what Moser iteration tells you, or whatever your favorite elliptic estimate is. It tells you that the sup norm of your energy in some slightly smaller ball, say a ball of radius r over two, is less than or equal to the integral of. integral of your energy in the larger ball, ball of radius one, times an important constant. So this elliptic inequality brings a constant here and four over r squared. So r is a radius. So if the c naught were zero, this would just be some generalized mean value property, right? So if you just ignore the constants, then this way the scaling says the sup norm is less. As the soup norm is less than the average value of the norm. Now, but so you can compute your epsilon knots later on, I threw in the slightly distracting constants, the way this depends on the Sobolev constant. And this 2n squared over 4 is not necessarily the best constant. It works for low dimensions. For higher dimensions, there are better ones you can pick. Dimensions, there are better ones you can pick. But anyway, it's nonetheless true. So the real issue for us is the C naught, because in our context, remember, we had a rather coarser or funnier looking differential equality. So we wanted to apply this iteration to the energy where E satisfied a differential inequality where instead of Where instead of a constant, we had the energy itself appearing inside here. Okay, so that, if you were just blithly plugging this back in here, it looks really stupid because I'm trying to bound the sup norm by a higher power of e and then by the average. So, from that standpoint, this looks like a dumb thing to study, but very, but I guess. But I guess, you know, Ullenbeck and Shane work this out. There's a very nice way of, in fact, extracting data from this. But before I extract data, let me just make things concrete for a moment. So the energies we're going to be typically looking at here. So if we take k to be 2, we'll take our harmonic form to be the harmonic vector bundle valued form to be the curvature. Then the energy we're studying is just the Yang-Mills local energy density. Mills local energy density. And then, of course, we have the Bochner formula that has this form. And so here in the estimate we've been writing, lambda will just arise from a control of the Riemannian curvature for your base manifold. And C1 is just going to be some universal constant. And of course, we've gone from a We've got we've gone from a quadratic in curvature to a cubic, so scales this curvature to the three halves. So that's why we have the one-half here. And here, I guess, the C1 seems to have been worked out to be two root n. I figured I'd work out various constants for this discussion. And the second example, I know it's not really part of the topic of the conference here, but it's an important one to keep in mind because it's where we understand counterexamples really. Because it's where we understand counterexamples really well. And so I keep looking at it to understand where things have to fail. But if we have k equals one, then the natural choice, then we could choose h to be the derivative of a map, which is harmonic. So if we just, then that gives us a harmonic vector bundle valued form. And we have the corresponding Bochner formula, which has a similar form as before, except now the curvature. Now the curvature operator is nicer. It's the Ricci curvature. And now this C1 just comes from the soup norm of the soup of the sectional curvature on the target space. Okay. Mark, why was it E one half in the first example and not E in the brackets? Because E is F. E is F squared and Laplacian E gives me an F cubed term here. Sorry. So it's just scaling. And it is kind of funny that the degree of the form corresponds. I guess for physicists, it's not funny. It's probably obvious. It wasn't obvious to me initially, but for physicists, it actually be clear that the degree of these forms does correspond to the scaling you get here in the way I talked about before, because it's somehow counting the number of derivatives. The not counting the number of derivatives. Okay, and again, so this is just what I said: what these constants were. So, in order to understand how to use these to bound things, let's just look at, let's just suppose for simplicity that we know the soup of the energy occurs at point P, the center of our ball. And then I'm just going to claim, well, we do have this differential inequality, but now what is C0? C0, we can just C0 we can just take to be this lambda plus c1, where now I just take that pointwise bound and just take the soup over the area and replace it by this guy. So that gives me what I said before was a sort of stupid looking estimate. It tells us the energy at the point P is bounded by some high power of the energy of the point P times. Of the point P times the integrated energy. And so why is this useful? Well, the observation is that you can, it's a little bit better if you write that, you rescale this. So you write this as follows. So multiply through by r squared to the degree of the form. And then when you do that, When you do that, you have this equality, and the Lambda terms are somewhat irrelevant here because anytime you're interested, you're generally worried about what happens when r gets small. So these just disappear. So it probably would have been a little bit more effective visually if I just told us to take lambda equals zero. So these guys are largely irrelevant. But this term is unfortunate, as I said, for bounding the sky from above. So how do you bound it from above? Well, bound it from above well just suppose you just keep shrinking r until you hit the point where the where rho well say rho became r some or r became rho it's some from going from side to side so so we've shrunk the radius until the radius times 2k is times the energy is exactly one so suppose we do that then what we get is when we plug that back in we get a lower bound for the energy density that's rescaled The energy density, this rescaled energy density. So it says that if it ever occurs that there's a rho for which the energy density is equal to one over rho to the two k, then this rescaled energy is bounded below by some constant depending upon this mess. So this is where monotonicity comes in. comes in. So what we'll do is we'll just say let's let 2 epsilon naught be one over this constant. And so we've said at that bound we've got 2 epsilon naught is less than this rescaled energy. And now we need monotonicity, which is where the geometry enters this picture. So if the rescale, if this rescaled energy is or the scaled energy is monotonically increasing, then once we've Once we've we can always we if we start off well for harmonic maps uh you can approximate them by smooth maps which preserve these monotonicity estimates and so you in that case you can always shrink the energy until you hit this equality and once you do you have this this lower bound for the energy but if you have monotonicity it means it could never the energy the rescaled energy Could never, the energy, the rescaled energy could never have been less than epsilon naught at any larger radius. Consequence, that tells you that whenever this rescaled energy is less than epsilon naught, E is less than one over this power of the radius at which you get that epsilon naught estimate. Okay, so it's just one of these nice sleight of hands, I think, is what Sergei typically calls it when we do this. So it's just a nice little trick that you Just a nice little trick that allows you to take what starts off looking like a really ridiculous energy estimate and getting a nice bound. So that's how you compute these epsilon knots. But how do we improve the result we said before? So that tells us then, well, if the Yang total energy of the over, if you integrate the energy over the whole manifold, if that's less than epsilon naught, then that implies some regularity, for example. But as we see, Example. But as we see in the examples that I, where I've seen people try to do this in the literature, it always tends to lead to a situation where they're making assumptions which tell me the vector bundle is trivial. So monotonicity, which played a role in the first part, now plays a role again. But the earlier place, we were essentially looking at a local monotonicity. Now I want to look at a more global one. And so what I'm going to do. And so what I'm gonna do is tell you a little bit about these harmonic forms we're studying. So I'm gonna tell you a theorem about harmonic forms, and we're gonna want the harmonic forms we're gonna want to apply it to are going to be curvature and or df for a harmonic map. And these are a variant of the ones we discovered for the Betty numbers, excuse me, when we're computing, estimating Betty numbers. Betty numbers. So we have H is strongly harmonic K form, and I've pinched my curvature between minus A squared minus one. Then if we integrate the L2, if we integrate the energy, I guess I left off my one halves, but so we integrate the energy density over, say, a unit ball. And here I'm assuming that once again, the injectivity radius is bigger than one, then that's exponentially small. And that's exponentially smaller than the integral of a ball of radius rho, where so what's so here, the factor, the exponential has a constant like this in front of us. And this is where the fact that supercritical, we can only consider supercritical Yang mills and supercritical harmonic maps because only in supercritical dimensions. Because only in supercritical dimensions do these numbers come out to help you, as opposed to give you just stupid estimates. And on the borderline, which will actually come up in certain geometries, if you're at the borderline here, then you can say more. Excuse me, you can, instead of just saying what, that you're less than that you scale monotonically when you increase the size of your domain, which is somewhat obvious, you in fact, you you in fact uh get a get linear decrease in uh if you so if you have some if your ball is radius rho then then you're at least uh your initial energy for the unit ball is like one over rho times that all right so suppose for example your real hyperbolic just to put make things concrete uh and suppose you have injectivity radius for your manifold is rho then Your manifold is ρ, then you can look at the moduli space of smooth Yang-Mills connections with energy less than t. And that's going to be compact for t less than or equal to, say, in dimension six, one-seventh the e to the row, up to, you know, stupid constant. And in this borderline case, it's less than or equal to two row times seven. So this says we've got exponential increase in the size. Potential increase in the size of the energy at which we can control the smoothness of the moduli space. Okay. And if just in case you want to see what the numbers look like in higher dimensions, so more generally, and again, this depends on what flavor, well, part of this is just essentially Sobolev constant. And then there's some parts of this come from the however you choose to do Moser iteration. But in higher dimensions, But in higher dimensions, you scale like e to the n minus 5 times the injectivity radius. So the bigger the dimension, the more control you have, the larger your energy can be before you can have singularities or bubbling. So I guess I should say bubbling sometimes in the course of this talk because there's bubbling in the title. So you won't have any bubbling. Won't have any bubbling as long as your energies remain below these levels. And I guess C in this instance was two root in again. And that just came from the C arising in this Bochner formula or Bochner estimate. All right. So let me also, if you forgive me for leaving topic for a moment, let me also say a bit about harmonic maps because again, I keep using that. Because again, I keep using that to stop me from wandering into areas that I know are false. So, for remember, a harmonic map is stationary. If for all one-parameter families of diffeomorphisms, phi t of your domain manifold, starting off with phi naught being the identity, then the energy is a critical point for the variation where you've composed U with the diffeomorphism. The diffeomorphism. And these guys are useful because the sort of estimate I've talked about, if you want to extend those to some weaker regularity, this is the situation where the estimates apply. So corollary to our structures, if you have a real hyperbolic manifold, once again with this injectivity radius rho, which I'm assuming is large for this to be interesting, and you have a stationary harmonic map. Have a stationary harmonic map, and then I want some bound on the sectional curvature of the target space. Almost every case I'm interested in, that B will be four. Gives you all your nice Grassmannians and whatnot. Then you have smoothness unless the usual energy, so this is the integral of the energy density over the whole manifold, unless it's less than or equal to some constant. It's less than or equal to some constant, which I've written down here just to be concrete, not because you want to look at it. All that's really interesting in these things is the exponents here. So, here, as long as you're in dimension n bigger than three, then you have you're allowed to take your energy exponentially larger in the injectivity radius than you would have otherwise thought. And once again, on the borderline, we oops, went back. We oops, went backwards on the borderline. We get a linear result that the energy has to be again. I just wrote, worked out the numbers just to show you it's they're not frightening numbers. You can be for basically, you know, the injectivity radius divided by 20. All right. So that's how you play these games. And let me skip that. And let me skip that. And also, I know physicists like various sigma models, and they're useful for studying some of these objects in smooth approximations. And so if you want to look at the sigma model variation of that, then you can replace your local energy density with an energy density plus a potential. And then the harmonic map equation changes from the Laplacian, the U Laplacian of U. The u Laplacian of U being zero to the U Laplacian plus the gradient vanishing. And in that context, the exact same estimates as before carry through, except you just have to change what your lambda was in those constants. Instead of bounding the Ricci, you have to add a Hessian term. So you just, otherwise, you can carry this all out to sigma models too. So, what are the implications of these estimates? So, suppose. So suppose we have again, M is hyperbolic, and we have a map from an initial energy from M to N, then Struva constructed a weak harmonic map flow from U naught to a stationary harmonic map U infinity. So there's always some weak harmonic map limit that you can extract. And by our corollary, if our initial energy if our initial energy is exponential is not not worse than something exponentially large in the injectivity radius then this this terminal map is smooth because this weak harmonic map flow is decreasing energy now this makes you want to say all sorts of false things um so um i'll remind you that i told you initially that i can take I can take a sphere of dimension bigger than three, and I'm not going to have a stable minimal map, harmonic map to that sphere. I could start off with such a sphere, and it's easy, no matter how big your injectivity radius, it's easy to construct a homotopically non-trivial map from a fat, negative, arbitrarily large, fat, negatively curved. Really large, fat, negatively curved space to a sphere, say the same dimension as space, for example, with energy that's bounded by some constant like one. I don't know, didn't work it out exactly, but nothing too big. And so this suggests that in this case, we do have such a flow, and the resulting map will be smooth. So that's all true, but it doesn't imply that the issue is that this final map is not a harmonic representative of the initial map. Representative of the initial map. So, this in some sense clarifies a little bit about what's happening with this Struva flow and tells you that along the way, by the time this result applies, because the estimates I've only given you are for the elliptic case, not for the parabolic case, you've had bubbling before you've reached this final stage. And so, when you've reached this final stage, you've what my what this reason. you've what my what this result actually tells you is essentially a removable singularities theorem that whatever you've got that this this uh map which supposed which would have a priori could have had all sorts of singularities is in fact if you start off with energy bounded in this way is smooth and what that probably actually means in the case of a sphere is that what I suspect is that you've bubbled off everything and your final map is constant. And your final map is constant. And so the struva flow tells you how to deform your map and end up with something which is homotopically just to a constant map by just ripping it apart along the way. So it doesn't actually tell you anything about constructing harmonic representatives in that most obvious case. All right. So when you when you add, when you improve your your Your, what's the term I want? When you add a little bit of extra geometry, so if I assume you're Kaler instead of just Riemannian, then that actually improves our estimates. So we can look, for example, at a complex hyperbolic manifold. So now, so I normalize that to have sectional curvature between minus four and minus one. If I have injectivity radius rho, well, then first we have the estimate I wrote down before. So this is just. Before. So, this is just the estimate I gave you a few pages back for the bounding the energy in a ball by the energy in a larger ball. And this is what those various estimates gave you in this instance. But it turns out that if you have a PP form, then you can improve your estimates. And essentially, by you improve by two. You improve by two powers higher, which is useful for keeping track of dimensions. You might say, Well, if I'm looking at large, why do I care large versus a little bit larger? Well, of course, depending on what dimension you are, this changes in some sense where your things fail altogether. So this gives you two extra dimensions in which you have a theorem. Anyway, so if H is PP, you get this Sharper estimate. So, for example, if you start off with a complex hyperbolic manifold within... manifold with injectivity radius rho. Then again, just to be specific, let's start off with m equals 3. So the six-dimensional case again. You could look at the moduli space of, for example, smooth Hermitian-Einstein connections with energy less than or equal to t. And you get that that guy is compact. I should have left it, I put a pause in the wrong place here, so it looks like I'm saying. In the wrong place here, so it looks like I'm saying something strange. So, if you look at this moduli space, it's going to be compact for, for example, t less than or equal to one-seventh times the e to the two row. Because of course, these Hermitian-Einstein curvatures are of type 1, 1. So I can apply my sharper estimate and get results here that I couldn't have otherwise gotten. And just to show you the other. And just to show you the ugly numbers for higher dimension, you get some mess like that, which again, this is could be just, I should write it as just a constant, but I want you to know again that these are all easily computable as opposed to saying there exists, which is not necessarily so useful. So you have a constant of this ilk, and now you have exponential, you're allowed to have your energy exponential. You're allowed to have your energy exponentially large in the radius of this size. So that exponent. Again, as I said, the exponents are important and the other coefficients are just there to show they're not hard to estimate. And never assume these other coefficients are sharp. You can always improve them. Okay. Mark, just, I mean, you probably mentioned this very early on, but I just want to make sure. Is the base manifold, does it have to be compact? Manifold, does it have to be compact? Nothing I've used requires a base. These are all local estimates, or semi-local in this case. So it doesn't have to be, except when I say when these theorems, so I was using in the last theorem, or the ones where I'm saying that you have compactness of the moduli space, then to use Uhlenbeck compactness as sloppily as I've been doing it, I want the underlying manifold to be compact. But for But for local regularity, it still holds. So, if you want to replace your hypothesis of a compact manifold with a non-compact manifold, then I'm not going to tell you your moduli space is compact anymore, but I'll tell you that no bubbling occurs. That if you go out in your moduli space, you're never going to have anything bubbling off when you're below these energy levels. Does that answer your question? Yeah, it does. Yeah, that's on but uh related to that question. Um, in the non-compact case, when the injectivity radius is infinity, then it looks like that your upper bound on the energy would also be infinite, right? Yeah, so in that case, you get non-existence results, sure. Okay, um, yeah, so but again, remember, I'm not, I'm, I'm in the super critical case, so that's I haven't. So that's, I haven't told you that in R4, you don't have any instantons. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and also you have negative curvature. So. Yes. Okay. Yes, that's a useful comment. I should have mentioned that. In fact, we use that a lot for the Betty numbers in the work that led up to this. This gave us various cases of the Singer conjecture, or sorry, improvement on understanding Singer conjecture. Improvement on understanding Singer conjecture. Now, I didn't quite catch why the rho being infinity sort of gives a non-existence result. Ah, well, I should go back a couple of slides then. I need to. So this slide. So I've told you that my local energy for a unit ball is bounded by this exponent or these various exponents. So as I take rho, if rho is infinity, the right. If rho is infinity, the right-hand side is zero. I'll see. Okay. So I guess, yeah, maybe it would have, I should have been, would have been smart if I'd thought of like Gonzalo and focused, included that case in the slides. All right. So looks like I'll be a little bit shorter today. So what can I say about the parabolic case? So if I could do all this just as well for the parabolic case, then we could probably get a Fields Medal. Well, no, because just. probably get a fields metal well no because it's just negative curvature but you could prove you could basically get harmony you get a reverse yield samson for that be really strong and certainly prove lots of things that are false which usually is a is a suggest to you that you should be careful when you know you'll be proving things that you know are false um i often use that as a as a guiding principle don't prove false things intentionally so uh let me just uh remind just re run quickly through what the ingredients are Quickly through what the ingredients are, and then show you at the very last step what goes wrong, but we still get some data. And as I said, I was just this entire line, something that's been in the back of my head for quite a few years now. And I worked it up for the conference because last conference I didn't mention Yang Mills. So I figured Sergei wouldn't invite me back anymore if I didn't have some Yang Mills in my talk. So let's start off and Start off and suppose that E satisfies the parabolic version of our elliptic inequality. So I just add a d dt to everything I said before. Then we have once again a Moser type regularity, so a parabolic regularity statement, where now I've just added a time dimension. And so that I didn't have to redirect. So this part I haven't rederived. I've just used the classic results here. So here. Classic results here. So, here I take, oh, I made it. Oh, yeah. So, I take the time to be to scale like the square of the radius in the usual way. And so, if I have a sort of a, what would you call it, a parabolic ball, then the energy there bounds the energy on a slight, the soup norm on a slightly smaller ball with the constant, which looks essentially the same as we had. Looks essentially the same as we had before. But now I'm not going to give you sharp constants anymore because I didn't work them out because it doesn't yet give you an exciting theorem. So it would have been a waste of all our times, mine especially. So as usual, I'll switch to a square root type estimate. Then, and I won't repeat the proof of epsilon regularity, the same thing works as before. So just if we have, except now our scaling, our dimension is gone. Our dimension has gone up by two, by we count time like two space dimensions. So the scaling goes accordingly. So if we have the rescaled energy is less than epsilon naught, then we have this super norm less than or equal to r to the minus 2k. So once again, we have soup control controlled with the pot with the rate controlled by the With the power with the rate controlled by the inverse, some inverse power of the radius at which we get a rescaled estimate. So now, if we had an exponential bound for this energy like we did before, then we could prove in all sorts of situations that you could just start off with an initial, say, Yang-Mills field or a map, and at no point could it ever blow up. And so you'd have ways of proving. And so you'd have ways of proving that you had a smooth harmonic map flow, a smooth Yang-Mills flow, and nothing could go wrong at all. This is why I said it's sort of like a reverse Eal-Sampson, because this is controlling the norm. And then you'd prove all sorts of wonderful theorems. But we always know that I have a small energy mapped to a ball for which it can't work. So, it tells you we can't get such an estimate, but I'll just show you what sort of estimate we do get. So, for example, in the real hyperbolic case, and this is not remotely optimized, I've only worked this out within the last week or so. So you have the following type of estimate. So, you can bound this integral. The energy on a ball by a constant times something that's exponentially small, the way you'd expect from our previous discussion, times the energy in a larger ball. But unfortunately, there's a term coming from the initial data. So t0 is supposed to be the initial time here. And unfortunately, the exponent goes inside the integral instead of outside. So this just tells you. So, this just tells you we're getting information that so taking the injectivity radius large here in no way sends this guy makes this guy arbitrarily small. So, for the parabolic case, we don't have the sort of data I would like yet because we're hit by the usual problem of the initial local energy. It's kind of fun that to get the It was kind of fun that to get these exponential decays. When I was studying the monotonicity in the elliptic case or the static case, I was bothered that people were doing things non-canonically. And so they were throwing out all the geometry. And so it took me a long time to figure out a canonical way to do the parabolic flows. And there it turned out, but seemed fairly canonical to me. It's still not clear. It's certainly not unique in some sense, like the optimal monotonous. Some sense like the optimal monotonicity is in the elliptic case. But in fact, there's you can instead instead of constructing backwards heat equations, which is the usual way to do short distance monotonicity in such situations, I found there's an infinite collection of nice geometric parabolic monotonicity results, which you could combine and which in a limit give you the classic one, at least at short distances. Short distances. So I use that to get the estimates I showed you on the previous page. All right, and it seems likely that I'll be able to use these for getting new information about the structure of singularities, but since I only got that estimate within the last week or so, I have no results there yet. So I think I'll stop here. So thank you for your attention. Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Marge. Any questions? The cat didn't appear. Oh, well, so cat minus one is, of course, negative curvature bounded above by minus one. So it's, I just, I just liked Fat Cat. It was more euphonious than the title I gave to the organizers. So I just thought I'd add that to my slide. I'd add that to my slide. So it's not often you get to have fat cats in your titles. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I have a question. Yes. So, so, so suppose that your energy is super small, like will you ask me tell then it's identically zero? So this is something that does, if your energy is super small to begin with, then this is something that I said people, people discuss who's speaking. People discuss who's speaking. I can't see my thing here. Maybe I should. Ah, there it is. It's Cichi. If your energy is small, then you don't require my net. If it's super small, you don't require my estimates. And that was what I talked about initially that, you know, this is the classic kind of case. I've seen a bunch of two-penny papers that people have written where they say, suppose you have Yang-Mills energy, where the energy is, you know, less than 10 to the minus. Than 10 to the minus 9 or something times whatever's the relevant unit. And they say, well, we can show you have a Yang-Mills representative for this guy. And I say, well, yeah, no joke. But in those cases, usually you can expect to show that things are flat or trivial. But sure. Maybe I should stop the share so I can see. So, one natural question I feel after you've admonished us on writing papers as a community that are vacuous is, do you have examples of manifolds for which we know the like with their injectivity rate? Like with their injectivity radius and some first level of non-trivial energy that we, for which we know, okay, this is therefore compact for that or an interesting topology of the bundle. Well, so I have a trivial, a simple answer to that, which is not trivial. So again, I kept focusing on the fact that you could always construct small energy maps to balls that were homotopically non-trivial. Homotopically non-trivial. And so then any bundle that you construct on that ball, you can pull back and get similarly not too large energy bundle on your manifold. And so in that situation, yes. So I didn't construct particular ones, but that gives you a universal construction. You can do lots of them, right? So I can do that. I can do that many different places with many different balls, and you know, something that's quite large in the energy, and then presumably you can start gluing various constructions like that. But certainly, there are many such examples. Is that sufficiently concrete? I don't know. You gave me more of a homework than an answer, but that's okay. Well, I mean, come on. Well, I mean, come on. Well, saying you've pulled back a bundle underneath. No, no, no, yeah, I agree with that. But like, there's the question of these constructing these, these, these, yeah, I guess. I mean, so, so I'm just saying, so, so you have a but how do you know that their energy is small enough to fit the uh the the the the okay because so i so take a ball of radius one in your manifold okay so i'm thinking my my rate my injectivity radius is big it's the enormous right so take a Big, it's the enormous, right? So I take a ball of radius one, I map it to a sphere by just, you know, wrapping it around a sphere of comparable size. And so the outer sphere for the ball gets collapsed to a point, you know, to the north pole. And so everything I do in that construction, nothing depends on the injectivity radius. Okay. No. Right. And so and so you so you. And so you ask, how big is that? Well, I mean, you know, I computed constants like one-seventh or something. Do I know how big that is compared to one-seventh? Maybe it's 25 in norm or something. You know, it depends on the energy of the underlying bundle, but it doesn't depend on the injectivity radius. So I can do that and then pull back bundles from spheres or anything. You know, maybe I had a sphere that I mapped from there to a CPN. Who knows? But you have various constructions like this, and then you pull back your bundle. And then you pull back your bundles, and they have bounded energy. You have injectivity radius that's independent of this energy, and so you can fall below the threshold. Okay. Other questions? I'm a little puzzled with one comment you made during your talk. Somehow injectivity do you think injectivity radius means inequality trivial or too restrictive? Or too restricted. I didn't say it's too restricted, just that when the injectivity radius was infinite, then that in many instances would tell you you had no finite energy Yang mills or finite energy harmonic maps. Except trivial ones. You'd have to have zero curvature, zero, or you'd have to be homotopically trivial. Uh, or you have to be homotopically trivial for your harmonic map. Oh, you're saying my geometry is sort of too simple to support non-trivial harmonic map. No, I'm saying that if it's finite energy harmonic map, then it has to be trivial under those circumstances. I'm not saying you can't have an, I don't know what could happen if you allowed your energy to be infinite. Oh, for sufficiently small, right? That's the whole philosophy, for sufficiently small energy of the harmonic map. I think. All energy, right? I mean, there will certainly be infinite energy ones. You just pull back one via a cover to the universal cover, and you get an infinite energy one. Yeah, so remember, what was the situation? Remember, what was the situation? I mean, I could, do you want me to go back to the slide again? I can reshare if you'd like, or I could just speak my way through it, whichever you'd rather. That inequality was helpful then. Okay, so let me share screen again. Just in my world, legend activity radius was always a good news. Yes, well, it is good news, but this case, part of the good news is various things are trivial. Ah, so here it is. So, what I've told you is I can control the energy on a unit ball. On a unit ball by this e to the minus. So here you want it to be infinite. So if the energy in a unit ball is less than or equal to zero times the energy in a, oh, well, we have to be careful. Yeah, so if the energy, if the total energy is finite, then this, this, then these numbers will all be, ah, if the total energy here is finite, then we have zero times something finite. If the energy. times something finite. If the energy, if you're allowing your manifold to be non-compact and you're allowing your energy to be infinite, then this doesn't tell you anything because I haven't. This is just some equality. This is zero times infinity. Is that it? Yes. Any further question? Can I maybe ask, so in your results, do you a priori assume smoothness or do you just assume stationary? You just assume stationary Yang Mills? Well, for Yang Mills, I didn't work out the sharpest regularity beforehand. So, Yang Mills, that's why I stated it for smooth moduli, because I haven't yet worked, thought through the approximation issues that you, and for harmonic maps, you know how to approximate, you know, embed in Euclidean space, and you can just, then you have smooth approximation. Just then you have smooth approximation. I have a recollection that there was some error by an unnamed pair of very famous authors with approximation in Yang-Mills. So I decided not to say anything about Yang-Mills, except in the Smooth case for right now, until I thought about that more deeply. Well, I thought the Smooth's approximation might not exactly be true in Yang-Mill's case. I'm not entirely sure, but. Not entirely sure, but Tristan River, maybe with one of his students, had some results about for the five dimensions. They had very unusual notions of this was Petro, P-A-E-T-R-A-C-A-T. Yes, that all was very interesting. I was following their work for a while. It wasn't clear to me it was the canonical path, but certainly I haven't reproduced that yet or done anything to make myself expert in that particular issue yet. Expert in that particular issue yet. So that's why, for the time being, I stuck to smooth case. And I figure if I write this up more carefully, then I'll maybe understand that, see if I can sharpen these results to some weaker version of Yang-Mills. But my guess is that that's a hard problem. Okay, but it seems to me that, like, so your results really has roughly two parts. One is the standard part about epsilon regularity on the standard unit board. On the standard unit ball. The other is the sort of monotonicity with an extra gain of exponential factor. So it looks like the second part only deals with L1 type averages. So maybe that doesn't really rely on very strong regularity a priority. Yes, so that is not an issue. It's just so let me think about that. Yeah, so certainly in the in the Certainly, in the that again, I was really studying this more in the harmonic case, a harmonic map case. So, in the harmonic map case, all you need in order to be able to prove that without the regularity, you could start off with just a weekly harmonic map and then assume it's stationary. And in that context, that's enough to derive such estimates. So, again, I haven't yet sat down and worked out what the analog is of stationarity in the Yang-Mills case. In the Yang-Mills case. Well, Yang-Mills has a quite standard definition for stationarity, right? Well, you just talked about critical? Well, I mean, stationarity is a certain quadratic expression being a divergence frequent. Yes, yes. So that's the, I guess I should rephrase whether, whether I didn't work out whether these techniques also. These techniques also actually it does. I take that back. So it's known. So because price, the original price inequality works for stationary Yang mills. And so any place that works, this will also work. So yeah, so stationary is okay. And then for extending these results. Okay, so you don't have to, for example, a prior make sense of For example, Appara makes sense of that's all right. I figured for my talk, I put my phone in another room. We haven't had many phones going off during the conference. Well, this is not quite during the conference. It's questions actually. Yes, whatever. Any other questions? Or I guess you're supposed to say that, Minoa, not me. Say that Minois, not me. You said it beautifully. I don't mean. Well, I suggest that we thank Mark and then move on to the discussion period. So thank you again. It's hard to do both, but there's electronic clap and there's the real clap.
