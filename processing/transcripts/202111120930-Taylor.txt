Yeah, I will be behind our discussion leaders, Wad Taylor and Albrecht Clem, who will tell us their views on the subject, challenges and prospects for strings geometry. So the plan is that Uh Wati will give a short presentation followed by Albre, and then everybody in the audience is most encouraged to participate, ask questions, comments, give comments, etc. But before, let me follow the example of Nana, Saul, and Oscar in presenting the main. Um, in the main characters, yeah, and uh, yeah, I mean, Wati got his PhD in Berkeley, then he eventually moved to the East Coast. He's been in MIT for quite a while now. Albrecht graduated at Heidelberg University, had some postdocs around in Europe, some faculty positions in Germany. Faculty positions in Germany, moved to Madison, and then came back to the good old homeland and is now at the University of Bonn. And okay, so now it's all yours, Wati, you want to start? Starting in progress. Sure, sorry, I'm just connecting my Agahead. So you have permissions, yeah, you have to share it. Yeah, you have to share me? Yes, yes, great. So Great. So let's see. Can you see the? Yeah, there we go. Presentation. And are you getting feedback? I'm a little bit afraid I might have. Are you hearing me without feedback? No, we were listening to a dog barking, but. That was my dog. Okay, very good. So let me see. Start presenting. Good. So I was just going to maybe talk from 50. I was just going to maybe talk for 15 minutes or so, talk about some of the things which I think are particularly interesting that have happened, particularly with Calabi Ao geometries over the last 10 years or so, that tie into with the theme of this workshop, in particular the things that connect a little bit to phenomenology. So I just want to make some general comments. I'm not going to try to give a thorough set of references. I will mention some people's work. I know many people that are on this in this workshop here and present have done related things. Have done related things. I'd like to encourage people as I'm talking: if you have some comment, some question, or you want to mention some work of you or someone else that I didn't mention in some context, please just bring it in. I'm happy to have any such interjections. So really, I think one of the most interesting things that's happened in the last decade or so, as we've developed a better understanding of geometry and its connection to phenomenology, is that we really have. Is that we really have, I would say, a more, oops, just a enable editing. Okay. Yeah, we have a more global, can you see what I'm writing? Great. Great. A more global picture of how geometry underlies the string landscape. And I think this allows us to ask questions like: what is possible? This is related. This is related to the so-called swampland program and what is generic? What is generic? So, a couple of particular things that we might talk about in that regard, and this came up a little bit in the discussion on the phenomenology discussion on Wednesday, so I want to expand a little bit on that: is what's topical, what's That is what's topical, what's possible in terms of the G, the gauge group, and in terms of the matter representations. So, first, let me talk a little bit about what we've learned about collabios, and then I'll talk a little bit about how this ties into our understanding of what's possible and what's generic for gauge groups. So, you know, we all know this beautiful picture from the work of Kreutzer and Skarka looking at hypersurfaces in toric varieties that for collecting. In Tauric varieties, that for Calabiao threefolds, we can plot the Hodge numbers of the known Calabiaos, and they fit in this nice sort of shield picture like this, where up here we have 11,491, and over here we have 491, 11, and here we have 251, 251, and inside there we have hundreds of millions of different polytopes, each corresponding to different collabias, and similarly for And similarly, for four-dimensional collabias for CY4s, the known collabias actually fit in a very similar picture, which looks sort of like that, but with a much steeper slope to the boundary. And the Hodge numbers here are something like 252, 303, 148, and it's conjugate here. So the Hodge numbers are much bigger for the fourfolds. For the fourfolds. But in both the threefolds and the fourfolds, one thing we've learned is that some enormous fraction, something like more than 99.99% of these are elliptic. That is to say, they admit in some phase an elliptic vibration. So they can be understood using, on the one hand, they can be understood using the structure of elliptic vibrations. There's a proof that they're a finite number. So Gross proved that they're a finite number of That there are a finite number of elliptically fibered Calabia threefolds. Recently, that's been generalized to fourfolds. So, we know that there are a finite number of distinct topological types of classes of threefolds and fourfolds. And almost all the collabias that we know are actually of this elliptic kind. And what about the other Hodge number and fourfold? Good. So, this is just H11 and H31. There is an H22, which you could draw as an extra dimension coming. Which you could draw as an extra dimension coming out, but they would all still fit in this plot. And it's generally that tends to be how carry, it's a little bit less interesting for the physics, but it's also important. So good point, Paul, in the chat. So, you know, this observation that most of these are elliptic, you know, with Yu Chan Huang, we looked at the clebias coming from toric hypersurfaces, and the group from Virginia, Anderson, Gao, Gray, and Lee has some very nice work looking at CICYs, completed. Looking at CICYs, complete intersection collabias, showing that in all the different classes we know of, most collabiats really are elliptic. And there are some general arguments that essentially once H11 becomes very large, essentially all of these should be elliptic. Now, furthermore, we have a somewhat systematic way of generating elliptic collaborators. So we have a much better handle on the overall global structure of the space of collaborators and thence of the space of string compactifications. So for instance, for collaboration, So, for instance, for Calabiao fourfolds, this controls what is arguably the biggest set of F-theory compactifications that give us n equals one 4D supergravity theories. So these have been studied a lot. If we look, for example, at these Calabia fourfolds, focusing on the elliptic ones, we know that the number of, so for CY fourfolds, we have sort of a global picture of this moduli space, the number of Space, the number of base geometries that support elliptic vibrations is about 10 to the 3,000. And this is a number which came from the work of both the Northeastern group, Halverson, Long, and Sung, and work that Enan Wong and I did, looking at numbers of bases. There's about 10 to the 3,000 bases. And then for different bases, there are also many possible fluxes. So you can get on the order of 10 to the 200,000 fluxes. 100,000 fluxes for the base that's up here. And you can also look at, for a given bases, the number of different triangulations. The number of triangulations is something like 10 to the 50,000. This was studied for this base here by Enon and also the Cornell group, Demeritus McAllister, and others from Cornell have looked at the triangulations there. So we have a very rich set. So, we have a very rich set of geometries, huge numbers of these possibilities, but we also have a very systematic way of thinking about them. So, that's kind of the global picture of the set of geometries. And then we can ask questions like in this big set of geometries that we have some control over, what do we get for gauge groups and matter? So, let me just say something about the gauge group. A typical vacuum in this big landscape has a gauge group which has Which has many factors of E8, F4, G2, and SU2. This was found both in the analysis of the Northeastern group and in the work of some Monte Carlo work with Wong. The largest rank has been known for decades, actually. The collabiao out here in the set of four folds was identified by. Fourfolds was identified by Candelas, Perevilov, and Rajich quite some time ago. The rank is 121,328, and that's a base with some E8 to the 2561 times a bunch of F4 and G2 and SU2 factors. So you can get very large. This is actually addressing a question that came up in Wednesday's discussion. How big can the rank get? That's the biggest known rank. It may be possible to prove that that's the biggest rank. We certainly believe. Biggest rank. We certainly believe for Calabia threefolds that this is the largest, 491 is the largest value of H11, although that's not rigorously proven. You can prove that 491 is the largest value of H31 for an elliptic threefold. And so that makes some suggestion there. But so we have the very large rank. The non-abelian gauge groups are well understood. The abelian structure, and this is really where things become more unclear and more further work would be useful. Further work would be useful. U1 to the k has been realized up to 10, but the upper bound is much larger around 16 or so. There was some work by Lee and Vigon using world sheet analysis of the string theory, which shows that the number has to be, sorry, I think 16 is the bound from F theory, and there's a larger bound of 20 or 22 coming from the world sheet bound on the string world sheet. This K equals 10 was recently described in a thing related. Was recently described in a thing related to a Schoen manifold by Grassi and Wygon, related to a construction of GNOME LPs. So we have a pretty good handle on how big the gauge group can get. And the typical gauge groups, as I said, will include lots of these E8, F4, G2, and SU2 factors. So then you might ask, okay, how do we get the standard model gauge group, SU3 cross SU2 cross U1? And there are various ways of getting this. We can get it from a gut. We can get it from a gut, which we break by flux breaking or another mechanism, or we can get it directly in the geometry. It can also be either tuned, which means you take a general base and then you manipulate the geometry through the complex structure coefficients to tune an enhanced gauge group, or it can be forced from the geometry of the base. Most of these bases here in this large space of vacua have some force. Space evacua have some force geometry, some force gauge group coming from divisors with a negative negative curvature normal bundle, which force you to have a singular geometry in the elliptic vibration and a resulting gauge group. This is often called the geometrically non-Higgsable gauge groups. And so there are really four different ways to imagine getting the standard model. And each of those four has seen quite a bit of, some of them have seen quite a bit of analysis, and others are just starting to be worked on. For instance, all the work of Beasley-Heckman-Wafa. All the work of Beasley Heckman-Waffa, Danagi Weinholt, and the executive work that came out of that on strength phenomenology came from essentially a tuned gut. More recently, there's been a lot of developments related to directly tuned standard model type constructions. There was a nice construction by the work of Paul Ullman, who's here in the audience, and Dennis Clevers and collaborators of a so-called F11 fiber, which it turns out. Fiber, which it turns out automatically gives us an SU3 cross SU2 cross U1 mod Z6 gauge group. And recently, the group from Penn, including Miriam Svedich and Halverson and others, have looked at some 10 to the 15th standard model vacuum you can get there. Related to that, you can actually write down the most general construction of this gauge group. Construction of this gauge group. And this is work with Andrew Turner and Nikhil Raghuram show that you can get large classes of vacuo with those tuned gauge groups. Now, even though those are very large numbers, those are much less than the total number of geometries. So perhaps even more promising place to look is at non-Higgsable exceptional gauge groups that are then broken down to the standard model. And that's, I think, some work in progress that you. Think some work in progress that you may hear about at a later time. But I think these are very interesting, exploring all four of these possibilities. That also is something which, in the context of flux-broken E8s, Yinan Wang has looked at some interesting aspects of that. So that is something we know about the gauge groups. Let me see, I need to. Sorry, I'm interested. I'm using a software that I don't use very much. I'm using a software that I don't use very much, and I have to figure out how to go to another page. Okay, I'm just going to make a new note because I don't know how to change pages efficiently with this software. Page two. Okay, so now let's talk a little bit about matter. So, this also came up in the discussion on Wednesday. So, this also came up in the discussion on Wednesday. What are the bounds on the kinds of matter that you can get from geometry? So, I want to emphasize that really it's our understanding of collabiat geometries and a more refined understanding of what's generic and what's not in that context that allows us to start to answer some of these phenomenological questions. So, for instance, what is possible? We have some knowledge from all the work on heterotic theory over the decades of the different gauge groups and matter content you can get from heterotic. What we've recently seen in F-theory is that results are very similar. F-theory is that results are very similar. So, for instance, for SUN, is of course the fundamental, the anti-symmetric, and the adjoint, which are so-called generic matter representations. These are the ones you get from a typical F-theory compactification. They're the simplest forms of singularities, and they give the largest dimension of moduli space. These are generic. There are also a few other representations. For instance, the symmetric representation, which comes from a self-intersecting point of the divisor carrying the gauge group. The divisor carrying the gauge group. And for some special gauge groups like SQ2, we can get things like the triple symmetric, which would come from a triple intersection point. One way to think about that is that you can build that from a Dinkin diagram of D4, where you have three SU2s carried on the legs here, and then the matter lives on the inside. So, from that point of view, you can ask: well, could we, for example, have an SU3 triple N. An SU3 triple symmetric representation. And to get that, we would need to embed that in a Dinkin diagram something like this, i.e. in E6 hat. But we can't have an E6 hat which gets shrunk completely in F theory. So this is ruled out in F theory. So in fact, from the point of view of the geometry of F theory, we see that really a very small number of exotic representations like this one and this one are allowed in F theory and most other things. Allowed in F-theory, and most other things are forbidden. So that's a pretty complete story for non-abelian matter, and it matches very nicely with what we know from heterotic. There's some boundary cases, and this really relates to the singularity structure of Calabiad geometries. For U1 charges, the story is less well understood. There's direct constructions up to Q equals 6. Q equals six. Paul and others have written some things, Morris and other people writing ways of describing up to charge six. We have indirect descriptions up to Q equals 21, some work with Mikhail Ragaron. We have no upper bound. And so that's a really interesting question for an open question. What is the upper bound on abelian charges? We really don't have a good. In charges. We really don't have a good handle on that. So, in understanding all this, a key thing is the singular geometry of Calabi-Yaus. And one of the things that's enabled a lot of progress is having a better understanding of the resolutions of these singular collabiat geometries. So, the work of many people, in particular, for instance, Asole, Patrick Jefferson, Monica Kang, and others, has really given us a better understanding. Has really given us a better understanding of how these different resolutions work for a variety of singularities. But there are also cases where we need to have some direct treatment of the singularities. Often it is the case that these singularities are non-crepent and they can't be resolved to give us a Calabiel manifold. And for instance, Grassy and Weigon have looked at matter that is included in these terminal singularities. That's an area which I think on the That's an area which I think on the math side, there's a lot more to be said. I'll mention it, you know, in the context of chiral matter. There are some interesting things to say there. So chiral matter in 4D extends the matter discussion. We have a similar story about what matter content is possible in terms of representations. But now you can ask, you know, for a given collabiat, what kind of chiral matter do you get? There's been a lot of work on that over the last decade or so. Over the last decade or so. Various, many, many people have contributed to that. I'll just mention that in some recent work, we found that you can describe the chiral matter in 4D theories from a singular collabiat geometry in a very general way by observing that the structure of what's called H22 vert of X over Z. Of X over Z is apparently resolution independent. So H22 vert is spanned by divisors DI wedge DJ in the collabio. And although naively, you would think that this structure, this is basically a lattice, an integral linear bilinear form. You would think that that lattice, which is built out of the quadruple intersection numbers, would not be resolution independent. It would depend on the Not be resolution independent. It would depend on the resolution since the quadruple intersection numbers are resolution dependent. But it turns out it's not, which I think gives us a powerful tool and also suggests that there should be a direct treatment of this structure, H22VERT, in the language of singular collabias. So that I think is an interesting aspect of the challenge to mathematicians of directly understanding topological features of singular elliptic collabios is understanding things like this, which are invariant. Understanding things like this, which are invariant. Understanding this allows us to classify chiral matter in many different contexts very generally. It's giving us new insights into mirror symmetry, which you may hear about in another context, but lots of interesting stuff going on there. Of course, we also want to understand non-chiral matter, which involves more complicated aspects of the Calabi-Ao topology. And there's been some initial work by Timo and Ling Lin and more. Timo and Ling Lin, and more recently by Miriam Svedich and Ling and other collaborators using some somewhat sophisticated mathematical methods to understand the non-chiral matter. I think these are really interesting questions for further research. Finally, let me just highlight the issue of moduli stabilization, which is another arena in which people have really started to make significant progress. So, for instance, the work of the Cornell group, Demirtis, Kim, McAllister. McAllister, Rios Tascone, Mantok? I forget the last collaborator's name. Anyway, they've been able to find a small cosmological constant in getting cosmological constants down below 10 to the minus 120 by tuning the fluxes and then stabilizing the moduli, which I think is a really exciting development. Exciting development. I'm kind of, I don't want to speak too long, so let me just wrap up with a couple of comments. I think one of the biggest problems is understanding how to break supersymmetry. And for example, we see that these gauge groups, which are generic and forced in Calabio geometries with eight supercharges and with four supercharges, are those still forced if we have no supercharges? A related question for mathematicians is: if we look at a geometry which Geometry which has which admits a metric with vanishing Ricci curvature. Does that in general imply that we have something which is special holonomy or collabi-Yau? As far as I understand it, I know there's been some work by Babbi Acharya and some others on this. If we try to construct a manifold with vanishing Ricci curvature, it almost always ends up being a special holonomy or Calabia manifold. And so finding exceptions. Calavier manifold. And so finding exceptions to that or some large class of non-supersymmetric compactifications that give us a good super good gravity theory without supersymmetry would I think be really interesting. Anyway, I just kind of wanted to say a few things, set the stage for some discussion. Let me see if I can successfully detach my stop broadcasting. Okay, great. Well done. What the I I propose that. Yeah. Yeah. Let's listen to Albrecht and then we open the microphone for everybody. Unless somebody wants to ask a very urgent question now to Wati. Okay, let's wait. I myself have a couple of questions. So, Alvrecht. Yeah, I try to share my screen. Does it work? Do you see my screen or not? Yes, we see your screen. Yeah, okay. So, um, yeah, I was also trying first, thanks for the possibility to talk here a little bit. I mean, um, I mean, I was trying to sort of formulate four benchmark questions that maybe one should solve in the field. And the first And the first one has very much to do with now. This is here frozen. Let me try. This is not good. You see my screen, but I cannot. I can, if it's not full screen. Okay, so one thing I remember quite vividly, so for instance, Michael Peskin. So, for instance, Michael Peskin, when he was asked in the 90s whether there is an interesting prediction of string theory, of course, he was saying, yeah, that is that the rank of the gauge group is 22, and that we know from the anomaly cancellation of the heterodic string. And of course, if you think about this now, then this is unfortunately less clear what to say. And Wati has already given us a good overview about the rank of the gauge groups that can occur. That can occur. But not only is it much higher, the second problem is we don't know it exactly because the examples that were mentioned there in Tauric geometry and Tauric geometry is only a small piece of how to construct Calabiao. So I think my first question is basically finiteness of Calabiao, and I think that's a very important question. So that's a benchmark question. So we have So we have, of course, the philosophy that we have local Kalabiau, they correspond or engineer n equal to, let's say, supersymmetric quantum field series without gravity. And then we can ask the question, is the consistency of quantum gravity strong enough to render this type of number of, let's say, type two string conductification finite? And so basically, we have. And so basically, we have this effective supergravities in four dimensions. And we know when we have n equal two, we only have to specify Kalabiao threefold. And if we want to have n equal one, we have to specify Kalabiao threefold, stable gauge bundles for the heterodox string, elliptic Calabiao fluxes, orientifolds, and so on. So, surprisingly, even the first question, which should be much simpler, is not answered. Not answered, and I think that that is something that would very much help the credibility of the field if this could be answered. So one has to say that the mathematicians more or less have done their job. I mean, they started, of course, with the question of differential geometry. Is there a unique metric on a Keller manifold which vanishing Richie curvature? And we know all that Mr. Calabi. All that Mr. Calabi in 95 has said, yeah, maybe it is. He has actually done more. He constructed the metric on a non-compact Calabi Yao, more precisely a line bundle over P2. And he said, okay, I mean, if the first choint class vanishes, then maybe there is a metric. And then Yao proved that thing. And that was in 96. And he got, of course, the Fields Medal in 1980. In 1980. And so that makes, of course, the construction of Calabiao trivial. So you take an almost Fano variety in n dimensions, and then you take this Calabiao M to be the zero section of this canonical bundle. And then the adjunction formula just says this has vanishing first churn class. And I mean, the most rich construction. Rich construction. I will maybe say later on a little bit more whether this is typical. Is the one of reflexive polyhedra. So we know that if we do this, if this, I mean, the Fano variety will be of dimension M if the polyhedra is of dimension M. So if we do a one-dimensional polyhedra, this is just a line segment, the reflex of polyhedra is two. That's two. Then the elliptic curves there are 16. I think they were found by Butteriff. For the K3, there are 4319. That was found by Kreutze and Skarker. And the same for the Calabiao 34. So if you plot this short sequence of numbers, you see it's roughly a gross double exponentially. So maybe you expect that there will be 10 to the 20. Um, that there will be 10 to the 22 colour profiles, and as but here said, they are probably all elliptic, or most of them are elliptically fibered. But it's still awkward that there is a question mark on this point. I mean, that is a construction we know, it's just a combinatorical problem, so it's hard to understand that this hasn't been answered. So, of course, as I said, the philosophy is there are infinite number of local columbia. Number of local collabios, and these appear in the geometric engineering of quantum field series. So, for instance, if you want to engineer SUN series, then you do this by the non-complete fan whose traces you can see in this figure. And there are infinite many because you can make this figure as long as you wish, as you see at this dots. But then, of course, the question is obvious. I mean, how much? Obvious. I mean, how much of these things you can compactify to include a thing that also involves gravity, means a global collabiao. Of course, hentorically, this is easy to answer, and we have heard already a lot about this. You can see what is the largest SUN, a single factor, and so on, because Kreutzer and Skrake have done the job in Calabia fourfolds. Job in the Calabia fourfolds, there is a more of a conjecture because we don't know this classification of reflexive polyhedra. But for instance, by this work that also Buddy has mentioned, I mean, of candelas at all, they know that this singles factor in an example is the biggest singles factor is SO 7232. 32. But in a, I think, a paper with Yao, we already said that if you take this anal strange singularity and fiber it successively over P1, then you get indeed the Calabi Yao, which are on the edges of this Tauric diagram. But this is a long time ago, I guess this was also 97, a little bit before this paper here. And so, of course, that also gives you. So, of course, that also gives you the bounds on the Euler number, on the H11, and so on. So, the question is: why is this whole, let's say, philosophy of embedding into quantum gravity not strong enough to make this bouncing construction independent? I mean, that is something which I think is a benchmark question in the field. The field. So that is my first slide. The second question is, or my first question, the second question is: Is the moduli space of the theory of finite volume and what are its boundaries? This is, of course, also a question that was already a little bit mentioned in Vadi's talk. So I will sort of present you the plot of the Keller parameter for the mirror of one. Parameter for the mirror of one parameter, Calabiau. And it looks nice. I mean, it's a sort of, you see, here is a conifold point. Then here is a point of maximal unipotent monodromy. But here it also goes actually to zero. I haven't had enough time to plot it all the way down. But it also gets an angle of zero. And of course, we know if we. And of course, we know if we sort of plot the same figure for an elliptic curve, then the area in the Prancara metric is pi over 3. But we know only little about how we should think about the model Lie space of Calabiaus. And that is a question which has been sort of interesting in the landscape distance conjectures. And again, the mathematicians have sort of done their job. So, for instance, Job. So, for instance, if you look do the analysis of the variation of the mixed hodge structure, then you find only four possibilities for one Kalabi Yao. So, this is, so to say, a picture. I mean, you know that in a hot structure, you have two vibrat, I mean, you have two filtrations and the one filtration, so to say, goes from left to right and the other goes from up to down. Right, and the other goes from up to down, and that is, so to say, the middle cohomology of the Calabiao, which is a one-parameter family. And this study of the variation of the mid-shock structure that tells you how this thing behaves at the singular points. And there are not so many possibilities. I mean, in fact, for For one parameter Calau family, van Straten has a nice review where he reviews these facts. He said that there are only four possibilities. There could be the generic point, then there could be the conifold point, there could be a K point, and there could be a MUM point. And you see, this MUM point, so to say, is indeed the mirror of the generic situation because everything that was here is actually. That was here is actually going in the vertical direction. And the cornifold is, so to say, a situation where you get two in the vertical connect, in the vertical direction, you get an elliptic curve here, and here you get basically two K3s, because these guys make the middle cohomology of a K3. So that is a very detailed theory, and it's actually quite useful for studying the. Quite useful for studying the complex modelized space of a calabiao. So, I guess there is a lot of addition. I mean, there are much more results when you have many modelized by Matt Kerr and Spencer Bloch. And so, this is really a thing that we can profit quite enormously on. So, the next question is. question is um is arithmetic geometry is relevant so that's some hobby maybe of me um so but we know for instance one data point and was also pointed out by shamit and its collaborator so if you have a supersymmetric flux vacua with n equal to supersymmetry then it corresponds to the attractor to an attractor point and what is nice about an attractor point is that um Point is that I mean, there is an action on the middle cohomology, which in this case is also four-dimensional. So it's the same situation that we have here. We have this middle cohomology. There's an action of the Galois group. And at certain points in the modelized space, this Galois group actually splits. So it becomes two irreducible representations. And this you can see. And this you can see on the on the on the denominator of the Hassewai, sorry, on the numerator of the Hasseweil setter function. So, and it turns out actually this is very rare. So contrary to what you might believe, I could not, so this manifold has actually an attractor point at one point, it's a rank two attractor point, so it has a supersymmetric one. Fracture point. So it has a supersymmetric vacua, but there are 14 other hypergeometric families which don't, no, sorry, there are 13 hypergeometric families which don't have attractor points. So for some reason, it's not so easy to find these supersymmetric wakua. And in fact, the only way to find them, there was a lot of effort by Moore and Denev and so on. The only way to find them is to analyze the Hasselwell setup function. So that's a function so that's a sort of say um a harbinger in my um in my opinion that we actually should also study arithmetic geometry in addition to algebraic geometry to get an um an idea how the string landscape looks. So another example is for instance that also Wadi mentioned that the number of U1 groups depends on the model while group and of course you know that And of course, you know that the model Y group by the famous Burst, Schwinnett and Dyer conjecture, corresponds to the L function value or the vanishing of the L function at zero. And here is a bit similar. So these coefficients here, not only that it splits, these coefficients, I mean, it splits in this way here, the middle core monitoring, and that is signaled by this. Is that signaled by this? But it's not only that it splits these coefficients here, this is done over all primes p, they have also a meaning. So for instance, they are the Fourier coefficient of a hacker eigenform. And of course, we can build then a hacker L function. And the information in this Hacker L function is a little bit similar to the normal L function that features in the Normal L-function that features in the same problem for elliptic curves and determines conjecturally the torsion. So, in other words, I think that there are other, so to say, there are other things that you can investigate. You can, for instance, see whether time reversal is realized in this vacuois. And you see that at least the cohomology splits over Q. And that means that if And that means that if you have a teta angle, that so the teta angle will be not one half or zero, but it would at least be a rational number. And if you then show that you have only BPS states, which are a multiple of this denominator of this setter of this q, then you would have time reversal. So, in total, you get actually a quite nice diagram. So, you know that the Hodge conjecture. So, you know that the Hodge conjecture says something that all Hodge classes are represented by algebraic cycles, but the Tate conjecture is basically says if the Galois group splits in this way, that then also, roughly speaking, these pieces of the cohomology here, these pieces are also represented by algebraic cycles. And of course, that would be very relevant also to understand. Relevant also to understand this singularity, this hot structure better. So that is the third question that I have. Maybe the fourth question, is there some spin-off from Fino? That's something that I like also recently. I mean, we know that for Feynman graphs, if you calculate them at one loop, then there will be a rational function. And that is, so to say, an emergent error. And that is, so to say, an emergent evidence that occurs. And then you can get them by rational polylogarithms. And at two loop, you get them by elliptic functions. And so you get them from the period geometry of families of colour BAO. And guess what happens at three-loop? You get them from K3. And what happens at four loop? You get them at colour BAO from Color Biau threefolds. So in some sense, the thing that we are doing to analyze flux varqua, et cetera, et cetera. Is Fluxwakwa, etc., etc., is by no means wasted. So, what we call the discriminants, the phenomenologists, they call it the Landau singularity and so on. And for instance, these prominent cycle that vanishes at the conifold that is actually related by the optical theorem to the imaginary part of the amplitude. So, things are not at all wasted. And one example where you can see this very Example where you can see this very clearly is the banana graph. So, the banana graph, I mean, there's a program now in phenomenology that all graphs should be related to other graphs. And in all these relations, the banana graph occurs. And it is actually related to a calabiao, which is a complete intersection in this fano variety, or as a hypersurface in this fano variety, or a complete intersection. Fano variety or complete intersection in this final variety, which is P1 to the L. So, well, I don't know how the prospect is for string phenomenology, but I have the sure impression that Calabia will never go out of physics because we need, of course, precision experiment to check all these things that maybe come from the consideration. From the consideration of the string landscape, etc. etc. So, maybe with this, I want to end these short presentations. Thank you. Thank you, Albrech. Very nicely organized. Interesting. So now, if I stop sharing, maybe. I mean, maybe I have one comment to Wadi's statement that most of this collabiao come from this choice construction. So, I mean, one guy who's always, so to say, looking at the specialities is, of course, Duco. And they have a list which actually rivals the number of Of a reflexive polyhedra, but these lists are all one-parameter Calabiao. So it's they for sure have no elliptic vibration. So it's, of course, if you have more parameters, then I think Vadi is correct. But I mean, then there are, of course, embeddings into spaces which come from non-abeli engaged linear sigma models and so on. Models and so on. So, I guess the picture that comes from Kreutzer and Skark is very nice, but first of all, it's not complete. It should be completed for fourfolds. And secondly, I think it is not completely generic. So, I actually have a comment and a question which I wanted to ask even before you said that, Albrecht. So, maybe I'll turn to that if you don't mind. So, first of all, actually, could you put in the chat or something, the reference you just described? In the chat, or something, the reference you just described for this set of one parameters. I'm not actually familiar with that. You said Duco, uh, yeah, this is Duco's. Uh, Duco has written a review of Yao operators. But yeah, I think it's, um, I can put it in the chat here. Okay, that'd be great. So, the comment and question I wanted to make is, I actually, I mean, I'm sympathetic to what you said about Tauric geometry seeming naively like it's just Seeming naively like it's just a small piece of the whole set of collabias. I'm actually a little surprised, at least at large Hodge numbers, at the unreasonable effectiveness of toric geometry. So let me just say a word about that and then ask you your opinion. I mean, you know, I understand some general theoretical reasons that most collaborators at large Harge numbers should be elliptic, because if you have a large H11, you can sort of argue that you have to have a divisor that cubes to zero. And, you know, the form of a triple intersection form generally should have. Of a triple intersection form generally should admit something which plays the role of that structure that supports an elliptic structure. I don't know such an argument for toric geometry, but if you look at Hart-Lodge-Hodge numbers, for instance, we did a study with Yinan Wang where we looked at an explicit construction of all the bases that support elliptic Calabia threefolds, starting from the Hertzenbrook surface F12. So we know there's a real proof that the largest possible H21 for a Calabiya threefold is 491. Labiya threefold is 491. And that comes from the generic elliptic vibration over F12. And we can systematically take the Hirzebrooks, you know, basically by following, you know, Antonella-Graci's argument that, following on Mark Gross's proof of finiteness, that basically all elliptic collabial bases for threefolds have to be blow-ups of Hertz-Brook surfaces or P2. We can start from those and blow up systematically. And we found, we rigorously constructed, I believe, all bases that support Calabia. All bases that support Calabiadao threefolds that are elliptic with Hodge numbers H21 bigger than 150. So that's two-thirds of the way down for 491. And we found about 6,000 bases. And of those, about 4,000 are already covered in the Chreiser-Skarka database. And so basically, at large H21, it's just the Tauric stuff. And then as you go down, you start getting little bells and whistles attached. But it's basically the Tauric instructions with a few funny things blown up that are non-true. Funny things blown up that are non-tauric. And so, at least at large Hodge numbers, I feel like that's evidence that Tauric geometry is doing an unreasonably effectively good job at picking out all the bases, at least, and a lot of the collabias with large Hodge numbers. And I'm actually curious, Albrecht, if you have any insight as to why that could possibly be. Because when I first learned Torrek geometry, I thought, oh, yeah, great, but this is just going to be a tiny piece of the story. But it seems to be bigger than that. And I don't understand why. Yeah, I mean, it's true, for instance, if you look also. instance if you look also at i mean at the butterev borisov construction which is a little bit more complicated it goes makes embeddings of um of complete intersections yeah you don't get any record number so when we looked at this uh at this problem for the fourfolds we basically had a one idea namely to fiber this uh this funny um arnold strange singularity over and over again because it gives so to say the maximal polarized case 3 already Maximal polarized K3 already, and it gives a nice torsion. Uh, I mean, an elliptic curve is a lot of torsion, and so this gives it gives already everything. So, I believe actually that there you can be very well right. And I think also, wasn't it Mark Cross who first said that the number of elliptic collabia is finite in 97? And then he sort of had no bound. But you're saying now there is a bound? But you're saying now there is a bound. And another thing which I think which is relatively efficient, and this is maybe related, is that I mean, when I mean, you know that for Fano's threefolds that you need as a base, then you get this is Kosovich classification, and so to say, but they are really Fano, and you can admit more general things. But for instance, the But for instance, the idea of Corti and these people who now want to classify Calabiao fourfolds finally start all with the Kreutz and Stark list for this reflexive polyedra in three dimensions. And then they try more or less to do what you do, namely to degenerate these things and look and then maybe make, I mean, I mean, I mean, of course, birational transformations. And so, I think, yeah, I think that this Koza Skarkalist is actually a major achievement in this thing. And that it has, yeah, that's why I'm sort of curious. I mean, what can you say about Calabiao fourfolds? Can you also say, I mean, of course, that you don't have probably all the bases already. Right. So, actually, Paul Orman just put. Right. So actually, Paul Ullman just put something in the chat, which I think is very on target about this, which is that there was this recent work, which I mentioned, but I didn't mention the names, by DiCherbo and Svaldi, where they proved the finiteness for elliptic Calabia fourfolds as well. And I don't know, Paul, you want to add something, but it's basically based on a similar minimal model program to what Antonella Garassi said. My understanding though is we don't understand Maury theory for threefolds as well as we understand minimal models. I don't know, Paul, did you want to say more? Yeah, no, I just wanted to say exactly this. So there's this result by So there's this result by Carvo and Swaldi from like, I don't know, one year or two years ago, where they essentially did like this minimal model approach for basis, but they were able to extend it to fourfolds. And I think they are essentially saying that all the basis for an elliptic fourfold is birational to some, in the sense that you can blow it down to some final variety. Yeah, I mean, I think this is this. I think for elliptically colour, for elliptic fibered colour fourfolds, I think that dystoric geometry will play a very big role also in the classification of fourfolds. And that, I mean, probably they don't know, I don't know, I haven't read the paper, Paul, but they probably don't put a maximum number on the Hodge numbers or the Euler number because that must be very difficult. But what I would sort of But what I would sort of like to see is that from some argument of quantum gravity, you can make an argument that, so to say, is model independent. And that would be beautiful. Yeah, well, you know, there was this. That's why I put it, so to say, as a benchmark and problem. And of course, there was work from conformal field theory on that a little bit. So that I think is also a good. So that I think is also a good idea. But that would be really sort of give the field a lot of new credibility, I think, if we, especially also this program of saying, okay, I mean, now we have to select the quantum gravity series, which sort of are compatible of local models. What can they be? So I mean, that's so. Unfortunately, I have not a very concrete idea, but I just want. But I just wanted to put it as a benchmark problem. Okay, are there more comments or questions for Albrecht and Woody? I could ask another question. Sure. Go ahead. So, what about sort of? I so what about sort of non-geometric covectifications? There are also, I mean, again, I guess all the Kolzan-Skarka things have at least one Keller modulus always, and you would think, well, they have a large volume point, but sort of a feature of the string theory is that you're not required to have this. You can have just the Lambda-Winsburg theory, and maybe the space of those theories. the the space of those theories is even even bigger than well most likely not but um because not many there are not many murals that have no complex structure but um but but they're still there and and they're they have not considered say in the context of of f-theory maybe in type 2b land origins for theories have been considered but definitely not in f-theory maybe i can two comments on this i mean for To comment on that. I mean, first of all, in this list of Duco, there, as I said, he is, so to say, interested in the special cases. So he has a couple of models that he calls orphans because they don't have a mum point. So that is this feature. And of course, they are perfectly good collabials. In fact, they In fact, they think and Duko constructed a couple of these, and they have no geometrical face in the mirror. That's one thing. On the other hand, I believe that, I mean, there's also a little bit from this Feynman graph business. So very often you only need a Calabiao motive. So it's not necessary that the Calabiao is in three dimensions. So like the solution to this widget. Like the solution to this rigid collabias, the mirror of the rigid collabias, they embedded it in a higher-dimensional space. And then, yeah, it's a variety where the first todge numbers are 0, 0, but then it starts with a 1 and then it has two other numbers and then a 1 again. So, this is, so to say, a typical situation for a Calabia motif. The one, of course, represents this result. The one, of course, represents the 3-0 form, and the others, but they are in the middle of a bigger cohomology. And I believe that this could be very well pieces of compactification which have not an obvious geometrical meaning. And of course, in this case, I mean, the question comes very concrete because it was a torus orbifold model, this one that was rigid. This one that was rigid, right? So, yeah, yeah, I mean, I think ultimately, maybe we should be studying, if you are interested in any compactifications, we should study Calabiao motives. And that's also the reason that I think this arithmetic geometry is interesting, because of course they focus on the Galois representation. On the Galois representation of the thing. They don't focus so much on the geometrical realization. What do you mean, Galavia motives, Alvre? Yeah, so basically is a piece of a hot structure which has an intersection form and it has integer, for instance, for Calabiao Seefold, it would have integer Integer symplectic monodromy, but it not necessarily has to come from anything, right? It can be abstractly defined. And also it should have special geometry. That means it should have this Griffiths transversality and this properties. But you can study these objects in their own right. And yeah, that's. Yeah, that's. I mean, I don't think it will produce us quickly many examples because these constructions are complicated. But I think one has to have an open mind that there are things which maybe come not from John. Yeah, I actually want to just follow up on Paul's question from a slightly different point of view. I know what Albrecht said. I mean, Paul, you mentioned type 2B non-geometric compactifications, and, you know, certainly. Compactifications. And, you know, certainly generically, if you look at a type 2b compactification on a collabial with fluxes, and you start to include these non-geometric fluxes, like the T-dual of an H-flux and the T-dual of that, and the T-dual of that, you get these very non-geometric things. And that would seem to give a vast space of compactifications, which we don't understand very well. And I see Saav here, our next speaker, who I think you wrote a paper, Saav, with Jacques and with Dave about this at some point, where you found that some, at least, of these Found that some at least of these non-geometric type 2B convectifications have F-theory equivalents. Do you have any comment on, like, to what extent you expect that to be true? Do you believe in all these non-geometric type 2B convectifications? And if so, do you think they all go over to F-theory? Or what is your take on that? So good. So we use sort of heterotic, the map from heterotic to F-theory to show that most, many F-theory models will have non-geometric heterotic tools. Tools. And what we didn't see is we didn't see a huge increase in the number of solutions from this. There could be just a lamppost effect where we were just looking at select models. But I think it depends what you mean by non-geometric. So this goes back to your earlier comment about more general compactifications, non-supersymmetric solutions. So in six dimensions, there is an asymmetric orbital fold, which has the same preserved supersymmetry as K3, but Preserved supersymmetry as K3, but no moduli in the C of T. So that's a very non-geometric background. It's completely frozen at string scale. But in terms of a compactification, it's on the same footing as K3. And I think we don't really know how many such things there are at the moment. And there, there could be a lot of floating around. But I sort of had a question for you following up on that non-geometric, sorry, on the non-supersymmetric question. The only examples I know. The only examples I know in six dimensions for Ricci-flat spaces are K3, the compact Ricci-flat spaces, K3, the four torus, and the quotient of K3 giving on RICs. And that's it. Is there anything else known? Are there any examples known that are Reachy flat but not somehow connected to special holonomy in a simple way? Mean a simple way as far as far as I know, they really aren't. That's why I raised that question. I mean, I don't know if mathematicians have really systematically addressed that question. As I mentioned, I think I haven't looked back at this, but I think Bobby Acharya wrote some paper where he tried to do certain constructions and didn't get anything really new that three-dimensional. Right, right. Atari was looking at three-dimensional compatrifications. Certainly, for four real dimensions, I don't know anything other than what you said, Saab, that admits a rechief. What you said, Saab, that admits a Ricci flat metric. And I mean, it's kind of striking that, you know, maybe Ricci flatness already kind of pushes us towards the set of vacua that we're already identifying so that there might be some sense. I mean, I think the reason one of the reasons this might be interesting is it kind of gives us the sense that maybe the things that we're investigating already from the geometry point of view may already be a pretty big piece of the pie when we start to think about non-supersymmetric compactifications, at least in the context of taking 10D supergravity. Context of taking 10D supergravity, compactifying down to four dimensions on a Ricci-flat manifold. I think it's a really interesting and important question. Wati, I had a question for you. Something that you didn't mention that I think it's important is that there has also been some progress in computing Yukawa couplings. I mean, in looking more closely at the phenomenology of the models you can construct, there are Can construct a standard model. Yeah, no, you're right. I should have mentioned that the Yukawa couplings are, along with the non-chiral matter, are sort of one of the natural next steps. And I think it'd be very interesting to understand the Yukawa coupling structure better. And that's, you know, as we get a better handle on the gauge group, the matter content, the Yukawas are, as you say, Enria, the next natural thing to really try to get a good handle on. And if you want to understand what your MSSM-like theory is doing, you absolutely want to get a handle on the Yukawas. So that's a great point. I don't. On the UCOLA. So that's a great point. I don't have anything useful to say about it, but I think it's a great point. I mean, I will throw out one comment, which is something we ran into, which is there is some kind of a connection between the structure of the multiplicities of chiral matter in 4D F-theory compactifications with codimension three points that are associated with Yukawas. And I think there might be some interesting mathematical structure there, which hasn't really been plumbed. I don't know how to be a little more articulate about that. Um, I don't know how to be a little more articulate about that, but there's something interesting going on there, and I don't fully understand it. We allude to that sort of in passing in this last paper with Andrew Turner and Patrick Jefferson, and I'm sure others have encountered this, but I'm not sure it's really been particular. I know, Albrecht, you've thought about something related to things. Maybe you have some comments on that. Yeah, I mean, I'm actually not aware of efficient techniques how to calculate these things. I mean, of course, you can say when they are vanishing, you can say. When they are vanishing, you can say things like that. But no, I have nothing, I have not studied this question actually. But of course, Anna Maria is right. It's maybe one of the more important questions to try to make contact with phenomenology. Yeah, I was looking, James Gray was there before, but he's not to ask him more concrete questions. Yeah, and a small comment now that you, I think, about fault theorems. There was one that said that all Calabri Jaos are connected. Yeah, this is from CTC Wall. I mean, this is, for instance, again, in the realm of Tauric geometry, you can actually establish that. That was done by Green and some people. I mean, basically, you modify the Tauric. Basically, you modify the Tauric ambient space in a specific way, and you can see that this corresponds to an extremal transition. And yeah, so I think that is probably be true. I mean, if we are so generic. I mean, at least in this realm of manifolds that we are looking at, I think that's probably true. Yeah, something that's worth adding to that is that it's provably the case in the case of all elliptic collaborations. The case in the case of all elliptic collabia threefolds. Combining Mark Gross's analysis and Antonella Garassi's description of everything in terms of a base, which is a blow-up over here, it's a broker of P2, that explicitly means that every elliptic Calabier threefold is connected to every other elliptic Calabiat threefold by some blow-up transition on the base or by basically there's various different kinds of, there's blow-up transitions on the base, which correspond to tensionless string transitions where you change the number of tensor multiplets. There are Higgs. Number of tensor multiplets, there are Higgsing transitions, and there are other more exotic transitions where you keep the gauge group and the matter, sorry, you keep the gauge group and the number of tensors the same, but you change the matter content. And this is actually something which with Lauren Anderson, James Gray, and Nikhil Rogeron, we've explored this other kind of transition. But the point is, between those transitions, you can connect every single elliptic collabiat threefold. So while, you know, the fantasy, Reed's fantasy is realized for elliptic collabia threefolds, probably for collabiat fourfolds. Probably for Calabia fourfolds. And that has a really important physics implication, which is if you look at the space of n equals 160 supergravity theories, it's really one theory. Every single branch of that theory is connected to every other branch by some transition in a provable way. And so it means that we really have one theory of 6D supergravity with all these different branches. And we're kind of honing in on the boundaries of that and whether there's really a swampland or whether we can get rid of all the things that look okay, but we can't get from F. Look okay, but we can't get from F-theory. But the upshot of that is, Emria, that that's a really important question. In 6D, it tells us that we have a single theory of supergravity. I suspect that eventually it will help us understand that in 4D, we can connect all these different bactua, but it's not quite as because we don't understand the minimal model program. Adding briefly to something Paul said, the minimal models for bases of fourfolds, that is threefold bases, I think is not just Fano, but it's also P1. Phano, but it's also P1 or Tauric bundles over some 2D base or a 2D base fibered over a P1. And again, I know Laura and James and collaborators have done some work recently with more general toric bundles. Paul, I think you've thought about some related things as well. Anyway, I just wanted to, you know, I think a better understanding of Moray theory and threefolds to understand threefold bases for fourfolds might help to actually prove this, at least for elliptically fibered Calabia fourfolds, which I think would be a really nice. Labia fourfolds, which I think would be a really nice statement because it would connect all the n equals one 4DF theory vacua, at least off-shell. The problem is, in 60 n equals 1 supergravity, everything is really connected on shell because everything is massless moduli. So you can dial the moduli and move from one branch of the theory to the other without going outside the space of vacuum. In four dimensions, because of the superpotential, you get stuck in various places. And so it's only in some very difficult to access off-shelf formalism that all the different n equals one elliptic That all the different n equals one elliptic collabia fourfold compactifications of f-theory are connected. I don't know if that's a useful adding to your question, Anne-Maria. I think Sal has his hand out too. Yep. Well, I have a completely different question, and I'd like to know you simply to think a little bit about non-supersymmetric stream constructions. And if you start with a heterotic non-supersymmetric string theory, what kind of object could you imagine that you have? Object, could you imagine that you have in six dimensions when you want to go from 10 to 4? Usually, you use a Glavia or you use a Galaviao-like corby fold, but in principle, I expect some more general objects, but I don't know what the conditions for these objects could be. Can you use anything that is six-dimensional? I think this is related to Saab's question. To go to six dimensions, I mean, I guess there are asymmetric orbifolds which can give you different kinds of constructions that are non-super symmetric. But if you want to do it geometrically, I don't know how to really construct a consistent theory without having a Richie flat metric or something closely related to it. I don't have anything else useful to say there. Okay. I see. Thanks. I see. Thanks. I mean, I have actually a related question. Can you go from CHL compactifications to normal?
