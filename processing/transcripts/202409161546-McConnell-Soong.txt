Yeah, so my name is Lindsay McConnell soon. I'm from University of Idaho Extension, as Bert said. And I'll just be giving you kind of a synopsis and introduction to the work that my team has been doing in immunization education, specifically with rural and underserved, medically underserved populations. So a little bit about me. I have a little bit different background. I spent 11 years as a trauma therapist. I spent 11 years as a trauma therapist. I am a licensed clinical professional counselor. I don't do direct-to-client care anymore, but worked in community agencies and private practice during that time. Currently, I'm the health equity director at University of Idaho Extension, and I manage a number of different federally funded grant projects that are focused on health equity, namely ECCITE, which I'll talk to you about in a minute. And I am a certified poverty coach through. Certified poverty coach through Dr. Donna Beagle's organization called Communication Across Barriers. So, just to get a reading through, are people familiar with what the cooperative extension system is? Some of my folks may be not hearing so much. Okay. Well, essentially, the cooperative extension system is an education agency that partners with the federal government, over 200 land-grant universities. Over 200 land-grant universities across the nation, and then also with our local county governments as well. So, our federal partner is the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture. So, they partner and support us and our land grant institutions. Extension is just the third faction for institutions with our academic departments and experiment stations. And then we work directly with those regional and county offices. Regional and county offices supporting professional staff and volunteers. So we have over 3,000 county offices across the nation. Every state has a land-grant university. Every state and territory has at least one. And that includes our historically black colleges and universities and our tribal colleges and universities. So we really are in pretty much every community and are trusted messengers in that. That. Now, my extension colleagues at Washington State University recently published an article in the journal Vaccines, and I thought they explained this pretty well. U.S. extension professionals hold a unique and trusted position in their communities, enabling them to bridge gaps in clinical resources, education, and preventative services for disease prevention. The cooperative extension system utilizes land-grant universities to translate academic research into practical knowledge that benefits. Into practical knowledge that benefits community socioeconomic functioning. So, what is ECCITE and how are we connected to preventive health? So, ECCITE stands for the Extension Collaborative on Immunization, Teaching, and Engagement. Formally, one little statement I have to make, it's an interagency agreement with the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They fund the cooperative extension. They fund the cooperative extension system to address health disparities among rural and other medically Anderson communities. So it's been a series of grant projects that I've had the privilege of leading since they started in 2021 as a rapid response to the pandemic. CDC recognized that Cooperative Extension is an invaluable partner because we exist in pretty much every community across the nation. So the work that we're doing primarily has been to advance. Primarily has been to address barriers and concerns about COVID-19, flu, and other vaccinations for adults. We've been working to increase the connection and communication between those communities and our healthcare systems. We've been looking at how to increase the accessibility of adult vaccines and the clinics that provide them. And then, with all of that, we're taking it back to INFORM, CDC, USDA, NIFA, Cooperative Extension, and then also our local health. Extension and then also our local health partners in reducing health disparities. So, our Idaho team, as I mentioned, has been active in every round of funding. In the first round, really that was the rapid response piece, and it was directly related to COVID-19 and the vaccine. So, we were filling the gaps in education for our health partners who were overwhelmed with what they were doing. So, our extension educators were going out to local events and providing reliable information for. Providing reliable information for folks. In our second round, we designed a three-step educational model for mobile vaccine clinics and ultimately integrated the immunization education into farm safety presentations. Following those presentations, then we would have on-site vaccine clinics for, for example, in this picture is one of our Hispanic dairy workers. We invited their families, we fed them, provided Families, we fed them, provided all sorts of health resources at that event. And then, currently, in this round of funding, my colleagues and I are providing poverty competency training to our public health districts. We've trained 132 staff in two of our local districts and then are coaching them in how they can adapt their outreach and education for people who are living in the crisis of poverty because it has to be. In the crisis of poverty, because it has to be different than some of the strategies they've been using. So, just at a glance with EXCITE, this is what we've been up to. Just with these ECCITE programs, we've hosted nearly 1,200 vaccination clinics. We've administered over 26,000 immunizations, and we've reached in our educational outreach well over 21 million vaccinations. All right, so getting into Alright, so getting into what sort of preventive health behaviors do we need to consider as we're having our discussions this week. So we know that we have individual factors that influence our health behaviors. So personally, things like chronic mental stress, a low sense of self-efficacy, gaps in our knowledge, and low health literacy. But we really can't stop there. So we'll So, Wilderink and their colleagues, in their work on socioeconomic health disparities, report that individuals do not make their health behaviors solely on their individual intentions. And health interventions tend to be unsuccessful because there are certain things that we are not addressing or not taking into consideration. So, things like the living environment, the conditions that people are experiencing, the individual. Are experiencing the individual skill sets that people have, people's wishes and needs are a factor. And then, on top of that, some of these other things we've been discussing, right, socioeconomic and cultural restrictions as well. What have we been finding in ECCITE? Nationwide, summary of everything that our teams have been reporting, there were three general factors that we found to be influencing. To be influencing health behaviors. And I will just say that this is not a formal research grant. The pot of money from CDC is not research money, but they are wanting qualitative data. They're wanting stories. And we've been reporting that back. But in summary, for most projects, we have found that health literacy, political affiliation, and language barriers have been the largest reported. Largest reported factors influencing people's. And this isn't just for COVID-19 vaccine, this is for all adult vaccines, for rural and medically underserved populations. I mentioned my extension colleagues at Washington State University. They did their EXCITE research with extension professionals specifically across the nation. So those extension professionals were reporting on their personal attitudes about vaccines as well as the attitudes in the As peat out issues in the communities that they serve. And so, what emerged from their data was that trust was a major issue, which I've heard a few times today already. So, specifically trust in science and government, and then trust in health professionals and educators. Media literacy was another major factor that they saw, so being able to discern what sources of information they can trust and rely on. And then they also referenced this conversation. And then they also reference this concept of psychological reactives, which I saw on the title somewhere talking about that. All right. So that's this response, kind of this automatic response that we have, pushing back against anything that somebody tells us we have to do. So that's something that they saw in their research with extension professionals. So in Idaho specifically, we want to look at how that kind of matches up with what we were seeing nationwide and then in that other subgroup of extension. And then, in that other subgroup of extension professionals in their communities, all of those represented in the work that we did. But if we take it a little bit deeper into the details that we saw, first, if we look at language barriers as an access issue, we saw even more access issues, specifically the severe limitation of transportation for folks being able to get to a site that would give them vaccine. That would give them vaccines. Vaccine availability. So, does the community have vaccines at all? Right? And then hours of operation for the providers, especially with our dairy workers, right? Work six days a week, really long shifts. What pharmacy is open for them to get their shots? So, those are a few more layers to access that we saw in our work. In regards to trust, I'll take it a little deeper here, too. It's a little deeper here, too. So, what we did as educators in our educational mobile vaccine clinics, for instance, was we were providing time and space for people to discuss their concerns. At the beginning of the pandemic, we had all these mobile vaccine units going out, right? And they were highly effective. But once we got through those folks, we didn't have a lot of people coming out because they didn't have time and space. Out because they didn't have time and space to discuss, right? And the judgment-free communication, having people trained in motivational interviewing and understanding how to talk to people about their concerns that were valid to them. Sources of information, what was trusted, friends and family versus medical authority, social media, community leaders. And then all of that was made even more complex by the timing in the pandemic because it changed with every milestone and every. And every just new wave of all the things. So, what I can just boil this down to, and hope that it can help inform some of our conversations this week, is that I've placed this into like two main categories of importance from what we've seen and how the existing literature and data shows. So, health education and unique barriers. Health education and how it's happening in a community. And how it's happening in a community matters. It matters largely. Who is providing that education? What are the relationships between the people providing it and those receiving it? And that goes back to historically and currently. What's the levels of trust? Does the communication style match the audience? And that comes, that's where our poverty competency stuff comes in. And then, how would we write the consistency, normalization, and integration that's being fostered? I say unique. Fostered. I say unique barriers intentionally because I very much believe that we have to be able to account for the differences that exist within communities in whatever we're doing to model and predict. So geography, socioeconomic position, education levels, and accessibility. Any questions that I can briefly answer? What can we do to help younger people get vaccines even though they come from more difficult or challenging and more Difficult or challenging environment? Is there a way we can approach those children to have them as adults have a better understanding of science and how vaccines work? Right, right. So, I mean, in the United States, we have our child vaccine program, right? So, the accessibility piece is a little bit easier. And we're working on adult vaccines because we don't have those options. But I think it's this feature. I think it's this feedback loop, right? So we're doing education campaigns at schools when our partners go and do vaccine clinics at schools, even though we're not working on childhood vaccines, because that's our entry point. That's our access to parents, right? So if we can educate them on why it's important for their children to get vaccines, then we can educate them on why it's important for them to get vaccines as well. But I think there is this educational component. Like we have to start at all levels. We have to start at all levels and try to catch up to ourselves and create that more well-rounded education. But we have to be looking at the fact that this isn't just anti-vax attitudes. There are these factors that are keeping people from taking preventive health steps that go beyond just education, systemic issues. Okay. Quickly, I'm going to use the same thing. All right, our next speaker
