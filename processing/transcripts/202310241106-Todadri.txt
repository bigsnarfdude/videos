To Mitch and the other organizers, Suna and who were the other door. It's been a wonderful meeting, meeting people within physics and people in the math community and so on. I'm learning a lot. Good to see that this Moire field is thriving and people are getting all kinds of interesting results. Yeah, so my talk fits very nicely with Pat. Fits very nicely with Patrick's talk and with D's talk later today, which will all be on the same topic. So I'm going to talk about this phenomenon of the quantum anomalous fall effect, but with a particular take on it that will, I think, be different from the other talks that we heard today. So, the work that I'm going to talk about was done by Chu Yang Song, who's a world coastdoc at MIT. Burkhostdoc at MIT, and Yohi Jang, who's an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins. So I can go quickly through my first few slides because they're more or less the same as Patrick's first few slides. So for people who've not seen this wonderful trace, whatever else you've learned from this workshop, I strongly urge you for, it's good for your soul to stare at this trace for a long time. It's one of the most beautiful. For a long time. It's one of the most beautiful things in modern science, I think. So, this quorum-hall effect, it happens if you take electrons, it usually happens, if you force electrons to move in two dimensions in a strong magnetic field. Then the electrons form lander levels and they interact with each other through Coulomb interactions. Then you also see a random potential. And with all these things, you see these plateaus in what's called the whole resistivity, like here. Disability, like here, here, here, and so on. So, those are gap quantum hall states. And when all twice, let's say somewhere here or here, the growth state that you get at these plateaus has excitations which have fractions of the electron. So it's absolutely beautiful stuff. Now it's a bit of a refined taste to appreciate what happens here. To appreciate what happens here. So, this is metal, this is the resistivity of the metal, it's metallic. But it turns out, understanding this seemingly boring place is actually the key to understanding this rich structure that one sees in this trace. And it's a metal that's very different from a textbook metal. It's what's known as a corpusite formuliquid. And phenologically, it's characterized by having an RXX, a longitudinal resistance. A longitudinal resistivity that's small but non-zero, but much smaller than the whole resistivity. And there are many other characterizations, it's not a standard metal at all. It's a fascinating metal, known as a composite from a liquid. So fractional quantum Hall effect can occur without any magnetic field, as Patrick explained in his talk. And the general idea that General idea that goes back a long time is to say that if you somehow have a churn band and you fractionally fill it, maybe you'll mimic whatever happens in the fractional quantum hall effect. And this was demonstrated a while back, theoretically, in toy models. So the questions that remained open, the interesting question that remained open from the body of work that started at this time is what are the suitable experimental platforms and why is this at all interesting? This is at all interesting? At least for some people, that could have been a question. And I'll give you my take on at least one of the reasons why I find it interesting in this talk. But let me briefly talk a little bit about the experimental platforms. So everything I have to say on this will be at a much from a much broader and higher level, you know, viewpoint than what Patrick said. Than what Patrick said. But let me give a broad-level understanding of where to find. So there's really been rapid progress in the last few years. From theory, early on it became clear that various moire graphene systems are going to be good to look for this. And I've highlighted some of the younger people who contribute. Who contributed to this in bold. So, Yohil Jong is the same person that I mentioned earlier in the talk. So, Dan Mo is, you know, was a student with us and now she's a postdoc at Cornell. Una mentioned her yesterday as well. She's going to be in the faculty market, as Una said. So, this is a short note. She's wonderful. Cecilia Repelin, she's not, I guess she's still young. She's a junior. She's a junior faculty in Grenoble, and Patrick Ledwitt is the guy who gave the last talk. I guess Islam, you're also young. Sorry. So you should be involved. Now, in Monet TMBs, simultaneous with this, Alan and his collaborators pointed out that Homo TMBs, so TMDs of twisted homo TMDs now may have may be good platforms, and there's other work, including by my colleague Liang Fu. Now experiments. So 2021 there was an experiment by Amelia Kobe on twisted bilayer graphene where they found fractional quantum Hall states at a field that was low but not zero. Low, but not zero. It's low in the sense that the flux to each unit cell is much smaller than the flux quantum, but it's not zero. Now, what the exciting thing that's happened, which Annan mentioned yesterday in the last few months, is our experiments on twisted transition metal dichalcogenides by Shodong Chu and Toi and Ji. And Ji will talk about their work in a few hours. Earlier this summer, and just asked. Earlier this summer, and just as of a couple of weeks back, work by my colleague Gonpentale, Rombo Hedral Drafine, which shows this phenomenon. Okay, so to set the stage, let me review some very simple ideas on how these sorts of MOIA systems realize what's their path to getting into the state. So, first clearly, you need to break down. Uh so first clearly you need to break time reversal symmetry and it's not explicitly broken by the Hamiltonian. That's what's that's one of the features of the state. So we call it a fractional quantum anomalous form of it for that reason. So time reversal is broken spontaneously and the general idea is illustrated by thinking about some graphene system which has both spin and value degrees of freedom and perhaps the k value as turn number c and the k prime value as turn number minus c and the idea is that the bands of flat And the idea is that if the bands are flat enough, then that the Coulomb interaction might at these fillings spontaneously polarize in spin-valley space. For instance, the total filling is one. The spontaneous spin-and-valley polarization will lead to occupation of one spin and one valley chosen from this set of four bands to fully populate. And since each band Populate, and since each valley has a churn number, you get a net non-zero churn number and you get an integer quantum anomalous false state. And then suppose this value polarization persists when you dope away from that integer state, then you're partially filling some churn band and maybe you could get a fractional churn state or fractional polynomial spawth state. So that's the general mechanism through which the system breaks time reversal in a system with In a system that has churn bands but different churn numbers, opposite churn numbers in the two valleys, breaks time reversal to selectively populate one churn band and then you know things if everything else works, you may get all kinds of interesting factual convolutions. Okay, so let me jump right away to the evidence in Twisted MOTE2. MOTE2. First of all, there's evidence of pheromagnism. That's the precondition for all of this. And I think Jay may probably show this a lot more. So maybe I will go through this quickly. So there is pheromagnism and there's a circular dichroism measurement, the same kind of measurement that Phi talked about yesterday. And you see hysteresis here as functional field, indicative of spontaneous symmetry grade. Indicator of spontaneous symmetry breaking. And there are multiple ways to measure the location of the many body gap in the density magnetic field plane. And to use Alan's words, Forum-Hall load tells you that the slope of the location of the gap in this density and magnetic field plane is a measurement of the quantized Hall conductance. And so from this, you find, for instance, sigma xy equals 1, which is an integer state, or sigma xy close to 2 thirds, which is a fractional state. So, okay. But really, you want to see it in transport as well. And that's happened since the published work is in Chou Dong-chu's paper and in this paper, but I know from talking to GE and Phi. From talking to G and Phi, that they also have similar data. So, at say two-thirds spilling, you see, for instance, that the longitudinal resistivity is essentially zero, but the Hall resistivity has hysteresis, and beyond the coercive field, that goes to a value which is 3 over 2 times H over E squared, which is exactly what you expect for fractional thermal policy. So it's been three. Now, Right, now I mentioned this composite formuliquid that exists in the standard lander level at half-filling. So, here, once again, you can go to half-filling and ask what happens. And the longitudinal resistivity, once again, is very small, but the whole resistivity is large. And it's nearly 2h over e squared. And there's some evidence that this actually is zero, that it saturates to a slight non-zero value. So it's a metallic. Non-zero value. So it's a metallic state with a large polysistivity. Probably, and there's some evidence that it actually is a composite from a liquid. Now, so that's an MOT2. I want to briefly advertise a beautiful work by my colleague Long Ju on the faction quantum anomalous fall effect in a different system. So, this is five layers of graphene stacked in a particular way. Way, you know, it's this ABC stacking, and then it's aligned with the boron nitride substrate to give you a Moira potential on one side. So that affects the band structure somewhere. And then there's a perpendicular electric field that's applied with gates at the top and bottom. So then what's seen is an integer, a normal quantum anomalous false state, as well as various fractions. So this is Various fractions. So, this is just a schematic. This doesn't tell, it's a schematic to show that this kind of thing is seen. The actual data itself is here. So, it sees many, many more one-half states. It reports six of so-called Jane fractions. These are various rational fractions on either side of half, where you see, for instance, at 2 thirds, you see the whole resistivity. Do this, at 2/5, 3, 4, 7th. There's various. 4-7, there's various rational fractions at which you see the quorum-hall effect, the fractional quorum-hall effect. So it's all very exciting for many people. And I'll tell you why I am exciting. Okay, so that's the stage on which whatever I'm going to talk about, that sets the stage for whatever I'm going to talk about. So the real question I'm going to ask myself is: what are some new questions and some new opportunities to explore interest? To explore interesting phenomena that are beyond what we can do with the standard for the fall effect. And there are many things one could do, but I'm going to focus on one particular thing that one can do with this realization. The most striking feature of materials is that they are highly tunable. You can change the density, by applying this perpendicular electric field, you can change the bandwidth relative to the Coulomb interaction. Related to the Coulomb interaction and so on and so forth. So, it's a hope of engineering of faces that are close to the Coulomb Hall phase in the phase diagram. Correlated faces that are close to corn Hall. And together, an exploration of the phase transitions or the Corn Hall phase. Now, theoretically, what we can see is that these proximate phases are the face tension. Phases or the phase transitions and all the phase transitions seem likely to be exotic as well with all kinds of interesting things like emergent gauge fields and fractionalized quasi-porticles and so on. So a useful analogy that I use to think about this situation is that in the landscape of phases of matter, we landed on one peak called the Kornhall effect. Till now, we had no way to leave that peak and explore the neighborhood. Because it was hard to tune out of quantum hall physics in any of the previous platforms. But now we can really explore the vicinity of this peak and see if there are other peaks which are at least as high as Quantum Hall, maybe even higher. So that's the dream. So let's see. So let's see. So what I'm going to do is to theoretically explore what's there in the vicinity of the quantum hall peak, right? With this motivation. Now in the experiments, it turns out that the very first experiments that people did in the last few months, they already began an exploration of the phase diagram in the vicinity of the phase. For instance, this at filling two-thirds in the T. In the TMD experiments, you see this plateau at 3 over 2 h over e squared, as you tune this perpendicular displacement field, you get out of the quantum hole phase into something else, which looks more or less like an ordinary insulin. And you can do this throughout the phase diagram: this displacement field, this density, and you tune, for instance, at half, you tune out of the composite from a liquid into something else, and so on and so forth. And so on and so forth. And you know, Long June, Peter Layer Graphene has a similar explanation. Okay, so what are some obvious competitors to fractional quantum Hall physics in these systems? So I'm going to make an assumption which is definitely true in the pentalayer graphene experiments. It may be true and may not be, or may not be true, in the TMD experiments. In the TMD experiments, I think in transport it looks like the assumption that I'm going to make is true, but in the compressibility experiments, it doesn't seem like it's true. So I don't know how it will work out. But it's certainly true in the pentalayographene. And the assumption is that the ferromagnetism survives beyond the quantum Hall phase. Okay? That this valley polarization that gives rise to the ferromagnetism is present even when you leave the quorum Hall phase. Even when you leave the quantum all phase. So then I don't have to worry about the other valley, and I just focus on physics within a single churn bank. Now it commensurate ladder spilling. So for the graphene system, you really just want valley polarization. You don't really know what the spin is still. Yeah, we don't know anything about the spin either experimentally or JP. So we're looking at commensurate lattice spillings and a big competitor to the fractional Big competitor to the fractional quantum Hall state is a charge density wave state which just lobs to the lattice. Now, just think of some classical arrangement of charges from the lattice. That's a state that you can end up in. Now, if you increase the bandwidth and the displacement field can tune the bandwidth, if you increase the bandwidth sufficiently, at some point you're going to land in an ordinary metal. You can forget about the interactions, you just land in the metal. That's a homiliquid metal. That's a Fermi-liquid mechanism. So you can tune from quantum Hall physics into Fermiliquid physics, which is a spectacular possibility that's only there in these Mourier systems. Anyway, so these are two other phases that can exist in the phase diagram. So what's the evolution between these different phases? No. Well, what happens in between? Are there more things going on in, say, the Going on in, say, the CDW insulator than just this classical arrangement of choice. Yeah, so the first thing I'm going to talk about is this provide about the Fermilique and just focus on the competition or intertwinement between quantum hall physics and charge density wave ordering, right? On the lattice at some commensurate filling. You know, there's many ways in which one could discuss this. One could discuss it at the microscopic level by doing serious calculations. That's not what I'm going to do. I'm going to do something serious, but it won't be serious microscopic calculations. Instead, what I want to do is to describe this competition or intertwinement from the point of view of Lando-Ginzburg theory, where I have one kind of order which is. That I have one kind of order, which is a broken symmetry order. I have another kind of order, which is this exotic beast known as topological order in the quantum horizon. How do these two things compete with these? Take a long wavelength, Ginzburg-Landau type point of view. And it turns out that's somewhat subtle. And so I'll call it a quantum Ginzburg-Landau theory. And among other things, it can be used to describe the phase transition to address the issue, the nature of the phase transition. There are many other things that one can address with it. The things that one can address with it, that's the remote state. And one of the things that will emerge from this description is that a very natural approximate charge-density wave-ordered state in the vicinity of many of the quotum-hall states is a charge-density wave state which has what we call a dark topological order, something that's not visible in an electrical transport experiment. So, this is a really unusual face, right? Really unusual phase, right? I think it's a peak that's as high as the Cornwall peak. So if you can find it, that's great. You know, we've gone beyond... You know, Cornwall is the most exotic thing known to humankind. No, no, we're finding other exotic things. In terms of corn phases of matter. So like a unicorn, a whole unicorn is complex. Now they swallow us. Alright, and then at this time, I'll talk about the evolution from this weird composite Fermi liquid to a Lando Fermilique and ask how that phase transition goes and describe the theory and make some experimental predictions. And I should say that this business of exploring the vicinity of Porham Hall, there have been a few papers over the last thirty years 30 years. I've listed several papers that influenced our thinking a lot. But a crucial feature that was not taken into account in any of these papers is that they did not feel the need to incorporate the fractional filling of the lattice into the field in all this previous work. And that is important and plays a crucial role in the physics that we are trying to describe. This graph. Do you mean that they didn't keep track of it or that their problem setup didn't have a fractional filling of the lattice? The problem was set up in such a way there's no fractional filling of the lattice. I thought the Parkeshi-V paper had a lambda level and a periodic... Yeah, the periodic potential was chosen so that the lattice filling of that periodic potential was. They're doing field theory, right? The field theory didn't have any filling constraints. Okay, so the CDW is. Okay, so the C D W is a broken symmetry phase characterized by a Lando order parameter. The fractional quantum Hall effect is a topologically ordered phase. There is no Lando-order parameter, but there's all this cool stuff with fractional charge and fractional statistics. I have to put this down. I don't know how much sense it makes to people who have not seen it. But maybe mathematicians are familiar with John-Simon's theory, maybe. But it describes. But it's described as what is often called a topological quantum field theory. For instance, one description of it is through a theory with emergent gauge fields with this so-called Chern-Simons term. So this B is a dynamical gauge field that's emergent. And then I've included a probe gauge field that can be used to say catholic the whole conductivity, this description. So we want to describe the competition between these two phases. Competition between these two phases, at least at the level of some mean field, right, or Ginzburg-Landau theory. And even if we can't really solve the full fluctuating theory. So let me give you the answer right away, at least for the simple Lauflin states. So the answer, this is the form of the Ginzburg-Landov theory. So if you're at filling 1 over k, then the theory is written in terms of k species of bosons. Species of bosons, phi DI, with some action. It looks like pretty much like a standard Lagrangian for a field theory of these bosons. And they're coupled to a fluctuating Duane gauge field, that's an emergent gauge field. And that gauge field has a Chern-Simons term at level K and it's coupled to this background 4 gauge field. So this is the theory. And the microscopic charge conservation symmetry. Microscopic charge conservation symmetry is incorporated into this theory through this coupling. So, that tells us exactly how the global U1 symmetry of charge conservation acts on the low energy theory. I also had to tell you how the microscopic symmetry of lattice translations acts on the theory. And it acts in a funny way, right? And that's really the crucial ingredient here. So, it turns out that lattice translation acts projectively on these fields by the eye. And the projective action of lattice translation is allowed because these fields are coupled to a human gauge field. So, any phase factors in some symmetry action can be hidden away by the presence of these gauge fields. So, in particular, unit translations, the two independent directions, do not commute with each other, but rather they commutators are pure phase, it's e to the 2π i k. Now in this Lagrangian, if you take R to be positive, then at the classical level, these fields are gapped. So you integrate them out and you're left with this pure John-Simon theory, which describes the whole whole fix. Well, on the other hand, if R is less than zero, then you expect that these fields condense. So then the condensation of these fields gaps out this, you know, there's a Higgs mechanism, Anderson-Higgs mechanism, through which this field B gets gapped out. Through which this field B gets gapped out. And once this field B is gapped out, it's just gone from the picture. And the response to capital A is just the response of the nuns later. But at the same time, the fact that these 5 V's transform projectively under lattice translations means that the lattice translation symmetry is spontaneously broken. So that's how this theory manages to go from the quant phase to a charge density wave phase as a tune some parameter. Face as they tune some parameter. Okay, so what is this good for? It's like any Ginsburg-Lando theory. You know, it's used in some regime to get some understanding of the universal structure of the physics, but it's not a microscopic theory. Ginsburg-Lando was never a microscopic theory. So, one thing it's good for is, of course, to think about the phase transition in some sensible way. Sensible way. You can do a mean field theory on this Lagrangian, and the mean field level you get a second-order transition. Now, really, we don't know what happens once you start including fluctuations, whether the fluctuations will change the mean field behavior to a new universal take class and make it first order. But those are higher level questions. At least we can produce a mean field theory for this phase transition. And we can use that to think about experiments which are currently. Experiments which shall currently happen. Now we can use it to discuss situations that are hard to treat microscopically. Like what if you have, you know, maybe with some gate-defined geometry, you have an interface between the charge density weight and the fractional quantum Hall state. One could imagine people making such geometries. You can study it. One can study defects of either ground state, just like in standard Ginsburg-Lando theory, you can understand vortices, right? Vortices in know vortices, right? Vortices in supernatural predicted on the basis of Ginsburg-Lambrot theory. You can do the same thing here. And then there's something interesting. So the defects of the fractional quantum Hall state are these anion positive particles with fractional charge. And what this theory then tells you is that look around each anion, there's a halo of charge density wave order that accompanies it, right? Which is an interesting It, right? Which is an interesting phenomenon that's not there in the lander-level realization. So, if I have an enion sitting somewhere here, maybe I localize it in some way, it nucleates around it a patch of charged NC wave orbit. I think this can be significant in the future. You know, if people want to break these things around, these are not just probably not going to be nimble particles, you know, they have to carry this halo of charge density. This halo of charge density waveform. It's very much analogous to a phenomena that were discovered in the high-TC superconditors 20 years back, where if you tunnel into the vortex core, you see a halo of size 100 angstroms where you see charge density wave walls. And the energy charge itself is localized at some length scale, which is large but finite if you're close to the transition. Close to the transition. But the halo size is much larger than the size over which the neon is localized. They have parametrically different scalings. So this leads to an interesting proposal. Suppose you have a region of the system that you can image perhaps with STM or some chart sensing technique. And maybe you dope slightly away from the commensurate filling so that you've introduced. From the commensurate filling, so that you've introduced some anions into the system. So then you'll have a bunch of anions. Five minutes, all right. You'll have a bunch of anions. The density of anions is set by the deviation from the commensurate filling. So for instance, if you're at one third or two thirds filling and you deviate slightly away, you you know how much charge you put in and you know the fractional charge of the anions, so you know the density of anions. So, you know the density of anions. Around each anion, there's this halo region with some charge order. And the charge order may be easy to image. Then the statement is that the density of these halos divided by the doping density is a direct measure of the fractional charge of the anion. So, this could be a backdoor route to measuring the fractional charge of the anion without actually measuring it directly. Anyway, so it's Anyway, so statements like this that you can make quite easily from this Ginsburg-Lando theory. Since I only have five minutes left, I'll merely mention, you know, in a minute how we derive this Ginsburg-Randall theory. It turns out it requires all the tricks I've ever used in my life. So I was actually happy. It gives me a chance to play with my toys. All right, so that was. Alright, so we use what's known as a parton framework, where you formally write the electron operator as a product of a boson and a fermion. So there's a redundant description of the electron operator. It's redundant in the sense that you can do a gauge transformation of both phi and f independently, phi and f at each point in space independently, but at the opposite places. But at the opposite faces. And this gates redundancy ensures that φ and F have the same density as the electron. And you can reformulate the system, instead of formulating it in terms of C, you can reformulate the system in terms of phi and F, but at the expense of including a dynamical Johann gauge field that enforces this gauge retingency. So there's a standard toolbox to derive effective field theories for various Theories for various phases and phase transitions. So, schematically, we work with a Lagrangian of this sort and discuss the phase diagram of the electronic system. So, I'll just describe the general idea and not describe how this general idea actually leads to the answer. So, we want to think about some phase speech. About some phase P, in our case of the fractional quantum hall phase, we want to leave it. Now that we found the quantum hall phase, we want to get out of it. That's the goal in this talk. So suppose we are interested in some base phase that I call P. Could be factual porn hole, could be something else. So the idea is to put this part on F itself in the phase that we are interested in. In this case, I'm going to Tested it. In this case, I'm going to force the parton F to be in the fractional quantum Hall phase. And then if phi forms a superfluid, then phi has an expectation value, then C and F, the electron and F, become indistinguishable from each other. More formally, if phi forms a superfluid, then this gauge field is Higgs, which means that little A logs to minus capital A. So then this part of the theory. This part of the theory just becomes, describes the original electronic system in the phase that I'm interested in, phase P. This is a very complicated way of describing any phase of matter, but it's a correct way. And the advantage is that no one can get out of the phase. And the way to get out of the phase is to get move phi onto the superfluid phase. So what we Yeah, so what we want to do is to implement this strategy for the quantum Hall phases. As I emphasized, the partons are at the same lattice filling as the electrons. So I put F in the fractional quantum Hall phase. And if phi is in the superfluid, then I just describe in a complicated way the original fractional quantum Hall phase of electrons. But then if I put phi in a Mohr translator, that destroys the quantum Hall response. That destroys the quantum hole response, and I've managed to get out of the quantum hole phase. But phi is that a fractional lattice filling, so it cannot form a trivial morten slave. So it has to form, it has to do something, and the simplest option is that it forms a charge density. So this entire problem of understanding the competition between fractional quantum hall and C D W gets related to a problem that we've solved in the past. That we've solved in the past, which is the competition between superfluid and CDW order of bosons on a lattice. That problem turns out to be very subtle, but it's been solved by many of us ordered 20 years back. So we just live off that solution and then put in this extra ingredient that, in addition to this phi sector, you also have the F sector. So that's the method. The method. I will skip the details of how we actually do this and say that that's what gives me this final answer. Okay? Now let me say one other thing and then I'll stop. So, what I described, if I do that and say one-third filling, it gives me a theory that captures correctly both the one-third Laufland state or any. Lochnam state or any one-third fraction of one whole state and a CDW, the most ordinary CDW on the planet. But now let me try to do this at say two-thirds filling. There's one thing that I can easily do at two-thirds. You know, two-thirds is the particle-hole conjugate of one-third. So there is two particle-hole transforms. So then I'll get a transition between the two-thirds fractional quantum Hall state and a C D W that now coexists with the A C D W that now coexists with an integer for involved. Because this trivial C D W maps under Percolo conjugation to that. Okay? So I'll go from on this side I have this kind of transition where sigma xy jumps from one-third to zero. On this side, I have a transition where sigma xy jumps from two-thirds to one. Or the rho xy goes from three halves to one. To 1. Now the experiments that I, the preliminary experiments that I showed, ρ x y went to zip, right, not to 1. So can we produce a theory that gets out of the 2 thirds quantum Hall state and goes into a C D W with no electrical quantum Hall effect. So it turns out the methods that I described are powerful enough to enable such a description, but to work in If you work it through, what you find is that the CDW state is very interesting. You know, it certainly has, it's an insulator with rho xy equals 0 and rho xx being infinity. It has longer in C D W order. It also has coexisting topological order in the electrically neutral sector of the theory. There are neutral quasi-particles that have formed some topological order. And this topological order. Topological order. And this topological order is described by this John-Simons theory. It has no electrical Hall conductance, but it has a thermal quantum Hall effect, right, of a half in some units. So this phase is what we call in this context a C D W star. It's rather unusual. This kind of phase has been fantasized for a long time by humankind, but no proposal for any. Proposal for any experimental realization so far. But this may be lurking in the vicinity of the two-thirds state in these Moira systems. And that, to me, is exactly okay. Let me just stop with that. Okay, so we have time for some short questions, maybe, and Raquel let us start to get organized. Okay, anybody? Patrick? Do you have any? Do you have any more intuition about the CDW start face here? I'm wondering if there's any way to start it in somewhere where you think about how to correspond with it. Like, can you think about a CDW or a parameter as some sort of spin-walk hash? Okay, I don't have intuition in that form, but there's more bottom-hole-like intuition. You can think of this as a composite boson crystal. In fact, that's exactly what it is. Now, at one-third filling, the composite boson crystal turns out to be a Crystal turns out to be a boring CDW. Two-thirds or any other filter in all the chain states, this composite boson crystal doesn't have three things apart from the Hawk effect of the parent Hort state. I see. So you fractionalize the electron into like BF and B carries the electric charge? It doesn't matter. But B can be thought of as a big generalization, but it's in the spirit of composite position. But it's in the spirit of composite bosom. Wait, what does the F do? What does the F do? Yeah. So the F forms some topological order.
