Alright, first of all let me begin by thanking Robert and the organisers for the invitation to be in Banff. It's been a while since I've been in Canada. Always good to come and see the Mountains. So as Robert already said, the title of my talk is Steady, Gradient, Kilery to Solitons and everything I'll talk about today is joint work with Alice Durrell from Paris to Sioux. Alright, so let me begin with an introduction explaining what a killer monopole is. So apologies to those in the audience that are already familiar with these concepts. Not already familiar with these concepts? Let's take a quick five minutes for this. So, okay, so let me begin with the definition of a complex manifold. So, nj is a complex manifold where n is the dimension of m over c. If the coordinate charts have values in cn and the transition functions are holomorphic functions, alright? So what this means is that there's a well-defined notion of multiplication by i in the tangent space, and this is what the endomorphism J encodes. And this is what the endomorphism J encodes. So J is an almost complex structure and it satisfies J squared is equal to negative density. So I guess I'm going to give you just two examples of K-ler manifolds. So examples to keep in mind are Jewists, so Cn, so this is trivially a K-ler manifold with one chart, and then we also have Pn, conjecture space, right? Which is another example of a Kerr manifold, or is another example of a convex manifold. Okay? So the next thing I do is I endow a convex manifold G with a Convex manifold G with a Romanian metric. And we say that G is a Killer metric if the following is true. Is Killer if? So the first requirement is that J, which is this convex structure, is an isomogree with respect to G. Alright, so this can always be achieved, right? So this isn't an obstruction in itself because you can just average by the action of J to achieve this. So with respect to G. So, with respect to G. So, J is an isometry. But what you require is the QA condition. So, once you know J is an isometry with respect to G, you can compose G with J in one of the arguments, and this gives you a 2-4. So we define omega to be the composition of J, to be the composition of G with J in one coordinate, and the KO condition is that omega is closed. Omega is closed. It's closed. Alright? So this is the Keeler condition. And we call, oh my god, here the Kler formula. Alright? So this is called the Keeler formula. So Nirmania terms, metric being Keeler is equivalent to the complex structure J being parallel with respect to the Lebesgue-Shabita connection of the complex structure. The complex structure J is parallel with respect to the levy-submitted connection of the Manium metric. Alright, so let me just give you two examples of Kayla manifolds. Okay, so Cn is an example of a Kayla manifold with a flat metric. And Pn, project space, is example of a Kayler manifold with the Vermini-Sturi metric. Okay? So Given a Keeler form, omega. So omega is a Kler form. We can modify a Kler form by adding on By adding on a delta bar of a smooth real value function. So suppose you're given a KL form omega, you take phi, which is a smooth real value function, which is small in C2 norm. So then you can modify omega by adding on i delta bar of phi, or locally i delta bar of phi is equal to sigma i of delta. I of del to phi divided by, so it's just a mix of complex and anti-complex derivatives of phi dz by h dz L boy. So the sum here is over K and L. So given a Killer form, you're given a smooth relative value function with this one and T2 norm. Then you can modify omega by adding on i delta bar of phi, where delta bar of phi is only given by, um so the mixed complex and anti-complex derivatives, okay. The mixed complex and anti-complex derivatives. So, this again is a two-form. So, this defines an equivalence relation of Keeler forms. So, we said that two Kayler forms are equivalent if they differ by delta bar for function. And we call these equivalence classes Keeler classes. So, this will be in the same Keeler class. In the same Keeler class. Keeler class. So, then the last point I would like to highlight is why do we really care about Kaler monifers? So, the point is. Keeler manifolds. So the point is, given a Keeler manifold, so this really distinguishes Keeler geometry from Manning geometry, there's a very nice expression for the Ricci curvature. So as it turns out, so why do we care about Kiloranifolds? So as it turns out, the Ricci curvature of a Kelomatric is also J invariant. So this implies that we can also compose the Ricci curvature with a complex structure in the first argument to form a two-form. Two form, right? So this gives us a two-form. And as it turns out, so I call this rule of omega. And it turns out that this is also, so this is a two-form, it's a two-form and it's also closed. And it's also closed. Okay? So this is, I call it a Ricci form. So this is a Ricci form of a kilometer. Okay. And then the way to prove this is you just compute the, you just compute in local coordinates what the Ricci form looks like. Local coordinates, what the Ricci form looks like, and you will see locally that the Ricci form looks like rho is equal to negative i delta bar log of the determinant of Gij bar, where Gij bar is the Romani metric expressed in mobile Hollow coordinates, essentially. Alright, so we've got two real, we've got two closed two forms on a Kayler manifold. We've got the Ricci form and we've got the Kayler form. So if the Ricci form in particular, if the Ricci form form in particular, if the Ricci form is equal to zero, in which case your manifold is Ricci flaccular, then we say that your manifold is omega-Calabial, is collabial. And if rho is a positive multiple of the RT form, where k is positive, then we say that omega is Killer-Einstein function. So, again, So, examples of these. So, Cn with a flat metric is an example of a Caviar metric, and Pn with the Fibonacci-Studio metric is an example of a Killer Einstein phenomenon of basically the background book. So, now let me introduce the objects that we want to talk about today. Okay, so now we know what killer means. Oh, okay, great. So, now I want to explain what a steady gradient reticolitone is. So, in order to find a steady gradient killer reaching solitone, you need two pieces of data. Two pieces of data. You need a gear manifold, and you need a holomorphic vector field. So, and these two objects have to be compatible in a certain way. So, a steady, whoops, the DCs. Okay, so a steady Kilorici soliton. Kilorici soliton. So, I don't intend to write this out, so I'll just abbreviate as static soliton. So, this is a triple, it's a triple. is a triple. So m omega x. Alright. So m omega is a Kerr manifold. Well actually m is a complex manifold. M is a convex manifold. Let me just clean this up a little bit. So m is a convex manifold, omega is a kilometric, is a kilometric, and finally So then X is a real holomorphic vector field. So let me explain what that means. So X is a real holomorphic vector field. So what this essentially means, well what this actually means, is that the flow of X preserves J. So the lead derivative of J with respect to X is 0. So the flow of X is by holomorphisms. So X is a real holomorphism. So x is a real holomorphic vector field, vector field, by which I mean the lead derivative of the compact structure, which is how you multiply by eigenity on the space, is zero. So these objects have to be compatible in the following sense. So they'll have to satisfy the following. So we need, so the Ricci form of omega is equal to half the lead derivative with respect to x of omega. So this is the Ricci solid tone piece. So, this is the Ricci solitone equation. So, that's what a steady Kilo-Richti solitone is. So, if it turns out that the vector thing x is a gradient of a smooth real-value function, then we say in addition that the solitone is gradient. So, if we can write x as a gradient with respect to g of f, where f from m to r is a smooth real body function, then we'd say that the soliton is gradient. Is gradient. Okay? Right? Okay, so now we know what the words of my type mean. So static gradient Kilo Ritzi soliton. Okay? So just an example of, a tricky example to keep in mind is that Lavian metric. So if you take x to be equal to 0, then the left-hand side of this equation reduces to 0. And so I'll just give you a quick example. So example. example f is equal to zero so fx is equal to zero so then from the Ricci-Soliton equation from the steady Ricci-Soliton equation rho of omega Ricci form is equal to zero which implies so which essentially means that m omega is collaborative okay so we call such examples trivial examples today we're interested in non-trivial examples right so um so these are called trivial examples I like to call these trivial examples Examples. Alright, and today we're interested in non-trivial examples. Okay? So that's what a kiloranophil is, that's what a steady gradient killer desolaton is. So the next question is: why do we care? Alright? So why do we want to wake up in the morning and think about steady gradient killer to solitons? Alright? So whenever you're considering reaching solitons, in general there's two points of view one can take. So one can take a static point of view and a dynamic point of view. So from the static point of view, From the static point of view, at least for steady gradient killer Hisolitons, steady AC solitons can be considered a generalization of clavia metrics. So it's a generalization of clavia manifolds. Of Clabier manifolds. Alright? Oops, it easies. Clabier manifolds? Okay. So the Clabier equation is... So the Clavier equation is basically rule of omega is equal to 0. So instead of having the right hand side equal to 0, you want to have it equal to into a, you want to have it equal to a 2 form, which is just half, replace 0 with a half delete derivative of x of omega, alright? By introducing extra data, which is just so you have this extra flexibility by introducing the holomorphic vector field x. So from the dynamic point of view, point of view, given a steady gradient, sorry, given a steady Kieruttis allaton, want to generate a self-similar solution of the Kiel-Rutti flow. Alright, so let me explain this. So you can generate a self similar solution, similar solution of the KLUT flow. So let me just remind, okay, so like, hold it. So let me just remind, okay, so like how to do this. So by a self-sembler solution of the Kileric flow, I just mean a solution that evolves via pullback via holomorphisms, at least in the steady case. So let me explain how this is done. So suppose you're given the information of a steady Keeler soliton. So you're given a Keeler form and you're given a holomorphic vector field X. Then what one does is one considers the flow of the vector field. flow of the vector field, so you take the one parameter family of bihomorphisms generated by negative x over 2, phi t of x. So, and we, for phi of 0, is equal to the identity. So we assume that our solitone is complete. That implies that x is complete. I can't remember who proved that. So this exists for all time. And so from this flow of this holiday, And so, from this flow of this holomorphic, this time-dependent one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms, bi-holomorphisms, you can generate a one-parameter family of killer forms, right? Just by pulling back omega, which is your steady K-O-C-soliton, by the flow of negative x over 2. And again, this is defined for t in R. Alright? And then you can check just by taking a derivative, but But the rate of change of this one parameter family of the rate of change of this one parameter family of Kilo forms satisfies the kilo which you feel, okay. Right, so we alt omega t is going to be phi of t star of, I equal to take the derivative of omega, right, which then is equal to pull out the negative, right? Pull out the negative times rho of omega, right? By virtue of the fact that omega satisfies the steady solitone equation, right? You just plug it in, right? And then, but this is just equal to negative rho of phi t star of omega, which is equal to negative rho of omega t. And then since phi at 0 is equal to 0, the initial condition is that, so the initial metric is just the steady solitone you started with. Steady soliton, you started with. Alright, so from the data of a steady K-Rucci soliton, you can generate a solution of the K-Lucci flow that's defined for all time. Moreover, so yeah, so it's defined for all time, okay, that's all I wanted to say there. So then why do we care about this? So, such solutions may model singularity formation in the Kielerucci flow, right? Which is kind of the underlying reason why we look at these guys, okay? So these are candidates for So these are candidates for modeling the formation of singularities in the Keyler Ricci flow. So these may model singularities in the KLRicci flow and the KLRic flow. Alright? Okay, so today's talk will be about constructing examples of steady gradient K-Lergy solitons. So before I get on to that, let me first of all So before I get onto that, so let me first of all mention some conditions, because we're interested in their existence, let me give some necessary conditions for the existence of a steady gradient killer to soliton on a manifold M. All right, so we'll do that next. So just get rid of this. Okay. So conditions. So conditions for the existence for the existence. Of existence of the static gradient kilo is a soliton on M. Okay? So first of all, let's look at the solitone equation. So the solitone equation says that rho of omega is equal to half the lead derivative of x with respect to omega. So if we look at this equation in cohomology, then what happens is What happens is, so if we look at this equation in Durand cohomology, then the right-hand side is equal to zero, right? And we see that necessarily the Ricci form, the cohomology tasks of the Ricci form, say no, we know the Ricci form is closed, so actually the Ricci form has to be globally exact. So in order to force this to be true, it's efficient, so we can force this to be true by requiring the following. By requiring the following. So suffice it to have, so there's a certain line bundle over our complex manifold called the canonical bundle, and we require that to be trivial. So the canonical bundle, so local sections of the canonical bundle just look like f dz1 wedge wedge dzn. Or f is holomorphic. So they're local sections of the canonical bundle, and it's sufficient to have tribute canonical bundle in order. Turbolychronic bundle in order to force the Ricci form to be globally exact. Okay, so why is this true? So we know that the Ricci form is always locally exact on the Turin manifold, but the fact that we have this line 1 doll globally trivial forces it to be globally exact for the following reason. So suppose that it is globally exact, then we can write the Ricci form as negative i delta bar log log of omega to the n divided by omega h omega bar or omega bar or omega is a global turbulent section of this um of this uh of of of this of the canonical humble alright so over here is an overvanishing trivializing section of the canonical hundred alright so um so so as i said before um So, as I said before, steady gradient killer results under the generalization of a clavier metric. So, in the compact case, this condition is just equivalent. So, if you're looking at clavier metrics and compact killer manifolds, a necessary condition is that the first term task vanishes, which is a topological condition, which is more or less equivalent to the canonical model being towards an effect, right? But we just assume it's trivial. So, this is just a generalization, or so this is just an analog. So, this is just an analog of the fact that for clavier manifolds, on a compact Kilner manifold, a necessary condition to have a Clavier metric is that the first turn class vanishes. So, this is just an analog for solitons. And on a compact Kilar manifold, this in fact implies that the first turn class vanishes if you contribute the clonical bundle. And then the fact that this omega is globally defined allows you to express the Ricci form as locally tilde partial function. So, this is a topological obstruction to the existence of static greening Killer Reform. Existence of static green Keter Ritchie solitons on a Keter monophold. Okay, so the next thing I want to mention is a result by IV. So suppose that IV, need a bit more chalkier. So suppose that M is compact. Suppose that you have a steady Ricci soliton, but a steady Kela-Ricci soliton on a compact Kelmanifold. On a compact yellow manifold. So, then, in fact, this implies that you have to be Ricci flat. Which implies that the manifold is trivial, which implies that you're actually collabial. So, if you're looking for non-trivial examples to study Green-Kilo-Ricci solophons, you need a non-compact manifold. So, the two requirements we need so far is you need a trivial clinical bundle, and you need a non-compact manifold for non-trivial examples. Alright? Then the third thing is. Then the third thing is we need holomorphic vector fields, right? So we need the existence of a real holomorphic vector field. We need this x to exist. Okay, and that's a non-trivial condition also. So these, so we're looking for, so m must admit holomorphic vector fields. Alright? Holomorphic vector fields. Alright? Holomorphic vector fields. Alright, so in summary, we're looking for Alright, so in summary we're looking for so we want to construct examples of non-compact Halo monofolds with true kinematic bundle which are non-compact, well non-compact, and which emit holomorphic vector fields. Alright, okay, so we'll go back to that a little bit later. Okay, great. Okay, so this is, so these are necessary conditions for the example of a static grain and Killerici soliton. So next day I'm going to give some examples of static graining Killeric solitons. Alright, so examples. Examples. Alright, so the first example I want to mention is by Hamilton in the 80s. In the 80s. So he even started, so this is the cigar soliton, which I'm sure we're all familiar with, which is the cigar soliton on C. Alright? So this example is osmotically cylindrical. It's isympotically cylindrical at infinity. About the filmy? And the radio vector field is just the radio vector field on CN, right? Or sorry, just the radio vector field on... It's just the Euler vector field on C. So it's the radio vector field. And these examples actually have symmetry. They're actually U1 invariant. And this is how these examples were constructed. So these have a high degree of symmetry. So they're U1 invariant. So the U1 invariant. So what you do is you take the steady soliton equation, right? You work on the U1 symmetry. So then the Soliton equation reduces from a PD to an OD, and then you can solve that explicitly. Okay, great. Okay, so that's Hamilton's example. So these examples were then generalized by Tsao on CN, using the same type of idea. Of idea. So Zao and 96, right? What just happened? I'm sorry. Oh. Here this is just better for the camera. Oh, yeah, okay, great. Yeah, the more light, the better, great. Great. So what happened here? So Zhao constructed a one-parameter family of solitons. So A, parara, and Cn, right? So this one-parameter family depended on a parameter A, right? So whenever A is equal to zero, then the soliton, you've got a complete. Then the soliton, you've got a complete example on Cn, right? So these solitons on Cn were invariant under the action of Zn on Cn, alright? So it reduces to a soliton on Cn mod Zn, right? And then that closes up to define a soliton whenever A is strictly greater than 0. This closes up to define a soliton on O of negative n, right? They canonic a bundle of P and negative 1. Whenever A is strictly greater than 0. Strictly greater than zero. So the way to think about this A is just the volume of the exceptional set, the volume of the P of the zero section. So the way it's out, we started with these examples, was again, you assume that we worked on the symmetry of the UN action on Cn, and again the soliton equation reduced from PDE to an ODE, and then you can solve that explicitly, and then look at the conditions to make it complete, the close-up over the origin. Alright? So again, and again, the vector field x. So again, and again, the vector field x is just equal to 2 times the radial vector field on Cn. So it's worth mentioning the asymptotics of those examples. So these exhibit some cigar paraboloid asymptotics. So maybe I'll mention more about this later. But the key points to take away are that the curvature decays linearly. Alright, so the curvature is equal to O of T to the negative 1, where T is equal to log mod z squared, more or less. Alright, so T is just the distance in the solitone. And the volume growth is half dimensional. So the volume growth of a ball of radius r at any point is equal to O of R to the half times the dimension, half the real dimension of M. The real dimension of M. Alright? So they exhibit half-dimensional volume growth, half the real dimension of volume growth, and the curvature decays linearly. So again, so I'll maybe describe these meters of time. Yeah? Are they collapsed? Yeah. Yeah, they are. Yeah, they're kind of collapsed, yeah. Okay, okay. Yeah. The decay is like on a Brian soliton, but these They look like the yeah, so the yeah, they're cigar paraboloids, yeah. Okay, okay. So if one direction were I mean you can look at the metric explicitly really, so I might as well just mention this now. So if you take t to be equal to law of mod z, then they're asymptotic to n times so quarterly t squared. squared plus eta squared plus t times, right, I need to describe this, right? So GST is a metric that C star, that's invariant under, that's invariant under the standard C star action. It's invariant under the standard C star action on CN. And the E die, this is a one form on the sphere. On the sphere, on S2A negative 1. Okay. So basically, what you have is, so you look at the C star orbits, so you look like a cylinder in the C star orbits, right? Coming from this point, right? Just dt squared plus eta squared. So eta is a one form on S2A minus 1. And it's invariant under the S1 action there. So the S1s, so essentially, if you look at the S1, so you've got to see. The if you look at the S1, so you've got the C star action, so you look at the C star orbit, so if you're restricted as one C star orbit, then you look at the S1, so the volume of that S1 stays the same as you go to infinity, and then the growth is in the transverse direction. Oh, I see, okay. Yeah, so I mean this exists, and if you look at the, so one dimensionless doesn't exist, and you just get cylinder. Okay, I see. Is that I see it, thanks, yeah. Yeah, okay, that makes sense, thanks. Okay, yeah, no problem. Okay, great. Okay, great. Okay, great. So then more examples were made by Dancer Wang and also Vo Yang. So this was between 2008 and 2011. And examples were also constructed by Claire Schaffer in 2020. So these are examples. So these examples were constructed on the total space of the canonical bundle over a final manifold. So these were constructed on the total space of the canonical bundle, the total space of the canonical bundle over a final manifold with some curvature conditions in the final manifold. So notice that these spaces have trivial canonical bundle. And they're non-compact, which satisfies two necessary conditions that I mentioned earlier on. So again, these examples were constructed using ODEs, right? You would assume. ODEs, right? You would assume symmetry, it would reduce the PDE to an ODE and then you would solve that explicitly. So then the first examples can start with using PDE methods by Heather Macbeth and Olivia B. Carr. So Macbeth and Olivia B. Carr. B. Carr in 2017 constructed examples using a doing construction. Okay. So using a doing construction. So, using the doing construction, they constructed examples, okay, essentially in small cater glasses, which we'll get on to a bit later. But the key point is they were the first to use PD methods. And then, so then this year, Schaffer constructed examples, 2021. So he constructed asymptotically cylindrical examples, again using PD methods, essentially using the methods that I use with Alex later for the I'll use with Alex later for the results I'll mention. Okay. So, um, okay, great. So, so there's some examples in mind. Okay, great. So, uh, okay, so now let me get on to the result. Okay. So, in order to make a statement of the result, I need to give you a brief introduction on clavier cones. Alright. So, let me first of all start off with the definition of a Romanian cone. So, Romanian cone, so this is a definition in Riemannian geometry, and it's a particular type of warped product. Alright? So, okay, so suppose that L G of L. So suppose that Lg of L is a closed Riemannian manifold, which is a compact Riemannian manifold without boundary. So then the cone over L, which I'll define in a second, so the cone over L comprises of two pieces, is again a Romanian manifold. Alright, where? So the cone, let me just go to this. Okay, so topologically. Go to this. Okay, so topologically, C L is just equal to R plus R strictly bigger than 0 cross L. On the metric T0 is equal to the R squared plus R squared G of L. Where R, R for, so this R is just the coordinate in the radial direction. Alright? So R we call the radial function. R is the radial function. function okay so excellent and L we call the length of the cone right the length of the cone all right length of the cone which we identify with the level set r is equal to 1 alright so I mean this just fits in with your intuition whenever r is equal to z okay so the volume of the slices of the grow the volume of the slices of the of the cone grow at a Euclidean rate right and then you have a singularity and r is And then you have a singularity, and r is equal to zero, unless, of course, you're flat space. So this is like a cone. It's just your intuition. So that's what a cone is. So now let me tell you what I mean by a clavi alcone. So a clavi out cone is just a reachy flat Killer cone. So we all know what a Keeler manifold is now. So let me tell you what a Klavi outcome is. So this is what I mean by a Clavi outcome. By a collab the outcome. Alright, so it's essentially a Reachy-flat Killer cone. So what does that mean? So it means, so you've got cone, you've got, so G0, so anything with subscript 0 I just refer to as a cone, because it just helps with the... No, okay, so it's a cone, right? So you've got, okay, so the cone recognition is Kater, right? So G0 is Keter with respect to With Keter with respect to a background complex structure J0 on the code. So with respect to some complex structure on the code. Alright. So it's a Kayler code, right? It's Ricci flat. So the Ricci curvature of G0 is equal to 0. Alright. Okay. So what we also require is the existence, is that the canonical bundle is trivial. The canonical bundle of the cone is trivial. Is trivial, all right? And we encode this by requiring the existence of a global trivializing section of this line bundle, the canonical bundle. So again, omega is like a complex, it's a holomorphic volume form. So omega is an or vanishing section of the canonical bundle, right? So let me just remind you. So locally, omega looks like, I mean, it's a complex manifold, you've got logo. I mean, it's a complex manifold, you've got local Holomorph coordinates, Z1 to Zn. It looks locally like F, N, where F is numer vanishing and Holomorph vector. So that's what it looks like locally, and then it globalizes. So even if it looks like a global volume form something, okay? So this encodes the data of the complex structure, and we require, so then we need a relationship between the co-metric and Dolomo-Doni form, and the requirement is that That so the holomorphic bony form is parallel with respect to the Levi-Shivida connection of the Clavier Cummins. So that's essentially what I mean by collabier cum. So you've got the level set. Ronan, I have a question. Yeah, yeah. If I may. So you assume perhaps that the complex structure is also conical with respect to DDR. Yeah. Oh, I didn't mention that. I think never mind, so that's uh I think never mind, so that's uh you you really want that this is a comment coming from a Sasaki Einstein? Yeah, yeah. I'm just um I'm just pressing that under the carpet, yeah. Yeah, so essentially the link is Sasaki Einstein. Yeah. For instance, you have a hyperten structure, only one structure of those will satisfy your your condition. Yes, yeah. Um Yeah, you're right. Well, I mean so I mean that the the the um so if you look if r is the radial coordinate then the Kiera cohetric is given by I over 2 delta bar of R squared or it's just a cone versus A Einstein. Is that okay? Yeah, that's right. Okay. Okay. So um Okay. So the length L of the column again is just identified at the level set R is equal to 1 and then R is equal to 0 is the singular part or is the singularity. Okay. So given the killer code and you get for free, we've got this vector field, R parcel R, which is a radial vector field. Alright. So it's a radial vector field, which is Okay, so you have this radio. Let me get some colours here, brighten up everyone's name, don't we? So we've got RDR. So you have this radio vector field, R parcel, and it's perpendicular to the slices of the cone. So here's the slice of the cone. It's perpendicular to the slices of the cone. It's perpendicular to the slices, the level sets. The slices of the cone are equal to a constant. So then what you can do is you can rotate the spectrum field using Do is you can rotate this vector field using the complex structure. So you can take J0 of R del R and that gives you a vector field tangent to the slices of the comb. So psi, which is J0, R d R is tangent to the slices of the comb is tangent to the slices of the comb. And as it turns out, it's And as it turns out, it's holomorphic. It's got special properties, so it's holomorphic. So the flow of this vector field preserves a complex structure, and it's also a Killian vector field. So the flow of this vector field also preserves the Riemannian geometry of the coe. So because of the expression properties, we give it a special name. We call it the Reed vector field. So we call it the Reed vector field of the coe. So, the point of the read vector field is: so, the flow of the read vector field is killing. So, the flow defines one parameter family of isomeries of the length of the cone. So, the length of the cone is a compact Romani manifold, so the isometry group is compact. So, the closure of the flow of the Reagan vector field and the isomaty group of the link of the cone, which is compact, right? So, it's an abelian, it's a compact abelian subgroup of a Lie group, and so it generates a torus. A torus. So you look at the closure of the flow of the reed vector field in the isomer group of the link with the cone, and that generates a torus. So the flow of the reed vector field generates the action, generates the holomorphic isomorphic, generates the holomorphic isometric action of a real torus on the comb. Which then you can complexify to get the action of a complex torus on the comb. Okay? So what you need to take away from this is that So what you need to take away from this is that given a clavial cone, you get the induced action of a holomorphic torus on the comb. Alright? So let me give you some examples of clavio cones to keep in mind. So some simple examples. So example one, so you can just take Cn and you take the quotient of Cn by gamma, where gamma Where gamma is the finite subgroup of SUN. And gamma acts freely on the complement of the origin of the origin on CN. So then the quotient is a clavier cone. In fact, it's a flat column. So it's a flat cone. So the fact that the action is an SUN means it preserves the flat metric and also the holomorphic boniform descends. The hot water body form descends to the quotient. Alright, so another example that I want to mention, how much time? 50 minutes? So another example, okay, so if M, I'll mention this example briefly, okay, so if M is a Keeler-Einstein fund manifold, right? For example, Pn, which I mentioned earlier on, okay? So then you can look at the total space of the canonical bundle of M. Alright? So the Killer-Einstein. So the Kayler-Einstein fa the Kayler-Einstein metric on M induces a norm on the canonical bundle. And from that norm, you can generate, from the norm, you can generate a Clavier co-metric on the blue round of the zero section of the canonical bundle. So let me just say that in 10 seconds. So you take the canonical bundle. You take the canonical bundle of a Killer Einstein-Fanner manifold, and you can contract the same. Feynman manifold, and you can contract the zero section to a point to get a cone. So you start off with the cargo bundle, then you can contract the zero section to a point. And then you get a real body function R on the blow down in the zero section, which is just equal to this remission metric, which is induced by the Kilarin-Saint-Faylor manifold to the power of 2, sorry, 1 over n plus 1, where n is a complex dimension of the Kilarin sign. It's a complex dimension of the Killer and Sinclair monifer. So then this is a really a function of our Claviocol metric on the call. So this is called the Claviantat. I modulate the details. It's essentially a way to generate examples of Claviel cones from Keeler Einstein. Given the data of a Keyner Einstein theater manifold, you can generate a Claviel cone by looking at the total space of the Kernic module, compared to zero section of a point. Correct the zero section of a point, and then you get this function induced by the Hermitian, you get a function induced in the total space by the Hermitian metric on by the by the by the Kiernanstein Feno metric, by the Kieranstein metric, and then this is really a function of a Claviel co-metric on the goal. So let me just make several points here. So the fact you're working on the canonical bundle here means that you've got a global holomorphic volume form, alright. And also, so the C star action, the action generated by the flow of the revector field, Generated by the flow of the Rig vector field. In this case, it's just, I mean, it's just a standard action on Cm that rotates the fibers of the Hoff vibration reduced to the quotient. And in this case, it's just the action on the C star fibers of this line model. It's just the action that rotates the fibers. And then again, if you do this anzats with Pn, then you'll generate flat cones. So that's exactly some examples to keep in mind. Okay, great. So let me. Okay, great, so let me state the theorem then. R-Spain the theorem. Okay, great. So, our theorem exact, but it gives examples of steady gradient Kaler-Beachy solitons starting with the data of a clavier alcohol. Okay, so let me just draw a picture to explain the setup. So, whoops, easies. Let's get rid of this. Alright, so we start off with the data of a class. Of a collaby outcome. So we've got a collaby outcome here. So C0, complex structure J0. So it's a collaby outcome. Alright. And we let R is the radial function of the cone. So R is the radial function. So here's R is the radial function of the comb. So again, then you're singular at the origin. So given the data of a clavial cone, what we want to do is we want What we want to do is we want to construct a steady grain of kilometers. So remember, we need three things for that. So we need, so what we want is a smooth, non-compact manifold with trivial canonical bundle. So one way to do that is to designularize the cone in a certain way. So the cone has got trivial canonical bundle, right? It's a Cabiol cone. So it's got a trivial canonical bundle by assumption. So one way to generate examples of non-compact K-R-MA. Compact K-R manifolds with trigonometrical bundles from the cone is to be singular isocone. So, what that means is, I have a singular R at the origin, so I can stick in some complex sub-manifolds here and repair it. So then it becomes smooth. So, this is called a resolution of the of the cone, right? You just I mean you can just stick in some complex submanifolds to repair the singularity, right? I mean I'll I mean and this will give you something called a resolution of the cone, okay. Something called a resolution of the cone. So this red set here, E, is called the exceptional set of the resolution. So this then will be smooth. So I'm assuming such an object exists. It's not always true that such an object does exist, right? So I assume such an object exists. So if you remove this, so on the continent of the guys you took in, you're just biholomorphic to the column. So that gives me a non-compact manifold, right? But I also want trivial canonical bundle, right? So that's another requirement, right? So let me call A and my resolution. So let me call M my resolution, and I want M to have trivial cornic horizontal, which is another condition. So this descends to requiring you have a special resolution called a prepmet resolution. So these are all hypotheses. You're given a cone that emits such a resolution, which means you can repair it, so it's got triplet chronicle bundle. The initial guy triplet chronicle bundle, you want to repair it, so you don't want any twist of the chronicle bundle of this exceptional set. Exceptional set. Alright? So, okay, great. So, then the next thing you want, right, we've got a non-compact manifold with global with trivial clonal model. So, the next thing we want is we want a holomorphic vector field. So, remember that we're given a holomorphic vector field on the cone, right? Which is just RDR. Remember that? It's just the holomorphic vector field on the cone. And this is generated by the action of a complex torus on the cone. Alright? So, this homomorphic. Alright? So, this holomorphic vector field is generated by the action of this complex tortoise. So, then an extra requirement is that we want this action to extend to the resolution. And then, so this holomorphic vector lifts to the complement of the exceptional set, right? Because it's a bi-holomorphic, right? But you want it to extend over the exceptional set. And we enforce that by requiring the C-star action on the cone to lift to a C-star action on the prevent resolution. Krabbin resolution. Alright. Sorry, this should say a crap and resolution. Oops. How do you know that there is a C-stem action and not a centaurus action? C-star to the K. Sorry, C star to the K. I meant C star to the K. Sorry. I wrote it but didn't say it. It's okay. So we require this. So this is an extra condition on my resolution, right? And we call this an equivariant Crebit resolution. Alright? Equivariant Cremit resolution. Crepent resolution. So there's three conditions on the resolution. So by Heron ACA, an equivariant resolution always exists of the cone, but it may not necessarily be a triple canonical bundle. So it may not necessarily be a Krepman resolution. Whereas you may have a Krepman resolution and it's not equivariant. So we assume that we're given this data. So then, so this holomorphic torse action generates R here, so that allows us to lift the vector field to. Field to a holomorphic vector field of stars. Alright, so we have, so that's great. So we have a, so now we've got a non-compact complex, we've got a non-compact complex manifold with truly canonical bundle with a holomorphic vector field, which is just a lift of holomorphic vector fields from the cone, right? So we've satisfied all the necessary conditions. And then the question is, does this guy emit static gradient Kelvinity solitons? So the answer is yes. So this is kind of our result. Yes, so this is kind of our result. So let me just say something here. So from the cone, we've got this, the radial function r. So we'll define a new coordinate t to be equal to log of r. Alright, is that okay? And then we've got a model Killer form, omega hat. So omega hat will be the model of our, omega hat will be the model of, will be the asymptotic model of the studies that we construct. So this, I mean, Alright? So this, I mean I'm taking shortcuts here, but uh it's given by I over 2 delta bar of eta t squared over 2. Alright? So in terms of t, this is omega hat, which is the model. And this is precisely what I wrote down earlier. So the model I wrote down earlier when Richard asked me the question, it's the cigar parboloid. I mean this is basically the model for the cigar parboloid asymptotics, alright? So then the theorem is as follows. Alright. So the theorem. Alright, so the theorem, myself and Alex is the following. Alright, so let me just get some nice chart to write it down. It's the following. So basically, in each Killer class of this resolution, there exists a steady grading Killer E2 soliton with this isompolytic model. So that's the existence result. So in every Killer class, in every Killer class, Of M, sorry, an arbitrary class K of M, there exists a complete steady gradient killer eacholaton board. There exists a steady gradient killer each other. Omega, in this killer class, In this Killer class, with the solitone backward field X and J of X is Killing with respect to omega, right, which is just follows from the gradient condition. So it's that the following is satisfied. So it's that for all epsilon greater than zero, the following asymptotic conditions are satisfied. So we look at omega, right? So let me call my resolution here pi. Call my resolution here pi. I've still got a couple of minutes here. So pi is this resolution map. So we can purse omega down to the cone and compare it with omega hat. We can look at this difference and see what it looks like. And it looks like the following. So we look at this difference and we looked at the lead derivative with respect to R D R. So we can look at the derivatives along the Along the pivots along the radial vector field. And we can also look at the gradient with respect to the Lemmy-Shavida connection. So here I'm encoding the difference of the gradient with respect to the lead derivative of RDR, which is the radio vector field in the cone, and then the covariant derivatives with respect to I. And you're measuring all this with respect to the metric omega hat. And this is equal to O of T to the negative epsilon negative I. Negative epsilon, negative i over 2, negative j for all, ij greater than or equal to 0. So with each covariant derivative, you jump by i over 2, and with each lead derivative, you go down by 1. So it's essentially saying that omega is asymptotic to omega hat. So that's the existence result. And then the uniqueness result basically says, well, it says, it doesn't matter, it does say, so in every Killer class, in every K-Class class, So in every Keeler class, in every Keeler class, there's a unique complete static unit calculated with the soliton up to the flow of X, right? Up to the flow of X, right? With the uniqueness is based on these asymptotics, right? So let me just say that verbally. So you're given a killer class. Suppose you have two static gradient killer reduced electrons in that killer class. Solitones in that Killer class, which are Rasim product omega hat with respect to the fixed bioomorphism pi. Then, those two get, then to get from one of those guys to the other, you just pull back by the flow of X for some time. So then that's the uniqueness result. So given a steady, I've still got three minutes, I guess. So given a steady KLC soliton, you can generate more steady solitons by flowing along X. And then what our uniqueness result says is that what are you That, what our uniqueness result says is that that's the only way to generate new examples with the fixed asymptotics, right? So the asymptotics fixed here are unique up to the flow of x. So let me just give some quick examples here. So I mentioned an example of Claviogohm, so Cm mod gamma, right? So let's just consider the two-dimensional case, C2 mod gamma, where gamma is a finite subgroup of SU2 acting freely on C2 without zero. Alright, then. out zero. Alright then so then there always exists a crapman resolution in this case. Alright so there's your cone. Then there always exists a crapmint resolution which is an agravariant crapmint resolution. We also require the resolution to be Kayler I guess I forgot to mention that. So there always exists an ervarian crapman resolution and so we can generate examples there. And also in the Keeler Einstein Final case so Um so uh what can we do there? So in the Kayla-Einstein-Pheno case, I'll just I'll just squeeze it up here. So um okay so if you take Fm as a Keyler Einstein-Fano manifold, you can construct this collabial cone by contracting the zero section. So but you can view the total space of the line bundle as a resolution of the comb. Alright. Right. I mean you construct the cone by collapsing the zero section of the line bundle, then you could just blow it up, right, and that's a smooth manifold. Right, and that's a smooth manifold, which is biolomorphic to the cone away from the zero section, right? And so they'll be biolomorphic, and so we can also apply our theorem with this example, right? So you can construct examples in each scalar class of the total space. Alright, so long if I asked, Robert? That's good. That's good, is it? Tommy, that's it. Alright, let me just, I'll take 30 seconds. So that's the statement of the theorem. So then the method of proof of the theorem is essentially using the continuity method to solve a complex monitoring power equation, right? So it is, so given a club cone, you can construct a Given a club, you can construct a steady solid cone at infinity by implementing this using ODE methods, essentially what Zao did on CN. So it gets you your model at infinity, and then using that you can set up a complex motion pair equation, just the standard stuff, and then you want to solve it. So the difficulty is finding the C0 estimate, and then we find that by using i and j functionals of I mean that was a complicated part, um, but that we we could do that because That we could do that because we have Hepper theorem. Okay. All right, I'll stop there. We have just done just in time. Okay, thanks so much for the peer feedback. Good. Are there questions for Ronan? Yes, I have a question. Sure. So, Ronan, so this unique statement, how do you determine the vector field X? No, the vector field X is given. No, the vector field x is given by the pullback of the guy on the comb. So it's determined by the vector field of the Sesame Einstein metric on the comb. So X coincides with R D R on the complement of the exceptional set of the resolution, yeah. So when you state uniqueness, you mean also fixing that? Yes, yes, yes, yes, sorry, yes. So you fix it out some time. Yes, sorry, yes. So you fix the asymptotics and you fix a vector field x on point. Sorry, I forgot what's on that. So x is fixed and the asymptotics are fixed and this map is fixed. So all the things you can change are fixed. All the choices are fixed and then we have a uniqueness statement. So do you expect to have solitons with different backs like a compact case? I mean you can always change the vacuum. I mean, you can always change the vector field by a killing vector field, right? Yeah, yeah, but so talk about that. So modulo that. So in the Smithner case, the vector field is determined by the minimal of some functional. Yes, that's right. So the same functional doesn't work for this setup. We tried to see it. So I guess the short answer is it's not clear. Um and then yeah, the short answer is it's not clear. I mean in the expander case in the expander conical case you have a lot of degree of freedom on the on the comet. So for every co-metric you can essentially for every killer co-metric you can essentially get expanders. So you have a big degree of freedom there on the model. So here I guess this is not so clear. So you're kind of in the intermediate case here. From having a big degree of flexibility in the expander case to having a bit being fixed in the shrinker case. To have being fixed in the Shrinker case. So, I guess the short answer is: I don't know. I don't. I mean, the point is: well, one thing to notice is its dependency is determined by some functional on the comb. So, maybe that can give you something, you can construct some functional for that which minimizes it. But if if so say if you've got an arra if you've got a a cone of if you've got if the cease direction is of rank two, then you can all then if the cease direction is of rank two then your um then your soliton, your steady solitone will be invariant under under an S1 will be invariant under an S1 cross S1 action. And then you can always you have that modulate because it's all killing there. You know what I mean? But then I'm and it'll still be gradient, yeah, so I think that you can change the vector field. Did you understand? Did you understand? So if the point is, our steady is invariant under the flow of J of x, so then if J of x is dense in, so the flow of J of x is always dense in the real torus in the C star of the k action, so then you'll have an S1 cross S1 isometry group of the soliton. So these vector fields, the vector fields generated by the action of this S1 cross S1 will be holomorphic. S1 cross S1 will be honomorphic and killing. So you can, I think there'll be a multiplier of fecker fields there. So there seems to be some degree of flexibility. And then I think there'll also be gradient with respect to those guys. Thank you. Thank you. So maybe just in a simple case where you have C2 modulo Z two, then the resolution is C2 mod Z two. The resolution will be canonical one little P1, right? Oh yeah, okay, okay, so that's the same as in the other type of example, okay? Yeah, so you recover the ZAOS example, yeah. The Zao's example, yeah. Does it have the same asymptotics as a Gucci Hansen? No, no, no, it'll be Zao's. So, I mean, it'll be the same. So, these asymptotics in code of this killer form is just those cigar paraboloid asymptotics. Oh. Oh, so they are collapsed, okay? They're collapsed, unfortunately, I guess. So, if you look, I mean, if you just have a C star action, then in the C star orbits, in this Line Bundle case, you just look like a cylinder. So, they're collapsed. Oh, wait, oh, and I mentioned four there. Oh, I mentioned before they're collapsed. He said in general they're non-collapsed. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, they're all collapsed. No, no, no, they're collapsed. Then I misunderstood you when I asked before. Oh, yeah, yeah, these examples are collapsed, yeah. In dimension two and up, complex dimension two and up. But these things. Yeah. Uh oh, I see. Yeah, yeah. Okay, then expansion. Good. Okay, any other questions? If not, let's thank Cronen again. Thanks for being here. And that's a round of applause to the organizers for organizing such a great conference. My engagement conference. Thanks, Albert.
