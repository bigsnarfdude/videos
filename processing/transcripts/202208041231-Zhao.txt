So, the floor is yours. Thank you. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay, good. Thanks for your invitation. And hello, everyone. I'm Jian Inzhou from the China University of Petroleum. I will continue the fluid flow simulation in both media. And it's about the coupling lattice programme method and all network model. And most of the work. And most of the work I finished when I was in ETH3 working with Professor Young Kamed. So, this is the outline of my presentation. So, multiface flow is very common in different science and engineering processes like the oil and gas field development, the geologic CO2 storage, and groundwater flow, and the multi-fuse flow in the fuel cells. And in recent And in recent years, the post-school modeling is becoming more and more popular, just as Professor Chen and Professor Tagy introduced. So the post-go modeling has helped us a lot in understanding the multi-phase flow process in the bulk media. So for post-go studies, there are different investigation methods. The first is post-go experiments. Is the post-scale experiments. So, with the help of the imaging techniques, we can directly observe the multi-field flow process inside the pores geometry. But for the post-gu experiments, it is really time consuming and expensive, and the detailed flow information sometimes cannot be obtained. For example, the pressure distribution and the velocity distribution inside the coarse media. And to solve this problem. And to solve this problem, the PostQ modeling is a good choice. So there are different Post-Q simulation methods. One is a direct numerical method and the other is a pole network model. So for the direct numerical method, we first need to reconstruct the real pulse geometry and we use the simulation method to simulate multi-phase flow directly in this real pulse geometry. Real porous geometry and the direct numerical method, including mainly the traditional CFD method and also the pro network, the lattice program method that we have talked a lot today. So the other method is the pole network model. So to get the pole network model, first we need to extract the topology of the pore space, then we use Pore space, then we then we use some regular pore bodies and surf both to represent the real pores geometry. So, based on this extracted pore network, we can simulate the multi-phase flow and single-phase flow in this porous media. So, for power network models, there are also two kinds of pole network models. One is a dynamic network model and the other is a quasi-static one. And the difference between them is whether the risk was force is considered. So for the So, for the dynamic one, we consider both the viscous force and capital force, but for the quadi static one, we only consider the capillary force. So, for the quadi static pole network model, it only applies to the conditions to the very slow, very small capillary number that the complete force dominates the flow process. So, here we have a brief comparison of the lattice process method and point network model. For the lattice process, Pole network model for the latest broadband method, it is a direct numeric method. So, we simulate multi-fix flow directly in this real post structures. So, it is computationally expensive, but it is more accurate in describing the multi-phase flow process and also the pulse geometry. But for the pore network, it simplifies the real pulse geometry into this regular probabilities and source bounds. And also, And also, the Gaudian equations are simplified as the Darcy equation. So it is very efficient, but it is less accurate in describing the force geometry and the flow process. So the goal of this work is to combine the accuracy of the lattice problem method and the efficiency of the pole network model. So first let's look at the pole network extraction. The power network can be extracted based on the Work can be extracted based on the watershed method. So, this is the schematic of the pole geometry. With watershed method, we can decompose this pole geometry into subpoenas as shown here by different colors. So, in the power network extraction, each sample region corresponds to one proportion in the extracted port network. And if two sample regions are connected, we will link the connecting and we will. Connecting, we will link the probabilities with the throat. And during this extraction process, there is a shape simplification process that we simplify the cross-section of these probabilities through some simple geometries like the triangular, square, and circular. Then the single face and two-phase group properties across. And two-phase flow properties across this regular geometries can be calculated based on some analytical or semi-analytical solutions. So we can see that the pore network model keeps the topology of the pore space, but it simplifies the cross-sections, the shapes of these cross-sections and all the pore bodies and throughbounds. So now let's look at the float determinant. Look at the float-determined flow, including the single-phase flow and two-phase trainer flow. So, for single-phase flow, it is in the throat that we have the largest flow resistance because of the small cross-section. So, and also for the drainage process, when navigating fluid in weed from one body to the other, it is also in the throat that we have the largest resisting capability pressure. So, for these two kinds. Pressure. So, for these two kinds of flows, they are determined by the throat. So, to more accurately simulate such kind of flow, we need to describe the throat information as accurate as possible. So, based on this idea, we propose three different improved pole network models. In the first improved network model, we use the real third cross-section to replace the regular third bound in the conventional network model. So this is Conventional network model. So, this is what we do. So, this is the sample region distribution after the watershed method. So, let's look at these two sample regions. So, to get the cross-section of this between these two pro bodies, we first connect the connect. We first draw a line between the centers of these two pro body. And when we move from one poster to the other, we can get. Point to the other, we can get different cross-sections. And we find the cross-section with the minimum area, which is the third cross-section that we want. So we use this through bonds with the real cross-section to replace the regular throughbound in the conventional network model. And we can see that when we move from one posting to the other, the cross-section in fact varies. It first shows. Varies, it first shrinks and then expands. But in the conventional point network model, we just use one uniform through characterize these varying cross-sections. So to improve this, we propose a second improved model. So we use the serious sub-served bounds to replace just one sub-shirt bound. In addition, we also use the real We also use the real sort of real cross-section in this series sub-source bonus. So, the third improvement is that we directly extract the power suitable element between the two power centers without any shape simplification. And this is one example of the extracted power suitable element. So, in summary, we have proposed three improved power. Proposed three improved point network models compared with the conventional one. So, for the first one, we use the real third cross-section to replace a regular third bound. And for the second one, we further capture the cross-section variation between two pore centers. And in this improved pore network model three, we keep the real pore through geometry without the shift simplification. The shape simplification. So next is a single phase flow. So for single phase flow, in the Perl network, it involves solving a set of linear equations. So first let's look at third bond connecting the Pore I and Pore G. The volume flu rate across this third bond can be calculated based on this DAS equation. And for each pole node, we can list the mass balance or volume balance equation. Balance or volume balance equation. And combined with the inlet and outlet boundary, we can get the pressure distribution in the HOPO network. Then we can calculate the corresponding permeability. So let's look at this pore-slootable element. If we use the conventional point network model to simulate the single-phase flow process, for each root one, we can calculate the conductance based. The conductance based on the semi-analytical solution. But for the improved point network model, for this real circuit cross section, there is no such analytical or semi-analytical solution to calculate the conductance. So we implement the single-base lattice proton simulation across this real slot and calculate the conductance based on the simulation result. And for the improved pole network model. And for the improved point network model 2, we need to implement the single phase simulation in each sub-substrute bound, and then we combine all these sub-throw bounds to get the overall conductance of this whole throat. And for the improved power network model 3, we just implement the pressure boundary conditions in this two-point. Then we can get the volume flow rate across this throat. Volume flow rate across this throat, and based on this equation, we can calculate the corresponding conductance. To evaluate the accuracy of these different pole network models, we choose three different sense dunes which are obtained from the digital rock portal. And we take a subdomain of these sense dunes and extract the corresponding pole networks as shown here. One in pole networks as shown here. So, before we do the pull network simulations, we first do the holder main lattice performance simulation to provide some reference values as shown in the first row of each digital rock. And then we conduct the different pole network simulations. So, in this column, we show the obtained permeability, and in this column, we show the relative error. we show the relative error compared with the reference LBM simulation result and in this column we show the computational time. We can see that from the conventional point network model to the improved point network model 3 the accuracy of the point network model in general increases and but also the computational time increases. But even for this most time consuming improved point Most time-consuming improved point network model 3, the computational time is still by order magnitude smaller than this HODO-magnetic sport mass simulation result. So the improved point network model 3 can replace this HODO magnetic sport mass simulation according to our understanding. But if we look at both the computational accuracy and the computational efficiency, And computational efficiency, we think that the improved pole network model 2 is a good choice. And we also compare the pressure distribution pole by pole. So on the top, we get the pressure distribution in the lattice product method. And on the bottom, it shows the pressure distribution obtained by the pole network model. So firstly, we map the pressure distribution in the digital rock. In the digital rock to the pole network. So then we get the pressure distributions. Then we get the pressures in each pole body obtained by the lattice Product My method, which is the x-axis in these figures. And for the y-axis, it shows the corresponding pressure in the probability obtained by different pole network models. We can see that for the first two pole network models, First, two pole network models, we can see some deviations between the pole network simulation result and the latest Burzman simulation result. But for the last two improved pole network models, we can see good agreement of the pressure distribution obtained by the pole network model and the latest Broadman method. Especially for the improved pole network model 3, we can get very good agreement between these two methods. This also This also means that we can use improved network model three to replace the whole domain lattice product man simulations because it can provide very similar results but with much fewer, much less computational time. And also the improved point network model too is a good choice to consider both the computational efficiency and the computational accuracy. So for multi-physical impulse media, we propose two different kinds of coupling methods. So the first is for the quasi-static drainage process. So as I introduced before, the quasi-static drainage process is a throughout determined flow. So it is the sort information that determines the drainage path and the drainage pattern. So we need to describe the third information as accurate as possible. So instead of using this regular third core section in the conventional network model, we use the real third core sections in the improved network model, which is just the improved network model one. But for two-fifth flow across these real third-cross sections, there's also no analytical or semi-analytical solution. Or semi-analytical solution. So we use the two-phase lattice problem simulations to get the two-phase flow properties across this real third core sections. And after we get the two-phase flow properties of each third one, we can incorporate into the whole network model. Then we can simulate the two-phase drainage flow in this whole pore stomach and get the corresponding complete pressure curve and. Complete pressure curve and relative permeability curve. But for typical digital work or typical pole network, there's usually more than 10,000 through. So if we implement the latest broadband simulation in each throat, it is also very time consuming. So to further improve the computational efficiency, we propose to use the artificial neural network. To use the artificial neural network to predict the two physical properties across the real suitable sections. And to get the training data set, we select more than 1,000 sort cross-sections from five different digital works, which are also obtained from the digital rock portal. And here we show some examples of the real search program. Examples of the real third core sections. So we use the latest performance mass simulations to calculate the two-fixed flow properties in all these real third cross sections. First, we validate the accuracy of the conventional bone network model to predict these two phase flow properties. So here we compare the two phase flow properties obtained by the lattice Pozman method based on the real slope. Based on the real third core section and the conventional point network model obtained based on the simplified third core section. We can see that for the first three properties, the critical entry-copy pressure, the copy pressure saturation relationship, and the single phase conductance, we can see relatively good agreement between the conventional pole network model and the lattice problem simulation result. Dispersion simulation result. But for the relative conductance curve, we can see that for the non-weighting phase relative conductance, the simulation result of the lattice Product My method is always larger than that of the conventional pole network model. And the main reason is that in the conventional pole network model, the viscous coupling is neglected. Then we use nine different parameters to characterize this loose root. To characterize this rose-root cross-section, which are the input parameters in our neural network model. And for the output, the output are the five different two-face flow properties that we need in the core network simulation. So, this is a comparison of the lattice Proteman simulation result and the artificial neural network prediction result. So, we can see that comparison. So we can see that compared with the conventional network model, the artificial neural network model can give much better predictions of the two-phase flow properties. And here is a quantitative comparison of the artificial neural network prediction and the conventional network prediction. You can see that the artificial neural network can give much better predictions of these properties. So we use both. So, we use both the conventional point network model and the improved point network model to simulate the drainage process in our very sandstone, and we calculate the relative permeability and compare with the experiments. Here, we can see that for the weighting fluid relative probability, the two conventional type of models predict very similar results, but for the non-waiting relative. But for the non-Hung relative probability, the prediction result of the improved model is always higher than that of the conventional network model. The main reason is that we can see the viscous coupling in this improved model, and the improved model has a better agreement with the experiments. So, finally, is a dynamic to fist simulation. Simulation. So, first, let's look at the relationship between single phase flow and two phase flow. So, this shows a schematic of the drying process. So, the red color is the liquid phase and blue color is the vapor phase. And the vapor can escape from the porous domain from the right boundary. So, we can see before and after the two-phase interface, we have the single liquid phase flow and single vapor phase flow, and these two flows are coupled with each other. Fluids are coupled with each other through the interface between them, through the complete pressure at the interface between them. So with the watershed method, we can get the sample region distribution. Then we can map the phase distribution into this sample region distribution. Then we can get different kinds of sample, including the true phase poles and the single liquid phase pods and single vapor phase proxies. And single vapor phase ports. Then we propose to use the single phase point network model in the single phase pods and use the more accurate two-phase lattice model in the two-phase ports. So to couples the lattice permanent method and point network model, we add another layer of buffer ports between the two-phase pods and single-phase pods. So in the buffer pods, we implement both the lattice. We implement both the lattice first method simulation and the pole network simulation to couple these two methods. So, this is the general algorithm. So, first, we implement the lattice proton simulation in these two phase poles and the buffer poles. And we can calculate the pressure of waiting and all waiting fluid in this buffer pose. So, these pressures act as the boundary condition for our single phase for network simulation. With power network simulation. So, with the power network simulation, we can get the pressure distributions in the vapor phase and also in the liquid phase. And these pressures in next step act as the boundary conditions for the buffer process to couple the point network simulation and lattice problem simulation. So, we use it. We use this pseudo We use this pseudo 3D pulse domain to validate the accuracy of the improved model. So here we at the right we have a constant vapor pressure boundary condition and in initial condition we have a large amount of weight or liquid field in this pulse domain as shown by the red color and we have a lower vapor pressure as a Have a lower vapor pressure as an outlet. So the vapor will escape from the porous media and the drying process starts. So this is the sample region distribution after the watershed method and this is the extracted network. So first we let's look at the phase distribution during the drying process. So we implement the whole domain lattice for the main simulation. whole domain lattice Poisson simulation to act as a reference simulation result. And on the right we show the simulation result of the hybrid method. We can see very good agreement between the hybrid method and the holder man latest worldman simulation result. And this video shows the evolution of the prototype in the hybrid method. So we implement the lattice proton simulation. The latest broad mass simulations only in the two-phase poles and the buffer poles, which are the yellow poles and green poles. So this shows the comparison of detailed pressure distribution. And on the left is the lattice broadman simulation. And on the right is a hybrid simulation result. And we can also see very good agreement between them. To quantitatively validate the accuracy of the hybrid method, we compare the Hybrid method, we compare the relationship between complete pressure and saturation. And we can see good agreement between them. And the fluctuations is mainly caused by the Heinz jump. And on the right, we show the comparison of the weapon pressure distribution along the x-axis for different liquid saturations. And for solid lines, it's the lattice present simulations. And the dashed line are the full net hybrid method. The co-net hybrid method. We can also see very good agreement. And this slide shows the drawing kinetics curve, and we can see very good agreement between the hybrid method and hold on LBM simulation result. And this shows the interface position as a function of the liquid saturation. And again, we can see very good agreement. Can see very good agreement and the difference between these two lines are the length of this couple of fingering. You can see very significant fingering during the drawing process. And as we only use the latest sportsman method in the two-fifth ports and buffer pods, so the computational time of the hybrid method is much smaller compared with that. Smaller compared with that of the whole domain lattice person assimilation result. So, in summary, we propose three improved pole network models for single-phase flow impulse media and artificial neural network indeed improved pole network model for quadrastatic genus simulation is developed coupling the lattice proton method and pole network model. And finally, we develop a hybrid method for dynamic drawing process, coupling the Process coupling the latest Rosman method and Pole Network model. Thanks for your attention, and I'm happy to answer any question. Well, excellent talk, Dr. Zhalin Zhao. Thank you. And thank you for a good talk. So we are close to the time, so we'll take maybe one question before, and I know it's pretty late for you. So thank you for giving us a talk at a very, very odd hour. Use a talk at a very, very odd hour for yourself. So, any questions from the audience here? Okay, like I have a just like one clarification because I'll be talking to you a lot because I work in this particular area. Kind of go in a philosophical direction of, you know, you are coupling two different resolution, different governing equation simulation methods. And when we transfer these variables, you're talking pressure to pressure, like what type of Like what type of averaging, what time-length scales you're talking about. You know, sometimes we use just because we are using the symbol same, that the information coming from one to another is like somebody says, you know, it will serve as a boundary condition for Lattice Wolfman. Lattice Wolfman had a much higher resolution and a pore network would have like one pressure. How do you go from one pressure to actually prescribing the pressures at every pore throat that you have resolved in your letters, Wolfsman? Lattice Wolfsman. Just give us an insight into that. How do you take the feedback from a core network into Lattice Wolfsman? Yeah, very good question. This is the key point of this hybrid method. So I have a slice for this process. So in fact, before we do the hybrid simulation method, we first implement a reference simulation process. So we simulate the single phase flow. Simulate the single phase flow for each throat and we get the reference velocity and reference pressure and this pressure boundary conditions. And after we do the yeah, we have it here. So after we do the polynetic simulation, we have another pressure P1 and P1. Other pressure P1 and P2, and then we rescue the velocity and pressure of this interface point node. And then we implement the equilibrium density distribution functions on these boundaries based on this risk-guided velocity and the pressure. Okay, okay. Well, Pretty good. I think I can live with that kind of an answer. But let's continue our discussion and we'll thank because we have one more talk before we go for lunch break.
