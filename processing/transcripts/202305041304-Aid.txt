Okay, so I'm I'm starting again. So you missed this. Okay, so it's a joint work with Matthew Baze. Matthew Baze used to be a research engineering idea of research and development, but he moved to the bank, but he's still a nice guy. And Giorgio Ferrari, who is in Benefit University, and Matteo joined us together on this project of stationary mid-field economy model for irreversible investment. And since I don't have much time, And since I don't have much time, but still, so there is basically no introduction. I will present the model, then I'll present the equilibrium, I'll present some economic result perspective, and the ascent to section, which is the most important order. Okay, so the model, and maybe there are some justifications that, okay, let's do that. The main justification is that George Joe had this possibility to do some stationary in Philippe Rio and they were looking In Filip Rio, and they were looking for economic applications and they wanted to work on the three together. So, that's, I think, that's the main motivation. So, you consider that you have a continuum of firms indexed by their production capacity, and their production is affected by two independent sources of randomness. Okay, so there is a one idiosyncratic risk in the Bronyan motion. And there is no introduction. After lunch, like this, After lunch, like this, zoom over there, like this, no time to adapt. And the macroeconomic shock, and this one is the thing that makes the thing a little complicated. So you have a continuous time Markov chain, epsilon, and with transition rate P1 and P2. So, okay, so 1 over P1 is the time that you stayed in state 1, and 1 over P2 is the time you stay in state 2. Okay, and there is True. Okay? And there is a crisis, and you moved from one state to another. And the dynamics of X is given by this. So small delta is the depression rate of the capital. So for instance, if I build the power plant, a power plant, its life expectancy is 40 years. After 40 years, no more power plant. Okay? So the decay is one over 40. And the volatility will depend on the state of the economy. The state of the economy, but the depression rate does not. The depression rate is linked to the capital, but this one is linked to the state of the economy. And this one is the investment rate. So there is a circle because it's a special type of thing, because this one is singular control. But this one is in percentage, and you can increase the number of capacity collection at the rate I. Rate high. Okay, so I guess that's everything. And the guy, this production facility, they produce a good, and for me, it's a commodity. For instance, it's electricity, mainly. But you can think of other goods. And there is a price which is like this. There is it's a function of Q. I can't say what is Q, but you can think it as the install capacity. And the more installed capacity, the lower the price. The lower the price. Okay? Minus alpha. And there are parameters. And this one, even if Q is very, very large, there's still going to be a price which is not going to go to zero. Okay, it's important in our model. But even if there is a lot of capacity, the price does not go to zero. Okay? Okay, and the representative, what is the criterion of the film? Are the criterion of What is the criterion of the film? All the criterion of the film, there are parts which are very common, and there is a part which is slightly new. Okay? So this one is the, there is minus because each time you want to invest, you have to pay. Kappa is the cost of investment. Each unit of power plant costs kappa. It's constant. There is adjustment cost. You can do the model without this one, but we put it to show that we can do it. Basically, we can handle Basically, we can handle this. And a discount rate. And this one is particular. Because this one is what we call the pricing rule. And in fact, look at that. So if you imagine that this one is one megawatt, this one is megawatt hour. But the price which is here is just like Corneau. The more capacity you have, the less the price. But here, the price does not depend on X directly. It depends on some. On X directly, it depends on something which is Q of epsilon of T. So Q of epsilon T can take only two values. That's because epsilon T can take only two values. Either you're in a good state or you're in the bad state. So this guy can take only two values. So this guy is only two prices. Yes, you see it's a crude simplification. So the decision maker is looking at the future and instead of using And instead of using the true income that you will receive, which is the price that's going to be realized on the trajectory of the process in the future depending on NEX, is going to say, no, no, no, no. I made some studies and I'm going to use only two scenarios. Either the price is going to be eta one or the price is going to be eta two. And I'm going to make the valuation of my The valuation of my production capacity at those two potential prices. So for me, it's an aberration. Somebody said it was not allowed. But I realized, so first we did the model and then I find an explanation. In fact, I found that this is what my colleagues, my former colleagues in deaf work, were doing. In fact, I tried to, with Uyen and With Ugen and Lucien Lucampi, and a great student, Nicolas Langrunet, we try to implement two pricing rules, meaning that you're going to follow the trajectory of your projection capacity, and depending on the true realization of your projection capacity, the electricity price would realize. And we built a model based on optimal switching and stuff. We need a lot of stuff, but I never managed to sell that to EDF. Never. It was really too complicated. And in fact, really, what they do is say, no, no, no, the prices are something which are too important, and we really want to know simple values for that. Give me what is your forecast for the price. Okay, and I will do my investment theory based on that. Okay? I can't compute about the Q. So the Q1, Q2 are two given constants? Oh, we are going to find out. Exactly. I don't know we are going to find out. Exactly. Here, the objective function, the criteria depends. So you need to see. Yes. So Q1 and Q2 are going to be data 1. So you need the whole function. Yes, yes. You cannot just say data 1. Okay. Okay, exactly. And first, maybe, Zheng Feng, you're thinking of the hard question Giorgio worded me about. But I will deal with this at the end. Okay, so this criteria depends on the stochastic. Okay, so this redaria depends on the stochastic process I of investment and two numbers, q1 and q2. Okay, okay, okay, and this one is very close, in fact, to the paper of Grenadier in Reviewer of Economic Studies, where he was. I have to go faster now. Are you in my side? Okay, okay. So, very close to this one: singular control and player game, but ours is simplification, but ours works. Okay, okay. Okay, I almost in loss. Okay, okay. So, equilibrium. What is an equilibrium? What is an equilibrium? You're going to see that. So, it's a pair. It's a pair of investment process, I star, and a couple, Q star, Q1 star, Q2 star. Such that, such that, what, what? Deviation from Y star when Q star is fixed is never good. Okay? Okay, this one is okay. And this is the And this is the fixed point. The fixed point is q star 1 equals the x conditional expectation in state 1 for the stationary distribution. So this one, the stationary distribution of the process, will depend on q1 and q2. And if you give me q1 and q2, I can compute this guy. Then, if I can compute this guy, I can compute this expectation. Expectation, I will find a number, and I need that this number is exactly the number I put in the. Okay? And so, when you see that, it's very. No, no, no, not this one, not this one. This one first. How to solve this problem and then the theorem. First, how to solve it, and then the problem. It's very simple. They told me that. It was simple already. Okay, so how do you do that? You fix a couple Q1 and Q2. It's two numbers. It's two numbers. You solve the singular control problem. You solve this one, and the singular control problem will be two reflecting barriers. You need to find two reflecting barriers for the process. And these two reflecting barriers, they depend on the couple that you picked. But once you have them, you compute the stationary distribution. And in fact, because it's Brunien, because they know a lot of things about the reflection of Brunien motion and barriers, they give you a formula for this. They give me a formula for this one. Once I have this one, I compute the expectation, then I get this gap. Reiterate foot foot, and it works. In fact, all the computations that, all the pictures that maybe you're going to see, if I have time, is based on implementing this algorithm, which converges super fast. In three iterations, you find it all. If there were only one state, it's one page of computation. Two states, Computation. Two states is ten pages of computations. So this is why there's a paper. Okay, so now you have to go up and look. And so, you theoretical, first there exists a unique stationary mean field equilibrium. You need to have some condition on the parameters, but then you have this. And the optimal control reflects on two barriers, A1, star, A2, that are solutions of a complicated yet numerically solvable algebraic system. So you have a Algebraic system. So you have an equation like this, but it's doable. Doable. And then you have the formula for the status limit distribution. And I put you see things. Now, the thing which is not important, you see numbers everywhere and blah blah. It is tariton. It's tariton distribution. It is x to the power something. So when you are above the last barrier, it is x over the threshold to the power of theta 2 minus 1. So it is parito. So it is parito. It's very important for the distribution of size variant. And we have those parameters almost explicitly. Almost. You just have to solve a small polynomial equation. So, economic results. In yes, I have time. I have six, seven minutes before the things go boom. Okay. Okay, so. Okay, so I will just show three things: if I trajectories and densities, market concentration, and value of stability. Just to show that the trajectories and densities. So you have something like this, just to imagine. Okay, but I know that you imagine stochastic processes. You live with them, so you don't need pictures. But for people, sometimes it's good to have a picture. So, how does the process evolve? So, you don't see clearly, but So, you don't see clearly, but those parts are red, pink, pink, pink. Okay, so when it goes pink, it means that you jumped to the new state of the economy. Okay, and this is the first threshold of investment, and this one is the second threshold of the investment. Okay, so you start here, so you reflect, poof, you reflect, so you reinvest each time you touch this boundary, and then look. The reiterate, and then look, then you move to a new state. So you let you move to a new state of the economy, so you let capital depreciate. And you let capital depreciate, Stéphane, you let capital depreciate because you know that in this situation the prices are too low and so there is not much value of capital and so you let it go, you let it go. So you let it go, you let it go. Here, for instance, it's a clear ESA. You were there, and then you let the capital grow, decrease, decrease, and depreciate. So you do nothing. You let things deteriorate like this. You don't care. Until you touch the boundary, you move up and then miraculously move into the. And so, if you make the expectation of a million trajectories reflecting on those boundaries, you're going to see that the expectation in state blue is going to go, or there is that there is. Is going to go, our idea is that it's numeric, don't worry. It's going to go to exactly q1 star and the same for q2 star. Okay, so it's going to go. So it's a check, sanity check. Now, don't location. Okay, let's move. Okay, and in this literature, people are really worried and concerned about the tail distribution of firm size. Okay. Of firm size. There's a lot of papers on that. For instance, one key reference is Axtel 2001, where, in fact, in Physicadé, he looks at the firm size in the US, but he mix all the sectors. Okay, all the US firms, and you take the minimum firms, for instance, like 50 people, no firms below 50 people, and you look at the tail distribution, and you find that it is Pareto. And you find that it is Pareto also with a coefficient, which is Y. Coefficient, which is 1. Okay? And here I've plotted for some parameters of transition of the model. And you have two examples like this. And here it is a zoom, not the conference application, but the fact that you make a loop, like this, you increase the size. It's a zoom of what is happening here, so you have got some bit. And here you see that it's just to show that you're really the test. You are really, the tail is like theta2 to the log of x, so it's really proportional. The log of the distribution is proportional to theta2. Okay. And in our case, in fact, we find some coefficients of theta2 which can go, which can be much larger in absolute value than one. Really much larger. Four, seven. I can produce things with four, seven. But if we take very small discount, Small discount, no, depreciation rate of capital, then we are going to go closer to one. For instance, if I take something like 50 years, so the capital depreciates in one over 50, so 50 years depression, then I will be much closer to one. But if I take some depreciation rate, which is very quick, for instance, in the informatic industry, where assets depreciate very quickly, then I would have a Pareto description which is going to be very quick. The Pareto description is going to be very large. The theta is going to be large. Hello, look at that. It's nice because they are not published yet, but there are some papers who find at the sectoral level distribution which are not one, but which are larger. For instance, for so you always find a paper. If you look closely in the literature in the web, you may find something that confers your theory, okay? Or your model. There are so much of that. There are so many so much of that. So, first, allor. And now, in the four minutes that I am left with, so this one is not market fragmentation, because this one is very nice. Very nice. Because, alor, yes, because stationary mean field equipment that Giorgio sold me, in fact, it was Brian Krob in Stanford together with his co-host Atlaca and Drake. They developed also the theory for economic industry and also to study exactly industrial economics. Exactly, industrial economics and the distribution of lumps. And in fact, in their paper in Journal of Economic Theory, they link the existence of an equilibrium to the fact that there is light-k distribution of force, meaning that it is not parado. Because in that paper, it is a sufficient condition. It's not a necessary condition, it's a sufficient paper. Because in that paper, they're saying if there is heavy tail, it means, it means that there are some. Testing. It means that there are some big players. And if there are some big players, in the limit, it's not possible to have something to consider that these big players don't have a preponderant role in the price formation or in the equilibrium. You would have to do something like large players, small players, stuff like this. But in our case, we find that there is the stationary. There is the stationary mean field equilibrium, and yet we have Pareto distribution. So we have something which are people which are maybe very big. So in fact, I said, okay, but how can it be? So I tried, together with my colleagues, like that a lot, to study fragmentation and concentration, but with other quantitative measures. Don't sleep. Okay? Okay, now it's here. Uh okay, now it's here we finish. Okay, and I will jump directly to the Gini type index, not the uh because this one is difficult to pronounce, but it is the one which this is why it is called HHI, because if you manage to pronounce this name, then you can work at a regulatory institution. Okay, but this one is the most used to assess mergers and acquisition in sectors to see if there is too much concentration, okay? It's and it is something that you need at least a PhD. Is something that you need at least a PhD in stochastic control to compute this quantity, which is the sum of the square of the market share. Okay? So, again, so it's linked to the variance of the stuff, but I will jump to the Gini index because the Gini index is much simpler and I pull up a picture. So, what is the Gini index? I'm going to take my firms, my 1 million firms, or my 1,000 firms, and I will rank them. This one are contacts, this one is the This one is the first, second, third quantiles, like this. And I sort them by order of context. And what does it mean? It means like the first 10% of the firm, they are holding less than 10% of the total capacity. You see that? And here, when you are there, 50% of the firm hold less than one-third. Less than one-third of total capacity. Okay? So this blue. Somebody cheated the stuff. It's not the stuff. Yes, it is true. It was very bad. And so this one is the... And I will finish. I'll finish on that. The action is going to hit me. Come to police. Okay. So this blue curve is the Gini curve. Okay, and this pink area is the Gini index. And so if this Index. And so if this curve, this pink, is completely confounded with this increase, it means that the market is completely fragmented. Each firm holds exactly 1% of this. And if it is completely concentrated, then the pink era would be this one. I won't make any comment on special economies in the world, but it can be an economy where everyone has nothing except one guy who has everything. And for this and that, you And for this, and that, you observe that when you increase stability, 1 over P1 is the time that you spend in the good state. When you increase stability up these index defices, it means that the more stable is the economy, the more market concentration reduces. We choose the line this. Because if you have found the opposite, I did not hope to be published. Okay, value stability, we skip that. Value stability, we skip that because it is look at, we skip that. Perspective: to increase or to do some more work, and thank you. There is a quick question. Is it just a matter of having enough paper? Or there are two difficulties. Yeah, I know. For two states For two states, they said symmetric cases, a lot of computations. Three states, you have to define in which order are the boundaries. And you have to do all the cases. So no, I don't. I don't have a PhD student who is patient enough to do that. Okay? And... Mine is just there is a patient. So why is epsilon more or less the state of the economy? Yes. Recession versus exponentially. Exactly. And why is it not showing up in the value function? Ah, see. Well. Where? So there is no deal. Oh, you are very strong. You have good eyes. Where? Where, where, where? In the value function. It is in the objective function. Look, look, look, look, look. I know it's fast. So J is IQ, and there is no epsilon there. Where? No, the K values. Yeah, here here there is what is epsilon I somewhere but there is VXI where where? Somewhere in the end in the end no but this this one I think you may because we're gonna trust the original it is epsilon one and epsilon okay this one is epsilon okay so it enters it entails don't worry it entails thank you I leave on this one because
