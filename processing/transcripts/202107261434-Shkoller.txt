Lecture today. So, our last speaker today is Steve Scholler from UC Davis, and he's going to talk about some recent work on the shock and cause development for 2D Euler with Azimuthal Symmetry. Okay, well, thank you very much to the organizers for giving me the opportunity to talk about this new work. And this is with Tristan Buckmaster and Theodore. And Buck Master and Theo Drivis and Vlad Vickel. So I'm going to switch gears a little bit and talk about the compressible Euler equations. And I'd like to begin by just listing them in what's called conservation law form. So these are the quintessential conservation laws in nature. Will this work? So the first equation is conservation of momentum. The second equation is conservation of momentum. The second equation is conservation of mass. And the third equation is conservation of energy. And there's this fourth variable here, pressure, and pressure is a function of density and velocity and energy. And it's written in this particular form. And for the most part, we will not be using this particular form for the analysis, but this form is incredibly important. This form is incredibly important because it gives rise to the Rankine-Hugonian jump conditions across a shock front. And to get those jump conditions, you really need to begin with this particular form of the system. So here we are with these Rankin-Hugoniot jump conditions. Each equation gives the jump conditions that a solution must satisfy across this shock front. So So here, s dot denotes the shock speed in the normal direction to the shock front. And this bracket is just the jump from the left side minus the right side. So you have a discontinuous function taking a value on the left and on the right of the shock. And the difference from left to right is this jump. So conservation of momentum gives you this particular jump condition and Particular jump condition and conservation of mass, this particular jump condition, and so forth. Now, when these three jump conditions are actually satisfied, in other words, when you have a solution to Euler, which satisfies Euler in a point-wise sense on either side of this discontinuity and then satisfies these jump conditions across the discontinuity, then it's often very convenient, at least it is for us, to replace this constant. To replace this conservation of energy equation, this third equation here, with a simpler transport of entropy. And when you do this, so here you have transport of entropy, capital S, then the pressure is given perhaps in the more familiar form where you have 1 over gamma. Gamma is this adiabatic exponent. In air, it's 1.4. And I often set it to be 2 for simplicity. So you can think of it as being 2 for this type. So you can think of it as being two for this talk. So the pressure is one over gamma, rho to the gamma, e to the s, and this is the ideal gas law. So this talk is about shock development, but the lingo is that you start from smooth initial data and you go up to the time of the very first singularity, which for this particular simulation is at a point. And this first singularity is called a pre-shock. Is called a pre-shock. So the evolution from initial data to the pre-shock is known as the formation problem. And then the idea of this talk is to continue that past the first singularity, past the pre-shock, until you have this surface of discontinuity forming instantaneously as a discontinuous shockwave, plus two other so-called weak characteristic discontinuities that will form. So here's a simulation where you take a wave. Here's a simulation where you take, this is sort of a generic type of initial condition to form a shock for the 2D Euler equations without any symmetry assumptions. So you sort of line this up so that you have a maximally negative slope at a particular point, let's say in the X1 direction. And there are some conditions. You want this to be a local minimum. So the second derivative should vanish and the Hessian of the And the Hessian of the partial one derivative should be positive. And you let it run. Oops. I don't know why it's not running. Let me try that again. Okay, let me run it in this mode. Let me run it in this mode. So, up to time one, at time one, the pre-shock will form, and then it goes a little bit past it where the discontinuity actually forms. And this is just sort of the typical scenario. You see the steepening, propagating front. And here's the side view. Same problem. So the pre-shock that will form at time one, and then it becomes discontinuous instantaneously. So the pre-shock. Instantaneously. So the pre-shock, as I'll tell you, is a continuous object where the slope becomes infinite at a point, and it's a C1 third profile. And then, let me just see, this was working a moment ago. So this is starting from this pre-shock data. So this is a C one third profile. This is what happens if you start with the pre-shock and let it run, except for it won't. So let me go. So let me go back to this view. So you'll see a discontinuity instantaneously develops as the shock front. And won't let me show you. So if what you'll see is that right around here, you see these two other little dimples. These are actually trying to. Actually, trying to tell you that there's two other characteristic discontinuities occurring. Now, for the remainder of the talk, we're going to work with azimuthal symmetry that really simplifies the problem. So the type of geometry you should imagine is a shock forming and then developing as it moves around a circle. And it'll sort of look like this. You have this smooth data, forms a shock, and then forms a shock and then it sort of cruises around the circle and that's the kind of problem I'll be discussing today okay so as I said shock formation you start from smooth initial data and you go to the first singularity and we call this the pre-shock so you start at time capital T0 and and then at time capital T1 this pre-shock forms T1, this pre-shock forms. And just so, just in this part, just in this part of the dynamics, you can actually study various forms of the Euler equation. You can study the full Euler equation, non-isentropic, which I've labeled as capital N. This has three wave families. You have sound waves, which can interact with entropy waves and create vorticity out of irrotational data, which I think is quite interesting. Interesting. You can simplify this problem quite a bit by studying initial data where the entropy is a constant. And up until the pre-shock, this entropy will stay a constant. So there you have sound waves which can interact with vorticity waves, but you can't actually produce vorticity. There are no entropy waves cruising around. And you cannot, as I'll describe on the next slide, you can't actually use this reduced model for the development problem. And you can And you can further simplify the isentropic model by studying irrotational dynamics. So, there you remove vorticity waves, you only have sound waves, but this can be really useful because then you can use a potential function, and this can really help with the analysis in some cases. So, let me begin by just giving you a very, very crude overview of our shock formation theorems. So we began with studying this 2D Euler equations under azimuthal symmetry. That's that figure I showed you where you had that wave moving around in a circle. And we studied the isentropic problem. And then in 2019, we went to the full 3D problem, but kept isentropic dynamics. And then in 20, we did the full non-isentropic problem, and we actually proved that from And we actually proved that from irrotational data, you could create vorticity and a shock. And in that particular analysis, we used modulated self-similar variables to produce a pre-shock where we could tell you precisely the location of that pre-shock, the time at which that pre-shock occurred, the direction along which that wave was propagating, and the C1 third regularity of the pre-shock. And the C1 third regularity has to And this C1/3rd regularity has to do with this generic non-degenerate data. If you take different kinds of data, you can get different holder exponents. But for the rest of this talk, I'll be focused on this stable, generic, non-degenerate data, which leads to C1 third profiles at the pre-shock. Now, for the purpose of the shock development problem, which I really want to discuss today, we needed a little bit more information. What we wanted to do was to What we wanted to do was to actually say that we could tell you what the functions were at the pre-shock in terms of the data. And in particular, in this latest paper, we've returned to this 2D azimuthal setting. We went full non-isentropic, but in this particular setting, we can tell you the power series expansion of all of the solutions expanded about this pre-shock location. Pre-shock location. And it turns out that for the way that we do the development problem, knowing this particular power series information is absolutely crucial and plays a vital role in things like uniqueness and so forth. Now, there are many, many other shock formation results, and I've been a bit careless not to cite more of them here, but I was afraid I'd run out of time. So I just want to refer the interested person into sort. Refer the interested person into sort of the classics in this area. So, Christa Dulu's original book in 2007 did the 3D problem in the relativistic setting. And then with Mao in 2014, they did the non-relativistic setting. And then Luck and Jared Speck in 2018 added vorticity to the 2D isentropic problem. And very, very recently, they have done the three. They have done the 3D full non-isentropic Euler equations with vorticity. And so the methods are very different than our methods, but I think the results are actually very similar. And I would refer you to those papers for that particular point of view. So, shock and cusp development. So, what is the objective? As I said, you want to continue the solution past. continue the solution past this pre-shock. You want to establish existence and uniqueness of a discontinuous shock wave and two other weak, oops, just one weak discontinuities. So these are going to be these two other surfaces which are going to emanate from the pre-shock together with a shock wave, which I'll tell you about. Now there's actually a very short history of shock development in the sense of coming from this pre-shock. Again, there's a huge history. Again, there's a huge history of weak solutions and so forth, but I haven't listed those. What I'd like to tell you about is a paper of Lebeau in 1994. So I think this was really a remarkable paper. She studied the 1D 2x2P system, which you can view as just 1D isentropic Euler. And she proved that from this C1 third point shock, you get instantaneously the existence of this discontinuous shock. Existence of this discontinuous shock. Now, uniqueness, she didn't have to worry about it. It came for free by a result of Taiping Liu. But it really was a very, very beautiful paper that really laid down a bunch of nice ideas. Later, Chen Dong and Kong slightly generalized her result with slightly more general initial data. And then a major generalization of her result came in 2004 by Yin, who actually studied. Yin, who actually studied the full non-isentropic Euler equations in one dimension under spherical symmetry. And again, he obtained from this point shock the existence of a discontinuous shock solution. He established weak solutions to this 1D system of Euler equations, but he did not have uniqueness. He did not study the regularity of these solutions, and he was not able to capture the weak discontinuities in his analysis. The weak discontinuities in his analysis. In 2016, Christa Dulu and Lisebach also studied the 1D Euler equation under spherical symmetry, but in the isentropic setting. And they established, again, the development result for the isentropic model, but that is actually not a weak solution of the Euler equations. And then Chris Dadulu has a new book that came out in 2019 where he studies the full multi. Where he studies the full multi-D irrotational Euler equations. And he termed this, if I understand correctly, the restricted shock development problem. And the reason this is the restricted problem is that when you, even if you start the problem with constant entropy, entropy must be produced at the shock. And so what's happening when you study isentropic or rotational dynamics is that you're not capturing the correct Rankin-Hugonian jump. The correct Rankin-Hugonian jump conditions. And moreover, you're not capturing the physical production of entropy. So even if you start the problem isentropic, once a discontinuous shock forms, it's no longer the correct model. So today's talk, we're going to basically talk about starting from smooth initial data with this non-degenerate generic. Non-degenerate, generic, stable condition, and then go to the point shock. And I'm not going to say hardly anything about that. We're going to get to this pre-shock here. And then from this pre-shock, there's going to be three sort of discontinuous surfaces that are going to form instantaneously. The red curve denotes the shock curve. The blue curve is going to denote what we call a weak contact. And the green curve denotes the control. The green curve denotes what we call a weak rarefaction wave. And what's interesting here is this is space-time. So under azimuthal symmetry, you have one space direction theta and one time direction t. And space-time is broken up into these four regions. And the behavior of the solutions is very, very different in each of these regions. And I'll completely characterize space-time in terms of what's happening in all of these different regions and explain how. Different regions and explain how the analysis works. Now, the next few slides, I'm going to sort of show a sequence of transformations that really gets to the point of the equations that we want to study. They're sort of for completeness, so I'm going to go fast and you don't have to take very much from it. It doesn't really matter. But it's convenient to introduce this new adiabatic exponent, alpha, which is gamma minus one over two. And in terms, and then it's convenient instead of studying. And then it's convenient instead of studying density or pressure as one of the fundamental unknowns, it's convenient to introduce this rescaled sound speed. So, sound speed is the square root of dp d rho, and I rescale it by one over alpha, and we call that sigma. And so, what you can do is you can, and I'm going to go through this quickly because it really doesn't matter. I'm just sort of going to get to the point. So, what you can do is you can write this as a system of equations for velocity, sound speed. For velocity, sound speed, and entropy. And this is kind of nice because there's this very similar sort of nonlinear structure which allows you to add and subtract these two equations from one another in a nice way. So that's the reason those variables are used. Then you switch to polar coordinates. So you let uθ be the azimuthal component of velocity and ur be the radial component of velocity. And so now you have four equations for the radial component. equations for the radial component of velocity u r u theta the sound speed sigma and the transport of entropy s okay so that's not a big deal now you make this azimuthyl symmetry assumption and so basically this is the massive reduction of the problem you assume that u theta is given in terms of a variable b of theta comma t, u r in terms of a, the sound speed sigma in terms of the sound of the sound The sound speed sigma in terms of C, and the entropy in terms of K. And when you do this, you get this very nice system of equations, and it really kind of simplifies the analysis in a very nice way. And to further simplify the analysis, I'm just going to set gamma equal to 2, which is the same as alpha equal to 1 half. And this is going to allow me to do something very special, which will really simplify the presentation. Will really simplify the presentation. Okay, the point of all that was to introduce these Riemann variables. So W is B plus C. So this is the dominant Riemann variable. So this is the azimuthal component of velocity plus the sound speed. And then there's a subdominant Riemann variable, which is the azimuthal component of velocity minus the sound speed. And as I said, there's three wave speeds in this problem. In this problem, there's a fast wave speed, which is actually going to impinge on the shock. Then there's the middle wave speed, which is moving with the fluid velocity. And then there's the slow wave speed, which is sort of going to set up expansion or rarefaction. And what you can do in terms of these variables w and z is write the Euler equations in the following way. So you have this dominant Riemann variable W. Dominant Riemann variable W, which is being transported on the left-hand side, the transport structures via this fast wave speed. And then you have the subdominant Riemann variable, which has this transport structure in terms of the slow wave speed. And then, of course, entropy is being transported by the fluid wave speed, middle wave speed. And then the radial component of velocity is also being transported by the fluid. Now, I've covered. Now, I've colored these two forcing terms on the right-hand side. The presence of entropy, what you would think when you switch to azimuthal symmetry, is that you could sort of get rid of derivative loss. And the fact that one has entropy, you see these derivatives of entropy forcing the dominant and subdominant Riemann variables. It looks like there's derivative loss. It turns out that there actually isn't. I'll say something about that later. And I'll say something about that later. So, this is still a really beautiful system to analyze. So, what is the problem? We are now sitting at the pre-shock here. So we've arrived at the pre-shock. So, T1 is the blow up, is the first blow-up time, is the pre-shock time. And XI star. Xi star is the pre-shock location. And I'm going to set both of them equal to zero. So we'll restart the problem with, we'll shift everything so that this pre-shock is occurring at zero, zero. And now the problem is you're starting, here you are at T1, and you're going to evolve this system of four equations. System of four equations. And the dominant Riemann variable is sort of the object to pay attention to. And based on our formation result, we have a very nice description of what's happening at the pre-shock. So in particular, we have an expansion for it, and these coefficients of the expansion can be computed in terms of the initial data to the problem. And when I said I took gamma equal to 2 to simplify things, what I meant was. To simplify things, what I meant was I'm in the formation process, I'm actually going to purposefully set entropy to zero and the subdominant Riemann variable to zero. And the reason for this is I want to highlight how this is actually created at the discontinuity. So now we're starting the problem here, and we're going to see what happens as we continue past this first singularity using this initial data here. So think of, so this is a So, think of, so this is, we're going to call this W with a zero subscript, W naught, and with A naught. And A naught is some function. It doesn't really matter, but it's C1, one-third. Okay, so that's the problem. Now, I'm no longer going to state anything very precisely. The rest of the talk is mostly going to be pictures. And what I want to explain is that the analysis here is really in terms of characteristics, in terms of derivatives of characteristics, and in terms of estimating characteristics. And let me begin with the three characteristic. So this is the fast characteristic. So what's happening here is you define eta to be the characteristic associated with the fast wave speed lambda 3. And for some And for some label x, what's happening is that so x is a label at time zero. So this problem is running from time starting at zero up to some time epsilon bar. So that's the time interval of interest. At time zero, this is where the pre-shock occurs. And this label is being carried into the shock. The shock. And then there's another label here. Maybe I'll call this x minus and this x plus. And this is also being carried by eta into this shock. And then to the left of this label and to the right of this label, eta is a diffeomorphism. So any label X will be taken by this flow, by this characteristic to some. flow by this characteristic to some Eulerian point theta comma t and you can reverse it given some point theta comma t you can invert the characteristic as long as you're to the left or to the right of this region here so these are the fast characteristics which impinge on the shock and what I want to remind you is that at this time level here so at time t equals zero we're given this pre-shock w0 now what I'm going to Now, what I'm going to explain is that W0 is essentially going to be carried into the shock by this flow eta. I'll say something more about that. So, this is in some sense the simplest of the flows of the characteristics. Now, there are two other characteristics. So, there's the two characteristic associated with the medium speed, which is the fluid velocity lambda two. And then there's this green characteristic. Green characteristic psi, which is the slow characteristic associated with the slow wave speed lambda one. Now, here, in this picture here, oops, come on, in this pict in this picture here, this was given an initial condition. And then we sort of, from that initial condition, we moved until we either got to the shock or somewhere to the left of the shock or to the right of the shock. To the left of the shock or to the right of the shock. Whereas in this picture here, here we're giving this characteristic a final condition. So what's happening is that you're at some point theta comma t in space-time, and then you're going to follow this blue characteristic down until you You hit the shock. And when you hit the shock, there's this time tau of theta, which is the shock intersection time. And similarly, you can follow the green characteristic, which is the slow characteristic, until you hit the shock, and then you end up with. You end up with j of theta, t, which is also the shock intersection time, but for the blue characteristic. And the final time means that this time here is parametrized by s. You're starting at some point theta, t, you're moving in time s. And the final condition is that when you're at theta, when you're at time t, When you're at time t, you recover theta. So it's essentially saying that you're not really going backward in time, but you're going forward in time, but you're assigning a final condition. Okay, now what are these important curves of discontinuity? So this is in fact, this is the two characteristic that's emanating from the pre-shock, and then which you'll see has a very strong discontinuities along it. Discontinuities along it, and then this is the green characteristic, which is the slow characteristic emanating from the pre-shock. So, this is this guy here is the shock. This guy here is another surface of discontinuity, and this guy here is another surface of discontinuity. I'm going to tell you what happens in between. Now, let me come back to this picture here for a moment. Come on. Okay. So, in this picture here, as I said, if you're at some label X, what's happening is that the three characteristic is taking you to the shock. And then what you can define is W minus just to the left of it. And you can take another label. Take another label, X minus, X plus, and then you can follow the three characteristic again. And as I'll explain in a moment, this will give you W plus. And once you have W minus and W plus on the shock, this will give you the jump of W. And the way this story works is that once you have the jump of W, you're going to create vorticity, sorry, you're going to create entropy. Sorry, you're going to create entropy and the subdominant Riemann variable based on jump conditions. So, let me explain how this works. So, as I said, first you have that the pre-shock W naught is carried forward to the shock curve by eta of x, t. And I'll explain on the next slide that you get that the jump of w scales like t to the one-half. Fleeting order, it's like t to the one-half. t is time. T is time. So at time zero, there is no jump, and then you instantaneously form a jump. Now, there are three Rankine-Hugoniat jump conditions. One jump condition is used to compute the shock speed. This leaves you with two remaining jump conditions, and you use those to form a coupled system of sixth-order polynomial equations, which give you a coupled system of equations for Z minus, which is the subdominant Riemann variable. Which is the subdominant Riemann variable just to the left of the shock, and this weird variable E minus, which is the exponential of the entropy minus one. So you have these two coupled sixth-order polynomials. And now what happens is that the lax entropy conditions allow you to select the correct root. So there are many roots, but there's only one correct root. And when you select this correct root, it tells you that Z minus goes. That Z minus goes like the jump of W cubed, and K minus also goes like the jump of W cubed, but with very precise information of what the leading order coefficient is actually like. So remember, the jump of W went like t to the one half. So k minus is like the jump of w cubed. And you see that on the right of the shock, k plus is zero, as I'll explain in a moment. It was chosen to be such. It was chosen to be such, but then you're instantaneously producing entropy with exactly this rate, and then z minus isn't negative something, t to the three halves, for the same reason. So even though I took z and k to be zero in this, come on. So there's some lag here, so just give me a second. So remember, here, k was zero. Remember, here K was zero and Z was zero, but then they, because of the jump in W, K is instantly produced here at the shock, as is Z. I'll say more about this in a moment. Okay, come on. Okay, so here's the basic behavior. So you're given W down here. So here you're given. Down here. So here you're given W naught, which is the pre-shock. And as I keep saying, a label X is being carried into the shock by this three characteristic. And it turns out that this three characteristic eta minus a Burger's type characteristic, their difference is very small. And this allows us to use almost exact formulas for some. Exact formulas for some particular information for certain upper and lower bounds. And in particular, what it tells you is that if you're at some point which is either on the shock or very close to the shock, and you take A to inverse, you follow it back until you get to your label, your label. Oops. Let's try that again. This is the first time I'm using this system, which is why it's not working. Using this system, which is why it's not working so well. Okay, so if you're somewhere very close to very close to the shock and you want to follow the characteristic back to a label, you're going to arrive at t to the three halves. And you get this from this particular lower bound. And if you're very close to the blue curve and you follow the characteristic back, you're going to arrive somewhere order t. Now, the fact that you're, when you're at the shock, the fact that When you're at the shock, the fact that you're arriving at a label t to the three halves, and because the pre-shock had this holder c one-third exponent, that's the reason that w minus on the left is going like some constant kappa minus t to the one-half. And then on the right, it's going like some constant kappa plus t to the one-half. And that's why the jump of w is going like t to the one-half. t to the one-half. Now, what about this object here? So let me explain this. So here we are in this interesting region. Let me talk maybe about the non-interesting region. So here we are at time zero, k0 is zero. So I'm going to follow, I'm going to take some label x. Label X and I'm going to follow the blue characteristic until I hit the shock. Now it's just being transported up here. So if I was, if K0 was zero here, it's staying zero here. So K plus is also zero. Now, what about K minus? Well, K minus at the shock. Is going like jump in W cubed, which is going like t to the three halves. Now, inside of this interesting yellow region, k is just transported. So what does that mean? Remember that partial s of phi t was the characteristic associated with lambda two. 2. So, what this means is that partial t of k composed, sorry, partial s of k composed with phi t is equal to zero. And remember, we had this final condition that phi t at theta comma t was equal to theta. So if we integrate this equation, we see that k at theta comma t, so here we are at theta comma t, and we're following this. And we're following this down until we hit this particular point on the shock curve. So this is just equal to k minus evaluated at s at tau. Tau is this time where you intersect the shock curve. Tau. And this is going like tau to the three halves. Now it turns out that you can show that tau of theta, t. Tau of theta, t scales like 3 over kappa, the distance of theta to this blue curve here. So this tells you that k of theta comma t is going like the distance to this blue curve. So that explains this object here. And then similarly, Z is not transported. There's a more complicated formula, but nevertheless, you can still show this. So that's the behavior of those quantities. Now, what about the first derivative? So, again, because we know that this Because we know that partial theta w goes roughly like the derivative of the pre-shock times the inverse of the derivative of the three characteristic. We can actually have, we have really good upper and lower bounds for this object. And what this is basically telling us is that the derivative of theta is blowing up like one over t as Blowing up like one over t as it converges towards the point shock. But this is this is kind of interesting. If you look at this picture, what it's telling you is that the only singularity is occurring at the pre-shock, and that if you're for any positive t, from the left, the slope is bounded, and from the right, the slope is bounded. And as you move down to t equals zero, it's only at the pre-shock that you have this x to the This x to the minus theta to the minus two-thirds type of blow-up. But you see from this particular bound that the derivative is actually smooth from the left and the right as soon as you're above the pre-shock. Now, again, the partial theta z is going like the distance to the green characteristic to the power one half. Partial theta k is going like the distance to the blue characteristic to the power one half. Blue characteristic to the power one-half. And I can tell you a little bit about that. So if you differentiate this formula here, so differentiate in space. You have partial theta k composed with the characteristic phi t times partial theta phi t is equal to. Is equal to zero. So this is telling you that partial theta k at this particular point here is equal to partial theta k evaluated on the shock at this point where the blue characteristic hits the red shock curve. So this is s of tau comma tau times partial theta phi t. theta phi t at s of tau comma tau. Now what you want to do is you want to write this in terms of the object you know, which is kappa minus which is just a function of tau of tau with a dot which is just d dt and you can do this by using the fact that well I want Well, the fact that characteristics are transverse to each other. So, what you basically get is s dot minus lambda 2 times partial theta phi t evaluated s of tau comma t. And it turns out that this has an explicit formula. And the derivative of this characteristic essentially goes like the rescaled sound speed at theta, t. At theta, t divided by c composed with the characteristic. And this is roughly order one. So this object here, since kappa, since k of tau was going like tau to the three halves, this is going like tau to the one half, which is like the distance from the blue curve to the power one half. And that sort of expands. And that sort of explains this estimate here. And again, the estimate for theta is the same. How are such bounds obtained with derivative loss? Maybe I won't say too much about that. That's not so interesting. Let me sort of get to the punchline of the talk. Maybe I will say one thing about this. So, one of the key ideas in our analysis is that you have That you have these different variables which are naturally associated with different characteristics. And one of the really nice tricks, if you will, in this analysis is to force variables to move along the wrong characteristic. So, for example, here in this particular formula, you see that W is moving along the fast three character. Moving along the fast three characteristic, and it's being forced by a derivative of entropy. Now, the fast characteristic is W plus one-third Z. The middle characteristic is two-thirds W plus two-thirds Z. And if you look at what the transport along the lambda two characteristic is, this is the exact equation for K. But if you force K to be transported by the three characteristic, you get an error. And the error, Error. And the error is exactly two-thirds the sound speed c times partial theta k. Now here, the full error is 1 sixth c squared partial theta k. So if you multiply this equation by 1 fourth c, this right-hand side is this right-hand side. And the beauty of this is that you can replace this ugly derivative. This ugly derivative with a transport structure. And when you write this along the three characteristic, you see that you have partial TW composed with eta here. And here what was a derivative becomes partial TK composed with eta. Now, if you differentiate in space and you compute the time derivative with this sound speed, you get this really nice formula for the first derivative. And this has no derivative loss. And this has no derivative loss. And what it's telling you is that there's a correct variable that you should be using. And the correct variable is a combination of the dominant Riemann variable and the derivative of entropy. So that's all I want to say about that. Now for second derivatives. So this is where the story starts to become interesting. So first, the first derivatives are sort of interesting because these bounds on derivatives. These derivatives, these bounds on derivatives are coming from the pre-shock. So, once you know the behavior of the pre-shock, you can right away see what the bounds on the first derivatives are. And remember that this behavior is coming from the solution of the sixth order polynomials, which is using the lax entropy to select the correct root. Now, once you have these bounds in this class of solutions that satisfy these first derivative bounds, you First derivative bounds, you have uniqueness. So we know that in general, in two dimensions, entropy conditions aren't enough to establish unique solutions by results of Delelis and his group. But if you know the pre-shock and you know the information about how that is behaving, then this allows you to establish a class of solutions in which you have uniqueness. But these first derivative bounds aren't. These first derivative bounds aren't enough to see the other singular structures in this problem. So, for that, you have to go to the second derivative bounds. And the easiest way of saying this is pictorially. So, let me describe what's happening with second derivatives of w. So, here y is theta. So, what's happening here is that in this interesting region between the shock and this blue curve, you see that. Curve, you see that the second derivative of y is blowing up like the distance to this blue curve to the power minus one half, and it's also blowing up as it's approaching the pre-shock here, like t to the minus five over two. In this region here, it's just t to the minus five over two, and in this region to the left of this blue curve, it's just t to the minus five over two. Now, the second, the subdominant Riemann variables is. The subdominant Riemann variables is very interesting because it's zero here, then it jumps like t to the three halves here, then it forms a cusp here, then it's smooth here, and then it forms a cusp here, and then it's zero here. And then the entropy is kind of interesting again. It's zero here, it jumps like t to the three halves, it forms a cusp, one-sided cusp on the other side. A cusp, one-sided cusp on the blue curve, and then at zero here again. And then to sort of highlight the two-dimensionality of the problem, here the remember A is like the radial velocity. Even the radial velocity, its second derivative is actually forming, you know, it has very singular behavior. So it's not quite as, it really has this two-dimensionality to it, and there's vorticity in this problem. To it, and there's vorticity in this problem. So, if you open up volume six of Landau Lift Ships, so Theo actually found this, I think this goes back to the 40s. So, going way back to then, they already knew about these weak discontinuities. They just didn't know exactly what they were. They knew that they were the sort of surfaces of discontinuity where the solutions themselves didn't jump. themselves didn't jump, but either their first or second or some derivative behaved in a funny way. And so even in one dimension, even in one space dimension, this was not known. And I'll conclude by just showing you the picture that explains what exactly happens in this particular problem. So here you are at initial data. So you're starting out with smooth initial data. And again, Smooth initial data, and again, the red curve is W and the orange curve is A. So you're starting out with W, which has this maximal negative slope at this point, and it's non-degenerate. K and Z are zero. A is something nice. Doesn't really matter what it is. Then here we are at the pre-shock. So here we are at the pre-oops. Here's the pre-shock. So here you form this C1 third cusp for W, and A, the derivative of A is still well behaved. And it's only when you take its first derivative that its first derivative is C one third. So this is basically saying that A is C one one third. One-third. So on the left is the function, and on the right is the set of derivatives. Okay, so now you go past the pre-shock and you go to the development phase. And now you see what happens. So this C1 third solution instantaneously opens up and becomes a discontinuity. And this jump grows like t to the one-half. Jump grows like t to the one-half, but it's well-behaved to the left and to the right. In other words, the slopes are finite from the left and to the right. On the other hand, the blue curve denotes entropy. So it's zero to the right, then it jumps like t to the three halves, then it comes down in this t to the three halves kind of way, and then it's zero. And then the again, the z is doing the same sort of thing. Again, the z is doing the same sort of thing. It's zero here, then it becomes minus t to the three halves. It sort of does something funny as it approaches this particular characteristic, and then it does something funny as it approaches here. And what's funny is this. So, oops. Let's try that again. Okay, so it's really small. Can I make it bigger? Yes, it's a big one. Okay, so this is basically the picture. So here, this is the first derivative. So you see that you have, oh, I guess I have to use this. So you have this jump in W, then you have this one-sided cusp, then entropy, zero here, a jump, then this one-sided cusp. Then Z is sort of the most interesting object, zero. Interesting object, zero, then a jump, then a one-sided cusp, then a one-sided cusp, then zero again. And even A does something kind of interesting near the blue curve. So what's interesting is when you return to physical variables, what you see is that the second derivative of velocity is well behaved across here, which is why we call this a contact discontinuity. And the flow of the fluid is sort of in the reverse direction, which is why we call this. Direction, which is why we call this a weak rarefaction discontinuity. So the punchline basically is that you have three simultaneous curves of discontinuity developing. These are called weak discontinuities, although in some sense they're stronger in terms of some derivatives than the behavior of derivative near the shock. Okay, so let me finish here. Thank you very much. Oops. Oops. Thank you. Um and any questions for Steve?
