All right, so I'd like to thank Alexandra and Jay, William and Veronica for putting together this workshop. It'd been wonderful to be actually all together, a lot of people I really enjoyed reconnecting with. But this virtual format, I appreciate very much for helping us communicate. You very much for helping us communicate in these times. So, the work I will talk about is joint work with two former graduate students, Abhishek Chowdhury and Yushan Bung. One is now at ECO Genetics in Iceland, and Yushan is at SUNY Stony Brook. All right, so we've seen a few examples already, and we'll see more of intracellular transport. You're trying to move. You're trying to move cargo through a cell or neuron. The motors are moving on microtubules, and there's attachment and the detachment from them. And this was a critical feature, particularly in William Holmes' talk, as I recall. And so here's the question that I'm trying to tackle and coming at it from a mathematical perspective and trying to make contact with experiments. Of make contact with experiments is how do you parametriz attachment rates in models, right? So, detachment, and this is something Will Hancock has been emphasizing in recent work, is that there's pretty well-established ways to measure detachment rates of molecular motors using optical trap techniques or other ways. How much force you apply, what's the rate that they detach. But you know, it's a little bit more awkward to try to measure a catchment race because it's like, how are you going to control the motors to rain down in a controlled way on the microtubule, unless you do it in solution, which you can do, but that's not really how they're attaching in when they're functioning, right? Maybe they're tethered to a cargo already, that's already tethered by another motor to the microtubule. So, you know, there's these parameters that float around. There's these parameters that float around the literature that, if you examine them, it's not entirely clear. I'm talking about the older literature, you know, how that works. So anyway, we wanted to try to create a, you know, some sort of a quantitative framework for trying to think about attachment rates to motors with the hope that perhaps this could be used eventually as a basis for trying to parametrize how attachment rates of motors depend on the various On the various features involved in the environment. And so, in particular, we want to look at the effects of cargo size and possible fluid medium. And depending on whether you're doing in vitro or vivo experiments, you have lipid versus rigid cargos. And these questions have been studied by simulations, and Stephen Grossman, in particular, has done some great Has been done some great analyses along these lines. And so, what I'm trying to do is a complement to that, which is to try to use analytical approaches and just see what we can come up with. So, there are some experiments that endeavor to measure attachment rates that I'm aware of are listed here. Here, and I'm going to reference them as I go along. You know, ideally, I'm trying to make the mathematical theory connect to these, and this you'll see is only partially successful. And the three kinds of experiments that we'll be thinking about. So, one is sort of the most kind of very controlled. You have an optical trap with a cargo, you have Tenace One bound to the cargo, you have one. One bound of the cargo, you have one microtubule, and you're measuring repeated reattachment detachment events, and you're trying to infer a detachment rate from that. So, then, well, Hancock has done a couple of studies on this recently. One is where he had a DNA with Jing Chu and Keith, had a DNA scaffold with two motors attached to it, and then you can study when one of the motors is attached, how long does it take for the second motor to reattach. For the second motor to reattach, and then you can infer the attachment rates from that. And then, third, and this is what we'll talk about, I believe, on Thursday, is to have a two-dimensional lipid membrane where you've got kinesium-1 motors embedded in that. Then you've got microtubules floating on top of it, like in a gliding assay, and you're looking at attachment rates by looking at accumulation of the kinesin one motors in the regions of the microtubules. In the regions of the microtubules. So we're trying to connect our mathematical theory to these kinds of experiments. The problem is, the mathematical theory depends on things that seem really hard to measure. So we'll see as we go how this works. All right, so I'm going to start with some mathematical playing around. So here is the abstract image to think about as I develop the mathematical theory. I'm going to think about microtubule networks similar to what was just discussed by Veronica and Melissa, a very orderly parallel microtubule network. I'm not concerned about polarity here, because I'm just looking at attachment and not what happens while the motor is attached. And okay, so the density of micropubles here is kind of ridiculous. But anyway, mathematically, this is what the model is doing. I'm doing a simplification. I'm doing a simplification for the presentation, which is to do a kind of a fake two-dimensional approximation to the problem. So, you know, really, of course, the motor and cargo is moving three-dimensionally through the axon or whatever. I'm imagining projecting everything down to a transverse two-dimensional plane, and I'm neglecting sort of the third dimensional here, right? And so the main reason I do that is because, you know, three-dimensional rotation. Three-dimensional rotation is a little bit messy to write down mathematically, so two-dimensional rotation is very nice. So, for the purposes of presentation, I'm going to be looking at this attachment problem in a two-dimensional cross-section, which basically looks like this. You have a motor particle, you have a cargo particle. The motor particle is a point particle. The cargo particle has finite size, it moves, and it rotates. And then there's a tether. And then there's a tether, there is an attachment point, which I'll call an anchorage point. There's an anchorage point where the motor kale is attached to the cargo. And depending on whether the surface of the cargo is rigid or a lipid membrane, this anchorage point will either rigidly move with the cargo rotation or be able to pull through the lipid membrane on the surface. So there's going to be a tether force. So there's going to be a teller force here. I've got microtubules. They have a certain size. They have a certain spacing between them. So even though I'm presenting this in terms of a periodic array, almost all the mathematical results will carry over in a limit where the spacing is very large. So if you just have one microtubule, then most of our mathematical theory will be applicable to that for reasons that will hopefully become clear as we go along. Become clearer as you go along. It turns out that actually the theory can be worked out in three dimensions. You just get more complicated formulas. And one of the points of trying to do this exercise was to try to get nice formulas. And so if they get really nasty multiple integrals, it's a little bit questionable about how useful they are. So that's why I'm not emphasizing that too much. So I'll show you the two-dimensional formulas, but there are three-dimensional versions. There are three-dimensional versions. All right, so here's how we're modeling the various agents here, or entities, I should say. So, the molecular motor, we're going to have some over-damped stochastic dynamics. It has an effective friction constant based on its size, and it can reattach when it makes contact with the microtubule. But I don't, it's not just a pure first passage time. I allow there to be a finite reactivity in the a finite reactivity, meaning the motor can bounce off the microtubule and the higher the reactivity, the more likely it is to attach when it bumps into it physically. So if you wanted to be completely attached on first encounter, that would just be sending the reactivity to infinity. And this is just the term when you write down the flux formulation. The reactivity is what you use to balance the diffusive flux. What you use to balance the diffusive flux against Ka times density to determine how well the diffusive flux goes through into the microtubule surface rather than getting bounced off it. The cargo is going to be a rigid sphere of certain radius. It also undergoes overdamped stochastic dynamics, both translationally and rotationally, with certain prescribed friction coefficients. The motor cargo tether is going to have a, in general, nonlinear force model, which I'll show you. Force model, which I'll show you next, and the micropubile network would just take to be a periodic array of cylinders with a prescribed radius and spacing. All right, so in some notation that will appear later, we have just a general force model for the tether. We write down its potential. I forgot the minus sign. And then the, and this is just a vectorial form. So those are going to be everything we can do for general. General nonlinear forces, but just for illustration, so the formulas are more concrete. I will largely illustrate one or both of these models. One is the simplest one, which is just have a linear spring with zero rust length. That's not very realistic, but it's mathematically nice. The more realistic model that's used in a lot of simulation models, for example, for motor cargo systems, there's a cable model where you have no compression. Where we have no compression, sort of no tension or compression if the tether is shorter than some of what might be sort of its natural contour length. And then if you try to stretch it beyond that, then there's going to be winder resistance. So that's going to be our model here, and that's just expressed by this force function. Okay, so if you want to just see what the mathematical equations look like, it's not super important, but they look sort of like, you know, here's the motor equation, it looks like a Langevin. Motor equation. It looks like a Langevin equation, but with a non-linear drift because you have a non-linear force. And it's just looking at the displacement between the motor position. What's this? Z is the center of mass of the cargo. R hat is the unit vector pointing to the anchorage point. So Z plus Rho C R hat is just where the anchorage point is. So you get a force based on that. You get thermal noise with the usual fluctuation dissipation relation. Cargo center mass. Cargo center of mass, similarly, and then this is just expressing how the carver rotates in terms of the torque and again thermal noise for rotation. The big thing I'm missing here is I don't have spherical interactions. So if you put in spherical interactions, the math theory is kind of hopeless as far as I can tell. So we're going to have to think about situations where spherical interactions aren't important, otherwise, whatever I'm going to say is. Otherwise, whatever I'm going to say is nonsense. So, in particular, if I actually was trying to stimulate what I drew here, I beg a little bit dumb. If the tether length is comparable or large, particularly to the microbiographic spacing, obviously there's going to be entanglements that I'm not capturing. So, if the cargo is small compared to the tether length, then I'm also going to have problems with steric effects. So, we can't put in steric effects for the cargo bouncing off the microtubule. That's not too hard, and that's not a big effect. Doesn't that's not a big effect. But most people, when they're doing simulation models, are more concerned about spheric effects with the tether, and so we can't handle that. So, this is for a rigid surface. There's just one change if you have a lipid membrane, and that is that you change the friction coefficient of the rotation. And it looks like, well, they just change the numbers, but the important thing is that if the friction coefficient for moving an anchorage point through a limited benefit, Removing an anchorage point through a limpid membrane is going to be a lot smaller than if when I pull on the anchorage point, I have to rotate the whole cargo. So, this is going to be important in what follows because the analysis we'll do is dependent on the relative sizes of the physical parameters. All right. So here's a math game that we're playing, and so several people in this workshop have contributed to. Contributed to and used this framework in various years and moved on to better things. And so I'm going through my phase. So, you know, for example, Paul and Sam and Jay and Dan have all done some neat work in this area that was pioneered by Matt Ward. And Sam and Jay were particularly helpful when we were at the Newton Institute to help org me into figuring out how this framework works. And so the basic idea is we're going to take idea is we're going to take, we're going to assume that the microtubule radius is small compared to the spacing between the microtubules. So the microtubules look thin relative to how they're spaced. If you do that, you're in the framework of something that's called a small target framework where essentially you can take the, you can think about the absolute limit where the microcubles are so thin they can never be found and then that problem is not too hard to solve. And then that problem is not too hard to solve about what's going on with the system, just relaxes to stationary distribution. So then they say, well, okay, the electric cubiles are there, but they're small, and it's going to take a while, like a long time, for the motor to find it. And so on that basis, you do an asymptotic analysis for writing down the associated backward Polmogoriff equation. If you know what a Falker-Plack equation is, it's just the adjoint of it. And so this is a five-dimensional. Of it. And so this is a five-dimensional PDE because you have five stochastic variables. But essentially, what it boils down to is you compute a quasi-stationary distribution away from the target, you solve an inner problem near the target, you match them, and you don't actually do this, but it's as if from that mass solution you're computing the flux of probability through the surface of the microtubule, and from that you get the mean first passage time. The mean first passage time. But you do this in the backward formal lesson for those who understand what happens. Now, you're going to see logarithms will appear. And those of you who know this business, because you're essentially solving elliptic type problem, you know, we're like, oh, in two dimensions, you get logarithms. In three dimensions, you get one over R and so forth. So why do we get logarithms if we're in five dimensions? The answer is because if you think about the five dimensions, the microtubule is small in two dimensions. In two dimensions and not small in the other three. So, the Carter rotation, for example, there's no smallness in that direction. So, that's why in the mathematics it works that we get logarithms. All right, so let's now start talking about what the results look like. Let me look at my time. All right, so if you just plug in the problem into the small target calculation framework, this is what you get. Framework. This is what you get. And it's a bit disappointing because the cargo has no influence on it. And I'm going to get to that in a minute. This is exactly the same result you would get if you just had a motor particle. So you just cut the cargo away. You just have the motor particle. It's diffusing and bumping into microtubules and possibly attaching to them, right? So, okay, so that's crazy, but let's just do this as a baseline. So what's happening here is what appears in the bracket, so let me do this. What appears in the bracket, so let me do this first. The error in this approximation is logarithmically small, which means not that small. And this is just fundamental to the feature of when you're doing two-dimensional small target calculations. If you can solve for the greens function of your problem, then you can re-sum these log terms and get a better error. But I don't know the greens function for my five-dimensional PDE, so I can't get rid of this. I'll show you quickly some numerical computers. I'll show you quite basic numerical comparisons. It seems like this isn't horrible in practice, but a little bit unsatisfying. Anyway, this bracket is just going to appear in all of our results. So let's just understand what's going on there. So this term would be how the mean first passage time would depend if you were diffusion dominated, right? So it's inversely proportional to the diffusivity. And then there's a log term. What's this log term? So it's logarithmic. Log term. So it's logarithmic in the ratio of the distance of the motor from the center of the microtubule to the size of the microtubule. And all this is doing is saying, if the motor is far away, then it's going to have some time for it to explore and find the microtubule. But if I start a few microtubule radii away, like maybe it just recently detached, then my mean first passage time is going to be smaller because I have some probability to reattach right away before like wandering off and having to do a big Before wandering off and having to do a big exploration. So, this logarithmic factor just tells you the reduction in meat first passage time as you happen to start close to the micromaterial. All right, so well, why does the, oh sorry, the second term is if your reaction dominate, right? So then this term would contribute if the, you know, you're easily can bump into a vector to blue many times and you're waiting for it to react. The meaning that's going to change in the formulas that follow is going to be the pre-factor of this, right? So right now, Factor of this, right? So right now, the pre-factor is the spacing of the microtubules because this is the same thing as that the motor is just exploring space. So the farther apart the microtubules are spaced, the longer time it's going to take to attach. So the mathematical problem that's happening here is when you do have some products and you say the microtubules are really thin, you're assuming that's the smallest parameter in the problem. But there's another small parameter in the problem, which is the ratio of the diffusivity of the carbon. Of the diffusivity of the cargo to the molecular motor. The cargo is typically maybe 10 times or more bigger than the hydrodynamic radius of the motor. And so the theory doesn't sort of take that into account. And if you sort of go through and say, what do I need self-consistently for the theory to be true? It's that this log factor is the log of the ratio of the microtubule spacing to a microtubular radius should be large compared to the ratio of the motor and cargo diffusivity. Motor and carbon diffusivity, and that's not terribly plausible. So, what you can do is you can do a different asymptotic calculation, which is the other extreme, which is where we reverse this inequality and say, okay, let's suppose that the small parameter governing the ratio of the motor and cargo diffusivity is a lot smaller than this logarithm of the microtubule spacing, but this is also small. So now I have two small parameters, but I'm going to reverse the which one's bigger, or which one is smaller than the other one. Or which one is smaller than the other one? So we call that frozen cargo because, in that limit, you basically treat the cargo as a mobile because if you reverse that inequality, you're assuming the motor will attach faster than the cargo has time to move. So that only works, but that's true. So, what happens if you make that approximation? So, if a treato cargo is fixed, that means, so both the rotation. Fixed, that means so both the rotation and the translation is about the same time scale. So I'm going to fix the anchorage point at a certain distance for the nearest microtubule center. Then I'm LS to some concept of the natural length of the tether under thermal fluctuations and quasi-equilibrium. And lambda is the ratio of that to the microtubule spacing. So lambda bigger than one means steric effects are important and anything I have to say is garbage. So I'm mostly going to present results. So I'm mostly going to present results for the case where lambda is small, but I can, we also have the result where lambda is order one, it's just more complicated. Okay, so what happens is you get the same factor as before. You get a length scale squared, but now it's nothing more of the cubio spacing squared. It's more or less a length scale of the tether squared, which makes sense because now the motor search space is governed by the tether. Space is governed by the tether, not by the, you know, just floating around the cargo and just exploring all space. And then the other factor that you get is you get a sort of Arrhenius factor, which is that the time to attach is going to be exponentially slow relative to the energy required to stretch the tether from the anchorage point to the nearest microtubule relative to thermal energy. See, if you have to make a large stretch relative to the energy, Stretch relative to thermal energy, then it's going to, you know, it's going to be a rare event to be able to stretch a tether that far and find the microtubule. So if lambda is over 1, this exponential factor gets replaced by a harmonic sum over neighbors. So if you're equally far from four neighbors, you basically get this cut by a factor of four and so forth. Now, this is only self-consistent if this formula is actually slow. Sorry, if this formula, if this time is actually fast. If this time is actually fast compared to the time it takes for the cargo to either rotate away or move a significant distance. And so you can calculate how close do I have to be to the microtubule for that frozen power approximation to be valid. And so you can do a calculation which basically says what you would sort of intuitively think that you have to be about the stretch length, the natural stretch length of the spring away from the microtubule with some From the microtubule with some logarithmic factors that are a little bit hard to interpret. But if you're farther away than that, then what do you do? So if my anchorage point is far away from any microtubule, then the first attachment time is governed by how long does it take for the anchorage point through cargo dynamics to get within the range of a microtubule to which it can attach on a reasonable time scale. So you're largely governed in that regime by the In that regime, by the carloid dynamics moving the anchorage point closer to a micro tube build. Hey, Pete, you need to wrap up. Yep, we'll do. How much time do I have? Well, you have seven minutes left in questions. If you want questions, you should. Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, seven minutes left and then good. That's my plan. Okay. That's what's bad. Okay. Good. Okay. So here we go. Okay. So yeah, let me. This is just doing numerical comparisons of the theory and numerical simulations. Turns out the fast, sort of the framework we had, you know, the fast cargo theory seemed to work better. Frozen cargo theory works better if you make the cargo larger. But this all depends on exactly where the cargo is. So just roughly speaking, the systems are at least reasonable. This says things are at least reasonable from the math standpoint. So, let me try to talk a bit about connections with potential experiments in real-world engineering systems. So, Arnold McKeeson, I talked to at the APS meeting last spring, he's working on a system where you've got motor cargo systems going through a flow, some sort of a controlled flow, and they're attaching and detaching. Controlled flow, and they're attaching and detaching from these microtubule carpets. And so, one thing he mentioned to me was: well, okay, it's a little bit hard to know what attachment rate to use for these motor cargo systems. And one thing I wonder is with a sort of frozen cargo approximation, perhaps one could parametrize, such as having a constant catchment rate like when you're within a zone. Got it. And so with, right. And so what you could imagine. Right, and so what you could imagine doing is having, instead of just can't attach, you can't attach a zone behavior, you could imagine having a rate that depends on how far the particle is from the surface, and that rate would increase exponentially according to the readiness factor as you approach the surface. Okay. So trying to navigate contact. So if I try to now make contact with the first of experiments that was in an optical trap, so suppose now we just freeze the center of mass of the cargo, but the cargo can rotate, and it's a rigid surface. So we can redo the calculation for that case. And again, we can do the case where the attachment time is fast relative to a card rotation or vice versa. So if the rotation is fast, then you get this kind of Fast, then you get this kind of a formula. Now, exponential factor depends on this is essentially the distance between the closest point of the cargo and the microtubule relative to the spring length. That's for the linear model. You get some pre-factors that depend on the cargo radius and the distance of the cargo from the microtubule. You can do the opposite regime. So, frozen cargo doesn't really care about what's going on with the cargo if it's frozen, except when the attachment. Except when the attachment point is too far. So, in the work from June Albert's lab, they kind of had this concept of there's a near zone where you can attach relatively quickly, and then there's the far zone where it's sort of, you know, not really possible to attach from. So we can use our critical distance from the previous theory to define the region of the cargo in the optical trap from which it catched then tap. Optical trap from which attach then happens more quickly than the cargo can rotate. But if you're farther away from the microtubule than that, then you have to wait for the cargo to rotate you into reasonable range of the microtubule. And then this is related to the calculation that was done in that paper. And you can just, you get it here. And so if we try to compare our formulas to their experiments, we can make context. We can make contact with their theoretical model involving a near and a far zone and just make things a little more precise in terms of having a reattachment rate that depends continuously on where you are on the surface of the cargo rather than just having a near and a far zone. But qualitatively, it's quite similar. I can't do quantitative comparisons because I don't know what the distance of the cargo is from the microtubule. They do report a Report an on rate from the near zone. Now, this is a large on rate, so you know, this is I'm just reporting what they infer from their experiments. If I try to relate that as the attachment time from, in our model, when the anchorage point is as close as possible to the microtubule and it's not that far, then I can infer this reactivity from this on rate. And the point is that I wonder whether this on rate I wonder whether this on rate, you know, how universal is it? Because if someone did a different experiment and maybe the distance from the, you know, the nearest or the cargo or the microtubule is a little bit farther away or a little bit closer than in this experiment, which would be a different K-on. The reactivity is a little bit more, by design in the model, universal. It just depends on very local activity. But of course, it's harder to infer from experiments. But this is just a suggestion. Suggestion. Okay, so we can do lipid membrane calculations if you allow the anchorage point to move. Even if we freeze the cargo, the lipid membrane, we allow the anchorage point to be mobile. And so then you get a different formula that's qualitatively similar with a different pre-factor. And so if you try to here make contact with Will's experiment, and I'll talk about. With Will's experiment. Now, he'll talk about this, I believe, on Thursday with a flat-lipid membrane with a sort of lighting assay configuration. Then this, in principle, we could try to correlate with our results if we had a frozen cargo, right? So lipid membranes just there with a very, very large radius and a small gap between the microtubule and the surface of the cargo. The problem is that the experiment... The problem is that the experiments, the problem from the model comparison standpoint, is the experiments have to do with you've got many motors and you're looking at the rate at which they attach to the microtubules and our calculation is based on having one motor that's wandering around and how long does it take for this motor starting here to attach to a microtubule. So if I'm going to do that calculation in this framework, I need to know a little bit more about how the microtubules are, where they are, and of course there are more. Where they are, and of course, they're more disordered in this kind of a flighting assay. All right, so very quickly, and just going to breeze through this because it's basically just similar ideas. We've also extended this work to the case where you have a cargo with two motors attached to it. One motor is already attached to a microtubule and the other one is, you know, how long does it take for the second one to attach? Does it get attached to the same microtubule or a different microtubule? And we can do this for general nonlinear forces, but the formulas get really horrible unless the other force is linear. So I'm just going to show you those formulas for now. So we can, again, you can get similar formulas. The key thing is that for rigid cargo, you get an exponential factor dependent on the distance between the attachment points of the two motors to the cargo. For liquid membrane case, you don't get that kind of a factor, you just get some length scale scale. Factory, you just get some length scales here, and in a linear model, you just get a length scale that has to do with the effective combined length of the two motors. And then I tried to think about relating this to some studies by Will Hancock, a group with Keith and Kingshu, where they measured the reattachment rates of kinesin 1 and kinesin 2, and the other motor was already astromicrotubule. What they found is that these reattachment rates are a lot slower than you would expect. A lot slower than you would expect from bulk solution attachment rates. And it's a little bit hard to relate. I mean, their DNA scaffold is not a rigid spherical cargo, and linear spring model is garbage. But yeah, if we just try anyway to relate our results to their model, is it possible that we can explain why the reattachment rate appears to be slowed down? Does this exponential factor possibly explain it? Explain it? Well, unfortunately, probably not because the distance between detachment points on the scaffold are about 40 nanometers. The length scale to tether is about 80 nanometers, so that factor won't be that huge. And of course, the DNA scaffold is some flexibility, so that's only going to make things worse. So I don't think that if I redid this calculation for DNA scaffold, it's necessarily going to help. All right, so just finishing up, we can also calculate the probability to reattach to the same microtubule versus a different. To the same microtubule versus a different microtubule to get an enhancement factor to get to the same microtubule. We can extend to three dimensions with just complicating things. And we can do general microtubule geometries if it's sparse. If your telelength is short compared to the spacing, so only the closest one is relevant. If you compare 2D and 3D results, it's not that huge a difference. So qualitatively, maybe the 2D formulas are kind of okay in 3D, I don't know. In 380, I don't know. And then I just want to acknowledge that this kind of idea of using these first passage calculations for motor attachment was done in previous work for other kinds of motor cargo systems. And essentially, what we've done is we've developed an asymptotic approach to attachment time and attachment probabilities for motors to microtubule networks. And we're basically using this well-established framework of small target time. Framework for small target calculations with the key complication being that we have to think about the role of two small parameters. One is the ratio of the microtubule size to the microtubule spacing, which is the standard small parameter. But there's also the concept that the cargo is moving more slowly than the motor, and so you need to take both those effects into account. And so we're hoping that the formulas that we're obtaining this way, it's not clear how quantitatively precise. How quantitatively precise they compare to experiments at this point, but maybe they give a framework for thinking about parametrizing motor attachment in a more beyond going, you know, having an attachment rate when you're close enough and no attachment when you're too far. So this was also, this was supported by NSF NIH and a very stimulating collaboration with John Fricks, Scott McKinley, and Will Hancock. And then I want to acknowledge also Isaac Newton Institute, where in particular Sam and Jay and I were at. Particular Santa Jade and I work at, and we have some great conversations to getting started on this. Okay, thank you, Pete. So are there any questions from the virtual folk? See any hands raised? Oh, I didn't interrupt. Yeah, you mentioned how, I mean, you get this logo. You get the slotted from the 2D search of the micro tubule to the motor to the micro tubule, right? And then, isn't there, I mean, I'll say cargo is also diffusing in a similar way. Don't you think it's a similar effect when the whole cargo motors complex reattached the micro tubule to the this to this red process? I I j just in the special view of the show, I mean, I didn't I didn't see I mean, I didn't see. You're expecting there to be some dependence on the cargo position? That's right, in a similar way that the motor magnetuble kind of time is a logarithm. So just the whole kind of motor system also gets in a dependency. So the results, so let's see. So the results basically, the true asset high. Basically, the two asymptotic limits I have. One is where you treat the cargo as moving faster than the motor. The time it takes for the cargo to move is much smaller than the time it takes the motor to attach. And so what happens is the whole motor cargo system will usually equilibrate, just like move around, and then it's like everyone will forget their initial condition unless the motor attached right away. And so that's why you don't get a dependence on the cargo position. But if you treat the cargo as moving slowly, Cargo as moving slowly relative to the time scale of motor attachment, then the cargo position does appear in the formulas, but not logarithmically. It's mostly appearing through this Arrhenius factor of where is the attachment point of the mortar to the cargo, because that stays fixed. And then basically the result will depend exponentially on how far you have to stretch to go from the anchorage point to the microtubula. Does that answer your question? Does that answer your question? I got confused about something. I'm not sure if it's related to Dimitria's questions. So you had two diffusion DM and DC for motor and carnal, but when motor is attached to carnal, is there a switch is there a switch to the slower diffusion coefficient? Like, is so is there a specific switch? It's two particles that are connected by a ceter, and then the smaller one diffuses more quickly than the larger one. Okay. Right, and they said the diffusion coefficients come from the friction constants, and then you, you know, KT over the friction constant, the cargo has a larger friction constant than the motor. So you just have like this sluggish, larger particle tender, just like, you know, walking a small dog, right? Okay. The dog has a higher diffusion. Okay. The dog is a higher diffusion than the human, right? Okay. Thank you for that analogy. Are there any other comments, particularly from the in-person people? No, I don't think we have any more. Okay, well, I think it's time for a coffee break. So you have until 10:40 mountain time, 12:40 Eastern time for me. So and just a reminder, but after the after a coffee break at the end of the second morning session, there's going to be lightning talks, so short minute talks, short three minute talks. So please stay through that. Okay, thank you. And before we go to coffee, I'll note that after lunch, I'm After lunch, I'm going to go to Inkpots for a hike. It's about 30 minutes away. It's about a seven-mile hike. It's not particularly strenuous, although there is a couple of hundred meters, I think it's maybe three or four hundred meters of elevation. It's a great hike, two waterfalls, some kind of nice ground-fed ponds at the top with a beautiful meadow. I could take three in my car. The plan would be, you know, assuming we're done with the lightning talks by 12:30, to probably Talks by 12:30. Probably meet and leave about 1:15. So, a quick lunch to make sure there's time to get back to the people to meet the folks.
