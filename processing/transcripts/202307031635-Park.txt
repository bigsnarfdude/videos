Hi everybody, my name is Corman Park and I'm a third year PhD student at Wisconsin Madison. Thank you very much for inviting me to have a talk here. So today I'm going to talk about my research work for integrative analysis on multiomic genetic and epigenomic data, including single cell high C. So as you all know 99% of our 99% of our DNA locations is non-cutting regions, and these affect the functional role of the body coding genes. But the thing is, some important non-cutting regions that regulate the genes are very far apart from the genomic distance to the target gene. But when they're wrapped inside a single cell, they're physically very close. So, in order to better understand the gene regulatory story, Regulatory story, we need to better understand the physical proximity information inside of our DNA. And that information is contained in high-C data. So we also call that data a high-C contact map, and that looks like an agency's matrix of a weighted graph. So let's take a look at how the data is obtained. So let's say we have a locus like this, where the blue locus and yellow locus are having discord contact. And the yellow locusts are having discord contact, then we can cut up these two parts and sequence these two regions and mark the corresponding entry of the contact map, the locus pair, as one. In this manner, we can obtain a full giant IC data, I see a contact map for each chromosome. So for humans, we have 23 chromosomes, and each chromosome has a contact net that looks like. A contact net that looks like this, where the darker entry denotes a higher contact level, and the yellow ones are denoting zero contact levels. So we have 23 contact matrices for the bulk I-C data. With the advent of the single-cell sequencing technology of the I-C, we now have 23 tensors, not 23 matrices. And each slice of a Slice of a high-C tensor is a contact map of one chromosome inside a cell. So for each cell, we have set some contact matrices that are stacked throughout cell indices. And you can see that the multiple tensors are sharing the cell indices. So we need to come up with a model that kind of incorporates that shared cell information. So my main objective of this project was to kind of Of this project was to kind of figure out the cell type-specific 3D genome structure. And for that proposed, I did some cell clustering and obtained some contact map of each cell type and some characteristics like topologically associated domains or AV compartments. And finally, I did some multimodal data integration, including Hi-C. And the statistical tool for that is tensor or matrix composition. So in methodological sense, I devised a joint decomposition model for the multiple tensor objects. The multiple tensor objects and derived some optimality properties for the alternate only square algorithm. And interpretation-wise, I made a unification of the estimation target of the model and the parameter of interest in this field. And therefore, the interpretation is direct and does not really require complex modification of the parameters. So, let's talk about a building block of my model, which is called as block term decomposition. So, let's assume. So let's assume that we only have one chromosome, meaning one tensor, which is an addition of the mean tensor, N, and the error tensor, E. And if we assume that the rank of this mean tensor is equal to 2, then we would have two modules, each of which looks like chicken fit. And each module contains a cell loading vector that contains the cell information that this module is capturing. And the low-side loadings A and B that contains the contact information that the module is capturing. And if you multiply those A and B, that is the contact map that this module is capturing. So, but as I mentioned, we not only have just one tensor, we have multiple tensor objects that contain the single cell information. Where the cell instances are shared across all this. are shared across all tensors. And therefore, we need to come up with a joint decomposition model for the multiple tensor objects that shares the parameters that contains the cell information shared across all the chromosomes. So as you can see from the formulation, you can see that cell loading vector C does not contain the chromosome in this. So up until here, I've been talking all about the single cell high C model T. Single cell high C modality. Now I'm going to talk about another modality that can be sequenced along with the single cell high C data, which is DNA methylation. So just to briefly talk about this, the DNA methylation is these orange particles that are attached to DNA. And when they are attached to the promoter of gene, you usually observe a repression of the gene expression level. So you can just think of DNA methylation. You can just think of DNA methylation as like jokers for those gene expression level. Fortunately, as I mentioned, we have technology to sequence DNA methylation and the high C at the same cell level. So we now have single-cell high-C tensors, which is high-C modality, and also the DNA methylation matrices that share the cell indices. For this, I needed to come up with a model that. Model that assumes that the parameter of the cell is the shared cross-modalities. So I devised a model called Muscle, which is an acronym of multiple single-cell tensors. I think it's a good name. As you can see, this celloing vector is shared across all the multi-tilts and chromosomes and types of natural matrices. So on top of that, so this is for the single-size high-sing mortality, and this is for the netylation matrices. Is for the detailation matrices. And you can see that in the formulation, the variances are different between modalities, meaning the variance parameter is not anymore ancillary to mean estimation, those M cancer and N matrix. So we relied on the assumption that the variances are proportional to each other. And then that kind of in the NLE equivalent problem of this entire model. Of this entire model, you can see that the balancing parameter exists in order to kind of balance between those functions of different modalities. So one is for the single cell heist sensors and the other is for the methylation matrix form. And you can see that the cell loading vector contains the shared information across the modalities. So let's take a look at the analysis part. I applied muscle. I apply muscle onto multiple data sets that contain single-cell high C and also DNA methylation. So these are what Muscle can provide you with. So first of all, out of the cell loading vector, one of the chicken fit things, you can gather all of them and obtain the cell loading cell clustering and also identify some cell types. Let's take a look at the case where we only have single cell high-C modality. Case where we only have single cell high-C modality first. And I'll take a look at the results. So from the cell-loving vector C, if you gather all of them throughout ranks, you can obtain one of the UMAP plots like this, where each dot represents a cell and the colors are based on ground truth cell type. And you can see that the UMAP plot of muscle is kind of, yeah, well separating the major cell types, major four cell types, where some of them were failing to do that. I applied muscle and other computational tools for single-cell high-C data set onto multiple single-cell high-C data sets and derived from a medium ranking of the cell clustering evaluation. And it seems that the Muslim is doing as good as, or sometimes better than, the other existing tools for single-cell high-C data set. So, MOSL is, it works pretty well in only single-cell high-C tensor case. Let's talk about the case where. Case. Let's talk about the case where we also have DNA methylation on top of single cell high C. So this is the cell clustering result where we only use single cell high C and apply muscle. And the one on the bottom is the one that is obtained from muscle result for both photomodality, single cell high C and DNA methylation as well. And you can see that the cell clustering from that result, the multi-modal result, is well. Result is well separating the major three cell types compared to the one with the only one modality. And the numeric evaluation also kind of ensures that the muscle application of all modalities are doing better in the cell clustering. So on top of that, if we use the cell loading vector C and the multiplication of A and B, which we call as eigen contact, A times B term, we can identify the role of each module. So for example, for the first So for example, for the first module, one module, if you take a look at the cell loading vector of that module, you can see that the values are constant throughout all the cells. Meaning, this module is capturing something about like grand mean or average of throughout all the cells. And the A times B term should be the contact level of all the cells across all the cells. For another module, if you take a look at the cell loading vector value, If you take a look at the cell loading vector value, we have exclusively positive value for one specific cell type. Meaning that A times B time, the eigen contact, should be the contact level specific to that cell type. In this manner, we can obtain cell type-specific contact pattern throughout cell types. If you only use this low-sign loading matrix A, you can obtain some contact, some characteristic of the context. Contact some characteristic of the contact pattern, which is called as a topologically associating domain, defined as DNA region that is preferentially contacting each other. So I'm not sure if you can see this. The boxes along the diagonal of the contact map, each of them is a pad, topological associated domain. You can think of them as like a cluster of loci. So out of this A matrix, if you draw a U-MAP plot and A UMAP plot and remember that that module is specific to one specific cell type. So it's cell type specific pad. So if you draw a UMAP plot where each dot represents a locus and the colors are based on the ground truth pad information obtained from the ground truth and you can see that the loci that are close to each other have similar colors, meaning the muscle is capturing the test structure in cell type-specific manner. Actually, out of using only this first column vector of this A, you can obtain a broader overview of the genome territory, which are A compartment and B compartments. So this figure is the same as the one obtained in the previous slide, but the labeling is based on the sign of the first column vector of the A. And you can see that the inner territory is A compartment, while the exterior territory is B compartment. E-color. And this is the same result, but the labeling is based on some ground through cell type-specific data from another paper. You can see that these two are matching. So I evaluated that throughout multiple cell types and multiple chromosomes, all the chromosomes. And it turned out that 70 to 80% of the log spoils are correctly called as A-compartment or B-compartment. Last but not least, I want to say that by aligning the low-side loading vector of this DNA metallation modality and using the information from the low-side loading matrix of ty-C, you can obtain some integrative analysis on this. If you recall, so A compartment generally has higher gene expression level, meaning we generally have lower methylation level, and B compartment opposite the A. V compartment opposite opposite the opposite is happening. So out of that low siloing vector of the methylation modality, if you draw the raw values of that low siloing vector here and the first column vector of the low side loading matrix called from high C modality on the middle and remember that we have two And remember that we have two types of DNA metallation matrices, and the last column is the low-sign loading vector of MCH. And you can see that these are the one in the middle is negatively associating with the ones in the corners. And generally, you see that the A compartment contains, shows lower methylation level compared to the B compartment, and the association strength is. And the association strength is cell type specific and also the methylation type specific. So just to wrap up, Muslim kind of provides you with some cell clustering based on the cell loading vector C and provides you with also the tag or AD compiler information from A, the low-sign loading matrix, and provides you with some cell type-specific contact pattern as model parameters. So these help you understand the physical process. So these help you understand the physical proximity of genome in such a specific manner and also helps you understand to integration.
