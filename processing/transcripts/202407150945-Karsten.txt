My name is Richard. I come from Acadia University on the east coast of Canada. Just before we get started with the lecture, this afternoon we're going to be doing some exercises, mostly playing with data. To do that, you're going to need your laptop. So I want to make sure everybody has a laptop that they can bring. And we're probably going to be doing most of that analysis using R. So I hope everybody has a little familiarity with R. We can also do We can also do it using other programs like Python, but the code we have is in R. So if you're going to use Python, you might have to write it yourself a little bit. I have some Python code, I think, on loading up data. One of the hardest parts of that is just getting the data loaded up. And as you jump around from different, actually, most of my code was written in MATLAB originally, except we had some engineers here. I actually prefer MATLAB, but it doesn't have all the statistical packages as easily available. Easily available. I'm going to talk about wind energy. This is going to go back a bit. I am what I would call an applied mathematician. I like to work with differential equations and mathematical models, numerical models. I don't do a lot of statistics. So I'm going to take a different approach to what we saw this morning and bring a different approach of trying to understand wind by basic physics properties. And the introduction I'm getting here is actually stolen mostly from what Adam did. Stolen mostly from what Adam did last year. He covered this all in four lectures. I'm going to try to cover it in one lecture. I don't know if I'll accomplish that. So, a lot of things are going to fly by on the screen as I do this. You don't have to, it's not an idea that you understand them all. That's not the point here. The point here is to get some, to build on a bit of physical intuition for what the wind is. Because we often lose this when we jump into the very complicated modeling we do or the complicated statistics. Modeling we do or the complicated statistics, and it just becomes a bunch of numbers. And you can approach it that way. There's nothing wrong with that, but you lose a little bit because you're not using the full amount of knowledge that you have. And the one thing I really want you to get out of this is the wind we are talking about in wind energy is the wind you experience every day. You know this. You've lived with it your whole life. You know what it's like. So when you start doing the statistics and the modeling of it, I don't want you to lose that. I don't want you to lose that. When something looks really wrong, it's probably really wrong. It doesn't make sense. You know what wind does. That's what we're trying to explain. A lot of what I'm going to talk about here is trying to just emphasize that fact, that we can go complicated model statistics and we can come back saying, this is what I experience every day. I should understand this. I'll go past the land acknowledgement. We had a land acknowledgement here for the Silicon people, the Okanagan people. Of the Okanagan peoples, I come from the land of the Mi'kmaq, and I want to acknowledge that we as well have a treaty that we share the land with the Mi'kmaq people, and we want to recognize that. So the outline is going to talk about a little introduction about wind energy and wind, very basic, assuming some of you have seen some of this before, some of you may not have seen a lot of it. Could give lots of long lectures on this. It's going to go fairly quickly just to give you the idea. This is going to go fairly quickly just to give the idea of why we're interested in wind meteorology. And then we're going to talk about planetary boundary layer dynamics, which is the planetary boundary layer as we'll emphasize over and over again. That's where we live. That's where the wind turbines are going to be. What are the basic wind dynamics? We'll try to get through all these topics. We'll see how far we get in this morning's lecture. If I need more time, I'll continue on. We're introducing in the rest of the week the ideas that we'll talk then about when these basic models sort of change or. Basic models sort of change or break down as we move to other areas. So, the second first area I'll talk about is complex domains. Like, we move away from a nice flat prairie land that we usually build wind turbines. We build them on hills and mountains. Adam's going to talk about as we move offshore. But I think we need the introduction first to understand why those other areas are different before we jump to where the difference is. And as you'll see, once we move to the more complex one, at least a complex terrain, there's only Complex one, a least complex train. There's only so much we can say to when we start to jump into what we saw more this morning of, and you just have to do the statistics of it because it's complex. Okay, so why do we want to understand this? So here's a picture of a wind turbine farm. What we're hoping to do here is we'd like to understand the resource, you know, how much wind is out, how much wind power is out there for, you know, you're going to plan a wind farm, how much power do you think you could generate, but maybe even larger than that, how much wind resources are in the province of Al. Wind resources are in the province of Alberta, the province of British Columbia, Canada, worldwide. What should we plan for? We want to understand how we might design. We want to understand the wind so we could look at designing a turbine. How big should the turbine be? What type of blades? We want to look at how we design a wind turbine farm. We're going to put a whole bunch of turbines together. How close together should they be? Where should they be positioned exactly in this farm? And we want to understand this in terms of an energy net. Once we start producing a wind turbine farm like this, Wind by a wind turbine farm like this, we'll see the wind is very variable, and therefore the energy we produce from a wind farm like this can be very variable. And how do you integrate that into a large energy picture? That's a very important idea, especially if you have an unregulated energy market, like we have, say, in Alberta or Texas and things like this, where this becomes really important. Also, a way to make a lot of money if you can understand the energy. So, as I just mentioned, that I have a form. So, as I just mentioned, that I have a former student who works in this field, and he works on this idea of predicting winds. So, I guess that's the next. How do we predict wind? How do we predict wind over different time scales? We might be looking at long time scales over the life sky around the turbine, how much wind power will there be? So, I know how much money I should invest in building that turbine because it's going to return me this much investment. But we also want to know how to predict it over very short time scales down to hours, even less than that, if we're integrating this onto a That, if we're integrating this onto a very complex energy network where we're trading off power from wind and solar and other sources, right? So, you need to know: should I fire up that gas plant in the next hour? And that's where, if you want to make money on this, that's where the big money is, because if you can predict when the wind is going to be strong or when solar energy is going to be high or low, you can trade energy futures. And like I said, my former student, that's what he works in, he works for a company that does the trading. Company that does the trading, and his job essentially is to look at predictions of wind and solar and say these seem reasonable. How much should the traders, how much, how much confidence should they have in these predictions? And if you can have a little more confidence, you can have a little better prediction, you can make money by trading the wins a little more accurately. That's only in Alberta, right? That you can do that? Yeah, he's in the US. In the U.S., the US is the main market. He works in Calgary. All the trading they do is. Calgary, all the trading they do is in the US because the Canadian market is just too small. There's not enough energy being traded in the LGBT, it's only Alberta, and it's not even the fully unregulated market like the Texas market is, which is a little crazy. But we'll see whether that comes here or not. But so, first thing on pictures of wind turbines, I assume everybody has familiarity with a wind turbine. We see them all over. With a wind turbine. We see them all over the place now. Just to give you an idea, what I want to focus here on is the size of them. This is a little cartoon, take off the web. It did from 2019 to 2035, although I think the sizes that they list for 2035 are already being built because the development here has happened extremely quickly over the last couple of decades. We went from really small, you know, not very practical wind turbines to massive machines now, especially the ones that are going offshore that produce. Going offshore that produce on, I think there is an 18-megawatt turbine out there operating now. Huge, much more power. The basic scales we're going to concentrate on is sort of the idea of the hub height, which is around, let me see, 90 meters, 130 meters, maybe up to 150 meters. 100 meters is the number I want to have in your head for the hub height of a turbine, the size of the blades, the rotor diameter varies from something around 100 meters. Varies from something around 100 meters, maybe up to 250 meters. So, again, you're looking at about a 200-meter, 100-200-meter scale for the diameter of the blades. So, that's where folks are on, because this is where we want the winds. We don't care about the winds way up there. We don't care about the winds. Well, we will actually care about the winds right on the surface, but we don't care about the winds way up high. And these are big, but I want to put these in scale yet because we. But I want to put these in scale yet because we think of them as massive. But this is a wind turbine in the middle there: 250 meters. That's one of the biggest wind turbines we can have. But we compare it to buildings. And I chose this one. I was trying to find one that put it in a Canadian context that actually had a tower from Canada on it. And it does have the CN Tower on it. And it's short. I mean, most of us, I assume all of us, have been up a building that is similar size to the large buildings over there. We've traveled somewhere, we've gone up the Sien Tower. How many people have gone up to Sien Tower? Hand tower. Trying to think what we have out west here: the Calgary Tower. That would be down here square a little more. Yeah, towers down here somewhere a little more. I think there's a really big building out west. We should put this in context of natural changes in height, right? 250 meters. Well, out here, you call that a little hill. Where I come from, we call it a mountain. Out here, you know, mountains are thousands of meters. This is tiny compared to. Is tiny compared to mountains. This is tiny, right? So that's all you get. Now, if you stay on the side, this is really big, but you've been up here. You've experienced the winds up here. You just climbed the hill and you experienced the winds at 250 meters. You've been up here. So we, again, we understand this is not a scale that we can't comprehend. It's still on a level that we can comprehend, a personal scale. So that's that's the scales we're going to talk about. We'll talk about heights about 25 meters to 250 meters. That's what we're going to be interested in. Nothing we're going to focus on. We're going to see that the winds there do are, of course, determined by other effects, namely the wind way up above, the weather. But this is where the turbine lives, and that's what we're going to talk about. So meteorology, we're going to talk about today is we're not going to do everything. We're not going to do global dynamics. Dynamics. All right, wind power. This is going to be a really quick idea of the engineering of wind power. Now, we could spend a lot of time talking about the engineering of wind power, generally how a turbine changes wind speed into power. The idea of wind power is, let's see, negative to the kinetic energy in the wind, but power is in the invection of that kinetic energy. So if we look at a formula for that, we get the kinetic energy, which is proportional to. get the kinetic energy which is proportional to the speed squared we multiply by the speed that is being conducted by s and then we multiply by that some over some area that would be the area of those turbines and those are becoming very large and we get a formula that we can say this is the power that's in the wind that the turbine has access to right so when we're looking at resources what is the resource this is the kind of number we would calculate independent of what turbine you're actually going to put in there and the key thing here And the key thing here is this S cubed. It goes like the speed cube, which means it increases very rapidly as you increase the wind speed. And that's why we focus on larger wind speeds. It doesn't make sense to build a turbine for wind speeds that are on the order of like two, three meters a second. When you double that or triple that, the amount of power, you double it, the amount of power goes up by a factor of eight. You triple it. Power goes up by a factor of eight. If you triple it, the amount of power goes up by a factor of 27. And so rapidly your power goes up. So we can't, you know, we don't talk about wind energy in areas where the wind is really linked. It just doesn't make a lot of sense. We have to have fairly strong winds. And that makes a difference for how we looked at the meteorology, right? Eventually, we're going to just say, I don't care about low winds. I care about high winds. That's what I care about. That's where I'm going to build the wind turbines. And in reality, the And in reality, we can't get all this power out from a wind turbine, and we don't want to necessarily have our wind turbine scale like SQ for very large winds. We actually introduce some sort of some function that we would have that would describe what a wind turbine really does. A typical function looks like this. This is a little cartoon from Wikipedia that Adam pulled off. It ramps up. This is something like. Something like S cube that it ramps up for lower speeds. It reaches what was called the rated power. That's the power we rather than you're going to say. You have ice. We said before, you have a 10-megawatt turbine. That's what the rated power is. It levels off so that we can produce some sort of steady, high-power energy as opposed to having the energy fluctuate all the time when the wind changes. It having a rated speed where it meets that power here, 15 meters a second. So these are somewhat important. So these are somewhat important. These are the speeds generally around where a wind turbine operates, 10 to 15 to 20 meters a second. It has some cutoff level where we will shut the turbine down to avoid damage if the winds get really hard. We're not going to operate our turbine in a hurricane because it's just going to be too difficult and spin too fast. That's just a curve. This is maybe a little better curve. Curve. This is maybe a little better curve just to show you what it really operates like. If even this is a bit of a cartoon, each of these blue dots would be an actual measurement where I've measured the wind speed and the power produced by a turbine. And you can see there's a lot of scatter around there. And the scatter for this could be for a lot of reasons. One of the main reasons is I'm probably measuring the wind at one point in that 200-meter diameter circle. So the one measurement is not an accurate measurement of the winds over the whole 200-meter circle. Of the winds over the whole 200-meter circle. The wind turbine is experiencing all those winds and sort of averaging them out. So, for one speed at 10 meters a second, I can have a very large range of power actually generated. I'm not going to focus on the engineering aspect of this. We're often going to use just this red curve, but I want you to recognize that the red curve is just like most of this stuff is some average of a whole bunch of data. Otherwise, it's the same thing. Cuts in at some step. At the same thing, cuts in at some speed, reaches a rated power at a rated velocity, and cuts out at some speed. This is the, you know, these are the speeds we're most interested in. I do weird reason for the around 10, like 250 watts or something like that. These ones? Yeah, exactly. Ah, it was just. There could be a variety of reasons for that. I mean, obviously, it looks like, I mean, this is actually. Obviously, it looks like, I mean, this is actually just they don't look random, do they? It looks like there's a process going on there at a couple of speeds where the turbine hasn't kicked in fully and isn't turning quickly. You'd have to look at the data. There could be a lot of reasons why. Again, in each of these blue dots, there's a huge amount of process going on here. The wind passes over the blades of the turbine. That creates lift on the turbines. They create rotation in the each individual turbine. They create rotation. They come together. Turbine they create rotation, they come together, they turn, then you have the generation of electricity that goes on in the cell of the turbine. So, to get from wind speed to a blue dot is a very complicated process. So, what would happen here could be quite a variety of things. I don't think what's the variable rule, the density be in slide. The density here. Yeah, here. What do you mean by the density? It's the density of error. mean the density it's the density of air so the mass of air divided by the volume the density of the the molecule of air around the yes so the actual so actual weight of the air the density of the air usually we're going to consider that to be fairly constant that's not you know we're going to ignore that effect in our discussions i don't know if you're going to discuss that at all for offshore the density of air does change if you have high level of moisture in the air so it then doesn't change we're going to talk about change It then doesn't change. We're going to talk about changes in density for other things, but in terms of this calculation, most of the time it's taken as a constant. Maybe, I don't know, maybe with really, really moist air, it would have an effect on the turbine operation. Most of all types of turbines I've seen, we usually take that density as a constant. I think the biggest variation you would see is the time of year. But I don't even know if the winds vary so much over the time of the year that I Over the time of the year, that I don't know if the density variations would ever have any impact on his power now. Will your role also be depending on gas, the wind speed? We're going to look at, well, it will. I would say we're more going to look at the way the density depends on temperature is probably the biggest variation you'll see. But yes, it could be a small non-linear, you know, non-dependent dependence on wind speed, but. And it's on wind speed, but in terms of this formula, I think that variation again would be really small compared to the overall density. I mean, in terms of when we look at density as either in the atmosphere or I specialize more in the ocean, the changes in density tend to be really small compared to the actual density itself, like less than a percent. We have measured changes in density in thousandths of the actual density. So the changes in density are really generally very, very small. Very, very small, uh, unless you have some extreme uh, like moisture in the air. Maybe then, but then, but then you're talking about a whole different situation, anyways. But in a climate change setting, the biggest change that gets you have to see in the wind power context is if you imagine, say, up in the Arctic Ocean, where right now you have ice cover all winter long, and so the temperature can get down to minus 40 evenly. But then, in an ice-free condition, it never drops below minus 1.8, and that difference can be like a 10% change in the density. But really, that's extreme, right? That's absolutely extreme. Thank you. All right, so basically, basic ideas here, then what we want, you know, really basic. This is a broken turbine. This is what we want to avoid. The blades have just been snapped. And you can see lots of pictures online. This happens not that infrequently where turbines are damaged, maybe not this dramatically, but turbines are damaged all the time. Quickly, but turbines are damaged all the time. Their lifespan is not as long as you'd like. So, what we want is steady, strong, predictable winds. That would be ideal. Low variation. So, low variation over the turbine size from the bottom of the turbine to the top of the turbine or across the turbine. If we can minimize those changes in winds, all the better. I'm not sure I understand the cutoff, but the velocity. The previous cutoff. 25. Yeah, it is 25. So don't mind checking down. Shuts down. So, why are you worried about damaging the well that why you're worrying about the problem? Well, because if you have to impose this, well, any winds above, say, 25, you're not making any power. So, you gotta be careful about that, right? So, if you have periods where you have large amounts of wind speeds. Large amounts of wind speeds, you are not making power during those large games. I mean, I think you still got to be careful. If you're breaking your turbine properly, it shouldn't cause a lot of damage. If you're operating up at this high speed, though, it's probably more damaging to your turbine hardware. I mean, the turbine will be designed to operate best at a certain speed. And when you go beyond, probably a best speed somewhere. Probably at that speed somewhere around here. When you go higher than that, you're putting more stress on the turbine. And I guess I'd say this is an ideal that we cut it off. What we know is, again, the wind is gusting. So you, I mean, obviously, if you have pictures like this, turbines don't get cut off quickly enough. They don't get protected. They do break. Is it shut off automatically, or is somebody they could be shut off automatically? They probably have the ability to break them. Like, if you said, Yeah, I know a hurricane's coming through, I'm just gonna put all my turbines in break mode to protect them. I see. And you know, if we've all seen that, well, if you know those hand on it, I hope you all have this question when you go by turbine farms. You look up, nine of 10 are operating, 10th one's sitting there, not doing anything. 10th one sitting there not doing anything. And sometimes you go buying the whole turbine farm, just not generating, right? There are a variety of reasons they shut them down. So ideally, we don't want these extremes because a simple reason, during the extremes, we're not generating power. And the one thing we have to be careful about is when we do the averages and stuff, because when we just do average, I'll plug you plots of average wind speed. Well, the average wind speed includes the extremes. And this is something I'm worried about on the East Coast. We've had this, oh, you've got great results. The east coast, we've had this. Oh, you got great resource. Where are they? They say, Where's the great resource? Well, right on the path of hurricanes. So it's really high wind speed, but is it a really high wind speed good for wind power? That's, I'm not sure people have looked into. They just take the annual average wind speed. Okay, so that's what we want to do. If we start looking at winds, we saw seven pictures today of mostly precipitation data, but we start looking at winds. This is again something we know. We know that winds. Winds. This is again something we know. We know that wind varies on a lot of different time scales. Again, this is the wind you experience varies on a lot of different time scales. You go outside, it's calm, there's a gust of wind, 10 second time scales. We know the wind changes hour to hour. We know it changes from day to night. We know it changes day to day, week to week, month to month, and so on. All of these time scales matter. If we plot a win time, so we saw a time series like this today. So here's a win, a 24-year 24-year win time series, lots of variation. And I should do 15-minute averages. So we take, you know, we do do a measurement continuously at some high frequency, maybe a second, maybe less, and we take a 15-minute average of that data just so we can plug. Well, room for it to catch up on that. This is if we zoom in for one year. What I'm trying to do is zoom in, you'll see that, okay, it's random, but maybe there's a bit more structure that we might be able to understand. So my goal here is to say, okay, it looks like a lot of sort of random noise. That means let's just use statistics. What we're hoping for is there's some structure in there, at least I'm hoping for, is there some structure in there that we can use some physics behind and understand. So at the level of a year, At the level of a year, baby gone. At the level of a month, now you start to see periods of high wind, periods of low wind. This is what we might try to understand. At the period of a week, you can definitely see this. Strong winds, low winds, strong winds, low winds. That's the type of thing we'd like to be able to predict. And beyond just predicting, you know, not just in a pure statistical way, we'd like to have a predictable. Just in a pure statistical way, we'd like to have some understanding of why this is happening. So, maybe a question. So, the average wind speed, so the wind is a vector one. Yes. So, is this like the amplitude or this is the amplitude? And I say that this is trying to think if I know exactly what to measure in here. This wind speed, most of the wind speeds at these powers are often captioned by those little cup anodons. By those little cup anodons, so it doesn't know a vector, it's just how fast that little cup is going. So, it really is just a speed. That's interesting, that's good to know, right? Because I'm going to talk about wind as vectors. It's not often measured as a vector. There's two measuring devices, one that spins like this, and a weather vane that does this to give you direction. These days, there's more modern ones than that, but a lot of historical data is that. And the last part I do is just on a day. The main reason I did this is. It's uh we mainly did this is to add the one standard deviation error bars, variation bars, that tell you how much the wind varies over the 15 minutes that you're doing that average. So this is just what we know. The wind is, you walk outside, the wind is not constant most of the time. No wind, gust of wind, no wind, gust of wind. That's how we experience wind almost all the time. It's rare you go outside with just a steady breeze blowing in your face. You can do You can do a little more analysis on this. You can do spectral analysis on this, and I'm going to talk about this a little bit later on just to show you where the, you know, there's one way you do that, a very, very variable, lots of time lengths, time series, is you do a spectral analysis. What this does is how much energy is in the different time scales. So if you look at the top of these graphs, So, if you look at the top of these graphs, up here you see the time scales we're talking about: one year, one month, one day. It's a logarithmic type scale. What you see is that most of the energy is in the one month to one day range. Weather. That's where most of the energy is, what we call weather. Windy today, not windy tomorrow. Storm system comes through. You get this, whatever we have going on here in Okanagan right now, 10 days of nothing but sunshine. 10 days of nothing but sunshine and heat. Very strange. You do really at the small scales, at the scales of seconds to minutes, we also have energy, not quite as much energy, but important energy. And this is the gustiness we know in the wind and what we call turbulence. What we'll talk about is turbulence. But again, this is something that, you know, you've got the graph, you know this. This is not information that you don't experience every day. This is how you treat to wit. What is it doing? You treat the wind? What is it doing out there right now? Oh, I'm going to go look at the forecast and see what it's going to do tomorrow because I know the winds tomorrow could be very different than the winds today. And we know the winds right in the summer might be very different than the winds in the winter. This is another example of type of variation that can occur. This plot is plotting versus one day wind speeds at different heights at a given tower. This is the lowest tower very close to the ground at 10 meters. This is the highest tower at 200 meters. Is the highest tower at 200 meters, so up at the top where a wind turbine would be. And during the nighttime, we see very different speeds: high speeds aloft, very low speeds at the ground. And these are two different days. One day we're very clear, so we have a very clear evening, very sunny day like we have out here now, and then a clear evening, and another day when it's cloudy. And we know when it's cloudy, you see very little change. But when it's sunny, we see a very interesting change. Interesting change. The wind speeds at the top get lower, they all get very similar. This is the kind of behavior that we see, we can see all the time in the time series that we'd like to understand. Why does it make a difference if it's sunny or cloudy? What's happening on a sunny day that makes these wind speeds all come down to the same type of speed? And we don't want to skip these things because the turbines carry. This is one thing we want to avoid here. We don't want to average these two. To avoid either, we don't want to average these two situations and just say, Oh, that's okay, we'll just average them. No, because the wind speeds are responding, the wind turbines are responding immediately almost. I mean, I think not immediately, but on the scale of seconds to a minute, the wind's turbines is responding. So you are not generating a lot of power here. You're generating a lot of power here, but you have a lot of variation across the face of your blade. So you're generating a lot of power at the cost of flexing your turbine. Near turbo. And we can go further. This is what we want to talk about probably later in the week. That's temporal variation. Spatial variation is even more complicated. This is a map of North America. The colors here, before you can't see this, dark blue is, this is again, it's one of these annual average wind speeds at 100 meters. Probably from a model or satellite. A model or satellite observations. It'll be from, I think it's from, this is from NREL. I don't think it's from, I don't know if it's from the ER85 data we'll look at, but a similar data set. Dark blue is wind speeds that are above 10 meters a second. So these are average wind speeds that are at the sort of ideal spot to generate power over their standard wind turbines. So the very dark areas, see up here in northern Quebec, this is just the most recent. This is just the most recent. I think that HydroCovac is now going to develop, just said, after years of saying we're not going to do any wind power, is going to develop large-scale wind farms right there on a scale that'll probably make them the biggest wind farms in Canada in the next decade. Other high values you see tend to be this areas in the prairies and Canada and the US. You see some really interesting things. You know, if I didn't tell you this is a wind map. Map, you'd probably look at it and say, Oh, that's a topographic map. Those are mountains. All these little yellow areas, those are all mountains. Wind speed is low in the mountains in this map. That's interesting. Except for some really interesting areas, and this is what's very interesting area in Alberta. There's this area in the foothills on the edge of the mountains where you have very high wind speeds. How do we explain those? Can we explain those? We explain those the other thing to notice about it. There's again lots of variation. Like it's not, you know, there's little every little hill or mountain causes changes in wind speeds. And where they have good data, you have a lot of variation, spatial variations down at all scales. This is a zoom in. This is a zoom in of that area of the foothills just off just west of Calgary. West of Calgary, east of the Rocky Mountains. I'm sorry, the color scales change here. Red, they're really high. Wind speeds now, blue are low. But just again, I wanted to show you that. Notice, zoomed in to show you the little details in the variations, how you can travel on scales of kilometers, tens of kilometers. You can go from a really high area to a really low area. And again, we know this, but. I'm just wondering, like, how John. Um, like how generalizable just the model can certain data sets. You present the data sets from the Netherlands, from Denmark, but given this huge spatial variation, how can you create a universal model that you've been talking, you've been comparing different data sets from different patients yet describing general behavior of it? Well, this is this is the question. This is exactly the question. How much we're going to talk about general models, how much do they really apply? How much do they really apply when you move spatially? The physical concepts don't change. We're basing these on physical laws. So they don't change. So we have some confidence that there's something that's constant. But as we'll see, the actual dynamics are really complicated. So it will vary. Maybe somewhat, maybe not remarkably, but somewhat remarkably in the areas where you had really strong winds. You had really strong winds, the dynamics are fairly consistent. Consistent enough that if you look around, what we don't have in the world is, well, and this is not totally because of these dynamics, but what does a wind turbine look like? There's just one model that we have out there mostly all around the world of what wind turbines look like now. The pictures I showed up you, that's what a wind turbine looks like. Three blades, 100 meters high, that's it. If the wind dynamics were really different all over the world, If the wind dynamics were really different all over the world and it was possible to generate power in different ways, you'd see a lot more models of wind turbines. We don't see them, which is saying that in these high speeds, it's pretty consistent. I can put up the same wind turbine and get predictable results. One thing about the variation should say, the wind turbine is an integrator. It averages, right? So that's one reason they can work well. But it is the question. That's what we're trying to figure out. How do I figure out? Trying to figure out how do I figure out where the red areas are, where the blue areas are, without making detailed measurements all the time. Okay, so our goal is to understand, so that's my introduction, half the lecture, how we're going to model this area close to the Earth called the planetary boundary layer. We're going to try to predict, can we say something about the wind? Can we see some commonalities between different areas? Can we do more than just throw up our hands? We do more than just throw up our hand and say, okay, it's just a time series. Let's just do statistical analysis. Because if we can have some more insight, we can do better statistical analysis. Not that I'm going to get away from statistical analysis, I want to just do it better. This is just another picture of that planetary boundary layer. Just to emphasize this troposphere above the planetary boundary layer is really where weather happens. So when we talk about weather, storm clouds, thunder, sun. Storm clouds, thunderstorms, weather systems moving in this high-pressure system that's above us here at Okinawa. And we're really talking about weather prediction in this area. In the planetary boundary layer, we're talking about how the area we live in, how the air there reacts to the weather above interacting with the Earth below. That's what we're talking about. That also makes it complicated because we have to do both of those things. Sometimes, and you'll see a multi-line talk about it, kind of ignore this. Multi-layer hot one, it kind of ignores. Something's going on up there, and we're going to make maybe make the assumption that weather is somewhat predictable. At least on a, you know, how predictable is the weather? How much do you trust weather forecasts these days? It's not horrible. Here it's easy, sunny and hot. But usually, we got about a week that weather forecasts are not too bad these days, right? So, this is somewhat predictable. And now, I want to predict this. And now we want to predict this, how this responds to it being predictable. All right, so planetary boundary. This is the weather. This is how you experience weather, right? Weather's way up there, but this is how you experience the weather, how you experience the wind. And it's the most important for wind energy because when we saw the size of the turbines, they are in this low layer. We haven't managed to generate turbines that are 2,000 meters up in the air. Meters up in the air. Maybe we'll do that sometime. Kites, I think, is the way to go. But all right, we're going to talk a little bit about physics. So, we're going to introduce variables from physics. We're going to talk about the velocity of the wind, three-dimensional velocity, although we're often most concentrate on the horizontal aspects of U and V. I use units of meters per second. I think most of the time, trying to think if there's any time I don't use meters per second. Be aware, other people use different units for wind. So, if you see Units for wind. So, if you see a weather forecast, you usually see wind in kilometers per hour, at least in Canada. If you see other ones, you'll see wind in knots. And you should just be aware of that and know there's different units. And just to get your 10 meters second wind that we're talking about is a 36 kilometer per hour wind. So you can think about that. What's a 30? Because that's the weather forecast being. If I see a 36 kilometer per hour wind out there, I'm going, I don't think I'm going to bike today. I don't want to bike into that. That's, I don't want to bike into that. Now, that's a good wind. That's not hurricanes. Hurricanes are like hundreds of kilometers an hour, but that's a good solid wind. So that's what we need for wind turbines, a good solid wind. Not a breeze, but a wind. Other variables we're talking about, mentioned density already. Talk about pressure a lot, fluid dynamics. Pressure is the force that drives wind. And you can think about that. How do you move air? Don't move air like this, right? It's really hard to move air. This, right? It's really hard to move air like that. I can move air like this. Like you change the pressure system and move air. We always have to talk about pressure when we talk about fluid dynamics. We'll talk about temperature because temperature is the easiest way to change the density of air and the most when that happens most of the time. I'm not going to talk about the molar mass too much. It comes up a bit in your state when we talk about how temperature, density, and pressure are all related. And again, what we saw cared about most in terms of And again, what we saw cared about most in terms of wind energy was speed. What is the speed of the wind? Which is very simple. And what we want to do now is figure out how these things interact. How does the velocity depend on the pressure? How does the pressure depend on the temperature? Therefore, how does the velocity depend on temperature? Things like this. We're going to write down a simple set of laws. Before we do that, why don't we talk about speed here? I'm going to make one added slide to sort of what I want to talk about. I want to talk about wind direction. And I talk about this because this is the most frustrating thing when you're looking at data. Directions are a pain in the ass. I mean, really a pain in the ass. And it's worse when we talk about wind, because everybody has a different way of stating wind directions. So you've got to be really careful when you look at any data set and say they have a direction. What does the direction mean? In common, what we most of the time have for winds is we specify the direction. is we specify the direction. We're talking about winds ourselves or in the weather or meteorology, we say the direction the wind is coming from. So we say a west wind. That is a wind coming from the west. It's blowing east, but it's coming from the west. It is a really stupid way to do things. Listen to this. So here's the wind blowing to the northeast, but the angle we'll give it is this angle down here, 180 degrees opposite what we were. Degrees opposite what we would think of it being mathematically, not usually, right? Not even mathematically. The other thing we do is we measure the angle clockwise from the north. That's not how we do things mathematically either. We measure the angle mathematically, and we're going to measure this angle, theta. That's the angle we would consider of that vector v, the polar coordinate angle. It's not the same as what you see in the data. Same as what you see in the data. And unfortunately, in the data, it's not always consistent. So, generally, mathematically, what we really want is the u of d. That would be better. Give me the vector. Then there's no confusion. I can calculate what direction I want to talk about. Great. But as I mentioned before, that's not how wind is often measured. We don't measure a wind vector. We measure wind speed and wind direction. We measure them independently. We measure them independently. This is just be aware. The other thing that's really important about angles that's really frustrating is angles are periodic. Of course, we know this. We go around the circle. That makes up very difficult data to jump with. If I go around the circle, if I go around the circle, I go from 360 to zero. You don't want to average, just blatantly average directions together. I take an average of two angles. An average of two angles, 359 degrees and one degree, and I average those, I get a result of 180. I get exactly the opposite direction as the two angles we're pointing in. So anytime we do statistics, do it on the vector. Do it on U and V. Those are fine. Don't do statistics on angles. You'll see statistics done on angles all the time. You'll get, how do I plot these? How do I do things? It's just confusing. I just like, that's the kind of thing that you. Using, I guess, that's the kind of thing that you want to be really careful of. And this is where you want your intuition to kick in. You're looking at this: I know the wind always comes from the west here, it's generally from the west. And I draw this plot, I did some averaging, and I get an eastward wind, or I get a south wind is the average direction of the wind. Obviously, you've done something wrong. It's the easiest one. And I'm just measuring the apps all the time. All the time. It's just. Sorry, I think I intended something. You mean always the wind blows straightly? You mean it varies in direction. This is just one time where the wind is blowing in one direction. Okay, I mean, it is like the line, or we can say that like the curve. I mean that when the wind blows, so this is like the curved one or straight, because for example, you said that is north. You said that is northeast. So you picture this line that means southwest. So I want to know that's why we have some like this red one. So we visit the vector representing the wind, right? Yeah. Now the angle that is usually reported for this vector is this angle all the way over here to say this. I don't say the direction the wind is going. I say the opposite angle, the direction the wind came from. This is approximately, I mean. This is approximately. I mean, one point space. We're looking at one measurement and saying, how do I report that measurement? And what I'm saying is the direction that people report for wind is not the direction we would think of it mathematically. It's usually an exact opposite direction. Well, it's not even the exact opposite direction. Exact opposite direction and round circle the wrong way. That's all I would say. So when you see a direction that says 212 degrees, This is the vector you're looking at, which we would call 58 degrees in mathematics. That's not obvious. We just want to always be careful about directions. And if we can work with vectors, right? People don't work with vectors because they're not mathematicians, because they haven't taken like a second year, first year of calculus, second year, linear algebra. If you're a mathematician working on vectors, you're an engineer, work with vectors. Why wouldn't you work with vectors? The vectors. Why wouldn't you work with vectors? It's easy. All right. What do we govern the dynamics? We're going to look at generally three conservation laws. Momentum law is just Newton's second law. You've all had some experience with Newton's second law. I talked about it in basic physics classes. You've seen it in lots of mathematical classes. It's a basic idea of balancing forces and accelerations. Energy law is usually what we're looking at here is the first law of thermodynamics. I'm not going to go into this a lot of detail. I'm not going to go into this a lot of detail because it gets a little complicated, but it is behind how temperature changes the density of the air and how we can look at the conservation of that. And mass continuity equation is always an important law to keep, we can't, we're not creating or destroying mass in these situations. Again, I'm in the atmosphere. This can get complicated. We're going to keep it simple. These are usually, I'm going to show some. These are partial differential equations involving the variables we just saw. We just saw. So, hopefully, you've had some exposure to partial differential equations. I don't know how many people have here like taking a PDE course. Oh, yeah, so you know, those of you who don't, maybe have seen them before, what you know if you've taken a PDE course is that partial differential equations can be difficult, right? We usually look at very simple partial differential equations if we want to write down solutions. The other things you should recognize with partial differential equations, boundary conditions matter, right? So, that's why that's why partially why they're difficult. That way, partially why they're difficult. They combine together initial value problems and boundary value problems. So, this is an example. And again, you don't need to, if you haven't seen these before, that's fine. I just wanted to show you the Navier-Stokes equations. These are the conservation of momentum that balances acceleration. So these are the acceleration terms, changes in velocity with forces. And the most important force, again, is pressure, pressure-gradient forces. Pressure, pressure gradient forces. The pressure has to vary. It may be helpful for everyone to acknowledge that W velocity is like vertical and up from the ground. Yes. Yes. U and V are horizontal velocities. These are horizontal. This is what we'll focus on most of the time. This is birth uptown. I should have said, why do we focus on this? We'll see this a bit more, but you can think about the wind. See this a bit more, but you can think about the wind and how you think of the wind. Is it a force that pushes on you, or is it one that lifts you up and down? Also, it's just pushing on you, right? You're not walking down the street, you're going, Measure Maryland in a row, you don't get the vertical velocity. So, these are the acceleration terms, these are the forces. F here has to do with rotation of the Earth. So, this is an important fact when we're dealing with winds on the scale, large scales. On the scale, large scales, 100 kilometers to a thousand kilometers, it'll be important in our discussion. And this is viscosity, importantly, molecular viscosity. So, this is very tiny stuff that most of the tiny ignore but will imbalance. So, you define the mid-speed and speed like u squared plus v square. Yes, I should have said the horizontal and speed. Horizon get the The ah, you could include it in there for me. The pressure has been varying in the oh, yes, yes. But when later on, when we think about variations on time scales of 10 minutes and longer, when you average over the vertical velocity, you say it becomes very, very small. When you average over the global velocity, you say that it's a big size. And so on the longer time scale is a vertical velocity, you're going to have to test. Generally, in atmospheric sciences, we ignore the vertical velocities. Experiences: we ignore the vertical velocities, and most things in fluid dynamics, we try to ignore vertical velocities, make the problem easier. It's not exactly correct, but that's what we get. Except when you're talking about the turbulence. Except we are dying in no terms easy. Except. And gravity's in there. This induction term. Oops. These induction terms, so this term we're going to come back to at the end of the lecture. I think that's what's on the slide. This induction term is really what makes fluid dynamics interesting and almost impossible. It is non-linear. And if you know, hopefully, when you're mathematics, you learn one key thing. When something's linear, it's easy. We can solve it. When it's non-linear, and the job. When it's non-linear, and the jump is really usually, it's non-linear, it's impossible, like not just hard to solve, but impossible to solve. These make the equations impossible to solve. But on the other hand, they make it, well, we wouldn't be studying fluid dynamics over 100 years if this term wasn't in there because we'd be done. So this is what also makes it interesting and rich. What I understand you assuming here is accessible. No, not really. That was put up, I'll put it up on. Really, that was put up. I'll put it up on the next slide. Depends. A lot of times we do to make it simple, but we know air is not compressive. But now, when does non-compressibility really matter? Usually with air, it doesn't really matter until you reach like the speed of sound. So hopefully, we're not dealing with that here. And this is only a different density function of density. Yes. Yeah. If you're going to be more accurate, density varies. Yeah, if you're going to be more accurate, density varies on a lot of different, depends on a lot of different variables. Compressibility is a certain areas of atmospheric dynamics would keep compressibility involved there. Most of the time, to simplify things, we will assume incompressible. Strictly speaking, we'll make a decent approximation. The variations in density don't affect the inertia, but it can affect the buoyant forces. Yes, okay. So these equations are really difficult to solve. So, what we're going to do in the next few slides is make approximations. Basically, by approximations, we're going to ignore terms in the equations and look at really basic balances. That means taking out, so what we'll do in the horizontal momentum equations is we'll say, I want to balance these two times only. In the vertical equation, we'll do the same thing, but with gravity. We'll take out really simple ideas, simple ideas that allow us to solve the equations mathematically. Solve the equations mathematically, or say things about the mathematics, and we'll say, Okay, this is the basic when does this hold, and this is the basic balance we have, fully knowing that lots of other stuff is going around those balances. And then we'll come back at the end and we'll say, okay, how do we bring in these terms in terms of turbulence? And say, well, what if we had turbulence? How do those initial balances we had, how do they change? Or how can we incorporate turbulence? But this is how we approach solving impossible equations is we break possible equations is we break them down to simple balances look at the simple balances what does it mean but it what this means when we do these simple balances we go out and look at the data we're going to have to look hard to see these simple balances they're not just going to be there staring in front of us blatantly they're going to be hidden by a lot of other things which sometimes you know then you might question how how good is this balance that's that's a bit where we're going to do any exercise so conservation of mass is is a similar Of mass is a similar equation. If it's incompressible, it becomes very simple. But again, it does have this general form to have this non-linearity in it that is important that we will talk about. All right, simplifying equations, I sort of mentioned this. It's complicated because they contain all these different scales, everything. You know, Navi-Stokes equations are supposed to model everything that goes on in the atmosphere. Simple dynamics. Let's not bring moisture into it. Dynamics. That's not bring moisture into it, chemistry into it, and other things like that. We can simplify them just like I said. So, for example, in simplifying them, we can look at things like the molecular viscosity really matters on extremely small scales, small millimeters. When we're talking about the molecular viscosity of wind, when you're going outside, I'm talking about the wind rubbing on your skin, that scale, how it goes from wind to zero. Now it goes from wind to zero. So it's millimeters. Now that's a little deceptive because it goes to zero. And we think about complex, like just stepping outside and walking around all these buildings and trees and stuff, that where the wind goes to zero suddenly becomes really complex. And somehow we're going to have to represent that without modeling every tree or every building or every person out there. On weather time scales, so this gets a bit to why we're in North. Scale: So, this gets a bit to why we're ignoring W. If we look at longer time scales, longer than 10 minutes, we generally know that the horizontal speeds are much, much bigger than the vertical speeds. This has to do with the scale, the size of scales of the Earth. Horizontally, we're looking at scales that are thousands of kilometers. Vertically, well, really for the wind turbines, we're looking at scales that are 100 meters compared to the thousands of kilometers. So, the vertical scales are really small, the horizontal scales are really large. We can't have super high. We can't have super high vertical wind speeds in a scale of 100 meters. It's about the same thing in terms of vertical, I guess, vertical change, same sort of ideas when we look at larger ordered 10 kilometer scales. Again, vertical changes are small, vertical accelerations are small. Oh, this is where one of the simple balances in the vertical equation is we can balance gravity and pressure forces. This is known as the hydrostatic. Pressure forces. This is known as the hydrostatic balance. This is that balance. If you could just take the two terms from the equation, the vertical variations in pressure are balanced by the weight of the air. This is where we know this is the atmospheric pressure we feel. Don't generally feel it that much. We don't even recognize it. You feel it when you go up and the atmospheric pressure drops is the weight of the air above you. When you climb a mountain and you go up several thousand meters, you have less air above you, the pressure drops. Air above you, the pressure drops. It's a fairly basic balance. And I'm going to come back down on it. Look at the scale of this. It's roughly one hectopascal, or that's per 10 meters over the scale of a turbine. Look at that 100 meter scale. That's about 10 hectopascales or one kilopascal. Kilopas scales often what you see on a weather map for pressure. So there is a change in pressure on the scale of. In pressure on the scale of a wind turbine. From the bottom of the wind turbine to the top, there would be a change of roughly a kilopascal, just due to the weight of the air. You can do a little further of this if you use the ideal gas law. What we're doing there is saying, oh, I can change density into a function of temperature and pressure. And then I can solve this equation. I don't know how many people, this is like one of the first problems I give in my second year BEs course. Solve this equation because I like this. You're solving a differential equation. This equation because I like this. You're solving a differential equation, getting an interval limit. You don't need to know the relationship here, though. The key thing is that I can, if you tell me the temperature distribution with height, I can calculate the pressure. And temperature goes on the bottom. As temperature goes up, density goes down. Basic, that's what we need to know from this law. Increase the temperature, density goes down. Warm air is lighter than cold air. Than coal there. Another balance we look at is the geostrophic balance. Again, look at the sides here. We're talking about 100 kilometers, so fairly large now, but not massive, big compared to turbine farms. Turbine farms don't extend overhill 100 kilometers. This is the balance that I inserted before, where you balance the pressure gradients and the Coriolis forces. This is the balance that results from being on a spinning Earth. And what it tells us is that. And what it tells us is that the pressure or the velocities, if you look at it this way, we can determine. If you tell me what the pressure field is, I just take the derivatives and I have the velocities. That's a wonderful balance. All I need to know is the pressure field. And in fact, the way it's written, if you just draw the pressure field in terms of contour lines, so think about the second year of calculus type stuff, draw contour lines, those lines are what the wind follows along. They tell you the direction of the wind. And this is why, I don't know if we see it as much in And this is why, I don't know if we see it as much in Marvel. They used to predict weather. That's all the weather forecasters would do. They just plop down a pressure field and say, oh, I can look at the pressure field. I can calculate the winds. This is generally only good. And the last one says, this is what we're really accurate above the layer we're most interested in, where the weather happens. That's why we draw those weather maps. So this will tell you how systems are going to come across the carnival. This will tell you, you can see really dramatic things if you plot. You can see really dramatic things if you plot the weather maps of hurricanes, for example. I think they have some pictures. But this is the type of weather map where I could say these are lines of constant pressure, contours of constant pressure. That tells you the winds. You just follow the lines of constant pressure. Where they get closer together, the gradient in pressure is bigger, so the winds are stronger. Where the pressure lines expand out, the gradient in pressure is low, so the winds are lower. And it tells us why, if you take a picture of a hurricane, what direction the winds go around a hurricane. Different in the northern and southern hemisphere. So in the northern hemisphere, they go in the positive mathematical direction, are cyclonic. So we call them cyclones. It's not good for weather production. The hydrostatic balance is useful. Yeah. It's just, well, right now I'm going to bring them both together in the next slide. So now the next thing is we do we take those two balances together, the hydrostatic balance and the geostrophic balance, and we get a thing called the thermal wind. So all we do is we take those two simple equations, take the derivative of one, combine them together, and we can relate the vertical gradients of wind. Vertical gradients of wind speed to the horizontal gradients of temperature. This tells us how the wind speed should vary as we go up in the atmosphere. So if you can measure the temperature, you can tell me how the wind speed is going to vary as you go up. Now, if I asked you sort of guidely, as you go up, what happens to the wind speeds? As you go up, I climb up a mountain. You go out. I climb up a mountain. Is it windier or less windy? Well, I go up in an airplane. What are the wind speeds? They can be ridiculously high up in an airplane, right? So as you go up, generally the wind speeds go up. These gradients are positive generally. But this gives us a way of calculating, you know, and again, it's an approximation, but it gives us a way of calculating or relating how the wind speed change vertically. The wind speed may change vertically to horizontal changes in temperature. So, again, we notice we're combining here something that's a local thing, how the wind here varies vertically, with a spatial thing, how the temperature varies across different scales. And you can get, just as well, you can get changes in wind speed. So, this is again relating it back to wind turbines. How much does this change? So, if you have to take in some typical numbers, you get a vertical gradient. Numbers, you get a vertical gradient of three meters a second per 100 meters. So across the face of the big turbines we're talking about, we could see a change in wind speed of three to six meters a second, just caused by the temperature gradients in relation to the temperature gradients. That's important. That's, you know, if you think back to those graphs, that leaves the bottom of your turbines, you know, maybe at five meters a second and the top of your turbines at 11 meters a second. And that's maybe not great for your turbines. And that's maybe not great for your term. So these things operate on reasonable scales. The temperature here is, is that a reference temperature? Is it the temperature that you have, not the gradients, but the temperature in the denominator in this equation? Is it a reference temperature or is it a variable? It's a variable. If you wanted to simplify it, you could take it as some, I mean, the changes. As some, I mean, the changes again, the changes in temperature relative to the temperature itself are small, so you could probably take the temperature as a constant as a reference temperature. But strictly speaking, there's a second term that's generally smaller than a neglect, or that's been neglected. This temperature here doesn't have to be constant. But we would often think of it as over the scales you're talking about, we might think of it as constant, especially here. Think about we're doing things like degrees, Kelvin. Here, think about we're doing things in degrees Kelvin here relative to the magnetic changing in the vertical direction, it's changing, but it's a small change usually relative to the total temperature. It is the temperature. Can I ask a follow-on question? Yes. The differentiation, is there another condition about the differentiation that needs to be along SO bottoms? No, no. No, okay. Thank you. No. All right, those are our simple balances. Those are the things that where we can just take a couple terms out of the equation, balance them together, give you an idea of what we can do. Now we want to go back and look at those complicated terms, the nonlinear terms, the effective terms, and talk about them under a framework that we call turbulence. Turbulence is a way of. Turbulence. Turbulence is a way of saying, you know, I always think of this as: I don't understand what's going on. I got to label it something. I'll call it turbulence. So, and often that's the way it's used. Anything I don't understand that's going on in the model, I'll just push in the turbulence. That's not really accurate. But turbulence turbines is a really interesting problem. Quote I read this morning, this was from Richard Feynman magazine. It is the last classic unsolvable problem in physics. It is, there's all these great quotes about it. All these great quotes about it. People say, you know, I think we'll figure out quantum physics, but we won't figure out turbulence. Turbulence is very difficult. And yet, again, it's not a weird thing. It's something we know intimately. We know about turbulence. We see it all the time. When we interact with fluid dynamics, a lot of the time there's turbulent. You have water coming out of the hose. You know, it comes out of an ice stream and then it breaks up into all these droplets, turbulence, right? This type of thing that we see flow. This could be. Thing that we see flow. This could be like this is smoke coming from something. It goes up in the air in a nice center stream, and it suddenly magically just bursts into all this complex motion. Happens all the time around us. So it's not something, it's not quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics happens all the time around us, but we don't know about it. Turbulence, we know about it. And we can kind of, you know, if I said, tell me when it's turbulent, you could just, like, I said, well, you know, I can't really define turbulence, but I know it when I see it. That wasn't actually about turbulence. That wasn't actually about turbulence, but I was on that. So, we don't usually define it in terms of mathematical things. We do it kind of in a hand-wavy way, as Adam has put here in his slides, as symptoms. What does it do? It's unsteady and irregular. So there's lots of motion, chaotic, something. It's rotational. So we see swirl, you know, if you look at the motion, you see rotation, things going around. It's multi-scale. When you look at something like this, you can see. When you look at something like this, you can see big structures and small structures and smaller structures and smaller structures, as small as you want to go, down to the molecular scale. It stirs or it mixes. So what we see in a classic example like this, you have a jet coming in, it breaks up, it's a really strong flow represented by the red, and it breaks up. So after the turbulence is done, the strong flow is gone. It's been mixed out, diffused away. And it does this by breaking it down to the small scales. So small enough scales eventually. So, with small enough scales, eventually molecular viscosity will kick in and smooth out the flow. So, it plays a really critical role from taking stuff from large scales, strong flows, down to small scales where molecular viscosity can kick in. But it's absolutely critical in all areas of fluid dynamics to understand real fluid inheritance. And yet, it's impossible to really solve. It can be generated by. By a variety of methods. Generally, when we talk about fluid dynamics, there's usually there's two methods we'll talk about here: sort of the wind. If you have shear, that is, if you have a fast-flowing flow wind over slow or opposite direction wind, so a change in velocity, that'll create turbulence in between the two layers of velocity, or by buoyantly driven flows. If you heat the ground, warm air rises, that'll create turbulence as the warm air rises. It can be reduced by a variety. It can be reduced by a variety of things. Most of what we talk about is viscous dissipation, so the actual molecular viscosity kicking in and damping velocities. But also, if you have buoyancy forces, suppose of the warm air being able to rise, you have cold air that's suppressing the rising of warm air. It'll suppress the turbulence development. And this results in sort of pictures of the planetary boundary there that we're going to. Boundary there that I'm just gonna that we're gonna show you cartoon of we'd like you know like to understand this more this is uh and then we'll have to explain this cartoon uh along the bottom we're talking the time is day so we're starting at noon here so the sun's out it's warming the ground just like we have outside right now if you warm the ground a lot warm air on the surface it's going to rise and event as that warm air rises turbulently it mixes all the air above it and it keeps rising until you know sometimes up to Driving until sometimes up to thousands of meters when you suddenly start. If you had any moisture in the air at all, you'd see clouds up there. Obviously, we have no moisture in the air here in the Oganagan Valley at all, right? Usually you'd see clouds form once that warm air, warm moist air hit a certain level, and that would level it up. That happens during the day, so you end up with one thick layer of well-mixed fluid. Generally, like we saw in that one graph, moving at the winds would be fairly consistent over this, moving at the same speed. Sun goes down. Speak sun goes down, earth cools, and now you have cold air under warm air. It's nice and stable. The air stops rising, and you develop a very stable layer, cold air near the earth with warm air above it. Now we have two layers of fluid. Generally, this is a wonderful, nice, steady winds in this area that change with height, that grow up with height, should say stay not in the vertical, but steady unturbulent winds. And so we end up with a different situation in the evening where we see a Evening, where we see a gradient of the winds from the surface upwards, sunrises, and we repeat. If we have nice clear skies, so this gives us a simple explanation of that plot I showed earlier of cloudy versus clear skies being very different. If it's cloudy skies, the sun's warmth doesn't have the ability to warm the ground and cause this variation from day to night. That's sort of a simple description. It gives us a little bit of layers we're interested in, the depths can be. Layers we're interested, the depths can vary quite a lot. And this, we're studying this whole during the day here, maybe studying a whole thousand meters of fluid at night. Here, maybe tens of meters of fluid. That's a rough idea of how buoyancy turbulence, buoyancy-driven turbulence can disturb the planetary boundary layer. And so, we can talk about the planetary boundary layer in a few sort of generalizations. Again, the viscous layer is layered. viscous layer is layer where the velocity goes from the wind to zero due to molecular velocity so it's just millimeters the important thing again is that it does go to zero it does exist we're not going to look at that layer in a lot of detail but we are going to use that there is some height where the velocity goes to zero as a boundary condition in our equation there's a constant flux layer so a nice layer where turbulent quantities can be well represented by that friction layer above That friction layer above, and it's usually a small layer that we can have fairly well approximate what's going on there. And then we have above that what we call the Ekman layer. The Ekman layer is how we adjust from the velocities near the surface to the geostrophic velocities we talked about before at height. And somehow we got to go from zero to those geostrophic velocities. This is called the Ekman process. Now, in truth, these overlap and interact. Mathematically, we'd like to pull them apart a bit so we can look at what goes on in each one. Look at what goes on in each one. So that's what we're going to try to do. And then once we get above these layers, we think of all the turbulence isn't that important, at least not the really high level mixing turbulence we want. We have then macro scale turbulence. We look at the atmosphere in much larger scales, not the small scales we're looking at on the planetary value layers. Clarify what you mean by surface values for the constant gas layer. Some gifts later. So we're going to, we're going to just you guys know, we are about half an hour to lunch if you're wanting to stick to the schedule. Lunch is at noon. Lunch is at noon? Yeah. All right. Oh, then the website needs to be updated. All right. So lunch is at 1:30. So I'll just introduce one. So that's what we were saying. Essentially, what we're saying is the turbulence values don't change a lot with height in this layer. And we're going to specify when I say specify, we take the turbulent values to be the strongest right at the surface, right in this layer. And then they're generally going to decrease with height slowly here and then rapidly here. So we have a lot of turbulence right at the level of the wind rubbing against things. It changes with height slowly and then it starts to change. Height slowly, and then it starts to change with height much more rapidly. So, surface is closer to the ground, yes. Where the wind is rubbing against some solid surface, you can pick up where it's going to zero. And I'll end with one other idea just to at the last to throw in. So, when I talk about potential temperature, when we really talk about atmosphere, we shouldn't talk about temperature, we should talk about potential temperature. And I thought, and I hate this because I'm not mad. And I hate this because I'm not a mathematical person, and I always hated potential temperature because I was like, why do we have to do this? I'll give you an idea of this. Why do we have to introduce potential temperature? If I took, where's the air warm? Here or a thousand meters above us? Here, here. Here. The air up a thousand meters above us is much colder, much heavier. What is it doing up there? It's heavier than the air here. It should flip. Which is heavier. Block hot, heavy air above cold air, it should come unstable and flip. But we know the air is much colder. Why doesn't it flip? Well, it doesn't flip because of the effects of pressure. Because there's a pressure force that balances that buoyancy force, as because there's a pressure force, the hydrostatic pressure. As we go up and down, the pressure changes. And so, what potential temperature does is try to bring those two things in. To bring those two things and understand those two things. It relates, it's a function of temperature and pressure. And it's trying to explain that. Why is the cold air still up there when it's heavier than the air down here? And it gives us a simple explanation. And that's, you know, so we can't just look at temperature on its own or we get the buoyancy forces, and we get the stability of the atmosphere wrong. The cold air stays up there. It's stable. We just looked at a temperature gradient. We said that can't be the case. When we include pressure. Case. When we include pressure into this variable, we get a variable that relates to this. Maybe I'll just show you the graph. That's the easy way to do it. This is what the temperature does as we go up. It goes down considerably, right? If you go up a thousand meters, it's cold. You go up to the top of a mountain, it's cold. You go up in an airplane, it's really cold. This is potential temperature, and we include the effects of pressure. It increases with height and is therefore stable. It's saying the lighter air, lighter I'll put in quotes. Air, lighter, I'll put in quotes because it's not lighter air. Lighter air, when we take the effects of pressure into account, is above the heavier air. And so the atmosphere is, in its general state, stable. We don't have that air flipping over all the time. It takes something odd, like heating the ground with the sun, to make it unstable. And so potential temperature is the variable we should be using about when we go on to talk about stability of the atmosphere. What we need to do is... What we need to do is, as long as it has a positive gradient, it's stable. If we heat this up enough, so we shift this over at the bottom, it will have a negative gradient and it will become unstable. So it's still the same process that we're familiar with regular temperature. Heat it up, it'll get lighter. It's still directly linear. The formula has it proportional to temperature. If you're not changing height, this is fine. It's just the same as temperature. Is fine, it's just the same as temperature. It's when you go up and down that you have to be careful, and this potential temperature. So, this is, and we'll see this when we look at data. This is what we really, if you want to look at changes with height and you want to know if something's stable, you should calculate potential temperature. It's a very simple format. You know, it's a very simple format, yet. We have to measure two things now. It's that we know the pressure, roughly, because we can use hydrostatic pressure. Pressure just changes in height in a regular way. In height in a regular way. So, potential temperature, you'll see. And, like I said, I used to hate it. I never really understood what it was for. And I thought about it, I was like, we have to have this. The atmosphere would be unstable all the time. Flipping over all day would be a horrible world to live in. And so this type of graph is what you keep in your head. I don't care about this temperature, how it goes down with height. Down here, they're the same, and I can treat them sort of the same as I go up with height, really, especially large height. In terms of stability, it allows us to just use a very simple condition for stability. If the gradient width of theta width height is less than zero, it's unstable. The air will start flipping over conductively. If it's greater than zero, it's stable. If it's around zero, we're not sure. We're on that borderline. Could you pull down to the potential type of temperature generation? What is it? That's the molecular molar mass. So, this comes from the ideal gas law. So, R is your universal gas concept. Okay, so this is just a concept generally. It comes from your universal ideal gas law. You arrange it with the specific gas bunch of no win. I mean, you can basically call it two sevenths or short. Rusty. All right, so I'm going to stop there because we have lunch. I think I mean, we're going to talk about, I'll continue on tomorrow with turbulence and how we look at the vertical structure, getting out to, essentially, getting down to the real detail we want to know about turbines and then look at spatial variation, which is just about right. I don't need a lot of time to talk about spatial variation because there's not that much to talk about under how complex it's. Any questions? Any follow-up questions? Any questions on Zoom? I have a question. Go ahead. Trisha, you had a question? question um can i can hear you uh we can't hear you right now if you're talking i had a quick question i saw that a lot of a lot of work was done on wind speed and how it affects turbines braking um are they are there additional factors that affect how turbines or whether or not a turbine would break that can be modeled mathematically That can be modeled mathematically. I mean, if we looked at, if we wanted to get into the details of the engineering of the turbine, you know, what is the strength in the turbine blade? How does the generator work? The macell work. You certainly can do mathematical models of that. That is something that's done quite a lot, where they try to predict how much variation is in the weight. Much variations in the wind. So they'll take what the turbulence level in the winds, and they'll try to predict how much that affects the turbine life that's generated, how much they affect the fatigue and the strain on the parts of the turbine. They have generally engineers have fairly, well, you could do very complicated mathematical models that are similar to the models of fluid dynamics. Usually they would have some sort of, like we did here, some simple formulas that would relate the level of turbulence intensity to the amount of stress and fatigue. To the amount of stress and fatigue you're putting on the blades and the rest of the turbine, and therefore you could predict how wind you'd have failure. It's another, that's an engineering problem, though, generally, and a solid mechanics type problem that I am not an expert in, although the equations look very similar because you were talking about solid mechanics, solids that bend. So it has similarity to elastic solids, which are the equations of fluid dynamics, essentially. Of fluid dynamics, essentially. But yes, the short answer is yes. You can do more on that.
