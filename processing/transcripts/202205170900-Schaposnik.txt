This day, we're going to connect Laura Shaposnik. Laura Nation Argentina and the studio la licenciatura y universidad la plata y especio sus studios de postrado en la universidad de Oxford y studo en estancias en la universidad de Heidelberg en la universidad. Heidelberg in the Universidad Illinois, Urbana Champaign, and 2012 is the University of Illinois in Chicago. But also many areas of divulgation, and we have many students anchored. And well, this is very important. And well, I'm very happy. Travel in giometria and topology, and I will talk about it. So, muchas gracias por a utar dar la charla y bueno. Les pas studa gracias, muchas gracias. Los voya sorchititos y que no vi a poder ver la caras, pero si quéenemprentas me puen a ser consonido, me pen escucharbiando, si? No, si si. Muchas gracias por la invitación y por lo fortune contales on my trajo. I want to seroy es countales not about resultados more particularly if we have the furades, and the Higgs parent as mathematical, and a little about who types in the world, and that type of championship. And my experiences can terminate the past, like this. My experience can be terminated with a little application of geometry and topology about it. So, first of all, they trust as good. First, the quiet strategy as well as the facile models of Higgs, like the point between activities in Mathematica, since we are introducing some of the most important concepts with definitions, if you can see how subjects and studios are recent, so we are like the GIS and that. With description of other mathematical ideas that work in the topology. Brief or inspiration more of the areas are planned, which can control many contemporary mathematics and physical material, and they are extremely resonating with the Mathematical Physics. And then the correspondence of Hodge of the 20th century. Hodge, of the age, in our Higgs, as points to various characters, representation of superficial groups and connections. So, we have the three days about relationships, but one of the more concerts, this correspondence is not able to transport Europe of class through the varieties of character. And this efficiency is subsidized in the Higgs for In the last Higgs por la conjo la confetura de la sobre la unicida de una minimim que para ese como esta scenario de energetic function de representaciones functiones. So, parents are efficiency transport actions that subsides colonization superficial minimum superficial. The much attention in the sectors and many particulars, but very. So it is unicided, superficial minimums, which is more general. In very general, it is quiet to see that more than the existence of the Jack Muller, but to dimensions. Our general images, and with the Generales, and with the topological topology, more general, and using relations and simplest strategies of color of the model original. Allowing us to model how different physical mathematics and mathematical physics, and the colour of this fibrous colour, we can social space. Associated space of quivers, graphos, and combinatoria. And many firación or questionas well geometric from Higgs or the representations are inspiring for this porter that is also much of the figurative Higgs. In particular, there are duality that many. And one probability is generality, and they have And collaboration, international markets in this, and can pretty much like a correspondence of brands of their facias, simplectices, and a correspondence in the terminal of the program of languages. The study of mathematics, the central age, in historical instrument. So, complex as real, and we consider the symmetry that consider the symmetry. In the 20th century, the concentration of strong origin is like a symmetry between fibrados of Higgs. Actually, principal actions to understand this concrete and symmetry. The concrete in our varieties. Carried between the varieties of the audience, they are dual, a pued established between a fibre. So a misma base, these variables, and the fibre space dual, like space duales. So una base like. And the matemática formula of the conjugate of extreme orientation. The conjecture of Tasmania, which the champion of SYZ conjectured, is a objective very ambitious of many investigators, and the idea is many advances in this direction. So, what do you have a little escape in the Higgs and how can we do it? How can we work from a more geometric geometry, of the vectorial fibers, and one of the questions that I used to map areas? And I can also see the map of areas, and with a more specific question. You have Higgs, a new aquí society to one. And introducing the porching, which is the question of automatic young mills. That are questions in four dimensions, which is not the reduce of invariance in a direction, or two directions, the reduced when a invariance in two directions is one to the superficial rim and. And the questions that I will do is hit that. So, two questions where the condition in the principle for the porch, which is important, and that is a holomorphic structure. And we have the curvature of a unitary connection that we have, and we can see the Higgs that will be the Friday the Higgs, who will fix, that you will see as one. These questions that are like Hitchin are solutions that determine a concept for groups, with structure or connection in the group. And that is the Higgs. The fibrous Higgs is to be like the solutions of these questions. Congratulations, we're me to the model of the fibrous Higgs who can fix howlings of equations, you know, as a delta una superficial compact of RIMAN, Sigma, but also more vectorial principles and matrices to calculate more efficient mass. So, I transform to Transformal to transform, we have to record that to contribute the model of stability, and that conditions that allow geometrical spaces when we work in the case of Higgs, it is stability, it is the conditions of the group, and it is the conditions of the general superficial condition. These conditions can be done, and one other space. No, they have other spaces that are more complicated, but this condition is what we expensar the fibrado combrado vectorial, a vectorial E, and the Higgs. The campus of Higgs, what is a campaign that is with the superficial sensor? So, the vamos pensar como un map. The voice is like a map that will vectorial fibrillation with differential forms about the superficial riba. How examples? Simples utilize examples. In the case of two people of the superficial rim, we are located and we are one of the two rare queues. The vectorial figure as a media, more medium, and we are going to consider the campo degree on the matrix, which will justimos there tensor with it. So, I can't say that the mascara is a media, that you will get a media, a media, tensor conca. But now, this implement a market that we have matrix, that is one and that we have. We homerida en ralidad va de qualamos un medio, escala un medio en solía cuanca que es una two forma different, a forma quadratic form. So what we have here, and even that one visit a identity, what we have here is a family of Higgs parametric differential about the superficial arrangement. And this family for the porque in particular. In particular, we describe the components of Hitchin, which Hitchin Studio, and that is a man to face when we consider this facilitation and study the geometry of this facility of perspectives, one of the things that we have in this And more conditions, for example, the groups, the groups general linear groups, and one range and the greatest in all the studies. If we don't regularly conduct these other. When these other things have the structure and structure, there is a complex structure compatible, which is conditions quantitative, and that defines simple structures, compatible structures, and that is very important in the agenda. And that is integral system, which is much like the dimensional system, and that allows duality between. And in particular, the EPEC, because we can understand the data, through the system integral system that the HIGH. But we can also other conditions to our fares. Our fair originally solutions to the equations in Hitchhiking, but we can regard conditions, for example, parabolic conditions, we can market in the supervisor of RIMA and people to Higgs. Al campus Higgs about singularities, we can regard singularity that are simplest in cushion case, or we see the parabolic structure or that mass wild Higgs on podemos chambers conditions in the superficial arrow. We mirror superficial rim, we have various dimensions more salt, we have. Saltas, we can put the points, and we have to, and we are generally in cushion that reconsider the other conditions that we stability, etc. Y una la manera que contrado with Mico Labrador, Steve Ryan, who is in Saskatchewan in Canada, to relax many generalizations, that works what we perpolid.  General, that loops, that rules are who are generosity, and the ramas are who the parabolic structures or singularities of Rango mature. What we have spaced from representation is in correspondence with the Higgs metamorphosis or with similarities of integrated similarities. And admitting a integral system, But the representation is that we don't know the complex part of the superficial rim, which is not what teaching much to their integral system. So, a lot of people who have a man understand. The integral system that mentioned that the figuration of Hitchin is a fibration of modern space, in which a way that the group and the differentials for superficial. Differentials for superficial riman degrees, the grados of polynomials, how invariants corresponding to that group. So, we have the tasks. The only hitching and what we do is a F of a Higgs and a figure, we have the characteristic polynomial. Of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix of the free matrix, because the coefficients are not invariant polynomials. And if it is theorist to figuration of hitching, and the integral system, however, in this figuration, we have our superficial rim, general, that will generate more, and what. And what is that proposition? And that the fibras are facios, and they have a queen that is facios to fenzar in the facio dual. And the management is fibrous in the science. When we are a point of vase, a point of view, the fencing as the auto values of the Higgs, recording that we are the characteristic that we do not know and auto facios. So, if they are a point of view, So, they are pointing auto-speaking, and the auto-dresses are like a covert of the superficial rim. So, the authorities will be multiple, they are ramifications, and generally separately. And so, the base, the brace, more than facios. So, we will generally lines about this covert. This covertura is. This covert what we have and the fever will be the variety, when we lose covered spectral coverage, or their varieties of covert. So, our fibrous features will have genetic vaccines, which is genetic, but also in space, sobre points singular. So, we will change singularities: the points where the characteristic of Higgs definitely reducible, a curb note. That point in this point singularity. So, in the case of the rango, perhaps when we are sex, as well, the regular points are the terminal fixed simples, and the points. Simples, and the point singular are when we have multiple. And the active son variety are various between Jacobian. One is that we have our figurations, so that passes correctly in transfiguration, which is another group. If it is another group, can contradict a correspondence between these figuracions, for example, what I did information about information. An information about it. And in particular, that passed when I put the group of England from the group. When the group of England groups appear in the confederacy of Stromina, who do because the two areas, and the confederate groups, the fibras of the model corresponding to the group of dualities in the events, they are varied. Various rule. So, it was provided by teaching many people, the duality for groups in particular and group more generally, but important to record is that these demonstrations are generic figures. So, one problem that passes with the fibers that are generic, which pass with the further singularity. That is a question that solution and that has many people. One understanding is valid about this singular fibre, it is understanding in terms of their space of fibras. Las Fibras. Here for the children recording that the model of X and compatible structures and simple structures compatible structure 3:60 and simple structures omega and omega and omega k. And through defining and reverence, and this. And then for the facio yellow fabric, I don't need the Higgs, and you have to face it, well, it's efficient. We are saying that a branch corresponding to the space with respect to one plexic form, and average complexity. And that are definitions because we are in the same way in the cuerdas. But the support is modified. So, we can solve the access that are and the support and the views. Also, like condition. How conditions of the cuerdas, but not the manager that we have. And we have three complexities, three simplicities structures. So, we have possibilities, so they are a superficial. Is that a subspace of my moduli that is the branch with respect to complex and complex forms, and that is a complex subject with respect to the hot complex. And the recording, the management that turns out the turn for employment to the indicator, the management that usually says that the complexity of the superficial summary. Of superficial arrangements that complex and industry, a complex, and host and the complex group. And many of them and validades to Higgs, we are generally the various convictions. The marriage and the audience is with the family of Higgs, but it can extend and understand the book to be varied. And we put symmetries, miramos la fibración de Higs, miramos la fibración de Higs about the bas y, preguntamos que lo que cómos de cuena brand. So, we are like, what is employment in goods? We are going to be able to do it. In building, we have types, and that's for example that correspondence to representation of the group of superficial groups. So, if you have corresponding vaccine, to see very particular faces of color, their faces of our duality based in a group of natural groups. And very, And very good in cases of physical cases, the conjecture valid conjecture, but allowing magnetic consequences. We are also in symmetry, we do not integrate reality, and we all relation logs with representations of three varieties, and And congratulations the space. No, that's not all time. If we have a question that is part of the question, we have a two minutes for the applications. Well, I wanted to preguntas in the sala and the travelling zoom. Super far. Well, that pregnant, but. Technology pregunta, but we are minus to verse. Pregunta me, porcelain. This y per polygonos que dibjaste, I lose enemas dynámic systems with shifts the market. Asti. Y aurita no recuerdo bien como como le dan el nombre, but Well, I record many. No, they are the moralities. So you have a point with varios lasos and mucha la memoria eso lego te paso bien el nombre cando. Y por favor y mintesa muchos y alien más. If you have a lot of. If you have ideas, I think many, like the idea, try to connect the piercings with our areas and much of the cyrus of the dynamic if it relaxes here, for also a question for this as the familiarity with the fibrous talks of the children. So, I would say that it is complicated, if that is natural.  And the manager that is mirando present in the firm of Higgs as a part of a virtual virtual and a campo, Philips implemented how a firm of linear solar solar coverture the supreme suffering. And this firm of linear figures who are a covered or a prime que establishment. But that we are not allowed to do not condition. Not conditions, but the impossible conditions for example that pass when we are grouped real representatives, like we said. For the group of representations of real groups, when a cosmopolitan model of Higgs, what if they are groups not compact and not script, so nothing and a object for example ranging in linear fashion? And then Excuse me, and what we have no alienization in the world in that parallel group or other facios, one of the fibrous non-son of alienos. Okay. Well, this is very interesting. Well, we passed other activities, we will here, but have the contact of the control for the question to. Las preguntas agendo a más a elante y bueno pueza categra dece vo utoche la Apláticas. Mucha, gracias.
