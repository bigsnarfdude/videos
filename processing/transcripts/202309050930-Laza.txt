Surroundings. Okay, today I'll discuss about isotrivial Lagrangian vibrations. And before I forget, this is all is jointly to Jon Jo Kim and Olivia Martin. Olyde MR. Okay, and before starting, let me start with a disclaimer. So we hope to have the paper out this summer. It didn't happen. All three of us had made major moves this summer. We changed the continent, each of us in a different direction. And we still hope that the paper is out. That the paper is out this week, it turns out that we found some small gaps and stuff like that. And anyway, the point is: you should take what I'm taking today and I'm trying to make clear what is proven and what we believe to be true. So you should take it with a bit of grain of salt. Additionally, I'm suffering the bad jet light. So anyway, hopefully it will be an okay. Okay, so in any case, Okay, so in any case, I think the subject is important, and I'm talking here about this one because I hope to stimulate some discussion. I'm looking forward for comments and all of that. Okay, so the motivation is something that motivates half of the talks here. So the motivation is, first of all, are there finitely many deformations like Like the formation types of hypercalors and the second one, kind of the complementary question, are there any new examples? I mean, I will not repeat whatever the standard introduction to hypertail talks to this conference. We know that there are the Conference: We know that there are the for the two series and two exceptional examples, and I will take it in. So, my expectation is yes to both. I mean, let me kind of qualify a bit. So, I think there is some evidence for one under the Under the assumption dimension equals 4 and B2 equals 23. And this is where I started so I have some work with John Jo on exactly this case Yalagradian generations. And for the for two, my expectation is that there might be exotic examples, exotic examples, special groups of automorphisms, special groups of automorphisms. And before going on, let me just mention kind of another topic that I'm. Another topic that I'm studying is with Jane Shang and Greg Push. We are studying at a fixed loss line of birational information on okay then. Extent and in that direction, and also need significant out of objects, and many others, and many others here. So, this would be complementary to one. Should be complementary to what Annalisa talked yesterday. So, we know that there are no regular automorphisms, but there are interesting birational automorphisms of grade 10. And I wouldn't be surprised that at the end of the day, you can find some extra examples in that way. Anyway, so today we are looking at Lagrangian hydration. So, I get all the, I'll get the setup X over V. Need to agree on vibration of a hypostellar n is half the dimension of x or the dimension of the page and n would be hypogenetic item now let's see. Oh, let's see. How can so what is well known, but let me just put it on. So the conjecture, I guess, one or two something like this is that D is odd and this is, of course, known. If the smooth war and now we test the whole spike of size and we start model sector and test that one can also in the case of Uh okay and in the fourth direction up yet uh this is and I mean the point is that for final classification itself for final classification we'll assume this content Okay, so either you work either you work in dimension four or you can make some sort of complicated statement assuming so I mean you bypass that okay the second thing to know when I mean this I think is a key today is that the RM of Of okay, here the attributions are I will put Poisson and pin hopefully I got it right so the the statement is that in this kind of situation the restriction maps so the h k the image of h k of x one to h On to hate of the fiber is set up to the cake over two a is even and zero on other one. So so so so so if I got the history right, uh Claire proved the statement uh first four eight was good. First for k equals two, then Shannon and B proof is for all for all k and there gave kind of a more more classical proof in all the cases. I mean, what it means, what it means, so in other words, in other words, I mean, my talk today would be impressionistic. I mean, kind of like, I cannot go into detail. So, so, in other words, the monod. Words the monodromy is the monodromistic of the family of ladies of varieties is different. So I see that I skipped the sentence that I wanted to say. The point is that we don't really have construction for hypertail and stuff like that. The only kind of accessible way to hypertail. Of accessible way to hyperscalers is via hyper via Lagrangian fibration. Under mild kind of conjecture for stuff like that, there are mild assumptions. Any deformation class starting with relatively low P2 will contain a Lagrangian member. And the Lagrangian hydrations are actually all easier to study because they are familiar with. Now, this is the key theorem in the story. What is this DRM telling you? Is that you really get a variation of what structures are going to be the variety type? It doesn't split in any way possible. It's kind of as irreducible as possible. In other words. So, the upshot, and I mean, I don't know if I'm presenting it correctly or whatever this is given. I mean, basically. I mean, basically, the upshot of this, and I think this is a key point here: Ben, Ben's through. This is again a theorem of completing by saying vector, making mild assumptions, very mild assumptions, mild assumptions. The conclusion is that kind of Lagrangian vibration of hyperpeller is either maximal in moduli moduli or I think okay. And of course, as I said, we study. I mean, kind of, I did some study and I did some results in the next chapter for plus additional accounts of 542. But this kind of went sideways and this will be an extra. Today we'll focus on the IPO5 case and what is kind of the hope. And what is kind of the hope why we are doing this? The hope is whatever some sort of classification, which basically should recover the standard examples. And the second part is if you are lucky, so one hope is that kind of extra hope. Exactly how much is that you'll get exhausted. And as you'll see, there are some things in that direction. So it's not kind of a hopeless task and whatever. So there might be, and I mean, I would. So there might be, and I mean, I would bet that in addition to the two exceptional examples of Ocravi, there might be more which come from very special groups, groups of automorphisms and stuff like that, and you'll see some things with that either. Okay, so let's see what we can do in the isotrigger state. So let's start with case three elliptic case three. So isotopia. And I mean maybe squeezing here, I should add an acknowledgement. So acknowledgement. So just in say one particle. In say one part is there is a paper from about six, seven years ago, but it is unfinished. And while writing this, we had some correspondence with them record, which seems to get similar results. Okay, so let's go to the iso PGL3 case, and basically, let me recall there are two. Called there are two basic constructions, right? And these are already kind of same on paper, and that this is same on and I think this is all true. So the first construction is the Kumar case. The Kumar case. So the Kumar case, I'm starting with A, an abelian variety. A an abelian variety which is a product of elliptic curves. Actually, I mean, it is too difficult to be isogenous. But anyway, so I'm taking a product of elliptic curves. And then, of course, I have A goes to E prime and mod out by plus minus one. I'm getting up to birational the Fumar surface method one. And of course, the point to note is here, so not here. So there are two notes kind of whatever, which are obvious. Any can be fiber. And the second point is that there exists a partner. A partner Lagrangian vibration. I mean, of course, I would have kind of the other Lagrangian vibration, isotrivial Lagrangian vibration. So this is the Kumar, the Kumar constructor. So I'm starting with the special Kumar surface, and I'm taking the two projections and this feedback. Okay, the second construction is what I will call the most construction. I mean, here one should mention also there is work of Hondo, there is also work of Korstan kind of. Kind of sort of five minutes about flat metrics single variety or especially so the the basic example here so kind of mastery example the basic example is I'm starting with C over P two the music's cover branch Branch with points and then I'm taking E omega times C, so this is a J-E-B-N-Curve, more toward the diagonal, near C section, and this, whatever this is of birational, this is birational for HP. For C. This will come, of course, with projection map T modulo one. I mean, here all the fibers are J invariant zero. So J0, and we would generically be I2, I25. The note two. The note to, and I mean, kind of the warning here, and I mean something to, I mean, generically, the peak of rest is just you and many modules kind of generically generate. There are nine more. So you have twelve points, and of course, 12 points, and of course, the delimit most of those are whatever you allow the points to come together. There is also a construction where you where you instead of these one, so you could relate to Eilenstein features, Eilbergstein features, and there is another construction where you go to Gaussian features and the key point here. I mean, kind of what kind of state is the state for whatever one observation here is that the month for. Here is the demand for eight group with SU1 and F of course two. And I mean in the language of people watching this one, the point is that F weak at the end of modification. And what makes this finite? I mean, I mean, the point is that this is a finite list. That this is a finite list, and what makes this finite is basically when you look at the Holtch theory, Holch theory here, what you need is that you have H1 of a curve with some mu and action. Actually, I mean three, four, six if you cook that. So you have a The Jacobian of a curve, or whatever, the homology of a curve with simplic group actions such that this decomposes into eigenstates, Hzeta plus H1, and one of them, something like H1, H zeta, has the coach structure of type one and this. Of type one, and this is this one here. This requirement is what makes this a finite list, and there is a classification representation of the already number. I mean, and essentially the classification of Moon and essentially overlaps with the Essentially, it overlaps with the classification of the technique more so that they define the viewpoint example. And the TRM, and I mean, I'm surprised, and I mean, I wouldn't claim our TRM. So this is a TRM. I will put it in star because I don't believe that we are the first one to establish it. So let's put the theorem. So I'm taking. So I'm taking X over B isotrivial for the immediate P1 here, isotrival K3. I'm taking G to be the monodal group. So this equation pi 1 of P0 into our of the fiber. Then the conclusion is that G is either G is either mu two, mu three, mu four, mu six. If G is mu two, then X is trans there exists a section. Then error is telling us over and there exists a bunch request. So, in other words, basically, these two constructions exhort the situation for K3 or ISO generos. Sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, hyphogenesis. So that's that's the statement. And I mean, one thing, and I mean, I will not be able to put one thing we try to work as much as possible without assuming a section. So some results will need a section, some results are kind of without a section. And actually, you'll see in a minute why. You'll see in a minute why actually it's important to work with POPO. Okay, can you turn the question? Yeah, so we don't know. I mean, it's about tor source over these things and whatever. So we didn't get, and you'll see actually, this is kind of in some sense. In some sense, we generalize this to all dimensions, and you'll see. Okay, so higher dimensions. So, example. I mean, this is embarrassing. And I mean, I would be happy to hear in higher dimensions. So, I would be happy, and this is my hope that I will hear more examples. So, how to produce ISO3GI. Isotrivial Lagrangian fibration. And I mean, there are two things, and whatever these are well known, maybe they're also in Seg1 paper. So in the K field, so if I start with S over B, which is isotrivial, so this would be P1 isotrivial, then of course I will get the, I don't know, XN, so X10. So extend to N1N and the composition isotrivial. So this is example of isotrivial on page 310. For Humar, for Humar N, what I do is the same kind of story. Same kind of story. So if I'm starting with going in variety, E times C prime, and I have the A goes to E prime. Then I have to take, then I have to take the sum, so I'm taking A n plus one goes to A. I'm taking the kernel of this one. This should map to the kernel of. To the kernel of E prime to the n local p and then I move downwards by the symmetric n plus one and this will give you the nice unfortunately. Unfortunately, this point is open, but I believe it's expected that exists isolagranian vibration on OG6 and OG OG 10. I mean the point what is the difficulty here? The difficulty is that kind of Lagrangian hydration on all different And I mean, I think the results of Wang and Webre say that this is never, this is never so if I'm not. So, if I'm looking at the isotrivial Lagrangian hydration, I'm taking the cubic fourfold, I'm taking the general hyperplane section that will have my so I'm saying what I'm saying is that the hyperplane section of a cubic of a cubic fourfold, the generic one will have maximal variation. On the other hand, on the other hand, x can degenerate, x can degenerate to the X can regenerate to the second, sequent to the very, and actually, this is not good enough. It can degenerate even deeper to elliptic A3. And I think that will actually work to produce the LSV family isotribia Lagrangian fibrin. But there are things to check and whatever. So this is one that we start. Okay. And the second thing to say, just to give an ex an expectation. An expectation. So humar type construction, human type construction with higher dimensions. So basically, why not? What happens if I'm taking x to be a times a prime modulo g so a prime? A price permanent variety, then G G diabolic. And then I would like to check this paper over change. Now, if I'm assuming the conjecture, assume the one conjecture, then A prime over g is. Over G is isomorphic to PN, and it turns out that there is a URL output where they are so they classify. So they classify basically exactly these situations. So this is an abelian variety. G fixes the origin. And they even assume that this is more after. And then the conclusion is: first of all, A has to be a product of elliptic curves, and second of all, Second of all, G is very special. G is either sigma n plus one acting on kernels. So a n plus one a the sum map by permutation or g is sigma n times mu to the n. To the end acting on the liquid first to the end by permutation at mu is good signal or and this is of the right n equals two so this is the dimension so I mean half the dimension of the hyperscalers. Dimension of the hyperteller and she is the police group with this order 16 order 16 acting on each square with the 16 model of side side. So, just to repeat, so remember that the first construction was the product of two elliptic curves, modulo or diagonal group action. So, why not something similar in higher dimension? I don't even require to be hypertailer. I'm just using the fact that the base of the vibration has to be air. And it turns out that whatever is clear in this business and whatever from the beginning. This business and whatever from the beginning, it is clear that whatever the key role is classification of groups of authoromorphism of fabilian varieties and stuff like that. And it turns out that smooth quotients of fabelian varieties are classified, and there are these three possibilities. Two of the possibilities correspond, I mean, these are actually realizes correspond exactly to the H3. Actually, the first one is Umar N, and the second one is a K3N isotabial vibration, isothibial sequel. And the last one is exactly the thing that I was saying. There are hints there might be more hyperkeler for kind of like the exposed hyperkeler, for instance, the last one. The last one actually will produce a hyperkeler. Actually, we produce a hyperteller, but it's only orbifold. We are still in the process of determining so there exists a kind of an exotic orbifold, which I think is new, produced by this kind of like product of special abelian varieties, where kind of the group, the monodonic group is this poly group. Did I say the poly group is an order 16 group, whatever it is, this it comes from 50%. It comes 15414. And we, I mean, there is still hope, so what we get is singular, but there is still hope there might be something new coming from like a twisted version of that one. Okay? Any question or so? So that's okay. So now let's go to our insert. So it's search. Okay, the setup is first of all, so again, kind of here we obtain this hydrovedial base and b is ideal. These are the basic assumptions. We take g I mean, of course, d zero would be the sum of the locus, and we take g to be And we take G to be the one out of the group. So this was a image five one C1 G L is H1. So L is the fiber and you would be kind of U is the what G cup. What have you done from G cover from zero? This is trivialized. This is trivialized from a blocker system. And then it's easy to see that this is the final so the base. So, the basic lemma of course is that G X faithfully on H1 of the fiber and respect the coach function and in other words, H one F is is uh in multiplied on where m is the mark for a so i mean the the more kind of non-trivial arguments involve kind of representation theory and i mean the whatever i guess the tendency point of view is to fuse the construct The view is to view the code structure as a representation of the mouth or data, the top of the mouth of Facebook. Okay, and the key factor of three factors which I'm suggesting about Shen in if I'm looking at a hormonology project. Hormology. So this is going to be a variety. This will be whatever's the result of hormones. If I'm looking at the invariant, this is better to the k over 2 and 0 k1 and so I mean this is just the particular case which I think is the same. Is just a particular case, which again tells you that the monodrome is thick. And what it tells you is that so kind of corollary or whatever, it tells you that H1 of F is irreducible. I mean, this is S G or structure, and maybe. And maybe kind of spelled out more. This means V would be kind of H10 of F. This is an irreducible G module. I mean, remember that basically there is a community action, so this would be Heritage G action, and this would be registerable as. And this is identical as G module. And we look at minus H1 of F as a code structure. So forget the G action. The G action. It's easy to see that this is isophila. I'm what it means is that this is That this seems to be, I don't know how correct it won't take copy of the wider of the weight one. Okay, so so far so far no no so far any time. No sort of coming. So, in other words, in other words, so I mean, everything is over Q or something. So, in other words, the fiber is product of something isogenous or product of a BMRI. And And the first QRM and then there's a safety is that the dimension of eight one of two, and we actually claim by this. But this is the example. On the way here, they discover a small depth. So we see the exactly claim designation. One, in other words, the fiber logon isotricial like an isolated filtration is isogenous if you can call that. I think the claims of the claim is definitely true. So, of course, it is true and it's all for obvious reasons. And I think it also has a point which has dimension. So, the so we were about we were. So we were about to post the paper claiming that it's always a power of analytic curve. It turns out that that proof doesn't quite work. We still have the original proof that worked in dimension four and whatever we hope to back logo. But anyway, so the point is that this is kind of very special, and I will not be able to. I will not be able to go into details here. So, what is the main point? So, the main point is that, as I said to Shen in Wazan, says that G is the monodrome group, which forces that the endomorphic of the H1 of S to be small. To be small. Hopefully, I got it correctly here. So it means this is a Q algebraic for something dimension over two and the more H1 is let's equal that for, which in turn remember that whatever M and G are commutment actions, which forces so. So M leads me inside functions like the endomorphism of G of H1 and basically forcing them to be so this is this is the general philosophy and whatever I have so big monodrome is for So big monodrome it forces small mamphort group forces special hold structure and and whatever in particular it follows easily that the dimensions of there is some sort of inequality connection of a to the square times times some sort of quadratic field that some things of the m over q of x equals Not necessarily, but I mean, I think what Ben observed is that an immediate corollary, even we say an immediate corollary of this one, is that is that maybe if B2 greater than equal to seven, it implies that the generic Lagrangian fibration is not isotropic. So the man for tape being small, it doesn't mean that because you can have kind of whatever even very small map for tape loop and kind of no algebra. No, no, no, algebraic class or something. But in any case, the punchline, and you see that this is kind of sharp, then I mean, it remains. So if the dimension of A is two, then whatever you get is real multiplication, you get other stuff. So we actually are pretty sure that we can include that one. Okay, the second thing. Okay, the second type of result is what can I say about how about the base? How about the thing? And I mean, long story short, let me put it here. So you remember is the base trivializing R1 times over R2. R1 times over R 3 and the current say that U is either is either is either a Belian variety or birational for Belian variety or an open subset of a variety of general subconscious We call this type A and this would be type B. So this is for K3. These are the tumor types, the tumor construction, and this will be most of the M construction. So, you have an isoto trivial Lagrangian vibration and the base trivial lighting the vibration is either it's either abelian, not a vibration, the local system, it's either trivial, is the same type of dichotomy. And I think kind of in the K3 case, you see that you would discover kind of humor and. In which they cover kind of Umar and Delinmosto. I mean, the problem is that the Lin Mosso at some point becomes Umar. So, so it's kind of whatever some of the Delinmosto cases are also. So, there is an overlap. And any question here? And the point, what is the point here? So, what is the big point? So, what is the idea here? I mean, the idea is that. I mean, the idea is that basically, I don't know, we have X over B Lagrangian, hypertailer. So here we use hyperteller. So there exists a 2040 form. And this one by basically by Kune, by QNEC, this has to come from. Has to come from one zero tensor one zero. The only way you can get this holomorphic form that is holomorphic form is from one zero on the base on H1 of the fiber and this is on H1 of you one weight of the H1. So this this two zero four So, this two zero form is a mixture of one zero from the base and one zero from the kind of an irreducible almost irreducible almost irreducible G representation and and this one has to the upshot is that H one of U will contain it to see One thing is to see the world, which is kind of a piece of the presentation. So basically, you get lots of one form and lemma or something maximal alphabet. So so, okay, I mean, I slept with a few hours last night, so so I wouldn't but but I think at this point uh doesn't depend so much on the on the on the uh on the kind of spoken what Are kind of slow name and whatever. Those are sorry. Yeah, yeah. So, so, so, so, so, so, so, I think here really doesn't, it doesn't. And I mean, as I said, I mean, I mean, you get something that looks good, but it's singular and whatever kind of the argument. I mean, the arguments, the smoothness come kind of in the in the first count that we'll do. Count that will be okay. So, so basically, basically, basically, basically, you get something of maximal Albanese dimension, and then you also use that whatever Babelian variety that you map, this kind of V is irreducible. So, basically, the basic fact is that if I have, let's see if I get it right. So, that's a theorem of Ueno. The basic theorem of Ueno says that. Says that sub-variety of simple Rabelian variety is of general type. And then Kabamata makes it to finite morphist to a Nobelian variety and so on. So the irreducibility of the representation and this the way it works gives you this. So the base, the base is, and this defines type A and type B. Type A and type B. Okay. And now the final thing, and but so the final thing is a classification. Okay, yeah. So the final thing. And I mean, the main QRM. So those are fine. And I mean, so here there is a small issue. So hopefully it will still fall back. So, hopefully, it will still hold, but anyway, so here let's assume that X over P is an isotrivial Lagrangian hydration of type A. And we make two assumptions. Assume there exists a section, a rational section. Section and here is a smoothness wherein something will play. The second thing is that we actually assume that one conjecture in dimension, in dimension and then the URL is a X X is the formation of equivalent either common and if that is kind of like what about the standard and the standard And I think here one should not not, it doesn't suffice here, does not sufficient doesn't suffice to assume it's isomorphism. I mean, the point, the point here, and I mean I will stop here. So the point of the theorem is that by theorem, you produce this second BM. Use this second abelian variety for UP F, which is an abelian variety, and two gives you this U of this size and also K prime, which is an abelian variety. And what we prove basically is that there exists kind of a second Lagrangian vibration. There exists a second Lagrangian vibration. Is the second Lagrangian hydration canonically the second Lagrangian hydration with fiber with generic fiber A prime and then basically we conclude that X I mean here we use the existence of a section we conclude that X is birational to the quotient of K prime time. Portions of state line size double or g and this is the diagonal and then the state line diagram has two terms and we give you the classification of the non-natural one. That's basically what I what I have what I have to present.
