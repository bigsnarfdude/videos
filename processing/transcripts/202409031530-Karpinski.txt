Okay, so the first speaker this afternoon is Christopher Karpinski from McGill University who speaks about hyperfinateness of boundary actions for graphical small cancellation pieces. Yeah, thank you very much Annette and thanks to Joter and Cassio for Whitey is a great place for conference. Yes, what I'm about to say is joint work with Damian Mutir, Kamehameha Mutier, and Koichi Oyakawa for Vanderbilt. We'll talk about hypervidedness of boundary actions. Got for that small transition. Okay, let's go a little bit more. Okay, so if we have some hyperbolic space X. So if we have some hyperbolic space X, then of course we can associate to this formal boundary. And if we have a group that acts on X by isometries, then this induces an action by homeomorphisms of G on the boundary. Okay, and in many situations, for instance, if G acts geometrically on X and G is a hyperbolic group, we can say nice things about the action of G on the boundary. In that case, it's a convergent group action. But what can we say? But what can we say kind of more generally? You know, for many general examples of G-acting on X, can we say anything sort of nice about the G-action on the boundary? And today I'll tell you a condition about that related to the structure of the orbits called hyperfiniteness. And hyperfiniteness basically means that you can sort of restructure your orbits to look like ones. I'll define this with this later. I'll define the space later. And what's interesting is that for many of your favorite groups acting on hyperbolic spaces, the induced boundary action has this nice hyperfiniteness property. Orbits are particularly simple. They look like lines. And my goal for today is to tell you about this for the case when g is this class of non-positively, combinatorially non-positively curved groups, graphical small cancellation, and x is one of their natural K graphs. So let me write down the theorem. So let me write down the theorem and people remain on the board. We start Ethereum with Damien and Cuichio. So this says that if G is A C prime, okay whatever, one over 14, it's an arbitrary constant, well not arbitrary, but there is. Well not arbitrary, but there's graphical small cancelation group. Okay, with the mysterious property, and I couldn't think of a good name for this, so I'm going to call it the bounded page property. You'll see why that's a good name later on. And why is its so-called thickening? Is its so-called thickened Cayley route and the action of g on the boundary of y is this simple ordinance structure. Okay, so for most of the talk, I just want to tell you what these things are, and then maybe if we have time at the end, we'll sketch. Time at the end, we'll sketch a little bit about the let's get started with graphical small transition. Okay, so this is a generalization of the classical small cast three, which I don't think has been defined yet, but will be defined in future talks. Will be defined in future talks, but I'm not going to do it. So we start off with a finite set S. I guess it doesn't have to be finite, but typically it's finite. And we start off with a sequence of finite connected graphs that are labeled by S oriented graphs. Label by S. Okay, so we assign to their edges elements of S, compatible with the orientation. Then we're going to let data be the disjoint union of these graphs. Data S will be the connected components of data. Now, from this data, we can associate a presentation for a group called a graphical presentation. So we'll write that as S data. So write that as S theta. And what this is, is it's the group of generating set S. Okay, then what are going to be our relators? Well, our relators, intuitively, they should be sort of cycles, right? So that's what we're going to do. We're going to take as our relators the label of the simple closed paths of theta. Closed path. Simple closed path. Okay, so we have some. Okay, so we have some, we might have some graph, you know, some data graph theta n. And then we just read the words of those cycles that we have here. Those are related. Okay, so we want to build a small cancelation theory out of this, so let's define the notion of pieces in this set. So a piece is a path P inside of theta n, which occurs in two distinct ways in theta. So what does that mean? There exists a path q inside of the theta n. Q inside of theta M, potentially the same M, N as there, with the label of P and Q the same. And such that these are distinct in the sense that there is no label-preserving isomorphism between graphs, which takes That's a piece. Just think of it: a path that occurs in two distinct ways. Okay, and then the graphical symbol transition condition that we're going to define as the metric one. So for lambda greater than zero, this presentation, or rather the group defined by this presentation, is graphical. C prime lambda. If pieces are short relative to the relators in this presentation, relative to closed paths. Another way to say that is that for every piece p inside of some component theta n, the length of p is less than lambda times the curved. Of p is less than lambda times the group of the recall that the earth is just the minimum length of a closed cycle. Okay. These are the kind of groups that we will be. Okay. And so these graphs theta n, we call them the related. And in, we call them the relators for our graphical presentation. It's a bit confusing because it's not the cycles themselves that are the relators in our graphical presentation, but it's these actual graphs themselves. Data n. This is what we refer to as the relators, and why is this suitable terminology? Because if you think of these data ends as being actual cycles, like closed loops, Close loops, then the graphical presentation is exactly a classical one, and the graphical sequence limited condition boils down to exactly the classical condition. So we call these relators up. Okay, so now let's talk about some Hayley graphs that are associated with these graphical small transition groups. One kind of obvious Cayley graph that we can associate to our group is just a Cayley graph coming from generating set S. But this is going to be the boring developer. We don't really like this Cayley graph. But it's locally finite, but it's not hyperbolic in general. But there's a more interesting Heliograph called the Bickender-Kundoff heliograph. And the idea is we take our Keely graph X and if G is small cancellation, then these theta n's isometrically embed into X. And what we can do is cone them on something, sort of make them diameter. Sort of make them diameter one subsets. Kind of like we do in relatively parabolic groups, colon off the parabolic subgroups, like cosets. And if G is sufficiently cancelation, then this graph Y ends up being hyperbolic. And it's what we call the Kundoff or thinking keel. More precisely, we deal with W. B follow the elements that are represented by paths in theta. Let W V all a G such that there exists a path P inside of theta N such that the length of P, such that the label of P is G in the group. And group Rancisto prompt. The rubric is to prove that if we look at the Cayley graph of G together with S tailored with W, then this is hyperbolic. If G is C prime 1, 6, graphical translations. This will be the Calendly graph that we're going to look at. Okay. So that's all I wanted to say about graphical spot translation. Any questions or queries? So the graph, each of the graphs is finite or they might be infinite? Here we take them to be finite. Yeah. That's their number infinite. Yeah. It can be finite as well, but finite means you get something hyperbolic. So that first point there, what does that mean? X heliograph looking at not Xbox. Oh, so it's saying that if you take the heliographic perspective, this finite generated set S, the labeling set, just that, unless your collection is like finite or something like that. This will rarely be a hyperbolic heliograph. But we make it hyperbolic by coning off these bedded. And there we go. Okay, so now let's talk about hyperbinas. This other piece of the puzzle. Okay, so hyperbinous, this is something that's not really in geometric group theory. It's something that we that people study in descriptive set theory. But it's sort of been making its way into geometric group theory. Sort of been making its way into geometric group theory over time, thanks to people like March and Sabach and Rubo Kilter's work. So, this has to do with equivalence relations on things called Polish spaces. I'll tell you what that is. So, the Polish space X is a separable and completely trizyle topological state. Topological space. And now an equivalence relation E on X is called hyperfinite. Kind of, as I said before, we can kind of structure its orbits or its classes to be lines. More precisely, More precisely, it's hyperfinite if there's a Borel action at z, the integers, on x, such that e is the orbit equivalence relation of z. So the equivalence classes are just the orbits of z. And an action of g on x is hyperfinite if it's more than equivalence relations. If it's more than equal to relationships relation. So this is what I mean by the orbits kind of look like Z lines. There's a Borel action Z, which induces the same orbits as your back. What are some examples of these features? Features. So, one example coming from sort of cometorics is this Taylor equivalence relation. Taylor equivalence on S to Dn. So S is some set, and we define this Taylor equivalence relation. How do we do this? It's E T. So if we take two sequences, xn and yn here, we see that they're tail equivalent, if and only if they have the same tail. So there exists nm, especially for every k, if we look at xn plus k, that's the same as yn plus k. So in other words, So in other words, kind of mark off. So this is xn and this is yn and these two tails are exactly the same. So these hyperliners. Okay, so from the hyperfiniteness of this, we get a bunch of examples of hyperfinite boundary actions of non-positively pure. So let me kind of give you a survey of sort of what's known and the PC. So in the 90s, it was shown by descriptive. In the 90s, it was shown by descriptive set theorists Dewardy, Jackson, and Kekris, DJK, that if we take f to the countable free group, then the action of f on the boundary is hyperbolic on the broken boundary. How do they show this? Well, they use the hyperbolic. Well, they use the hyperfinness in this Taylor Cochrane solution. Because if we take a boundary point in F, then we can represent it by a unique sequence from the identity, or a unique geodesic from the identity, like gamma psi. And then we can take xi and then map it to the label of gamma psi in STDN. And then it's not too hard to check that two boundary points are F-related if and only if these labels are tailor-qualid. And then from the hyperfinadness of ET, we can sort of pull that back to the hyperfinidness of F. E T implies E L. Yeah, that's not quite pictured. And since this result, this is from the 90s by the way, 94, people have been asking, okay, give me your favorite group, give me your favorite hyperbolic G space, much like your facts, is the boundary action hyperfine? And that's sort of the game that I've been playing. Last couple years. And yeah, so let me tell you a little bit about how to sort of prove hyperfinance for these graphicals. My cancellation groups are the idea. So we look at g output boundary of y. Okay, what's the idea here? We take a boundary. We take a boundary point and we are presented by a geodesic grade for one, which is actually a two design grade in this x kilograph. Let me just write the idea in one sentence and then we're done. Idea, represent psi in the boundary y by two desix in x. X and then um then D T plus X being finite implies that E G is equal of definite index to the Taylor College function. That's all for all sake. Thanks. Are there questions? Are there questions? What's the paralysis action from the tail? Is that an obvious thing that that's for finite or is that? No, this is a theorem. And actually, they use a different definition, I think, yes. This is also by some people. It's in the same paper here, DJK, from the 90s. And they use a different definition of hyper. And they use a different definition of hyperfiniteness, which is to write this as an increasing union of the so-called finite equivalence relations, Rn. So finite meaning that their equivalence classes are finite. So they sort of do a bunch of cognitorics to decompose this as this increasing union of these finite equivalence relations. And then you can show that that definition is equivalent to having, to being induced by a Z action. It's not totally true. Yeah, it's not totally true. We don't want to see what this addiction is here. There are more questions? I also wanted to know what is this BPP. Oh yeah, yeah, it's what I was explaining to you. Yeah, yeah, so like basically you can't find books with too many pages inside of these graphs, theta n. So there exists some constant k such that Such that there's an upper bound on how many cycles inside of theta n you have that share a common path. So we call this path P. Then there's an upper bound, k, a uniform upper bound, such that for every n, the number of cycles in theta n sharing Sharing a path with P is at most P. So you can't have folks with more than K pages across all different letters. We need this for this finite index thing. This is kind of this order of the finiteness condition. Thank I always be kind of a little bit more expensive. The next speaker said,
