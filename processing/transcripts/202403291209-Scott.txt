We just check and publish file for the next one. No, it's in five minutes. I need to leave it for five minutes. Okay. It come up in the captcha though, like in that flip. There was like a 1206 to 1208. Yeah, I think it's probably going to work, which would mean that it's not the mail server spot, but it was something that happened on the castle. Yeah. But there is a check in the published file. So the So I can't think why, but the capture.mov gets renamed to that workshop dash meeting ID thing, and then the publish.rb or publish fire.rb is supposed to take over, emerge to mp4, and then do whatever it's going to do. So they send out the tweets and stuff, and that's the script, it'll depend on the email server because that's the one that is about to send the license file and all that stuff. Yeah. That stuff. So I expect a failure in there, but I don't think it's supposed to. If it removes the file from rounds and you get the dot n from 4, I think it's supposed to just leave the.lob and raise. Yeah. So I know last week we did have two kind of issues, didn't we? There was the one where four videos just disappeared in the afternoon. But there was another one where videos just didn't get published. So um So um they were made, they were in the capture folder, but they never made it onto the website or anything. Okay, that's probably what we're about to see the second of those. The first one is more mysterious. Yes, it's the last thing. Where do we start with the already? We're in two minutes. We have another few minutes or so. But yeah, the second little sort of makes sense. Published scripts. Yeah, it doesn't look like it's wrapped in anything. It just tries the notes on the email, which is Ah, this time crazy.   Remember which one you remember when and what the ID was for one of the ones, but was in the second group, so didn't stay on the disk, didn't send it, didn't publish. So sorry, did stay on the disk, but didn't publish? Yeah, yeah. Um not off the top of my head, but I think I can work it out. If you remember what day as well, just start browsing through the whole I want to say it was a Wednesday, but that's just pure off the top of my head. Okay, I'll start looking there to see if there are any afternoon thing? Uh it was definitely afternoon that didn't work at all. I'm not sure about the question. I'm not sure about the how much. If it was a Wednesday, it would just be a morning. Pretty quickly sex producer. So this this was all um like on the weekend of the 18th, or the week of the 18th oh sorry, yeah, so I'm not meeting. So it's five two six seven, that group. That's what it was. I'll jump back to the button. I was looking through the blog for next Wednesday and there's published videos going out at like half past ten. Oh, there's maybe a variety of SM. Yeah, I did do a I uploaded a whole chunk of SM. I don't, yeah, maybe that's where it came on. Makes sense. Okay, let's see. So Wednesday last week would have been the 20th.  Okay, this looks like one. So, Professor Nicodemi, so Wednesday morning at nine, the email didn't get sent out until the evening of the next day. So, I think that's one that I uploaded manually. So, So I think that's going to be five zero zero two seven around from nine to nine. Yeah, I don't see it anymore. Yeah, there's only one eight on 28 at 111 and I don't think there's any error line right here. That's good. Well it should to block consultation or publication notifications. It shouldn't be like in the block for DRS. It should say sending computation notification to film name. Notification notification to show name regardless of whether the email went out or not because that happens before you actually send the message. Yeah. And I don't see those purposes lectured on the 20th. There's literally one of those and it's for Libra to Dr. Carrie. Yeah, so for Dr. Carrie, I haven't got any email notification in my inbox for that. So sorry, yeah, you got it. It's clearly being a sent email form so 11 Dr. Carrington. I don't have one in mind of that. I'll have another check which is trash. And I think the five minutes have passed.
