For this wonderful workshop. And I'm Shen Ju Huang from I'm now a postdoc in University of Maryland. And today I'm going to talk about KNA fractal model, which is one of the refracton models that has non-VM particles in it. And I like this model because it's arguably Is arguably one of the simplest models that has now really an article and open questions. So first I would like to thank my collaborators, Adam and Fran, unfortunately he's not here because he has some issues with his visa. The household, he's here and he will be talking about another kind of Talking about another kind of fractal models that I'll have, non-BDM fractons. And also, I'm not looking at my current with my PHP advisor. So I feel I don't really need an introduction of fractals here, but I will keep it short. So fractal topological orders. By here topological orders just means I have a gap to the current state. Gap to the ground state. And so this is a gap state in three spatial dimensions. And we have non-trivial ground state delivery, let's say putting on the three toros. And it's locally indistinguishable by some local operators. And we have point like citations that cannot be graded locally. So these are all properties that are the same as the user. The same as the usual topological order in two dimensions. So, but what is different, or the defining characteristic of this fractal model and fractal phases, there are some excitations that have restricted mobility. For example, we can have fractons that cannot be moved by any local operators without creating other excitations. Or we can have sub-dimensional particles that can move but only within some subspace. Within some subspace. And the growth state degeneracy, if you calculate on some three trolls, say it will grow with the C-sub size. And also the number of super selection center in the region actually grows with the volume of the regions. So these are properties that beyond the usual TQ of T. And so this XQ model is maybe one of the things. Execute model is maybe one of the simplest flattened models. So it's exactly solvable models, consist of commuting projectors. And in the following few slides, I will briefly review these execute models and all its properties, excitation properties to make sure we are on the same page. And later, I will discuss a magnet. Later I will discuss a mechanism, like how to go from staking of traditional topological order to this fractal model. Yeah. So yeah, I talk about mechanisms for fractal models. By mechanism, I really mean how to get from one phase to another phase by condensing some excitations. So I will show you. So h uh I will show you that here by stacking in a bunch of particles and then condensing some extended objects, I will call it P string or set, you represent particle string. Like condenses p strings, I can go from stack of total models to SU models. And later on you will see that this mechanism can be generalized to a stack of non-abelian topological orders. Yeah, so this SQ model has fretons. So fractons is the excitations that validate these cube terms. So you add this sigma, a bumped sigma Z, it's like a membrane. It creates four fractions at the corner of this membrane. So and So, and there are no local operators operators I can create a single fractons. And if you want to move, say, these fractons by I think a Z here, you end up creating more fractons. So you cannot move a single one of them. So these are totally immobile excitations. However, bound state of two fractions can move along a 2D plane. So if we add a ducture of sigma z here, you can see that this fractal, you can turn the corner, so it can move within this plane, but you can not go up. So there are also charge excitations, which are excitations that Are excitations that violate these vertex terms. And these charges, they are one-dimensional in the sense that they can only move in the one-dimensional line. So these are created by say sigma x. But when you try to, let's say you have these one-dimensional charges, when you try to create a sigma x here, and I try to make it You know, make it turn a corner, you know, create excitations in a system is coded. So that's why it cannot move in a two-dimensional point. It can only move in a one-dimensional line. And so, and if you look at the ground-state wave function, if you focus on the z basis, and you will find that near the you will find that uh you know near a single vertex uh this configuration this string configuration is not a dump. So here I draw blue means like let's say I have spin down for example. So usually you know a string can freely turn the corner in the usual toric horizontal and but here this is not allowed. So you may know that in the usual torque So you may know that in the usual toric code we can draw the Granc wave function this way. It will be some fluctuating strings. But here, because this configuration is not allowed, so the Gransey wave function is actually in the fluctuating configuration of these cages. And you'll see that this picture also generalizes to Narbidian for example in the cagement models. So yeah, uh so we can actually get these SQ models by couple uh layers of toric code models. So here we have uh layers of toricode stacking along x, y, and z direction. So each of this layers is a toric code. So on each link we actually have uh two qubits uh like this. Like this. And we want to couple this total in some way that you end up have a XQ model. So the term we add is this ZZ coupling on each one. So in a swamp coupling limit, let's say we take this term to be very large. This cube term becomes a perturbation. And if you do a degenerate perturbation theory, Degenerate pervasion theory, you end up with this cube term. And this is the F-cube model. And the meaning of this ZZ coupling is that in a decoupled layer picture, you actually create this 4N particle. So this is like a loop, but the is built by these n particles. n particles. And say if you keep create this acting is easy and it spawns, you actually, you know, you create a larger P string. So in the strong coupling limit, you actually, what you do is actually condense these P strings. So by condensing this P string, you can go from stage autoicles to SQ model. And this is one of the mechanism we know. Like how to uh uh how to go from a more traditional uh topological orders to uh factor orders. So what's nice about this picture is that uh you can actually, you know, from the breaking statistics of this P string and the underlying particles, you can determine what will be the excitation count. What will be the excitation content after you do this P-string condensation? So, for example, this P-string is built by a bunch of N particles. So, you have non-trivial braiding statistics with a single E particles coming from some layers. So, I should remind you that in a topological order, when you count it some order when you counted some annuals, then everything have non-trivial braiding statistics with these annuals will be confined. So here this E particle, because you have non-trivial braiding statistics with P strings, so it will be confined. But the bound states of E particles, you know, one E particle may come from this layer, another E particle may come from this layer. This bound state will have a tree. say we have a trivial breeding statistics with P strings. So this particle survives after the P string condensation. And so this becomes the one dimensional or the binomials in the SQL model. And fractals is actually the ends of open P strings. And you know sus and And you know, s and you know, in a decoupled layer, you have this picture. But once you condense the P string, you know, this string becomes invisible. It can fluctuate. And then near this end, you will end up with fractal recitations. And also the string ends cannot move individually without breaking the strings. So that's why you actually, you know, you need to create more fractals. To create more fractals. Yeah. So, yeah, now I'm going to generalize this picture to non-abelian topological order. So, essentially, I want to replace like each of these layers by some non-abelian topological orders. Black orders. And the model I'm going to use is called the string name models, which is one of the country models I can realize is now a deviant of logic order. So here I'm going to briefly review what is the string net models. It's a exactly solvable model defined on a trivalent lattice. Usually it's defined on Usually it's defined on some high-colon lattice, but here we use this kind of truncated square lattice. And each link is labeled by a string type. Could be 0, 1, 2, 2. And at each vertex, we assign some branching rules that tell us how this string can feel, what are the allowed configurations. The growth states in this model actually fluctuating strings. But with this phase factor, and this phase factor is really important. So we demand that the ground state wave function was satisfied just following local constraints of strings. So for example, the string can be freely deformed. When you annihilate a string, you get a phase factor. Phase factor, and when you reconnect a string in this way, you also get a phase factor. And this would be kind of the input data of your string name model. It's how you define this model. You need to specify this data. And the Hamiltonian of the string name model. Of the string name model consists of this vertex turn and this Parquet turn. So it's similar to a torico. Now this vertex turn actually implements this branching structure. Like if the string configuration is allowed, it's what we want. You know, we keep it. If it is forbidden, we give it an energy penalty. And we also have a plaque turn, which is defined in this way. It's a weighted sum of this BPS operator. And this operator is defined in this way. So you imagine you create little strings inside the plaques, and you use these local rules. Use these local rules, try to fuse these little strings to these edges of placets. And you pick up various phase factors, a bunch of F's. And that will go into definition of the pluget operators. So this is a string net model. Now, we were going to focus on a very special kind of string net model. kind of string, string net models where you can find excitations that violate only these B terms. This is not always true in string net models. The technical language is that the input data is a unitary module, a tensor category. But for those who don't really study topological orders, all you need to know is that we focus on some strings. Is that we focus on some stringline models where there are some excitations that value in the B p term. And we're going to call those excitations flux. And it turns out that you can also find the corresponding nanium contents, it corresponds to this AA bar. And especially, we're going to focus on the case where this flux excitations is up. Is abelian. Maybe it's possible to generalize it to non-abelian flux, but so far I don't know how to do it. So let's focus on the case where this flux is abelian. And just to give you a flavor how this flux incitation is created, so you will have like the string operation. Like the string operator is defined in this way. You have this string operator acting on a button. It actually only gives you a phase factor. The phase factor is related to the breeding phase of this anion, of the flux and the anions on these edges. Diagrammatically, it looks like this. So this excitation will validate on So, this excitation will violate only BP terms. And when you want to make a long-string operator, you simply just take a product of these operators. Now, because now we have these flux operators, which is abedian, these are very similar to the end particle in the torico. So in this class of models, it's easier to generalize this T-string condensation process. So we take like stacking of string name models that has this property and we add a coupling, you know, that actually creates P string citation. So now I add a coupling that Now I add a coupling that I create this four flux, abedian flux. I made this turn very large. So that will implement this P string or flux string condensation process. After I condense these P strings, I will end up with fractal models that are similar to the XQ models, but it's a non-belian version. Now I'm going to give you a simple example where now the input data is the icing annuals. So in icing annuals we have trivial particle, we have icing anions, and also this side is a fermion. And this ising anions and side will have a non-trivial state. And side will have a non-trivial statistics, abedian statistics. And it turns out that it's actually basically all you need to know to derive the excitation content. If you take this input data and in the string name model in two dimensions, you actually have nine distinct ambions. This bar means that you actually conjugate the Actually, conjugate the usual gradient phase of, I think, any of us. Yeah. So, yeah, we can write down a Hamiltonian very explicitly, but it's not very illuminating because we can understand this excitation by this P string condensation picture. By looking at breeding statistics of P strings and these anions, we can derive which particle is confined. And Is confined and which particle is decompliant. Yeah, so you know this T string corresponds the flux string or T string corresponds to this guy, this side side bar. So we actually want to condense the so the flux strings made out of this side side bar part. Is made out of this side side bar particle. And also, remember that side bar will have non-trivial braiding settings with stigma and sigma bars. So all the excitations that have R number of σ bars will be confined because this braiding phase. And once the deconfined planons would be this particle, this will have trivial braiding statistics with in fact. Grading statistics with the saturated bar string. And the fractal says actually the central side side bar string is the open end of this side side bar. But because the side side bar is abedian, so here we have abedian fractons. And the bandside of two fractons is the the side-side bar flux, which is a planar. R flux, which is a planar. And we also have the nylons. So it's similar to the nylons in the XQ model. But here, the nylon is actually made out of icing anions. Because icing anions are not billion. And you know. You know, this and also this ising anions, it comes from two perpendicular layers, so you can only move along a one-dimensional line. So in this case net models, we actually realize a non-believer anions that has restricted mobility, that can only move along a line. Yeah, and we can actually show that this. And we can actually show that this one-dimensional nature is actually intrinsic, meaning that it's not a bound state of deconfined planons coming from 2D topological orders. And it's also not a bound state of say a line in SQ model and another B and Planon coming from 2D topological. Coming from 2D topological order. We call it inextractable. So, yeah, that means that these liners, these non-Abidian liners, you cannot think of it as just stacking, decoupled stacks of non-Abidian 2D topological order. It actually coupled in some untrivial way. Yeah. And also if you look at a Groundside wave function, it's actually very similar to the picture in the SU models. Here you have these cages, it's made out of this sigma string. And the difference is that you have these side strings attached to these cages. And if you look at the possible configuration at each vertex is very similar to x cube. Similar to XQ. The only difference is that you replace this string by sigma. And also side string can attach to this sigma string, like this. So this is why we call it K-genetic models. But to be honest, I spend a lot of time thinking about this one-size-wave function and try to make pro progress, like try to come up with some consistency conditions. consistency conditions, you know, similar to the stream net models. But so far I find it very useful. But maybe, you know, someone will find it useful. Yeah. I think that's basically all I want to say. So finally I would just like to summarize so far the routes to non-obedian fractional phases we know. So the So the old works were mostly focused on coupling non-obedient topological orders in some way. Sager and Yang Fu's work, they try to couple this non-obedient of logical order to fractons directly. And here we have cage net, and in this one I have will tell you another kind of fractal models, but it's you know similar in this very capful norm. Similarly, in this very capful non medians of large closets. But then we know we can, if we take multiple copies of fractal models, assume there's a permutation symmetries there. Once you gauge it, you also get some non-bedian fractons. And also, recently, Julian and his collaborators also figured out how to obtain non-bedian fractons in this cancer. And photons in this tensor gauge theory. You need to gauge the charge conjugation. And finally, recently I learned that using this non-invertible default and animal picture, you can also realize non-VDM flat tones. I think that's right. Yeah, so basically, that's all we know how to obtain some non-believing particles in the Particles in the fractons. Yeah, so I think there are still many questions here. For example, this non-invertible defect picture, I think it's a very nice framework. It's very general. So I would be very interested to know that how to use that picture to understand, say, cage name models. You know, it would be interesting. Okay, I think that's all I want to say. Thank you. I think that's all I want to say. Thank you. Okay. If there are no questions, I guess we can move on.
