For the opportunity to give this talk and for the organizers to this work is joined with Peter Houston, Theo Johnson Freight, Mitchell Niksich, Dave Pennies, David Reuter and Matthew Yu. And it is still in progress, though the statements are very stable. Are very stable, but maybe the proofs change a little bit. Okay, so without further ado, well, as I think almost all the talks this week, I'm going to work over an algebraically close geological context zero. And if Terry was here, well, I would tell him to take the true field. And well, I'm going to begin by just briefly reminding you of the definition of fusion to gasmear, because I'm going to take over to class. Gaspar, because I'm not going to tell you how to classify them, so it's important to have the definition in mind. So a fusion two category is a finite semi-simple rigid monological two category with a simple unit. I'm sure everyone here is familiar with the definition of the fusion one category. And well, it looks awfully familiar, except that, well, there's two twos showing up. And somehow this definition was given by Douglas and Meuter, and really the key contribution is this notion of. The key contribution is this notion of the finitely misimple two categories, a part that really wasn't clear before they thought about this project. And very quickly, a few key points. So one key property of these objects is that for every object of your two category, you have an associated category of the noidal category of noidal one category of endomorphisms, and all of these are going to be multifusion. And in particular, there's one distinguished object, the unit. One distinguished object, the unit, and we can look at the associated monoidal category of endomorphisms. And it turns out that it is braided because C is a monoidal two category. And it's convenient to have a shorthand notation for this thing. And David already introduced it on Wednesday. It's loot loot of C. And this is the braided fusion of 1 category. And it's essentially the first, it's essentially like the most accessible part of the fusion 2 category. It's the thing that you will know. Then, okay, this was already discussed before this week, so the School Lemma doesn't hold. And so, meaning that you can have non-zero one-morphisms between non-equivalent simple objects, and this leads to a notion of connectedness between simple objects. I mean, there's going to be an example in a few slides. And using this, we can define the set of connected components of a fusion, well, we're the finite principle here. Okay, so this is all much different. Okay, so this is all about the definition. What are some examples to keep in mind? The most basic example is this fusion two-category two-vec of two vector spaces, which really what are two vector spaces? Well, they're just finite semi simple one categories. And then once we figured this out, well, we know we can leverage all the basic constructions we know in the theory of fusion-what categories, and very quickly we realize that we can construct. We can construct a G-graded version and then we can twist this G-graded version. Now the twist is a four-core cycle, instead of a three-core cycle. We can also take representations of a finite group inside of two-backed, and this leads to this guy 2-rep T. But also, really, because we're working at a two-categorical level, your finite group can also be upgraded to a two-categorical level. So, really, these two classes of examples. So really these two classes of examples are also valid if this finite group G is replaced by a finite categorical group of L C G. And this actually leads to somehow more at least two rep over two group is like a somewhat, at least to me was a somewhat surprisingly interesting class of examples. Okay, and then the finite class of example that I want to mention, which is relatively straightforward to come up with, is that if you have a graded Come up with is that if you have a great diffusion one category, you can look at the associated two category of finite and a simple module one categories. And this inherits a monologue structure by the relative directions of production. And it turns out that these fusion two categories are exactly the connected fusion two categories, where connected means they have only one connected component. But that's, you know, that's that's a list. Maybe not that exciting, but the classification is coming afterwards, so we'll have more exciting examples shortly. So, we'll have more exciting examples shortly. I just wanted to mention one example which is not of the type we've looked at before, and not a lot of details, but essentially the way you build this example is by doing some like by considering some Morita development. That's essentially the way this example is constructed. And on your left, there is a little picture that depicts the underlying two categories. The underlying two category. So, in particular, the nodes are the simple objects. And you can see that between these two simple objects, well, there are non-zero bimorphism. So, in particular, there's only three connected components, but there are four simple objects. And on the right-hand side, you have a table that gives you the fusion rules for this gadget. And, well, if you think about it, you'll be perhaps a little bit surprised because they look kind of wrong, or at least they wouldn't correspond to any fusion. They wouldn't correspond to any fusion one category for, I guess, the reason that x is its own dual, but i doesn't show up as a summant when you take x times x. And the reason L is well because i and x actually are connected. And so you don't need, like, you don't need i to show up. You'll have i doesn't have to show up as a summit. That's all. I feel like I'm going rather fast. Any questions? No? Nope. Okay, thank you, Chelsea. Okay, and now I'm almost to the classification, but in order to state the classification, it is useful to distinguish two cases. So I told you that if you have a fusion two category, you can extract from it a braided fusion one category. This is this loop C. Now, if you have a braided fusion one category, something that you can always do is look at what its symmetric center or its mug-center. Center or its Mugger center, this C2. And then, well, there's two possibilities because this thing is now a symmetric fusion category. Either it is tanachian, so it admits a fiber functor to vect, or it's not tanachian, it's super tanachian, and in which case, okay, my sentence was awful. If this symmetric fusion category is tanachian, then the fusion two category is called bosonic. There's nothing super so refined bosonic. And if there A refined problem. And if there is something super in the sky, then the fusion to category is formula. And I will begin by stating the classification in the bosonic version because it is a little bit easy. Okay, so what we show is we explain how to describe the space of bosonic fusion to categories. And really, I mean the space of bosonic fusion to categories and monoidal. And monoidal equivalences. What is the first piece of data? Well, the first piece of data is a non-degenerate braided fusion one category. So in particular, it's good to know, this classification assumes that you already know all that you can possibly know about non-degenerate braided fusion one category, which is quite a strong assumption, but is essentially anyways the best you could confirm. The second piece of data The second piece of data is an inclusion of finite groups. So, nothing too surprising. I'll explain later how you can see all of this, at least, or most of it, how you can see that at the level of the fusion category. Third piece of data is now an action of the smaller finite group H on A by braided monoidal equivalences. And there's a fourth piece of data, which is a Foucault cycle pi for G, so now for the big group. And finally, you need somehow some data that relates pi and rho. And what you can do is that you can restrict pi to h, so this gives you some focal cycle. And it turns out that you can also produce a focal cycle from this action row. This is something. This action row. This is something that essentially follows from the work on expansion theory by Tingovich and Austric. So, namely, you can compose this map, or maybe the distribution of this map, by this canonical map, and this produces a Foucault cycle for H with coefficients in k star. And somehow you want this Foucault cycle, which we call the anomaly of rho, to agree with the restriction. To agree with the restriction of PyTrutch. Well, when you say unwanted, do you want uncatch language? Yes, yes, that's a good idea. Okay, now some unpacking, because somehow I've just thrown at you like a whole bunch of data and it's not supposed to be really clear what all of these things correspond to right now. So let's do a simple case. Let's do the case where h is equal to g. Where h is equal to g. In this case, what do we get? Well, we still get this choice of a non-degenerate graded fusion one category A. That's all fine and good. Then, well, this we have fixed. And then the next piece of data is an action, but now it's an action of G because H is equal to G. And then it turns out that this focus cycle part is actually uniquely determined by. Cycle pi is actually uniquely determined by rho via the homogeneous. So, somehow this we don't have to give, and it also turns out that for similar reasons the homotopy you can essentially get rid of. So, really, what we have is just a non-degenerate breeder fusion category and a finite group acting on it. Well, we all know fusion or braided fusion category theory. If you have this data, you know what to do, you equivalentize and you obtain a braided fusion one category AG. And then the fusion two category that you reconstruct is well just mod of AG. To reconstruct is well just mod of H. So this exactly tells you how all of the bosonic connected fusion two categories fit into the classification. They are exactly the ones that will show up if you take close to it. Okay. And you can do a similar, you can do a similar exercise if you now take H to be the trivial subgroup. I won't do it again, but it's essentially similar. Kind of essentially similar kind of manipulation. And here you get some kind of delete tensor product of one of these g-gridded two-vector spaces, maybe twisted. So the pi is the pi that showed up two slides ago. But you have to take the product with model A. And those are essentially the completely disconnected fusion two categories. So those are the two extreme cases. And then, okay, I wanted to mention this for fun. If you take A to B equals to vector, so it's a different way of saying. A to b equals 2 x, so it's a different way of simplifying the classification. It turns out that what you recover are these strongly group theoretical fusion to categories. And in particular, this guy that we showed up previously, well, is classified by an inclusion of finite group like this, of Z2, 2, Z4. What do we mean strong? Oh, yes, I guess. So we have, I want to say a strong version of group theoretic. want to say a strong version of group theoretical for fusion two category because we we require that uh we require that omega of C is actually uh a symmetric Tanakhan category. But you could also say something bigger. You could require that root of C is, like any group theoretical, graded fusional category, which would be weaker, I would call group theoretical, but not the strong. And what are a few And what are a few takeaways? What are a few lessons? Well, it's slightly technical, but please bear with me. We have these loops of C. And I've been talking a lot about, or I've mentioned, this first symmetric fusion category that you obtain by taking the symmetric center of looters. It turns out there's another symmetric fusion category that's associated to C. Associated to C, which essentially showed up in David's talk on Wednesday. So, what you can do is you can take the Dundfeld center, you fusion to category Cancy, fancy Z or fancy C. But now this is a braided fusion two category, so when you take loops, you get something that's symmetric. And you can actually show that the canonical functor that goes from loops of Z C to loops of C actually factors via this Muger center. And not only does it factor, This Mughal center, and not only does it factor via this Merger center, it's actually the dominant symmetric monoidal functor. And because I've assumed that C is tanachian, well, it corresponds to some symmetric monoidal functor of this form. So it's just a restriction along some inclusion of finite groups after presentation. And that's exactly what the the inclusion of finite group, that was the second point of the classification, corresponds to. It exactly records this map. Exactly record this map. And it's probably also worth saying that somehow this failure of this map to be an equivalence corresponds exactly to how disconnected your fusion two categories. And another thing which is relatively clear is that how you you can reconstruct loop sub C from the data we had previously, we had some finite group H acting on A by pretty. Final group H acting on A by brain monoidal equivalences, well, it turns out C, it's just equivalentization of D by H. And those are the pieces of data that are the most easy to see. The other ones are a bit more mystical. Okay, and now fermionic version, don't want to spend too long on it. The way you should think about it is basically you put super everywhere and it works, but then you have to actually. It works, but then you have to actually put some meaning into that. Maybe, well, okay, supergroups. I think basically everyone knows what this is. Maybe just to remind everyone, a slightly degenerate gradient fusion category, easy fusion category whose migration center is a spect. Well, super twisted. Super chromology is a chromology theory. I want to get into what this is more precisely, but it's it's a bit more complicated than uh the usual h4 that you're used to. But essentially ev everything looks the same, it's just Uh that we can talk about data issue. I won't get into it quite it's a homomorphism and the point is that if it's slightly degenerate, then greater homomorphism is a way as naturalized. That's what he would call a super action on it. Ah ah so so you say that there is some some garnonic or damorphism yes by by minus one you have you put a minus one on your fermion because A is slightly degenerated text dance so this was the classification and now I can't resist but tell you a little bit about how this goes well before telling you about how this goes I want to tell you a little bit How this goes, I want to tell you a little bit about why you should believe that this is possible. Because I'm sure we all know that there's essentially no hope of classifying fusion one categories. So why should you believe that you classify fusion two categories? So does your theorem basically say that all the fusion two categories are farm animals? Uh oh what? They're they're not far though. So, the reason you should believe that you can classify fusion to categories is this result, which says that every fusion to category is actually more equivalent to a connected fusion to category. And essentially, it's somewhat formal, but if you think hard about what this means, or hard, or maybe not so hard about what this means, you can convince yourself that this means that you. You can convince yourself that this means that you can describe every fusion two category using the following data: namely, the data of a symmetric fusion one category E, the data of a braided fusion category B, whose muger center is E, and then this last piece of data C is a B central fusion one category. So essentially, what this is describing for you is the Morita equivalence between mod B and the fusion two category you're trying to look at. And if you do this. And if you do this process correctly, or more precisely, if you do it coherently, you obtain something like this. I'm going to give some unpacking, and please feel free to ask questions now or later if you want more details. So the first thing we see again is this dominant symmetric monoidal functor from E to F that appeared previously. And then what we show is that the space. What we show is that the space of fusion two categories is equivalent to the space of commutative squares of this form, but really all of the nodes are spaces. So this is a point. And what are the other spaces? Well, the top right corner is the space of braided fusion one categories whose mugal center is equipped with an equivalence to F, and here I'm taking those up to braided monologue equivalence. Now at the bottom, Now, at the bottom, you have spaces that kind of will feel the same but are actually very different. So, these say with F, with F is going to be the space again of braided fusion one categories whose nuclear center is equipped with an equivalence to F, but now the morphisms are going to be certain width equivalences. So it's a space of a very different nature, but which again is very closely related to radio diffusion categories. And here there's a canonical map, which is, you know, take the width class. Take the width class, and here's the map that's induced by this dominant symmetric functor. And this is quite a nice result already. What is a nice result from homotopy theoretic perspective, but it's quite far from the things I've told you at the beginning. So, how do you go about massaging this enough to get into the first statements that appeared? Well, what you show is To show is the following, which is an observation that's probably interesting in its own right. So you can show that the assignment that sends a symmetric fusion one category E to the associated wheat space wheat E actually defines a functor from this category of symmetric fusion one categories and dominant symmetric functors to spaces, so S stands for spaces. And moreover, what's really interesting about this functor is that we can show that this functor preserves equivalentizations. Or if you want a more homotopical language, it preserves limits of shape d G, where G is a finite. And don't want to get into too many details, but essentially, what it allows you. Essentially, what it allows you is to take the E's and F's that were inside and somehow take them out. And you obtain by combining the previous two theorems, by just doing a little bit of thinking, a result, a corollary, that the space of fusion two categories, or really, I should have seen bosonic here, is equivalent to the space of commutative space of this form. So really what I've just done is like taken the E's and F, well I've identified them. The E's and F, well, I've identified them with rep of G and rep of H, and then I've taken this agent out, and we get a square of this one. Through the case form H is equal to G, how this collapses, so I can kind of connect it case, right? We need to A deliverable fusion to get pieces, yes. HSG, then the bottom arrow and the triangle just okay. So, what is that? I mean, because I'm trying to unpack this notation. Oh, sorry. Yeah, no, I mean, okay, I can tell you. So, yes, it's relatively formal to go from this to the first theorem. And what happens is that here, I pick a non-degenerate web diffusion one category, A. This is, because this is like, this is BH, so it has one object, but then it has H-morphosis. So, here I pick A. So here I pick A and I pick A with an action by H. This is what this map at the top is doing. And then, well, we have this inclusion of finite groups. And then, let me just think. I have that, I have that. And what this map is doing then is actually picking the focal cycle for G, the map at the bottom. And then being able to feel this square is actually this homotopy, this last P. Square is actually this homotopy, this large piece of face. That's what it colors by. Yeah, that's a good question. Thank you for the question. So would that mean that the map down, so this is the action of H on A, and associated to that is this anomaly? Is this composition the anomaly of the action? The anomaly is what essentially you get two, the two composites are like two maps from a Composites are like two maps from essentially, gives you two focal cycles for H. And then the homotopy is making sure that it does the same. But it's data, it's like the data that allows you to tell you that these two focal cycles are the same. So that's essentially what I wanted to say about the proof. I mean, it's only the very key ideas. There's a lot of work that goes into actually proving these statements. But it was pretty. But it was, I think it was a lot of fun to actually bring in all these higher categorical and homotopy techniques to this world of a few hypercategans. And then, okay, well, we have a classification. What is it good for? Well, it allows us to answer a few questions that at least I was thinking about already essentially at the beginning when Chris talked about if you should look at diffusion two categories, those were essentially some of the first questions you would like to answer. And, well, Like to answer, and well, now that we have a classification that relatively straightforward to answer. So, the first one is about rank finiteness. So, what is the rank of a fusion two category? Well, what you have to do is you have to multiply the cardinal, the set of connected components, so it's a cardinal number, but you also have to include the rank of the braided fusion category associated to it. Associated to it. Because somehow, if you don't have these two pieces of data, like run finiteness, it's never going to work. But it turns out that if this is a dual definition of rank, well, you just get rank finiteness. Well, really, you get rank finiteness because of the classification and that we know rank finiteness for breeding finiteness. So that's our first profit. Another profit, which is essentially clear for the theorem, is that we have actually unrigidity, so there's no non-trigger deformation. There's no unfused deformations for fusion two categories. I'm sorry, I'm out of date with this stuff. Are these corollaries new to this paper, or is this something recovering from these results? Well, this wasn't this one, but this went before. Okay. And finally, we also obtain, I mean, I'm keeping it a little bit vague because I don't want to talk too much about hypergroups, but we're also able to show. To show that the hypergroup associated to every fusion two categories, which you really think of as like this quota big rig over R, that they're all of this form, all of this double coset form. Where the groups that appear are the groups that appeared before, the same G and the same H that appeared before. So it's giving very strong constraints to at least some part of the future. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Questions? So when you say that you, I mean, you found space, what kind of space is this? This two type? C-type? It is a three-type. C-type? It seems to me that the story might be a kind of way more complicated if you do the positive. Oh, sure. Why would it calculate zero? No, it's a once you tell us a list of all symmetric categories, then we probably should just list. I mean, but it's going to be the same. I guess it's where all the fusion was. So I guess it's just in groups and I mean, I guess essentially, you know, this whole story is using the fact that in characteristic zero, finance of a symbol is the same thing as separable. Which is not true or positive characteristic P. So somehow I'm essentially sure that you can do all of this in characteristic P if you put separable essentially everywhere. But then, yeah. Then if you move away from that, it's it's not okay. For examples, it it looked like generically the number of components is marriage. Is that true? No, it's this double coset. It's the double coset. More questions? I think.
