Great conference. So I'll tell you about the results of two papers, one that appeared last year and the other one that appeared just a week ago. Oops. And again, sorry, I have to just make sure I can. Ah, what is this doing? Sorry. Here we go. So in this talk, I'll describe how mirror symmetry solves the problem of categorifying quantum link invariants. Verifying quantum link invariance. The problem was introduced in 1998 by Cavano, who showed how to associate to link a collection of bi-graded vector spaces graded by acohomological and equivariant grading, such that equivariant Euler characteristic is the Johns polynomial. The vector spaces are themselves incovariant. The problem Kovanov initiated is to find a physical, or at least a geometric, meaning of Kovanov. Or, at least, a geometric meaning of covenant homology, one that generalizes uniformly for all gauge groups. Edward Witten explained in 88 that Don's polynomial comes from Transseiman's theory with gauge group based on Lie algebra SU2, not colored by its fundamental representation, and effective Trans-Simon's level related to Q. This placed the Don's polynomial into a more general frame. Don't spolynomial into a more general framework, which one gets by considering Transimon's theory with different Lie algebras and different representations coloring the nodes. The relation of Witten's link invariance to quantum groups was developed by Rishi Tikik and Taraya shortly after. I'll explain that covenant homology also has origin in physics, which places it into a more general framework in parallel to what Witten did in 88. From string theory, I derived two different descriptions of the theory, related by a version of two-dimensional homological mirror symmetry. The theory turns out to be solvable explicitly by making homological mirror symmetry manifest. At the end of the day, this subject does not require string theory anymore. I will explain the string theory origin here because many people in the audience have thought about it. But as far as mathematics goes, it's not necessary anymore. Goes, it's not necessary anymore. Mirror symmetry, however, is necessary. The theories come from two-dimensional defects in a six-dimensional zero-two conformal field theory, which as implied by works of Boguri and Wafa and also Book of Schwartz and Wafer. The six or five-dimensional description of this same physics is being developed by Everett Written. The approaches I'll describe are complementary and solve the problem. Complementary and solve the problem from the perspective of two-dimensional theories on the defects. One of the striking aspects of quantum node invariance is the wealth of mathematics and physics connections one gets to discover once one understands them. The fact that this structure arises from a deeper theory will, I think, lead to many more connections. We'll see one of them here as a vast new family of examples of homological neurosymmetry, which connected to Neurosymmetry, which connected to representation theory. Another general feature of the theory is that, unlike in other approaches to categorification, where one comes up with a category and then works to prove that deep categorification gives the invariance one set out to categorify, in this theory, this last step is automatic. In the same 89 paper, Witten showed that underlying Trans-Simon theory is a two-dimensional conformal field theory. Is a two-dimensional conformal field theory associated to G and kappa with affine Li algebra symmetry. We'll use this as a starting point rather than Transhymn's theory itself. To eventually get invariants of knots in R3 or S3, one typically starts with the Riemann surface, which is a complex plane with punctures. It's equivalent, but better for our purpose, to take the Riemann surface to be a punctured infinite cylinder. Have punctured infinite cylinder. And as a result, the theory will be able to describe links in R2 times S1 and not just in R3. To a puncture at a finite point, we'll associate a finite dimensional representation of the Lie algebra, which we'll take to be minuscule. To punctures at two ends in infinity, we'll associate a pair of infinite dimensional Raman modular representations whose height weights are not integral. integral to this data conformal field theory associates a conformal block obtained by sewing sewing chiral vertex operators rather than characterizing conformal blocks in terms of vertex operators and and sewing one can describe them as a solution to a differential equation the equation that they solve is a trigonometric version of the equation discovered by knizhnik entomologico in 84 because the riemann surface is Because the Riemann surface is an infinite cylinder rather than a plane. By varying positions of vertex operators as a function of time, one gets a colored braid in the Riemann surface time. From perspective of the Casey equation, the braiding matrix is the monodromy matrix along the path and parameter space described by the braid. The monodromy problem for the KC equation was solved. For the KZ equation was solved by Drinfeld and Kazan and Blustig following on works of others, Tuchi and Kanye and Kon in 88. They showed that monogramy that reorders enabling pair of vertex operators of the fine current algebra is a R matrix of the UQ quantum group corresponding to G, whose construction is canonical. Now, any link can be represented as a closure of some braid. Be represented as a closure of some grade. The corresponding quantum link invariant is the matrix element of the braiding matrix taken between a pair of conformal blocks that describe the top and the bottom of the picture. The caps and the caps describe pairs of vertex operators colored by complex conjugate representations that come together and fuse to the identity to disappear. So in this way, both grading and fusion of conformal field theory play an important role. And the fusion of conformal field theory plays an important role. Our starting point for categorification of linked invariance is the realization of conformal blocks, which comes from quantum field theory in two dimensions, with any with the two supersymmetry, and ultimately from string theory. In fact, most immediately from string theory, one obtains a striking and much more rigid generalization of conformal blocks of the Finley algebra. This deformation. This deformation is based on replacing the affine Lie algebra by the quantum affine algebra, which is a one-parameter deformation. This deformation was discovered by Igor Franklin and Richard Tiki in the 80s. They showed that one can break conformal invariance while preserving much of the structure that's provided by conformal field theory. The fact that this is possible is striking and it's explained by string theory. The deformation, oh sorry, this is the same. Deformation, um, oh sorry, this is testing. Uh, so the deformation replaces uh the KZ equation by the coinemating zomological equation, which is a difference equation. Like in the conformal blocks, solutions of the QKZ equation can be described as correlators of chiral vertex operators, except that all the operators are Q deform. Because we broke conformal invariance, working on a plane is no longer the same as working on a cylinder. So we'll specialize the Lie algebra to be simply laced of AD type. There is a generalization to non-simply list Lie algebras, but we won't have time for it. The Q corner blocks that solve the QK's equation of the finally algebra, quantum algebra, come from 2-0 little string theory in six dimensions, which is labeled by. Which is labeled by, which is of AD type, and one gets it from a limit of string theory, type 2B string theory on AD surface singularity. String theory will disappear from us momentarily, but I want to tell you what a direct connection there is between the two. So one takes this two-zero theory, little string theory, on a six-manifold, which is a product of the Riemann surface where conformal blocks live. Surface where conformal blocks live, times two more complex dimension planes, one which supports the D-brain, which we call here D. So our defects are two-dimensional supported on D. The theory on the brains is quiver gauge theory. This is a consequence of a textbook description of debrains and singularities textbook. Debrance and singularity textbook and string theory. Anyhow, the theory on this debris is a quiver gauge theory with quiver based on G. With it turns out to be a three-dimensional gauge theory, not two, even though the defects of cells are two-dimensional. It's a three-dimensional gauge theory on D times a circle due to string winding modes that run around the cylinder. Now, one of the results. Now, one of the results of my prior work with Andrey Arkunkov shows that one can get the fundamental solution to the QKZ equation, which spans the space of conformal blocks of the quantum affine algebra from either the Coulomb branch or the Higgs branch of this three-dimensional gauge theory. The Q conformal blocks are supersymmetric partition functions of the 3D theory on D times S1. That the supersymmetric partition functions. That is supersymmetric partition functions. The ranks of the vector spaces and the numbers of debris of different kinds you include determine the representation and the weight in the specific representations that conformal blocks transforming. From this perspective, the vertex operators come from heavy flavor brains that are associated with framing nodes of the quiver. The highest wave vector. The highest wave vector of the Brahma module comes from a complex scale in the 2-0 theory, which abelianizes it. This abelianization takes out all the mystery of the 2-0 theory away. It makes it trivial. This is why the description based on defects is so effective. So in particular, it means that none of the complicated bulk dynamics is actually important. So which solution of the QKZ? So, which solution of the QKZ equation the partition function computes depends on the boundary condition at infinity of this long cigar. The fact that you can get solutions of QK's equation and Q-conformal blocks from either the Coulomb branch or the Higgs branch is a reflection of three-dimensional mirror symmetry. Now, if we were to pursue the story further, rather than discovering not invariants, we would discover integrable lattice models. In a precise sense of a very general kind. And this thought is developed in my work with Andreo Kunko. Instead, going towards lattice models, we'll go back to the main interest, which is to understand where conformal blocks of the affine Lie algebra come from. The conformal, so in this little string theory, conformal invariance is broken by the strings. Conformal invariance is broken by the string scale. The conformal limit is a point particle limit. In this limit, the theory, the little string theory, becomes the 0-2 conformal theory you've heard so much about. And the limit coincides with the conformal limit that takes the quantum affine algebra to the ordinary affine algebra. In particular, in this point-particle limit, Particle limit, the winding modes become infinitely heavy. So, defects which were three-dimensional for the purposes of Fuqué's equation become purely two-dimensional. One description of so, and moreover, having understood what the theory is that gives you, that gives rise to a more complicated thing, the QK's equation and quantum fine algebra, we can. And quantum and fine algebra, we can simply take the limit, the conformal limit, and understand what are the theories and defects that are guaranteed now to give us conformal blocks of the F-in-E algebra. So one description of the theory we get is as a supersymmetric sigma model. So now we are slowly moving towards just pure math. One description of the theory is as a supersymmetric sigma model on a hypercarolic target, which is a Coulomb branch of the 3D theory. Coulomb branch of the 3D theory. This Coulomb branch has several descriptions. One of them we'll use today is as the moduli space of singular G monopoles with prescribed direct singularities on R3 that's broken up into R times C. Where G here, the big G is the Lie group of adjoint type with Lie algebra, little G. Viewed as monopole-moduli space, the Coulomb branch is parameterized in part by positions of smooth monopoles on R3, where the positions of singular monopoles are kept fixed. They are modular of the metric. These monopoles are what came off the deviance that we had before. Okay, but anyway, for every vertex operator on the Riemann surface, one place. On the Riemann surface, one places a singular G monopole. Monopoles are on R times C. One places a singular G monopole at the corresponding point on R, where you just shrink the cylinder into a line, whose charge is the highest weight of the representation color in the vertex operator. Generally, the integers that tell you which queer gates you start, which Coulomb branch to study, again, Start which Coulomb brand to study, again, encode which conformal blocks you're studying. Here, the flavor nodes we said describe describe which vertex operators you put. The X is hypercalar. This hyperkalar symmetry is broken, working equivariantly with respect to symmetry that scales. That scales the holomorphic symphactic form on X, and it comes from rotations of the transverse complex plane in six dimensions. X is just, again, moduli space of monopoles on R times C, so the symmetry is rotations of that C factor. We'll work equivariantly with respect to larger torus of symmetries acting on the Coulomb branch where Where, in addition to the symmetry that scales the holomorphic symphactic form with HQ, there's also a lambda action that preserves it and comes from the maximum torus of G. The positions of vertex operators from perspectives of X are complexified KLA moduli. The reason a Riemann surface is a cylinder rather than a flame is Rather than a flame, is because the B fields that complexify the K L and moduli are always periodic. So if all representations are minuscule and KL and moduli are generic, the manifold X is smooth. So conformal blocks of the Final D algebra are partition functions of the supersymmetric sigma model with target x working equivalently with respect to t. The domain curve, as I've been drawing here, is best thought of as an infinitely long cigar with a circle boundary at infinity. In the interior of D, supersymmetry is preserved by A-type twist. Because the cigar is infinitely long, this A-type twist is compatible with any supersymmetry preserved at the boundary at infinity. And we will place a beta boundary condition. The boundary conditions form a category. The boundary conditions form a category, and the category of boundary conditions for the sigma model NX working equivariantly with respect to T is the derived category of T equivariant coherent shapes. It's exactly that on the north. Picking a B-type brain, an object of the category, as the boundary condition at infinity, the supersymmetric partition function remembers the brain only through its equivariant k-theory class. The supersymmetric partition functions, this supersymmetric partition function has a precise mathematical formulation as Gibbon-Tahl's J function or vertex function computed by T-equivarium Grabovitten theorem X. But the fact that it comes from the supersymmetric sigma model means we have much more information than just this statement. However, conformal blocks being given Being given to us j functions of X means that the Knich exemological equation is the quantum differential equation of X. It's an equation for flat sections of a connection, a vector bundle, which fibers the homology groups, over the complexified KLN moduli. This was introduced by Guimental. The fact that the two coincide is a theorem of Daniel Enko. For this specific X, the K's equation. For this specific x, the KZ equation is on the nose, the quantum differential equation. Because the KZ equation is a quantum differential equation, action of braiding on the space of conformal blocks is the monodraming of a quantum differential equation along its path in K-London moduli. From the signal model perspective, we again have more information. The monodromic problem arises by letting the moduli of the theory vary according to the braid in the neighborhood of the theory. The braid in the neighborhood of the boundary at infinity, near the boundary at infinity of the cigar, where the time along the braid is the time along the cigar. It follows that the path integral of the sigma model, where time runs along the annulus, cutting off the cigar near its end, and the moduli that vary according to the rate computes the matrix element of the monodromy between a pair of conformal blocks. Monodromy between a pair of conformal blocks picked out by the beta brains at the two boundaries. The very same path interval, with time that runs around the circle instead, computes the index of the supercharge preserved by the two brains. In fact, one can simplify one's life and take the modulus to be constant at the expense of changing one of the boundary conditions. The cohomology of a supercharged Q Supercharge Q is computed by the derived category as its most basic ingredient, the space of morphisms between the two brains. The Euler characteristic obtained by closing back into an annulus manifestly computes the monogramy matrix element because nobody tells you which direction you should think of as time. So we've manifestly categorified monodromy of the Categorified monogramy of the Knitian phenomenological equation and quantum Mar microsis. The brain group acts on the brains by auto-equivalences of the derived category, because along the path in Kala moduli, the category stays the same while the individual brains change. So then it follows that these derived auto-equivalences manifestly categorify monogramy. Is manifestly categorified by monogramy of the TZ equation. This is a physical explanation for a very difficult theorem of Bes Republic of Compa, which uses quantization of X and characteristic P. Quantum invariance of links should also be categorified by the derived category of coherent shapes because they can also be represented as matrix elements of the grading matrix between pairs of conformable. Matrix between pairs of conformal blocks. For this, however, we need to find objects of the derived category whose vertex functions are conformal blocks that describe the caps and the cups. I did this in the first paper. I explained that along with braiding, fusion has a geometric interpretation in the Diraft category as certain perverse filtrations which were envisioned by Chuang and Were envisioned by Chuang and Roku. One learns from this, I don't have time to explain that story, but among the things one learns from that is that brains that leads to caps and the caps are not some abstract objects of the derived category, that structure shifts of a specific vanishing cycle that X develops as you bring pairs of vertex operators together. The cycle itself. The cycle itself sits inside X as a holomorphic Lagrangian, and it's simply a product of minuscule Rosmanians. Remember, all of our representations are minuscule. The beauty of perverse filtrations is that they give you a very good, powerful way of describing derived equivalences. And that, in particular, brain group action on the derived category. On the derived category. So, using those and the very special property of the vanishing cycles associated to caps and the caps, it's not hard to show that not only do homology groups more manifestly, they don't only categorify the corresponding quantum link invariants, they are themselves link invariants. So, each homology group in each Each homology group in each degree is itself a link invariant, which is what you want. The reason it's not hard to show is that the reason it holds in the derived category is essentially the same why it holds in conformal field theory. Anyway, recently, Ben Webster proved that link invariants that come from coherent sheaves, derived category of TF variant coherent sheaves on X are X are equivalent to the invariants that he defined in 2013 using KRLW algebra studied by Kovanov, Lauda, Roku, and himself. And again, we get a generalization here, in fact, of that story that he discovered in 2013, because you also have links in R2 times S1, not just in R3. Now, as stated, neither the approach by coherent sheaves on X, nor Coherence sheaves on F, nor by KRLW algebras, is very computation-friendly, at least as far as I understand. In the rest of the talk, I'll describe how physics lets one reformulate the problem and actually solve the theory. The resulting description is completely new. We'll end up with a cousin of KRLW algebras, but a much simpler one. So the conformal limit is not a geometric, remember, for Q. Remember, for QK's equation and conformal blocks of the quantum and fine algebra, we had two descriptions: one based on the Coulomb branch, the other based on the Higgs branch. Now, the description based on Higgs branch is not useful in the conformal limit because the limit results in a bad singular space. So, this description is lost. Something has to replace it. In particular, because solutions of differential equations or difference equations don't just disappear. What replaces Here. What replaces it is a Landau-Gisbrook model whose target is an open subset of a symmetric product of copies of the Riemann surface where conformal blocks live with a certain potential. The relation between the Coulomb branch X and the space Y is a cousin of ordinary two-dimensional mirror symmetry. It can't be ordinary mirror symmetry because Y is half the dimension of the Y is half the dimension of X, of the Coulomb branch. What happens instead is that the Coulomb branch has a core locus, which is half-dimensional. It's preserved. It's a locus preserved by the torus action that scales the holomorphic symplectic form and that gives us Q of not invariants. This locus has all the information about the geometry of the. So now we have. So now we have two x's. The original x, which is the Coulomb branch, we'll call it the big x, and we'll call its core locus the small x. So the space y is mirror of the small x of the core. Viewing the big X as the moduli space of monopoles on R3, its core is locus where all the monopoles, not Is locus where all the monopoles, not just the singular ones, sit at the origin of the C factor and add points along R. Okay. So X, the core, is just essentially a symmetric product of cylinders locally. Now, the bottom row, small x and small y have all the information about the geometry. And we'll call the relation going diagonally equivalent. The relation going diagonally, equivariant mirror symmetry. People mean lots of things by equivariant mirror symmetry. This is what we'll mean by here: the fact that we can also go diagonally. Now, the small X embeds into a big as a holomorphic Lagrangian submanifold. The big Y, which is a mirror of the big X, fibers of the small Y with holomorphic Lagrangian C star fibers. This big Y will not play much role for us. Not play much role for us because essentially all the information and the right description is from perspective of the bottom. But just conceptually, it's good to think of it as a big square diagram. Now, a model example to keep in mind is the big X, which is an AM minus one surface or resolutionoid. Its core looks like a sausage, a collection of P1s with a pair of Of P1s with a pair of infinite disks attached. The corresponding big X is the moduli space of one smooth SO3 monopole in the presence of M singular ones. The ordinary mirror of this big X, which is an A minus one surface, is big Y, which is what's called the multiplicative A minus one surface with a potential which we want E. But this multiplicative A minus 1 surface is a C star vibration over Y, which is an infinite cylinder with M marked points in the interior. At the marked points, the C star fibers degenerate. In the big Y, the M minus one Lagrangian spheres. m minus one Lagrangian spheres, which are mirrored to m minus one vanishing p1s in the big x. These vanishing spheres project Lagrangians in y that begin and end on the functions. So y in this case is a single copy of the Riemann surface where conformal blocks live. And the positions of vertex operators correspond to marked points where the C-star vibration of big Y over the small degenerate. By X-Y, by mirror symmetry, the mirror pair, the small x and the small y share a common base, which in this case is just a line with some marked points. This line is a moduli space, is the sort of visible part of the moduli space of one smooth monopole in presence of M singular ones. The fact that The fact that this mirror symmetry is quite so explicit is the reason why eventually one will be able to understand completely. More generally, the equivariant mirror of the big X and the ordinary mirror of its core is Y, which is symmetric product, roughly speaking, symmetric product of copies of the Riemann surface where conformal blocks live with some locus deleted. Uh, locus deleted and some singularities resolved again. Projecting this in this in the more general context as well, projecting onto the common SYZ base of the x, the small x and the small y is the same as projecting the big x, the modulized space of monopoles on R3, just to the modulized space of monopoles on the line. Okay, so. So the smooth monopoles that parameterize the moduli space are just these gray dots, while we keep the red dots fixed. Including the T-equivariant action on the big X, or the small X, corresponds to adding to the sigma model on Y a specific potential, which is a multivalued complex function on Y. This description arises by starting from Is by take from starting from a 3D gauge theory and taking the conformal limit essentially of its Coulomb branch, which is a very subtle thing to do. But anyway, the point is that the potential comes from a simple one-loop calculation in 3D gauge theory. So once you write down the 3D gauge theory, you know the potential. So we know the potential as well. So and it mirrors the T if we were in action on the big X. On the big X. From this mirror perspective, conformal blocks are partition functions of the B-twisted theory on the very long cigar with an A-tie boundary condition corresponding to a Lagrangian in the target. Such amplitudes have the following form. There's some where omega Where omega is a top holomorphic form on y, w here is the Landa Gisbert potential, and phi are some insertions. What we've discovered here from neurosymmetry is integral formulation of conformal blocks. This is just a rewriting of the integral formulation of conformal blocks of the F-final algebra that go back to works of Schechmann and Vartinko and Fagin and Franklin from the 80s. In fact, the B-twisted Lambda-Gisber model on Y with potential W and the A-twisted sigma model on the big X are equivalent in the sense of topological neurosymmetry to all genus due to reconstruction theory of Given Talon-Taliman, which says that given the solution of the quantum differential equation, one gets to reconstruct all genus topological string amplitudes of any semi-simple 2D field theory. So at the topological string level, So, at a topological string level, close topological amplitudes, they are just the same. Now, corresponding to a solution of the case equation and a conformal block is an A brain at the boundary of this long cigar at infinity. This brain is an object of the category of A brains, which is the derived Foucaidal category of Y with potential W. The set one needs to delete one gives rise to a set of one forms on Y with integer periods. These one forms with integer periods are responsible for equivariant grading of both the brains and the homes between them. Now, mirrorsymmetry helps us understand exactly which question we need to ask to recover homological not invariance from y. Because y is an ordinary mirror of the small x, we should start by understanding how to recover homological invariance from the small x instead of the big. Every object of the derived category of big x, which is relevant from us, comes from a corresponding b type brain on the small x via a functor that interprets. That interprets a brain on the small x as a brain on the big x. This functor has an adjunct that goes the other way and takes the brain on the big x, the brain on the small x, by tensoring with the structure shape of the small x and restricting. This construction is standard. The fact that these two eigenfunctors exist is what lets us recover all the relevant homes. All the relevant homes computed on the big X, which we know categorical link invariants, to questions on the small X. The factors being eigen means that for any pair of brains on the big X that come as images of this push-forward functor from X, the holmes of the brains upstairs agree with the home. Agree with the homes between the brains downstairs after replacing the downstairs, one of the downstairs brain by a brain obtained by sending it up and pushing it back down. Okay. So there's a non-trivial operation which you need to know. And it's not identity. By mirror symmetry, for every pair of B-type range on the big X, which come from the small X, there is a Come from the small x, there is a mirror pair of abrains on the uh on the small y such that the holmes and y agree with the holmes and the big x. So there's a corresponding pair of adjunct functions. If you construct a pair from the perspective of sending brains on the small y to the big y and back down. To the big Y and back down. They relate the brains upstairs and downstairs in a way that exactly mirrors what happens on the coherent sheaf side. Now, recall our example of Y, which is the equivariant mirror of the big X, which was the A minus one surface, the resolution of it. Mirror to I, so a vanishing P1 in the core. The core was the sausage. The core was the sausage, is the Lagrangian, which is a simple interval between a pair of functions on y. The functor that goes up amounts the pair in the brain downstairs with circle fibers over it. Remember, big Y is a C started the D vibration, where D is the total dimension of Of half the dimension of the big Y. So, this is how you get these pictures. The fact that it goes the other way does not send the vanishing sphere back to itself. Instead, either computing it by neurosymmetry or directly computing this function from definition. I should say this parallel understanding of neurosymmetry upstairs and downstairs is joint work with Vivek Schender and Matthew McGreen. My green. So, one finds a figure eight Lagrangian. So, starting with an interval brain, pushing it up and back down, you get a figure eight. The basic virtue of these adjoint functors that they preserve the home is not difficult to see from this picture. So, for example, homes between these two Lagrangian S2s is one-dimensional because they intersect over a point, and here's a single-point intersection. Over a point, and here's a single point intersection. And similarly, here, homes of an S2 to itself is cohomology of the S2. So, here are the two points. Anyway, the example we gave is relevant to covenant homology. For a link obtained by closing a braid with two D strands, the corresponding X is a Coulomb rant of. X is a Coulomb branch of some specific gauge theory with this quiver. The same X can be described as an open subset of a default semantic product, more precisely as an open subset of the Hilbert scheme of D points on the Na minus 1 surface. The fact this is true is a theorem, a very non-trivial theorem by Manolesky. Not obvious theorem. Not obvious here. So in the big X, the brains that close off the strands are a product of D non-intersecting P1s, in this case. This case that corresponds to covariant homology in the Jones polynomial. So the vanishing cycle, the brain is a structure sheet of a vanishing cycle, which is a product of D non-intersecting P1s. And the equivariant mirror, which is an And the equivariant mirror, which is an open subset of the symmetric product. So, the equivalent mirror is the open subset of symmetric products of D points of the same kind on the Riemann surface where performal blocks live with a specific potential. So, here I wrote down the potential. Why is that coordinate on the infinite cylinder viewed as a complex plane with origin and infinity deleted? Infinity delayed. By equivariant mirrorsymmetry, the D-cups are products of D non-intersecting figure A Lagrangians, and the D cups are the interval brains. In the Line of Giesburg description, both the Lagrangians and the action of grading on them is geometric. So we can simply start with a projection of a link to a surface, translated into a pair of Lagrangian. Was translated into a pair of Lagrangians by choosing a bicoloring with equal number of segments of each color for each link component, such the way that such that red overs underpasses the blue. Anyway, the mirror Lagrangians are obtained by replacing all the blue segments by simple intervals and all the red segments by figure eights. The homological inkivariant is the space of morphisms between Is the space of morphisms between a pair of brains in the derived chires category? These spaces are defined by floor theory, which is modeled after Morse theory approach to supersymmetric quantum cans. The starting point is a floor complex spanned by intersection points of two Lagrangians and a gradient by cohomological and muscle degrees and the equivariant degrees in our case. The action of The action of the differential on the space is generated by instant times, and in the absence of anomalies, it should square to zero. The cohomology of the resulting complex is a space of morphisms between the brains. In the four approaches of the A model, the coefficient of the action of the differential is obtained by counting homomorphic disk instantons in Y, interpolating from one intersection point to the other. Interpolating from one intersection point to another of muscle of index one and equivalent degree zero. This theory, it turns out, can be described explicitly. It can be described explicitly because it's a cousin of Hagar-Flohr theory. We would get Haggard-Floor theory by, instead of starting with SU2, starting with GL1/1, at least Alexander polynomial rather than Jones. Jones. What I didn't explain here is that one can get Hager-Flueth theory from string theory by an analogous construction to the one I described, which starts with type IIB string theory and conifold instead. And this is the story is being developed in joint work with Miroslav Rabchak and Elise Lepage. So anyway, Hagar fluid theory has target, which is a different open subset of A different open subset of symmetric product of D copies of the Riemann surface that looks the same Riemann surface with a similar but different potential. One way of thinking about the differences, which is a cousin of his string theory origin, is that you can think of Hegel-Floy theory as a theory of fermions on the Riemann surface, whereas to get SU2 instead, you start with a theory of anions. That explains all the peculiarities of the difference between, or most of them. Anyway, like in Hager-Floyd theory, Lagrangians in Y can be described as products of D one-dimensional Lagrangians on the Riemann surface. And in particular, the intersection points of a parallel Lagrangians are d tuples of intersection points of d one-dimensional Lagrangians. A holomorphic map. A holomorphic map from a disk to the target Y projects with non-negative multiplicities to domains on the Riemann surface, with boundaries on the one-dimensional agrangians and vertices at their intersection points. So this is an example of a disk that inter with a projection of a map from a disk with two marked points to Y, the two marked points. To why the two mark points project to like one point is a pair of green points because it's a symmetric product of two copies. Okay, so uh, like in Hager flow theory, one can read off from the Riemann surface, from the domains, the Fermi, the Musselman index and the equivalent degree of the map to Y. For example, the Muslim index of a disk is what's familiar What's familiar from Hager-Fleuer theory as twice the Euler measure of the domain. So this disk that projects to a like the Derieman surface like this is mass of index one. This rephrasing of the A model that counts holomorphic maps from D to Y in turn amounts to counting holomorphic curves. To counting holomorphic curves instead of studying holomorphic maps, counting holomorphic curves inside D times A with a pair of projections to D as a default cover and to A, the Riemann surface, as a domain with boundaries and one-dimensional Lagrangians. It's known as the cylindrical approach to Floyd theory, and it's particularly well suited here because D times A is actually part of our six-dimensional target. Of our six-dimensional target of the six-dimensional two-zero theory, anyhow, the Euler characteristic, as always, simply counts intersection points of Lagrangians, keeping track of ratings. So what we end up with is actually the fact that this computes Jones polynomial is a theorem due to Bigelow. And what we've understood from equivariant mirrorsymmetry. From equivariant mirrorsymmetry, Bigelow's peculiar construction. So, in this example, corresponding to the right-handed Hauplenk, you easily discover that there are eight intersection points and six domains that can contribute non-trivially to the differential. The cohomology of the resulting complex should be covenant homology, in particular by neurosymmetry and by the fact that the other characteristics come out correct. However, However, well, the fact that differential squares to zero comes as usual from contributions to Q square canceling in pairs from broken maps, which are boundaries of mass level index two disks with equivalent degree zero. I want you to know that dimensions of the resulting complex grow polynomially. Grow polynomially with the number of crossings, which should be compared to exponential growths in the common case. Now, the cylindrical approach to flow theory simplifies the problem dramatically. Instead of counting holomorphic maps to Y, which is this complicated symmetric product, one reduces it to a well-defined problem in complex analysis for each domain, A, essentially applications of Riemannian mapping theorem. While it simplifies, While it simplifies it, this problem on its own, trying to solve it directly, is incredibly difficult. As everybody knows, counting disks is hard. In fact, this disk counting problem can be solved. It can be solved by making homological neurosymmetry that relates the small x and the small y manifest. Working in the derived Foucault-Saddle category as a The derived Foucault saddle category, as opposed to perhaps more familiar to some Foucault saddle category, is actually simpler. It's simpler because the derived category has far fewer objects, as any deformation of brains that doesn't change the homes is an equivalence. So by contrast, in particular, one can generate the entire derived for Chias Hyde category by a finite set of grains, which are symbols of the potential. For every critical point of the potential, and all the critical points in all of our problems, as long as the are going to be isolated, as long as the representations are minuscule. So for every critical point, one gets a pair of left and right symbols, which are respectively the set of initial conditions for the upward and downward gradient flows of the real part of W. W or on which the imaginary part of W is constant. The critical point equations are in all cases a variant of Baythausen's equations. Here I write it for general case, I guess. They are isolated and non-degenerate and labeled by the weights in the weight space, the conformal blocks transforming. Coming, well, the symbols. Uh, well, uh, the symbols depend on a chamber in a covariant parameter space. There's a choice of chamber that's suggested by mirror symmetry in which the left symbols are simply products of D realigned Lagrangians. In fact, for all cases, not just for covanov, they always look the same. They're just products of lines on the cylinder. And moreover, as long as the fixed points are isolated, they're mirrored to line bundles and X. Mirror to line bundles on X. This is just a matter. To formulate the homes between such brains, one has to deform them. This deformation is very well known to people who study numerous symmetry. It leads to what's called the RAG-Foucaire category, after which the intersection points become isolated. There's still infinitely many of them, as they have to be, because by mirror symmetry, homes from any one thimble to exist. Homes from any one thimble to itself coincide with a space of holomorphic functions on the core, which is infinite dimensional. The thimbles generate an algebra because, and not just a vector space, as so if you take the direct sum of all the thimbles that generate the derived Christians category, you get an algebra, which is the endomorphism algebra of the Morphism algebra of the brain T. You don't get simply a vector space, but an algebra because the theory inherits a product from Floyd theory. The algebra, all the algebra elements turn out to have cohomological degree zero. In particular, the action of the differential on them is trivial. So we get an ordinary associative algebra with trivial differential. Associative algebra with trivial differential. This is not an accident, it's a reflection of mirror symmetry, which maps all these real line brains, left symbols, to line bundles on X. So the algebra is ordinary graded associative algebra, graded by the inquivariant degree. Now, there are not many homomorphic discounts that one can actually compute. Fortunately, all the ones that contribute to ones that are com that contribute to the algebra products are computable because they come from products of triangles which um in turn are essentially determined um exactly um by the d equal to one theory i should say this way of solving the theory is very analogous it's it's it's an here we're um i'm switching back to su2 uh is completely analogous replacing gl1 slash one to su2 uh to what su2 by gl1 slash one to SU2 by Gilan Slash one to what Denio Rue did in his 2010 works, I think. Now, since the thimbles generate the derived category and everything we know about the thimbles is contained in the algebra, we get an equivalence of derived categories. For D sub A is a derived category of A modules bounded from the right. Bounded from the right, which comes from this functor that lets you map any brain in a Lagrangian, any object whatsoever of the Chai-Sadel category to module for the algebra. Now, these algebras, being ordinary associative algebras, can always be thought of as path algebra of a quiver, whose nodes correspond to critical points of the potential and where paths And where paths from one node to another encode the homes between the symbols. For us, these quivers always have closed loop in contrast to simpler theories that come from single value potentials. So this results in a richer representation theory and a richer derived category. So for example, for y, which is the equivalent mirror of the a minus one surface. And mirror of the a m minus one surface, the algebra is a path algebra of a familiar quiver, a fine a quiver, with unfamiliar relations which capture symbol intersections and relations between them. The more familiar quiver with relations which look like this arises from actually the big X, where one has the equivalence of the derived category coherent sheaves on the big X, with derived category. The big X with the derived category of an algebra, the script A, based on, which is a path algebra of the same quiver with these relations. Changing the relation, imposing this more restrictive condition, corresponds to restricting the big X to the small X, whose category of brains becomes the derived category of the algebra A, the algebra A that comes from symbols and is a quotient. And is a quotient by imposing this more restrictive relation of the algebra of the big X. So, in this way, homological mirror symmetry becomes manifest. And this is a model how mirror symmetry is understood in all these cases. The algebra is computable explicitly. It has flavors of algebras that appeared in the works of Covanov, Lauda, and Rockwell. Kovanov, Lauda, and Rockwick, which Webster generalized, specifically his most recent generalization. The algebra and the description, the algebra A, however, is much smaller because it's a quotient of Webster cylindrical algebra. And because the algebra is smaller, the description of link invariance we'll get from it will end up far simpler. At least I think it's simple. Ben will tell us. Ben will tell us if it is. By the virtue of the derived equivalence, any brain has a projected resolution as a complex, every term of which is a direct sum of symbols. The maps encode a prescription for how to obtain the brain by starting with the direct sign. Brain by starting with the direct sum of symbols. There should be here a shift by cosmological degree. So the maps include a prescription for how to glue the brains by deforming the differential away from the trivial one. For example, in the case of Y, which is mirrored to the A minus 1 surface, the figure A brain, which serves as our count, has Has a following resolution with three terms. Okay, and the resolution describes how to starting with four symbols in here, gluing them over the intersections at infinity, obtain a figure A. Now, a draft category has a second description in terms of the right symbols, which is, so we really have a pair of equivalences, the two equivalences. The two equivalent ways of generating the derived category of y. All the right symbols are compact and they're dual to the left in this sense, which in particular implies that algebra A check is related to A by Kuzuldeval, which should be an algebraic way to understand this derived equivalence. The important fact for us today is the fact that among all the right symbols, White symbols are the brains that serve as caps. Now, this has a striking consequence. It means that we get a second purely classical description of not homology groups, which we can read off from the description of the cap brain, this product of figurates deformed by the brain infrastructure. Okay. Without any work. Without any work. Moreover, it solves all the instantancing problems at once. As for all brains, the description of the cut brain as a bound set of symbols, as a complex, is obtained by studying with the direct sum of symbols, brains, shifted by homological degree, and deforming the differential away from the trivial by these maps. From that complex, it's an elementary piece of homological algebra that you get for free. Algebra that you get for free a complex of vector spaces. In particular, a complex of vector spaces that compute the homes from this brain to the brains that serve as cups, the product of intervals, when an action of the differential is squares to zero. The link The link homology is the co-homology of this complex. So, as soon as you know, as soon as you have a geometric description of the cat brain deformed by this braiding functor, you're done. This is the complex. It's the geometry of the small piece of the geometry of that brain. Which piece? The piece picked out by the simple, the closes off the braid. That's the common. That's the covenant complex. So, per construction, these vector spaces actually spanned by the intersection points. The differential that's constructed classically in obtaining the brain, describing the cat brain as a complex, sums up all the action of in symptoms. So, this is how this equivalent solves the non-categorification problem. This algebraic description, which I described here for SU2, generalizes along the same lines for Abu Scretchi. So I'm out of time. If you'll give me a minute, I can show you the algebra. I see the algebra. So for SU2, the algebra is best represented graphically. The element of the algebra, so this is not specific to ICU2, is a configuration. Is a configuration of D blue strings and M red ones on a cylinder. If you're familiar with KRL-W algebras, this should be very familiar. Except that there are no dots. A single string diagram, a single string in this diagram describes paths on the one-dimensional version of the quiver. And configurations with D strings describe paths. Describe paths on this more general equivalent, more general D. But essentially, the D equals to one theory encodes, because these are symmetric products, encodes most of the guts of the theory. So every string diagram is made out of string bits that are one of four types that carry specific equivalent degrees, which are known, and where first three come from the one-dimensional problem, and this crossing is new. Crossing is new when you have more than one blue string, when d is more than one. The algebra multiplication is stacking cylinders with relations that are familiar, except that there are no dots. They say that blue strings need to be taught, tight, or else the algebra will be benches. The KRLW algebra of Covin of Lauder, Roque, and Webster are given in similar terms. Lauder, Roke, and Webster are given in similar terms, but with more generators and different relations. By result of Webster, it describes the category of brains in the big X. So it's naturally more complicated. The algebra is A to describe brains downstairs as their quotient. The quotient essentially corresponds to setting the dot to zero. All right. So I think that's enough. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, well thanks. Thanks, Mina. Questions? So, yeah, I'm trying to formulate the right version of this. So, yeah, I don't know if I'm actually. Know if I'm actually, yeah, Jake, go ahead. Sorry. Yeah, so no, I asked you about SUN the last time I saw this talk, but maybe could I ask a more specific question now? So for the SU2 case, you had this kind of nice picture where you had sort of Lagrangians downstairs in C, and then this larger category. This larger category for the scripty X or Y upstairs. And then you kind of push-pulled to get the figure eight, for example. So could you describe sort of what the analogous picture might be for SUN instead of SU2? Something you understand? So what's what's what's um okay, they the the Okay, the story right now is completely worked out for SU2. What's clear for arbitrary G is that there's an algebra A, which is obtained by analogous terms with analogous properties, and the algebra A check, which is dual to it, because the CAP brands, the ones that I described in the first part of the talk, The talk, um, are going to uh uh project to specific simple brains of adult. In the end, the description, I think rather than getting any kind of explicit description in terms of figure eights or Lagrangians like this, that is the right description is purely algebraic. What one needs to work out is exactly and exactly which And exactly which specific simple this part is easy. Which specific simple should you take? The part is easy because mirror symmetry is understood explicitly. And the action of the up and down function. And I think because everything is completely explicit. So quotients behave nicely, I think, with causal duality. So I think that it requires work. It requires work, but I think in the end, we'll have a user-friendly description of algebraic description of homologies for all cases. And you don't want to count instant tons and you probably don't want to draw these funny pictures. The pictures are useful for figuring out what the algebra is and figuring out which symbols should you take, like the dual of which symbols should you take to be the simple. Is the simple that corresponds for? Is the simple that corresponds to, for example, this products of minuscule degrasmania? Those steps are easy to work up. I think, again, in the paper that appeared, there's not yet a fully computer-friendly formulation of color and homology. I think there will be from this. The description of grading functions in terms of symbols is very simple. and uh and um describing um you know describing uh what they what they do on the specific cup brands is not difficult either so thanks okay who's next tip okay just wanted to make sure uh so this uh the braiding functor that you So, this, the braiding functor that you mentioned, is that in your paper, or is that something you plan to do in another paper? I didn't see it. It's not described explicitly. Okay. But braiding these symbols is easy. I mean, right. So, right now, yeah, it's not explicitly described in the paper yet. Okay. Okay, Todor. Hi, Mina. Thanks a lot for the talk. I wanted to check a thing about To check a thing about this thimble description. So, Goyoto and Witten had a superpotential like this and some thimble calculations that they used to get Jones polynomials, but then it was difficult to lift that particular description up to not homology. And I think, like, on the physics side, Dima Golikov and the others worked on it. You seem, I just want to verify, you seem. I just want to verify, you seem to have found a way to do that. So the issue is like there was a Kaler model and then there was a hyper Kaler model on top of it that one could lift to. And you're describing a way to sort of fix the calculations in the Kayler model that Toyota and Witten had by lifting up and going back down. Down so, uh, um, firstly, what's crucial for the story, what was absolutely crucial to even really get the Jones polynomial. I mean, you know, the fact that it's computer Jones polynomial as a theorem, one doesn't have to do any work at all, is understanding of mirror symmetry. To have mirror symmetry, their potential does not work, it's not well, okay. To have, you know, to have, you need, it's a subtle, there's a, there's a, they wrote down a slightly wrong potential. But essentially, one way of understanding is taking a slightly wrong limit from three dimensions down to down to down to two. But what you lose is you lose mirror symmetry. Okay. Um, and mirror symmetry is what buys you, for example, the fact that, you know, this. fact that um you know these thimble brains that they exist and they they are mirrored to just lime bundles and eggs right um the brains that the thimbles that they were using um i think you would always be i think this this specific chamber is entirely motivated by mirror symmetry and nobody else considered these symbols before okay yeah thanks right i was just sort of asked to have this all related I was just sort of asked to have this all related to that. Thank you. Yeah, but it's working in this specific chamber, which where the symbols look like real line like ranges, one set of thymbals, and the others are dual to these vanishing cycles, which is just crucial. Yeah. I just wanted to ask you if you understand what happens at large N. No, I don't. I have not. No, I don't. I have not thought about it at all. This is all very, I'm not saying that there's not, um, yeah, I don't know. So, this usually things which work well for Andou algebra are kind of orthogonal for things which work.
