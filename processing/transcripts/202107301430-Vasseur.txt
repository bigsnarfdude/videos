This is our last talk for the workshop. We're very happy to have Professor Alexis Vassel from the University of Texas at Austin, and he will give us a lecture on instability of finite time blow-up solutions for incompressible Euler equation. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for the introduction. Thank you very much to all the organizers for the invitation and for giving me the opportunity to give a talk. The opportunity to give a talk today. That's really nice. And thank you for putting this conference together. I think it was really a great conference. I really enjoyed it. Before going into more details here, I should right away not forget to mention my collaborators. It's a joint work with Laurent LaFleche and Michel Bishik, both from the University of Texas. Both from the University of Texas. Misha, I mean, I'm sure everybody knows Misha. And Laurent is a postdoc here. Okay, so I will go through all that. What I should say right away, it will be about Euler equation, 3D Euler equation, and it's about stability, right, or instability more, and the link between. More and the link between stability and regulatory. So, I will show some results in general and then recent results on the axisymmetric case. I will explain why we're interested in this and a bit of idea of the proof. And then it will be basically very close to the end of the conference. So, let's begin with the Euler equation. Everybody knows about the Euler equation. This is really the simple form here. Is really the simple form here. The important thing is that I consider a 3D case, right? And the other important thing is that I consider a smooth initial value. And with this initial value, smooth, so you can ask me smooth C infinity. Well, actually, maybe C4 would be enough, but really smooth, right? And the question that That we want to address is what happens if we have a blow-up in finite time. So, of course, it is an open question, right? But in everything that we do here, we assume that the solution stays smooth enough up to a certain time, T star. So, in terms of boundaries, so actually, the result is pretty general with respect to this. You can consider R3, T3, or 3 T3 or any smooth domain, let's say, of course, if you add a boundary, then you will add the impermeability condition on this boundary. So nothing fancy there. So as I said, I mean, whether such a solution blows up in finite time is not known. I mean, there is some result. I will talk later about it, right? I mean, I'm a big fan of the result of Tarek El Gindhi, especially, but I will talk a bit. But I will talk a bit more about that. But right now, I should say that I'm not exactly in this case anyway because of the smoothness. We need more smoothness and the initial value for now. So when we began to work on that with Misha, I mean, the idea, which was a very naive idea, right, but it was to say, well, it is pretty well documented that a numerical prediction of such growth. That numerical prediction of such growth is hard business, right? I mean, and we had a very nice talk about Tom showing this. I mean, if you want to be able to say something numerically, and you really have to work hard and do a lot of care in the way you treat numerical treatments. And it's very different from other situations when you can see blow-up pretty easily. So, the question that we had was a sort of The question that we had was a sort of a naive question. We said, but can we set something in terms of, can we prove something which goes into this direction, explaining why this case is different with respect to this, why it is so hard, right? And just to remind you all this, I came back to an old story. I came back to an old story, so it's an old story of 10, 20, 30 years ago, right? But now, of course, numerical people know how to do things far better. But there was this numerical computation that I've seen before, and I was pretty interested by it a long time ago. And there was this numerical computation of care, who so 1990s were a long time ago, we find in 2005. Time ago, we find in 2005, which is actually very close to the kind of problem that we've seen in the talk of Terry Tau when you mentioned certain also numerical experiments. And basically, here, what they were showing at the time, with, I mean, the method that they had at the time, is showing, predicting a sort of finite time blow-up. So you can see that there's a single line here. Can see that there are several lines here. You can concentrate, for instance, in the first one, which is one of the vorticity. And it was almost a line, right? And so there was this prediction that you should have a blow-up around for this problem time 18.7, right? And it was a blow-up like one over T minus T star, right, for omega. But of course, I mean, as you know, so this is basically a visualization actually of who on. Actually, of who only in the paper of who only, right? So, here in a computation of 2006, right? And so, this was the situation that you have when you have two vortex here, one in one direction, the other one in the other, which is in blue is a visualization when you have, I think, 80% of the vorticity. And of course, they were showing that those things are attracting themselves, but of course, when they attract, then they're Tract, then the flatten, there's an interesting dynamic here. Now we know that if you go even further, there's really very complicated dynamics here, but especially in this paper of Tom Hu and Li, what they proved in their computation is that actually there's no blow-up. You have a gross, double exponential growth, right? Because here is the log log of omega, but they were able to But they were able to pass in a pretty stable way past this time, 18.7 or whatever. That was predicted. Okay, so just to show, I mean, now there's, of course, far more technology, but it shows that things are complicated, but they think there is really a hard problem there. So the main question is somewhat the main question of this talk: is can we prove something in general that explains the high level of difficulties that Level of difficulties that we face when trying to obtain human equal evidence of law solution to all. And the philosophy of our result, if you want, is basically so in everything that we do, you take a smooth solution up to a finite time, you assume that at this time you have a blow-up, as a time that I will call t-star, right? And What we will show is that when you approach this time, then your solution becomes more and more unstable in LP, or less and less stable in LP when the T goes to T star. So in some way, in a naive way, what we were expecting to be able to say is that, of course, what it means means that small perturbations initial value induce Initial value induces more and more discrepancy of the solution. And so it's more and more difficult when you approach this time of blow up to approach it, right? Because just a small perturbation have a cascading effect. Okay, so this is at the end a result about comparing stability and regularity. So I need to say. So, I need to say what is, I mean, what kind of stability we are looking at, because of course, it's highly dependent on the linear stability concepts that we're putting it, right? So, what we are talking here is about linear stability. And so, basically, what we do, well, if you consider any time t before the blowing of time, and we'll consider always this time, right? And then we will then. And then we will then the t goes to t star, but first you fix this t, right? And this is before the blowing up points. So there is no polar regularity in terms of the solution, the non-linear solution, right? So u is completely smooth, as smooth as you need, right? And then what we consider is a linearization of the Euler equation close to this non-linear solution. So the V here, I mean, you can see this equation is just the linearization of your Euler equation close to this fixed U, but which Close to this fixed U, but which depends on time, right? So it depends on time, but you're looking at it before the time goes up. And basically, what we want to do now is to see the growth of the mode. So for any initial value V0, so you fix the time t and you want to see the growth of this V0, right? I mean, through this semi-group. So you consider the semi-group G of T, which two group g of t which to an initial value v give you the v of t and basically you want to measure the growth of this semi-group uh so i mean in a very uh naive way again it would be to try to see the growth from ap2p right so why naive actually is what we've done first our first paper is about that lp2p i will explain why uh this was really naive and why is why actually it's better to do better and actually To do better, and actually, we can. I mean, it's the same result, but just to explain more precisely what we get, we can get something better that shows the growth of Lp and Lp. What we can consider is what is called the Kalkin semi-norm of G of T, right? And what is this thing? This is the growth, if you want, of the LP norm, but up to a compact operator, right? This means this is a growth up to any perturbation by a compact operator. Compact operator. And I will explain why, actually, if you want to compare and to try to give an interpretation of what we're saying and what we and our result, why this is important. So you can see this gamma P of T measuring the norm of this semi-group when time is fixed. So as a quotient of the bounded operator of magnitude. Of the bounded operator from LP to LP by compact operators from LP to LP. And obviously, this growth is smaller than the LP norm itself. So of course we can measure the growth in LP, but here it's more refined. I mean, we can refine it and show that actually we can show dramatic growth of something which is the Calcincom in the mortgage. Okay, so basically we want to see the growth of this through this. Of this through this norm. I'm surprised that it's not something else I was expecting here. So I will say it, maybe I put it later, but especially if you look at this problem as a spectral problem, the fact that we filter out the compact operator shows right away that it's not a problem of eigenvalue to look at. eigenvalue to represent that. Actually, what the instability that we will show are instability which based on the singular spectrum. It really comes from the sorry, so the essential spectrum. It really comes from the essential spectrum. And okay, I mean this is something that you can keep in mind. I know there's some people who don't like this, but I think that in some way that the nice things, right? It shows that it's really something different than what we usually expect. It's really a different. What we usually expect is really a different things which happen here. Okay, so let's go first on the easy part when we compare a standardian smoothness. I mean, it's very easy to show that as long as your solution is smooth, actually it is stable, right? And it's just you can show it just by Just by energy method, right? It's actually the growth in L P, right? The growth in L P grows exponentially like the integral of gradient to infinity, right? So as long as the gradient is infinity, regularity, I mean, irregularity implies stability very easy. But what we are interesting, interested in, not interesting, interested, sorry, it's interested. We're interested in is other causality, right, is to show that actually if you are still Actually, if you are stable, then you are smooth, right? And this is a result that we have here, so the first result. So fix any LP, right? And what we can show is that this coefficient which measures the stability, right, the stability is bounded by below by the Linux unit, the vorticity. And of course, for the bilicatoma, Catomida, it means that as long as your stable as this is banded, then you're smooth because this stays banded, right? In some way, it gives another bilcatomaida condition. You can say, well, then you can show that stability control regularity. So you have to expect, if you have a block, you have to expect to be unstable in this framework. Framework. Yeah, because of course, what we're interested in is contrapositive, and the quantitative says that if you blow up, this converges to plus infinity when t converged to t star, then this coefficient also will blow up. And so when t converged to t star, you become unstable. Okay. So that's the result we have in mind. Before going further, there is a several things I should say. I should say. So, one silly, but it's the last day, right? So, one silly remark is that actually the thing is very different from the scenario, for instance, of compressible fluid dynamics. And here, this is one slide on Burger. So, I will get something super simple. But just to have an idea of things very different here, right? If you consider a Burgers equation, and here I have a very sophisticated numerical experiment, to show that in finite time, Try to show that in finite time you have a shock. Of course, I'm joking. I mean, this is easy, right? I mean, just getting it, right? And actually, you can prove that this is stable in L1, linear stable, right? And I have the proof here. If you linearize this equation, then you can obtain this equation, dt plus dx u equals zero. Again, it's for t before u goes up, right? Everything is smooth. V and I mean, it's transport equation is very easy. I mean, it's transport equation, it's very easy to show that the L1 norm, if you have this, actually, you can put absolute norm here is still true, right? And so it shows that when you integrate in time, it shows that actually it's stable in L1, right? So your growth in L1 does not grow, right? So your B of T is just bounded. So it shows, you know, that what's happening, basically what we say is that what's happening for Euler is not that, right? It's very different, right? It's not that, but it's very different, right? It's something very different from this situation. Another remark going further is why this calculus. So I said that it was important. So why? Why this thing is important? And actually, this is from a remark from Yao. So I'm very thankful to her to tell me this in private before I got. I got trouble having to answer in public. So here's the situation, but seriously, I mean, this is interesting. This is the situation: is when you consider, if you want to say that this linear instability says something to the real problem, right? To the real problem of trying to solve the non-linear. If you want this, this is that you expect that small perturbation of u epsilon, right, we have linearly like the linear equation, right? But when you change a bit your initial. When you change a bit your initial value, let's say, then you have a small perturbation u epsilon. And actually, what you should expect, and what you have in almost all the case for other equations, is that actually it will change also your blowing up time. So what you should expect is that your blowing up time won't be T star, it will be a T star epsilon, right? And if you take this into account, right, and you look what you will get when you look at just Just the evolution of your semi-group as I did before. So you say this G of T V zero is V of T. This is linear, but this linear, I expect it to be the perturbation of U epsilon with respect to epsilon, but because I want to see what's happening exactly at this T star, I need to make a translation of the T star, which is the blowing up of U with respect to the blowing up of U epsilon, because this is what's happening at the Boulevard time that you want to compare. And if you do this, You want to compare. And if you do this and you do just a linearization of these things, what you get is on top of what should interest you, which is the growth of the profile up to the change of time, you have also a growth which depends only on the change of time, which is this C of V zero, and you see the T star epsilon minus T star epsilon. But you can expect, well, and when epsilon goes to zero, Expect when epsilon goes to zero, you can expect that this will depend only on the perturbation of the initial value, right? And if you have this, what you can see is that this is a scalar, which should be linear with respect to u, but for any time t fixed, right, I mean, zt of u is the fixed function u, which is which is your blow of function. So especially it's one quan, it's 1.1 in v, right? But still, now if you look, try to see, well, now if I'm looking at the I'm looking at the growth of this in LP, which was what I was claiming, right? So, if you look at the gross LP, well, you can say, well, again, I mean, just looking at things, you say, okay, so UX blows up, let's say, like T star minus T minus alpha, just to give an idea, then you can expect the things that you want to blow up in the same fashion. But then you can see that your DTU here, because you differentiate this, blow up faster. So this means that if you look Faster. So, this means that if you look at the growth of G, actually, you don't really measure what you want. You measure something which is not very interesting, which is just to say, well, you have a change of time. If you change the initial value, then you change the block time, which is, I mean, that was a fantastic remark, right? I mean, that was really, really, really great. This is what you have to be careful when you work on hypothetical things, is what you are really saying, right? So, but then we rely that our result itself. Our result itself was not dependent on that, because especially the things that we capture, right? So, we want to capture these things, but what we really capture is the semi-normal calcing norms, which means this is a growth up to compact. So, especially if you have a term which is a finite dimension, then it's filtered out. And that's why this calculating norm. Out, and that's why this calculating norm is interesting, is important because basically it means that it's really this that we see the course, right? Because this is this is round one, so you don't see it if you consider the calcinor. So, all this to say that when you do this kind of business, you have to be careful to claim what you get, right? But here in this situation, we are really looking at the growth of the things when you filter. All the things when you filtered the change of time, right? I mean, hopefully, in a situation like this. Okay, oh, and this was here, okay. And why is that? I mean, all those things showed why we all this is because we are not looking at the eigenvalue. The kind of instability that we get are not due to eigenvalues, right? Because this would be one, typically, and this is typically what you get when you consider this kind of problem, right? The change of time. The change of time corresponds to an eigenvalue, right? That you have here. Well, here is not the eigenvalue that you look at, you filter them out actually, and it's really into the essential spectrum. Okay. So, what's next? So, I mean, we wanted to go a bit further than that because now there's a lot of very nice actually not only Not only numerical experiment, but proof, right? That's the thing. So, especially, we were very interested by this result of Luan Hu, where they predicted and when they computed numerically a blow up at the boundary, but in the axisymmetric case, right? And again, here is again something which comes directly from their Directly from their paper. What is this? It doesn't seem to be the white paper. It should be the paper here. But basically, I mean, the double maximum vorticity, but basically what they showed is, I mean, a very good prediction of blob in finite time, right? Right, and on top of it is not only that the neural looks good, but on top of it is backed up by mathematics, especially they have a proof of the fact that the final time blow up on the boundary. And the proof is based on this fantastic work of Tyke Guindi, right? When he showed for the first time the collapse in finite time of the Of the Euler equation when you take initial value, which are C1 alpha. Okay, so we were very interested in this and to say, well, what can we say about something? So here, of course, as you all know, C1 alpha is very important, right? I mean, the initial for now, the initial value has to be not smoother. So it's a difference. But in terms of at least the numerics, right? I mean, The numerics, right? I mean, in terms of the numerics, I mean, C1 alpha also infinity. I mean, I should be careful what I say. Let Tom talk about it, but I don't see how that's a huge difference. And so again, in a very naive way, we had this question and said, well, the fact that we're able to get this, is it due to the axisymmetric geometry or is it all the stuff, basically? Basically, right? And you could have expected that the axisymmetric geometry comes stabilizing, right? Because it's not only that you have basically what we say that whatever solution that you have, so axisymmetric or not, so especially you're axisymmetric, you know that it becomes unstable when the time comes is closer and closer to t-stone. But it may be because of oscillation, which, sorry, perturbation, which are not axisymmetric, right? So now if you look at perturbation, which have themselves Which themselves are axisymmetric, then it may be a way to stabilize things, right? And so, this is the next result. And basically, what we've shown is that it's not the case. So, here what we consider, so now you can see, so this is like the gamma before, right? This would measure the growth of instability, if you want, depending on time. If you want, depending on time, right? And again, you take everything up to a compact operator, right? So we don't look at the gain value. Now, the important thing is that even the perturbations are axis symmetric, right? So you look only along axis perturbation. And there is a new trick that, well, we did because we need it, but actually it's kind of nice, is that we can add a weight, right? So, a weight, right? So, it's not only LP, it's weighted LP. So, we are looking at weighted, I mean, growth of instabilities in a weighted LP up to compact operator. That's the thing. And now we say that, well, you need some condition between the P and the weight, but But basically, you have the same result that if you have a time t star, you assume that your solution blows up at this t star, then your instability blows up also when t equal to this t star. And the fact that we were able to play with this r minus sigma, we're able to have a slightly better, I mean, slightly more. So, this is to show, we were interesting to say that. show we were interesting to say that okay we have instability of the function itself but in a way that the function grows themselves and usually what you what you are more interesting when you interested in when you you you do numerical numerical computation or even when you do when you're interested in stability of brain problem is more the stability of the blood profile right so we have a first result here still We have a first result here, it's still a bit murky, but it is there. And basically, we say, Well, now we assume not only that your solution blows up, but we assume that it blows up with a certain profile, right? Which is what you hope usually, what you expect. I mean, this is basically what Tom Hu shows, right? I mean, in his numerics, that you have something like that, except that that's not exactly. Except that that's not exactly this. I cannot really compare to this because here is for the x-star is close to zero, right? It's not the boundary. So, but with all this, I mean, this is kind of idea that you have, and you want to expect, and so this means that you expect that there is a profile here, so you have two terms, alpha and beta, and what we consider now is you consider linear, the linearized Euler, right? And your solution V is a solution linearized Euler. Is a solution we minimize an blur, but you rescale this solution in the scaling of your blur profile. You clean it up by taking out all the eigenvalue, because you don't care about the eigenvalue. And now what you care is really V, so the growth of V as perturbation of your blood profile. And so that's the And so that's the thing that you have. You look at the growth of the Vs, right, when you have filtered out the finite dimensional operator there. And the results that we have, so here when I say it's murky, because now it depends, you know, there is some condition, the alpha and beta depends on a coefficient which depends on your assumption on your block. You have different coefficients that you put there. The P is the L P that you choose. P is the L P that you choose. So, under a condition on the P with respect to the blow-up coefficients, if you assume that your blow-up is non-trivial, your blow-up profile is non-trivial in the sense that the curl of U is different from zero, right? Then if then at this time T star, when you have your blog profile, your blog profile becomes Block profile becomes instable in this sense. Yeah, so in this case, as I say, why it depends on at r equal to zero, which does not correspond exactly to the numerics that are available, but it corresponds to the solution of L Kind. Okay, so again, it corresponds to the solution of L Kind in terms of geometry. Contrary to solution of AD in terms of geometry, not in terms of regularity, we cannot really claim now that we're talking about the same solution, especially because we need more regularity in short value, right? And something that I try to clear up. I will talk about those certainty later. But before going there, I wanted to give you, the proof is very simple. I mean, the principle is pretty simple. And I wanted to give you, I mean, I wanted to give you, I mean, just an idea of how this works and just a WKB approach. So basically what we do, so this WKB expansion method, so it was developed for Euler, especially by Susan and Misha, right? So you see why we were together. And it was especially, I mean, it's a standard tool in order to define rigor, that's how they use it. To define regurgitation, so they use it in order to define regurgitation: the concept of fluid Yapin of exponents, right? And especially, so it's all about trying to get exponential in time stability of a steady state for Euler, right? And basically, the idea here, so now I'm have a time dependent, but okay, and it's to look at your solution of your linearized Euler, and you do an expansion when you look at very high frequency, right? So, B of Frequency, right? So, B of T here is the amplitude of your V, the psi here, well, is the evolution of the gradient, right, along the flow. And you can see that for high frequency, asymptotically, for small epsilon, actually your system of Euler is described by the bi-characteristic amplitude ODE. So, it's an ODE, right? So, that's what is simplified here. Here. Basically, so gamma is just a position. So, of course, you are following the flow. So, you take a point, you follow the flow. So, it's a characteristic of the function u. Then you have psi and b. So, this is the equation of the evolution of the gradient, if you want, the evolution of the amplitude. And they depend on the dx of u along the characteristic, right? So, this dx u is the gradient of u. Dx U is a gradient of U, but around the characteristic. And what you get is an ODE, right? It depends only on the value. And it's coupled, I mean, the function of psi, of course, depends on gamma, but not on B, and the function of B co-requistine. So that's basically the equation that you have here, right? So very standard for WKB things. So what you get for exactly, I mean, for Euler, what you get. I mean, for Euler, what you gain by doing this is that all the difficult terms in Euler, which are non-local, become local at high frequency, which is not surprising, right? I mean, high frequency is like working with Fourier, right? So for Fourier, so for instance, the incompressibility here, for high frequencies, the complexibility becomes algebraic condition, right? That at each point, b dot xi is equal to zero. xi is equal to zero, like in 40. And the lower projection, the lower projection is, so you want the lower projection of this, and what you get again is a term which is now purely local and which is proportional to xa, right? This is the gradient, the gradient of the pressure. And that's what you get. So this means that you have a lot of local information that you can get here. And just one example, if you consider now For example, if you consider now the omega, but omega is not omega as the vorticity of B, right? Is the vorticity of the nonlinear quantity. So you consider the real vorticity of the linear problem. And this quantity, you can compare it to P, and you have a sort of elicity, right, the local conservation. So the elicity, you know, is the fact that for Euler, the rule Euler, you have the omega times U when you integrate is. Is conserved. Here it's a local conversation, right? It's not after integrating, it's really locally, right? And it means that in some way you can relate the vorticity, the growth of vorticity and the growth of B. Of course, it's just one, so it's not enough. You have more, and there is a far more very nice structure, which is really Euler related at this level. And that's what you in some way. In some way, harvest at this level. So it's a lot of structures that are known for the Euler for integrated quantity. But the nice thing is high frequency is local. And actually, there's even others which are kind of surprising. I didn't put them there, but we realized very recently to try to push the theory further. Okay, so what is the proof then? Well, the proof is then now. The proof is then now you consider what I call beta here is the growth of the amplitude when you make perturbation on the amplitude at equal to zero and the direction where you put your psi gives in some ways a direction when you put your perturbation, right? So you put direction in a certain direction with a certain amplitude and you want to look how this beta grows, right? beta group right and through the the typical w pop expansion you can compare the growth of this beta of t of this high frequency regime with respect to the growth of the LPNOM right is basically constructing a weak solution which is very close to your and that's that that you put there right so you can see that the solution that you consider are high frequency solution right it's not eigenvalue again this is It's not eigenvalue. Again, this is where we see that what we're looking at is high frequencies. So it's the essential spectrum there, right? That is really through this that you can see what we're doing here. And then the next things is to compare by the direction, what you want to compare is actually the growth of omega with respect to the growth of The growth of these amplitudes per high frequency. And basically, when you can compare to all this, then you have the result. So basically, you have the stability of the linearizer lower. So here it would give the gamma p of t, yeah, up to the sub norm. Again, why the semi-norm is because it's a limit for high frequency. That's the link between it. Okay. What about the axisymmetric case? So, for the axisymmetric case, what is the difficulty? Well, the difficulty is that now, when you choose your psi, you have not on any point, you cannot choose your psi in all direction. Because if you want to reconstruct a function which is axis symmetric, this means that along the direction, this means that along the direction of the direction of your symmetry right i mean you can you cannot have a change uh you cannot have your fast uh change of v and what it means means that the psi you cannot have all the psi so it limits uh the psi that you can get if it limits the xi that you can get it means it limits the the the the solution uh that you can consume That you can construct in B of T, right? The soup here now is on the sum family of psi. So it limits your ability to grow better, right? And especially it shows that when we compare things, we are able to show the growth, but only the growth, you can compare to the growth, but not on all the growth of omega, only on the polaroidal growth of omega, right? And but okay, so after work, we were able to put this part. We're able to put this part with respect to the omega. And actually, it's not very hard to see that you can have a big catomida for the axisymmetric, which depends only on the poly. I mean, usually, right? I mean, it's the other one. I mean, the nice equation on the axisymmetric case is respect to the omega set, right? But it turns out that you can get with respect to omega theta. For some reason, we needed some weight here, close to zero. I'm not sure that it's yet that it's absolutely. Yeah, that it's absolutely necessary, but we needed them. In some way, that was nice because it forced us to consider weighting norm, weighting norm, which was interesting to consider anyway. But that's why that was the first reason why we introduced those weighting normation. Okay, so that's the axis metric case. I'm already fine. Okay, so there is a lot of things that we want to do. Okay, so there is a lot of things that we want to do, right? Especially now, so as you see, of course, it's a conditional result, right? Is if something blows up, then you have this. If it blows up that way, then you have this. So it's not always completely clear what is the best result, what's the result which is really interesting. And now, because there is all those great results, in terms of numerics, in terms of event proof, right, with this work, with the With this work with Tarek, it would be very interesting to be able to compare them. And that's what we are trying to do now: to see how the situation that we are working are different or similar. And if they're similar, why they're not contradicting themselves. I mean, for instance, with the work of L Dindi, they clearly do not contradict because the solution of L D are certainly not stable in our framework. They are stable with a very strong. With a very strong norm, which basically imposes the way you want to see the blow-up, but certainly not in our case. But it would be still interesting to prove it, right? So it would be still interesting to say that those solutions cannot be stable in our framework. But this we cannot say exactly because we need more regularity, but it's something that we think that we should be able to work with, right? To work with, right? But for now, we need more regularity. I do not remember, I mean, maybe C3 and there's something here. So it's not clear that we are talking about the same object, whatever we claim afterwards. Of course, it's also with respect to numerics. I think that with the work of Tom Hu to understand why in some way he managed to get through this, it can be a lot of reason, it can be because what we claim Claim is different, or it could be because the blow profile that it gets gets out of the blog profile that we control. And it can be a lot of things, but it will be, I think, very interesting to understand this. And of course, I mean, I was very interested, for instance, the talk of Cheryl Tar when he was trying to get a full theory which would go to blow-up of Nairostoks. To blow up of Niestoks, if there were stability of Euler, well, it gives in some way a way to see the limit of such a theory, right? I mean, things can be done and things we can't, right? In some ways, I see this as a sort of Bill Catomaida result, right? Another situation which prevents a blow-up. And in this situation, where, you know, I mean, if you want. Where you know, I mean, if you want stability, whether stability failed because of a neiggen value or because it's because of the extension spectrum, it doesn't change that it's not stable, right? So at the end, if you want a stability result, I mean, just you just make it fair. But there is also direction that we're looking at. Actually, we would like to have a stability in C alpha. Again, I mean, it was to go, you know, closer and closer to the ADD things. Of course, it will be. The LED things, of course, it will be still different because it will be C alpha with weights and different weights at Z equal to zero. But we think that's something that interesting and you should be able to do, at least for some range of alpha. I think something that we can do, but anyway, we still need to write a paper. And here is completely wide, right? But of course, can we say something about money and stability? In general, certainly not. Certainly, not if here we are talking anyway about hypothetical results. I mean, maybe you know, assuming that if you assume that you have a blow-up with a certain profile, with, can we get non-inharm stability? That's something that's, you know, I mean, if the conditions are reasonable, it could be interesting too, but it's still not clear where we go there. We were there. And I think that's a good time to stop and to thank you all for your attention.
