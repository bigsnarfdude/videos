We can see it online. You can see it online. Okay, and if you can see it, I don't know if there are people there. They're saying that they can see it. Excellent. All right. That's good news. So I won't speak in the vacuum. All right. So first of all, thank you, the organizers, for putting this together. So we have some lovely talks. have some lovely talks until now so prepare for a let down and i will talk to you about you know this is a workshop on pattern formation and the funny thing is that i probably want to talk to you about the opposite the absence of patterns which will be kind of fun uh so before i start i just want to tell you who does this work because i barely finished my talks uh Finish my talks. So, Larry Max and Erin have done much of this work along with Nathan Kine, who is now at Penn State. She basically originated a lot of the ideas that you're going to see here today, along with Aaron Max and Aaron, and my collaborators that you see here. So, these are the people to blame for what I'm going to tell you. So, I'm going to tell you about disorder solids. Like I said, perhaps not something that you see many patterns, but we'll see where we're going. That you see many patterns, but we'll see where we're going with this. And this solid, you can find them all the way from the atomic all the way to the grain size. You saw a few today, although more crystalline. And they have a problem. One of the problems is that they're prone to fracture. They're brittle. And anyone who has dropped their smartphone without a cover knows that. They just take a little bit, and now a little bit more, and just More and just crash and splatter all over. But there are other places when you see this, you know, in bridges and paints and pipes and so on and so forth. The interesting thing about them is that not long ago, if you take all of the types of disorder materials from colloids to nanoparticles to amorphous carbon, you find that their huge strain is Strain is about 3%. So here's the old stress as a function in the loading models, and here's all these disorders solids that you can think of. And that says about 13 orders of magnitudes in elastic models and seven orders of magnitude and size in terms of the grains of waste to amorphous solids. And it feels like the yield strain is always about 3%, which is quite remarkable for a disorder material. So that's something I want you to keep in your mind. So, that's something I want you to keep in your mind. So, when you have this stress over strain, you find this 3%, you know, roughly for all this material. So, it's something cool to see. While crystalline materials, they have a little bit more of a broad range of use. The other thing that I told you is that they are brittle. So, and that's something that we want to, from a material science standpoint, we want to actually. Why we want to actually improve, we wanted to increase the toughness, if you will. We want to increase the window between yield and fracture, right? Issue is that, as I told you, this point over here is relatively fixed. We cannot play too much with this window here from a microscopic standpoint. And we want to increase this area over here. So, because we cannot play too much with that, right, one of the ways. Much with this, right? One of the ways that we think about is perhaps changing this, you know, interpreting the microstructure or playing with the microstructure and see if we can do something about increasing this windows. And so the question we have here is, what are the fundamental factors that affect this window, plastic flow, yield, between yield and fracture? All right, so that will be the theme here. So to improve those properties, that's the, you know, the goal, you know. The goal, the overarching goal. So, one of the first things we would like to do is perhaps predict this particle rearrangements or the constituent rearrangement, but just measure their positions, right? So, how you go from structure to dynamics. And if you can do that, hopefully use the knowledge then to understand and control yield and toughness, which is the rheology of material properties of this. So, that is how this topic. So, that is how this topic is structured. What we would like to do is make this connection between particle dynamics, bulk rheology, and structural changes. Okay, so that is what we're going to do. So, I'm going to tell you a little bit in the first part about the connection between structure and dynamics. And then I'm going to tell you the second part, the connection between structure and biology. So, here's the model system. So here's the model system. So I'm going to produce a disorder system, a model disorder system, if you will. And this will be a 2D model system. It is oil. So these are particles, eight thermal particles about 4.1 to 5 micrometers. So they are bi-disperse to produce disorder or to avoid crystallinity as well. They're going to be in an oil-water interface. And the particles are negatively charged, but because the water that you have. Negatively charged, but because the water that you have this green here, this positive charges, so they become repulsive. So there's a type of repulsion between them. So all these particles will be sitting at this interface. And here's an image of these particles. And you can see that there is some bright spaces between the particles that the particles don't touch the repulse. And there are walls around it, right? So they're jammed. They're jammed. And the area fraction for this is about 43%. Okay. And they're large. So there are no thermal motion. So these ethermal particles. So these are soft jam materials, athermal materials. So that is our model system. So then we take that interface and this is the thing you can do. You can play around with the different types of particles that you have. Different types of particles that you have. You can have more monodisperse, so you see a lot more crystallinity. You can have more bitisperse, you know, change the duration between the particles you have. You can create different amounts of crystallinity or polycrystallinity in there or disorder, if you will. So this is the type of systems that we can make in terms of the material. Now, you take this material and you put it in, this is the water-oil interface here, between two. Between two walls, your glass slides. And then you place a magnetic needle here. And you take this entire thing and you put it in the Helmutz coil. So with the Helmutz coil, you can take this needle and go back and forth, right, and produce a shear flow between the needle and the wall here, right? So in essence, what you have a very So, in essence, what you have a very precise shear flow with the needle that can oscillate back and forth. So, this is what we call the interfacial stress barometer that we built in my limit. Actually, Nickton did a lot of this work. And this is not the first time this has been done. In fact, the first time this has ever been done was by a student of Elisabeth Dusson, who at the time was a chemical engineer in. Was a chemical engineer in Apen, and this is the original apparatus. We took a picture of it from a PhD thesis in 1986, and she built this. I didn't even know that it was there. So, and this is the inspiration for a lot of this now, the different versions of this interfacial stress barometer that you see out there that other people have used. Okay, so this is how it looks like. So, you take How it looks like. So, you take the needle, it goes back and forth in a sinusoidal way. This is PowerPoint, so it doesn't look sinusoidal. But you get the picture, you take the material and you shear it with us. Because we know the equation of motion, we can track the needle and we can do some simple force balance, we can obtain the reality, the interface riot. And that interface riology has to be much larger than the bulk reality. Larger than the bulk rheology. And that is given by the Bausenax number. In our experiments, the Business number is about 100. So we're pretty sure that we're getting the interface rheology. That is the rheology of the particles at the interface. The Reynolds number is well below one. Particles are small. The speed of the meter is very small. So we can obtain actually very good rheology out of these things. There's very good inertia here. So here it is. So here it is, you know, you can get G prime and G double prime, elastic modulus and viscous moduli, as a function of the strain amplitude of the needle, right? So this is a sinusoidal wave at a frequency of 0.1 hertz, right? And this is, again, this is the storage module. At one point, it drops and the viscous modulus grow. And if you plot the 10 delta, you will see that about 3% is where things are start to. Where things start to where the storage modulus starts to go down, right? So that is what we call the yield stress of this material around 3%. Okay, so the question is, what is happening at the microstructure at that 3% before and after around that area? What is happening? The beauty of this system is that you can attach a microscope and now you can track about 50 to 60,000. About 50 to 60,000 particles in space and time, right? And this is how it looks like. So, this is the monolayer, and hopefully, this will play. So, this is about 50,000 particles, and it going back and forth. So, this is what the needle does. So, the needle is at the bottom, the wall is non-slip boundary position at the top, and you're shearing this back and forth. This is a very large strain amplitude, 40%. Large train amplitude, 40%. And we're doing this, what you see in your screen right now, we're doing this to remove all the residual stress that happen once you start making this monolayer. In other words, you're trying to erase as much memory as possible. So once you finish this protocol, you interrupt, you let the system come to rest, you quench it, and you resume a much smaller amplitude to make the smash. Amplitude to make those measurements. So that is my experimental system. Okay, so I can measure the reality and I can track particles. And because of that, you know, I can track this as an example of it. I can tell which parts of the particles undergo affine or non-affine deformation. And this is characterized by this quantity called ditumen. So you take a particle, you look at the shells. You take a particle, you look at the shells, of usually two particle shells around, and you can ask the question whether that shell of particles are having affine or non-affine deformations. And that will tell you quite a bit about local plasticity in the sample. Again, just to be clear, this is the strain, this is time, and we're given a sinusoidal forcing. And we're going to look mostly at a stromoscopic. At the stromoscopic rearrangements or stromoscopic measurements. All right. So here's one example of this non-affine deformations. If you look below yield, below the 3%, you have a lot of this little regions of non-affine deformation that over time go away. Over time, all of that non-affine deformation just goes away. You have just a few of these. Just goes away, you have just a few of these things. While above you, a lot of it remains. So, this is the steady state. This is at the beginning of it, and you let it run over time. And you can see that above you, you have a lot more of this non-affine deformation. So, this is one way to microstructurally look at yield. And it happens again around 3% when we see that transition. Okay, so that's what we. Okay, so those that's where we are, and now we need to characterize this structure and this disorder system. Unlike crystalline materials, where structural defects can be characterized by dislocations, we have a lot of theory on that. The same is not quite possible for disordered materials. We don't have those analogous defects, right? And there's a lot of research in trying to find metrics for those to. Those to characterize disorder systems, right? So, here's a paper just recently in 2020, in which these authors looked at different metrics of disorder to see which one will correspond better with local rearrangements. And these are simple as two-point correlation functions all the way to machine learning methods. So, you can see that there is a widespread range of. Widespread range of metrics to do this because we don't have a universal order parameter to characterize disorder. So here I'm going to pick one of this and it's going to see how it goes. And the one I'm going to focus on, and you're going to see why, is the concept of excess entropy. And it's really configuration entropy beyond or Beyond or relative to an ideal gas, an ideal gas being the most quote-unquote disorder disorder system. And I'm not here trying to imply that entropy is equal to disorder. I'm not trying to say that, but this is configuration of entropy. And I'm going to tell you probably how to think about this. So if you take this, you know, kinetic gas, you know, the energy can be decomposed into. The energy can be decomposed into kinetic energy and potential energy. The ideal gas has all kinetic energy. It's just vibration, it's just kinetic energy. While an athermal solid will be mostly due to its potential energy. So that's how we look at that. You can do the same for entropy. So you have the kinetic entropy, you have the potential entropy, right? What the excess entropy is, What excess entropy is, is you subtract the vibrational part, and all you're left is with the configurational part of X. So that's what we call excess entropy, the configurational entropy of the system. And that's the metric that I like to use to characterize these disordered materials. The interesting part is that, at least for experimentalists, At least for experimentalists, is that this excess entropy can be calculated from the two-point correlation function or G of R. And so this sometimes is called the two-point excess entropy. So this is, that's Q, this will be my symbol for excess entropy. And this is it, just from G of R, you can calculate this excess entropy, this configurational entropy, if you will. Entropy, if you will. So that's pretty appealing to do so from an experimental standpoint to calculate this. And it has been done in a lot of simulations, but not tested so much in experiments yet. I'm going to skip this a little bit. So just in the interest of time. The fun part. Yes. In practice, how far out in radius do you have to be able to go to get this from? Have to be able to go to get this from data? Like, how many, how many particle radii out do I need to be able to measure? That's a very good question. I think there are two embedded questions there. So about five shells out is how far you have to go. And that's usually our experience with the system that we have. But most importantly, I think your question is. I think your question is that this natural log needs to converge. Does that make sense? Yeah, that's very helpful. Yeah. Yeah, then if so you go as far out as the natural law converge. And you do that for every particle. Okay, so it is laborious, but it's doable. Thanks. Welcome. Okay. Okay, the fun part, as I was saying, is that this excess entropy has been shown to, you know, be able to correlate well with transport property of liquids. So this is a simulation of liquids with different potentials, Leonard Jones or different type of liquids. And here's the scale diffusion or dimensionless diffusion. And this is the S2. This is called the Rossen cell scale. This is called the Rossenfeld scaling. This is ponential scaling. And it's able to predict very well the diffusion or the atomic diffusion of this liquid by just looking at the structure disorder or this excess entropy. So this has been shown to work really well for equilibrated liquids. And recently, it's also been shown to work relatively well for larger, for larger. For larger systems of supercooled liquids, in fact. And this is the work from Max Mai, his collaborators at Hong Kong that show, yeah, similar type of scaling can be seen in two-dimensional solids or supercooled liquids just by calculating the two-point correlation hexas entropy. All of these are at equilibrium, and we wanted to see if we can try to do this in non-equilibrium systems. Eclipse systems. So again, that's the experimental approach. We have the rheology from the ISR that I showed you. We can get G prime and G double prime. We're going to characterize structure using the configuration of entropy, X2, calculated from G of R. And we're trying to connect with the dynamics particle relaxation times that we can actually calculate. So we try to relate all these three in the next minutes. In the next minute, that I might have here. So, these are my samples. I have bi-dispersed samples and monodispers samples. These are the type of particles I'm using here. The sample C has some Brownian motion in it, so it's not entirely athermal. It has some thermal motion in it. These are the volume fractions for each sample. This is the particle sizes. And we also did complement all of this with simulations, two-dimensional simulation for particles with lanager potentials, different types of energy potentials in Hertz and contacts. So these are some of the samples. So we can calculate at each frame the relaxation times, tau alpha in this case, from the intermediate scattering function. From the intermediate scattering functions. And the first thing that you note is that the relaxation times do change with time. So we set the exponential here and we get just exponential over here. This is a two different snapshots in the shear rate. So the relaxation times do change as a function of my shear rate. That's not surprising. But here's what the fun part is. fun part is. So this is the tau alpha of the relaxation time. And in blue is the shear rate that I usually impose. So this is what I'm imposing. This is what I'm measuring out the shear rate. It's a little noisy because I'm taking derivatives of the velocity. It's the second derivative of the particle tracks. And here comes the relaxations. And the first thing you note is that the relaxation Is that the relaxation lags the forcing? It might seem intuitive to you, but that was actually something that we were surprised: that there is a persistent lag. You shear it, and then the particle relax, right? So there is a causal relationship between shear and relaxation. And this is actually we can take all our data, right? All our data, and here I'm skipping a few things here, and this is the A few things here, and this is the relaxation for a particular sample at different strain amplitudes as a function of shear rate and all scales as a power law. This is sort of like a shear tenning behavior. But what that tells you is that the faster shear rates leads you to shorter relaxation. The faster your shear, the shorter the relaxation, or the faster. Shorter the relaxation, or the fastest it relaxes. Okay. So now what we're going to do is to calculate the excess entropy, right? As I said, we're going to calculate it for the G of R. So this is the movie of the G of R. So this is a sample spin going sinusoidally back and forth. And we're going to use that G of R data to calculate the excess entropy. And here it is. This is the signal of the excess entropy as a function of the relaxation. As a function of the relaxation. So the relaxation now is in green, right? And the excess entropy now is in dark. And again, what you see is a lag between the excess entropy and the relaxation. So that's kind of fun. So we see that the excess destructure lags the relaxation that lags the forcing. Don't lag the forcing. And the good, the interesting part here is that the shorter the relaxation, right, the smaller the SQ, sorry, more disorder or more caged, if you will. So the faster shear rate leads to shorter relaxation and leads to a more quote-unquote disorder rearrangement system. Right? So that is how. So that is how we see this system going. You force it, it relaxes into a structure. And we can scale all our data. So this is the relaxation time. This is the excess entropy, right? And these are the three samples that I showed you. Both a thermal and the one that is a little more thermal, right? All these two. Right, all these train amplitudes, right? And we can find that scaling again. It's not the same Rosenthal's scaling that you saw before, but there is a scaling here, right, between the excess entropy and the relaxation times. So in essence, I can go from just to structure excess entropy and tell you about the relaxation. All right. And the blast disorder, right? Disorder, right? The last ordered or more disordered the system is, right? The faster is that the relaxation. So that's what this is telling you. This is a relationship now between the structure and dynamics. And what I like about this also is that, as I said before, the status structure that you see is a consequence rather than the cause of the relaxation process. Of the relaxation process. So that's the summary so far. So that is the relationship between structure and dynamics. And you can find a little more details in the manuscript that I'm showing here. So next, I want to try to relate structure to rheology. That's actually a little more complex. And so again, so here is the G of R. We're going to calculate the G of R, calculate the The G of R, then we calculate the excess entropy. That's the signal of the excess entropy as a function of time, right? So, just like I showed before, but this is a little more detailed. This is below yielding, right? All of this is below yield. I'm going to tell you what this equation one comes from in a minute, right? But this is the signal of it. And the interesting thing is that it follows the forcing, it's a sinusoidal forcing, it follows it nicely, all right? Nicely. All right. So again, so this is 0.66. That's the essence entropy. As I'm increasing the strain or the strain amplitude, I go from what I see an isolated sinusoidal to a second harmonic showing up. And above you, the structural response seems to be independent of direction of shear, right? Well, in here, the excess entropy or the Excess entropy or the profurgation entropy depends on the shear direction. It responds to it quite nicely. Near yields, you can see that it's starting to lose that dependence, right? And this has to do, we think, to do with the memory associated with the system, the localized memory on the system, right? That below yielding, the system remembers its original configuration and tries to go back to it. And this is what we see. Back to it, and this is what we see below yield. Above yield, it's a little bit like fluidizing your system, the memory is lost, right? So this is another way to think about yielding. That perhaps below yielding, the system can retain some of the memory, so initial memory that it has, while as you cross-they use and transition, you Transition, you erase the memory and it's fluidized and can no longer be retained. And I'm not an expert in memory. And if you want to know more, maybe Joey can tell you a little bit more. He wrote a nice little paper on it, actually a long one, on the subject. But I want to go back to what I was telling you. So below you, so this is the signals of the exentrophy. The signals of the excess entropy as a function of the strain rate or the strain amplitude. This is some increase in the strain amplitude. And hopefully, you can see just one signal to the appearance of the second harmonic, right? And the second harmonic is associated with the loss of memory or plasticity, if you will, above yielding. Okay. And here it is: I'm taking the FFT. Every time I have a signal, I take the FFT. Every time I have a signal, I take FFT, so I have one, and you see as I'm increasing each certain amplitude, a second harmonic shows up that is pretty large. And the interesting part is that the second harmonic, as I was telling you, takes off at about 3%. That's very close to where the yielding is. So that's why I was telling you that the first harmonic is associated. Harmonic is associated with stored memory. While the second harmonic is the fluidization, it's plasticity, is when memory is starting to get lost. So, and it's pretty interesting that it happens, or perhaps not interesting, maybe it is somewhat obvious that it happens at about 3% or yielding happens. And if you take the ratio between those two. And if you take the ratio between those two, the second harmonic to the first harmonic, if you take the, just like you would take the ratio of G double prime to G prime, there's a very nice correspondence between those two. That's why we believe that. There is a linear relationship that appears, or at least a scaling, between the ratio of those harmonics and the rheology. And that's what we're going to. And that's what we're going to explore in the next few slides. So that leads us to: okay, can we relate those two now? Those are harmonics to the rheology. So here we go. So this is how we're going to do this. So this is a phenomenological way that we understand this. And it goes like this. So in the memory part, in the first Memory part in the first mode, if you will, right, is just the microstructural forces F times delta X, the needle displacement. Okay, so what is this microstructural force? It is the potential. It's all the forces, the average forces acting on one particle. And that we can actually estimate. If we know the potential, we can figure out the force and we know the potential. Figure out the force and we know the potential. The erasure has to do with the prescribed force, the number of particles that have non-affine deformation, the determinant that I show you before, and the delta x. All of that is the energy balance, right? It's the temperature times the difference in exentropy, and this is all energy. So, this is the memory part. So, this is the memorial part, this is the ratio part. So, that is our postulate. That's how we think this is happening. So, how can we use this to get this relationship? Well, then we go and use, we take the ratio between these two. So, this is, as I said, the memory. So, this part over here. And this is the, I'm sorry, this is the dissipation. This is the elastic part, right? And the ratio between those just. And the ratio between those just gives you this relationship, where F naught, again, is the amplitude of the prescribed shear force that we know. And F star, this is how we measure that. It's the sum of all the magnitudes, sorry, the average forces acting on the particle. And when F naught is larger than F star, is when you start losing memory. So when the prescribed force... The prescribed force is larger than interparticle forces, then you're starting to flow. That's the idea. Okay, and this is the quantity here, that I showed times the ratio, and it just follows quite nicely. Okay, so then I'm going to use a little bit of shear transformation zone theory. So G prime is equal to the number of particles and the number of particles that, you know, and the number of particles that And the number of particles that undergo non-affine deformation of G prime. I need to find what the relationship is. I know what Fd is. So I'm going to take this Fd, which is F star times this divided by this. So here we go. And this quantity here is just the volume fraction, right? And if I do that, I end up with a simple relationship. This is plasticity, and this is. And this is here is the elasticity. These are just the Mexican parameters. So, this is the volume fraction. This is the ratio to forces. And this is the ratio of those two harmonics. And if you plot that, all of our data collapses into one master curve. Not only the data, all the simulations collapses into a single master curve. And here we have. And here we have different Lenochron's potentials, we have different Hertzian contacts, and we have a little bit of thermal energy, right? All of that. So what this effectively does, again, it's a phenomenological model, but what it does is connect structure to the reality. And all you need is three-dimensional parameters. Three dimensionless parameters: the ratio forces, the volume fraction, and the ratio of those two harmonics. All of this can be computed from experiments. All of this can be tested in other systems. And so is the rheology. So I think we have, it's not a constitutive model, but I think it's a nice relationship that can be tested in other systems. So, conclusions that we have established a connection between these two. A connection between structure, dynamics, and biology in this shear amorphous solids. And maybe this concept of access can be useful in order in other systems. It has been useful here, but we know that it has its issues because one of the things that you notice is that it is an average quantity, it is a single quantity. Quantity. It is a single quantity. It's not localized. So it has its limitations as well. So I'll leave it at that and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. Hi, Apollo. Thanks for the nice talk. Hi, Paulo. Thanks for the nice talk. So, at the very beginning, you commented on how amorphous materials typically yield at 3% strain. And there are a number of examples like elastomers and hydrogels that yield at considerably higher strains. I'm wondering if you could comment on how those materials relate to the materials that you're looking at here in terms of dilating, you know, because it seemed like the initial motivation was to try to dilate the distance between yield and catastrophic failure. Yeah. Catastrophic failure. Yeah. Yeah. So those are those are composites. You know, these are not those types of materials. So I think perhaps that's the difference here, right? These are more particulate systems and not polymer composite that have these networks. And I think that distinction needs to be made more clearly. Does that answer your question? Yes, I mean, even like homogeneous elastomers, they have cross-links in them. Is that what you mean by? Yeah, that's what I mean by it. Yes. Yes, thank you. Yes. Thank you for a nice talk. Do you have an example of a material, a yield stress material that you think would follow this behavior? A microgel or something like that. Would that sort of yeah, microgels? I do not know if this will follow this type of behavior, maybe. Okay, that depends. What kind of behavior you're just we're discussing here? I'm thinking about the second harmonic that comes in at yield. Ah, yes. The non-linear sort of vischolasticity kind of. I think it's general. Yes, I do think it's general. Yes, I do think it's general, and I'm hoping it's general, of course, and it would be lovely to be proven wrong as much as possible. But we think that this happens, you know, we try with one another material that we haven't published, which is carbon with particles in it, because it's an ideal stress material. And it seems to work well there, too. But this is just one model. And this is just one model system, right? And one study. So I would love to see how far we can push this. Okay, thank you. Any online questions? Yeah, I certainly have a question. Very nice talk, Paolo. How do you manage to have such a nice non-slip boundary condition between the colloidal? Between the colloidal particles, the needle and the wall, because that's really tricky. We spent a whole year doing that. Well, you know, as an experimentalist, you work what you have. First of all, the needle is rough, right? So we actually attach very carefully particles to that, to the needle. So you can do that, or you can simply just work with a needle that is rough, which is That is rough, which is fine too. As far as the wall is concerned, now you have to be very careful with the interfacial tension, right? So in order to get as flat as possible because that curvature will play tricks with you, right? So we play with that interfacial tension, right? And to make it as flat as possible. As possible and temperature, actually to play a little bit with temperature as well. So that's how we try to make the curvature of the wall as flat as possible and the non-slip boundary condition at the needle as rough as possible. Great, thank you. I have another question. So, this plot that you showed where the That you showed where the second harmonic to first harmonic ratio and the ratio of the G prime to double prime, I mean, they fall right on top of each other. I mean, that looks amazing. And to me, it came out of nowhere. Should I have expected this or was it really coming out of nowhere for you when you saw the data? None of this was intuitive to us. Let me just show you what. Thank you for that. I just want to show you that plot, only because you're right. Only because you're right. There was no expectation that that should be the case. Okay. Whatsoever. So you're talking about deaths. Exactly. It just came out of left field for me. It's so striking. It's very striking. So I will tell you the story now. So we were just looking at memory, really, and see if there was any signature of memory here. But it turns out when we saw this. But it turns out when we saw this second harmonic, we said, oh, why don't we just look at the signals? Because we start seeing this over and over. You can see that as we increase the strain rate, right? So we had this postulate that maybe the appearance of the second harmonic is when things locally start to flow. And more and more, when you see it, you will see the second harmonic. But it was just a postulate. It was just a possibility. We did not know. And when we plotted these things together and we saw that, sorry, where is that? We were shocked. We were shocked. Of course, note the axis, right? They're different axis. It's just to tell you that they are related. But no, we would not expect this. Was not in the cards, I thought. The uh, in the cards, I thought we thought it would be a non-linear relationship, a much more non-linear relationship. But it nicely conveys the story, Rhino, if that's the case. The second harmonics associated with plasticity. And are there hints of higher harmonics or uh yes, there are something, yes, there are a very good question. Are a very good question. There are hints of other harmonics, yes, uh, as it should, uh, but then what you have, yeah, there are, but their edge noise is belower noise, but you know they're there. Okay, so the story is not as clear. Thanks. One more question actually, I was uh intrigued by Joyce's question, so I would like to. Joy's question, so I would like to follow up or maybe to clarify for the non-experts the point. Like, why should we expect at all? You said that you did not expect linear relation, but some non-linear relation. Why should we expect any relation between the ratio of the second and the first harmonics to the ratio of the moduli? Like, what was your expectation? Like, and why? Like, and why there was no expectation, I think. That's what you mentioned that there was some expectation of some non-linear relation. Ah, no. What I was trying to say is that once we start seeing the second harmonic, we start thinking that this could be associated with plasticity. But I did not think that it was a direct relationship to it, to plasticity. That's what I was trying. That's what I was trying to convey. But I had no expectations either way on how this would play out. It was, we were just trying to understand the signal. Does that make sense? Yeah, so basically, the expectation was there should be no relationship. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Because there was no also. Also, there's no work on this, even from the simulation standpoint, and looking the harmonics of the signals. So we were a little bit in, you know, in the woods. You know, we're trying to make this up as we go. Paulo, hi. So I don't know if you can do that with your experimental setup. That with your experimental setup, but if you could do a creep-type experiment, would you expect that you would start to see signatures of the second harmonics as you enter secondary creep, for example? Or could that be used as a kind of early signature for yield? Oh, that's a fantastic question. Thank you for that. That's exactly what we're trying to do. We're trying to look at true. We're trying to look at creep. And to do that, we're trying to do this with a very small applied steady stress, right? And see if we see the signals of the second harmonic locally now as a way to detect the presence of Kriedmore. That's where we're going. Yes. Yes. Good question.
