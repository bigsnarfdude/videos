The first thing I would like to say is that it's not a math talk. And you might look at the talk and say, well, where did he hide the math? The math is actually hidden in these two papers, which appeared in the Information Theory magazine. And so if you'd like to know more, I recommend these these two papers. It took us that they're papers that I wrote with Ronnie Hadani. Papers that I wrote with Ronnie Hadani, I'm going to be talking about the Zako DFS modulation and he's one of the co-inventors of that modulation. And also two faculty from India, Anand Chokalingam from Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, and Saif Muhammad from Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi. I have to say at the beginning that I'm on the technical advisory board of Cohere Technologies, so you need to correct the talk for the appropriate bias. All right. Okay, let me set the stage because we're starting to think about 6G, 6 generation wireless. What's special about 6G? Well, what I would say is that the channels that we're considering are becoming more extreme. I mean, here what I've done is I've arranged channels in order of increasing Delta spreads. So pedestrian, terrestrial channel, no Delta at all. Mobile, maybe 300 hertz, millimeter way, perhaps three kilohertz, and so on. Through kilohertz and so on. And I would characterize the way that we design wireless systems today as saying that we use mathematical models. So we typically say we're only going to have so many paths. We're going to constrain their delays and their Doppler shifts in a certain way. And then we fit to that model. And what I would contend is that that. And what I would contend is that that approach is losing ground as wireless channels become more complex and onput becomes more significant. And actually, one of the themes of this talk is going to be stop estimating channels. You don't have to estimate channels. I'm also going to suggest that it might be possible to operate model free. So I've sort of said what model dependent is, and I will go. And I will go on to tell you about them on the three. And so, in a sense, the context for the talk is machine learning. And so, the question is, what physical layer would machine learning like to see? And I'm going to argue that what machine learning wants to see is a physical layer that is changing slowly. Changing slowly and is predictable. That's basically what machine learning algorithms want to say. And I'm going to explain why the modulation that I'm going to describe is a good fit for that purpose. Well, model free or model dependent, we have asked this question before. In fact, we asked it in the 17th century. And you can think of Newton's laws of motion as As model-based, because you start with something very fundamental and you work out from that. And you can think of Kepler's laws of planetary motion as being model-free, because Kepler didn't have a model, he just looked at data. And well, we asked this question in the 17th century. Why would we ask it again now? Well, we ask it again now because machine learning has revolutionized image and natural language processing. Natural language processing. It's revolutionized bioinformatics. It's actually even starting to revolutionize mathematics. Mathematicians, when they thought about functions, they used to think about these really complicated function spaces like Beesov spaces and the like. And now they're starting to think about functions in terms of how well. In terms of how well can you approximate them with certain kinds of neural network. And so machine learning is even having an impact on mathematics. And I'd like to recommend this article. It's a beautiful article by Waynan Er. It's only about three pages, but he's talking about the impact that this new perspective is having on applied mathematics. All right. So this is a This is a picture of Philip Woodward, who died in 2018 at the age of 98. And so Woodward was a very distinguished radar engineer, and he was a virtuoso clockmaker. This is a picture of him with one of his clocks. And what's remarkable about Woodward is that in 1953, he wrote this book. I mean, in 1953, Book, I mean, 1953, that's five years after Shannon's paper. He wrote this book on probability and information theory and applications to radar. And what he said in that book was, here's how you should think about radar. You should think about radar as a game of 20 questions with an unknown operator. How does that work? Well, you send out a radar waveform to the To the propagation environment. That's the unknown operator. The unknown operator sends a return back to you. You infer something about the environment. So that's the game of 20 questions. And how do you design a good waveform? How do you design a good question? And we're going to be talking about these kinds of waveforms. And this kind of waveform has a special structure. It's a pulse train that It's a pulse strain that's modulated by a tone, and we're going to call them pulsones. So that's the time domain waveform. And they're going to play a central role in this talk. So let's think about wireless channels. I send some signal X and it arrives at a receiver, and on the way, it bounces off various reflectors. Various reflectors, and the reflectors delay the signal in time, and they shift it perhaps in frequency if they're moving. And I've represented this here on the right-hand side. The height of the bar is the strength of the reflected signal, and the position of the bar tells you about the displacement in delay, the displacement in Doppler. So that's the picture. So the idea is that. So the idea is that, and actually one of the ideas in this talk is that regardless of waveform, suppose I didn't care about waveform. If you're managing wireless traffic, you should manage it in the delayed opera domain. Why should you manage it in the delayed OPPA domain? You want to do things like scheduling. You'll do a better job of scheduling. A better job of scheduling if you can see further into the future. So you want a representation of your wireless environment which doesn't change very fast. Now the slowest that you can get is the speed of physics, the speed at which the reflectors change. And if you're managing your environment in the delayed opera domain, you are achieving that lower bound. So let me produce a piece of evidence to that effect. Two weeks ago was Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. And there was a press release by Vodafone. And the press release was talking about results that were obtained actually by Vodafone and Cohere on their dense urban On their dense urban testbed in Madrid. So, I mean, what Vodafone says is: you guys, you have all sorts of claims. We don't believe you. What we will do is we'll invite you into our test bed and we'll see how you do. What the press release said was that by managing traffic in the delayed OPLA domain, they were able to improve their spectral efficiency by 50%. 50%. So, for a carrier, that's an enormous deal. I mean, they're all, you know, when people talk to carriers about new services and stuff, they kind of roll their eyes a little bit because they don't really believe it. But if you talk to them about spectral efficiency, they really believe that because they can see that that's extra money. Okay. Delay Doppler domain. That's where you should manage trouble. All right. We're still thinking. All right, we're still thinking a little bit about radar, and we're thinking about questions. Because when you send a waveform to probe a propagation environment, you get a return, and you get information about some aspects of the scene, but you get no information about some other aspects. So for example, if you send a time domain pulse, you don't get any information about Doppler, and if you send a frequency domain pulse, you don't get information about time. You don't get information about time. You send one of these pulses, you can perhaps believe that you get information about both delay. And so I'm going to argue that to communicate on a doubly spread channel where you have reflectors that delay and shift and upload, you should use a pulse in the delayed upload domain. And I'm going to And I'm going to suggest to you that this is not strange because, right, as electrical engineers, you all teach LTI channels. And in the LTI channel, you send a time domain pulse. And you have a little guard band, and you figure out the input-output relation, and then you recover the data. And we're just going to do the same thing in two dimensions. So it's not incredibly unusual. It's not incredibly unusual. Now, you say a pulse in the delay-Dopplin away. Well, you can't do that because Heisenberg Uncertainty says that you can't localize in delay and Doppler. And so what do you do? Well, you cheat. What you do is you make a box which is bounded by a delay period, tau p, and a Doppler. Tau p and a Doppler period nu p, and you put a pulse somewhere inside that box, and then you then you tessellate the plane with the boxes, and as you move along the delay axis, you introduce a phase. Actually, you don't introduce a phase when you move along the Doppler axis. But you see, now we've technically satisfied Heisenberg uncertainty because we are not improperly localized. And if you're a wireless engineer, what we would say is the following: you're a wireless engineer. You don't understand exactly what channel you've got, but you understand your maximum delay spread and you understand your maximum Doppler spread. We're going to ask you to size this box so that the delay period is bigger than the delay spread and the Doppler period is bigger than the Doppler spread. Bigger than the Doppler spread. So, in a sense, we're going to take advantage of knowing that interaction is local. Now, I do need to tell you how to get from the delayed OPLA domain to the time domain. And the way that you get there is by applying the transform. And in this case, the transform is called the inverse Zach transform. I'll say here at the beginning that. I'll say here at the beginning that there are these Zach transforms and Fourier transforms. They're all the same complexity. At the end of the day, they're all Fourier transforms. So you shouldn't be intimidated by this statement. So when you, so here you have a pulse in the delayed altar direction, and it ends up as a pulse train. So there So there are these pulses, and the width of the pulse is 1 over b, where 1 over b is the width in time of the pulse that you put here. And the duration of the pulse is about t, where 1 over t is the width in dot line. The offset in the square, tau 0, tells you about the offset. zero tells you about the offset of the full strain, and nu zero tells you about the modulating tone. If you want now, so here what you have is you have a collection of bt functions that are limited in time and bandwidth. So you're achieving the time-bandwidth product. You can see that they're approximately You can see that they're approximately orthogonal because if I shift, they're not going to see each other. And if I move in tone, they're not going to see each other. And so you have a kind of toric structure, because I mean, if you keep shifting in time, you'll come back to the beginning. So it's like a torus. They live on a torus. So that's the, these are this time domain function, which is what we transmit is called. Because what we transmit is called also. All right, let's go back to radar. And this is the, so I just want to tell you about an experiment that Woodward was an amazing engineer because he started off. So, what do radar engineers do, first of all? They work with ambiguity functions. So, they want to find targets. So they want to find targets. They send a waveform and they shift it in delay and Doppler. They take the inner product. That's the value of the inner product. That's the value of the ambiguity function at the displacement in delay and Doppler. Square it to get a real thing. So there's an ambiguity surface corresponding to a waveform. And there's a theorem by Moyal which tells you about the volume under the ambiguity surface. You can't avoid it, it's the energy squared of the signal. Okay? So radar engineers work with an ambiguity surface. It has a certain volume. You can't alter that volume, but what you can do is move it around. Can do is move it around so that perhaps things that weren't visible before become visible after you've moved it around. So, all of radar engineering is about moving ambiguity functions. And so, here, what Woodward did is says, well, I have a time domain pulse or a or a tone, and this is the resolution that I get, and the the width in one of the directions is the ambiguity when I can't see. Ambiguity when I can't see. And he did this amazing experiment. So this is 1953. He said, I send a narrow Gaussian pulse. This is my ambiguity function. It's not very good. But now I send a train of narrow Gaussian pulses modulated by a broad Gaussian envelope. If you're a quantum person, this is a GKP state. So Woodward was doing GKP states in 1915. Was doing GKP states in 1953. And what he observed is that the ambiguity function, the volume under here, shifts so that it's a lattice. Now, if you're a radar engineer, you're used to working with tones or you're used to working with chirps, and the ambiguity functions of these things are lines. They send up chirps, they send down chirps, where they meet, that's where the target is. Where the target is. It's only a problem if you have more than one target, because then you have many intersections. Some of them correspond to ghosts, some of them correspond to targets. It's really hard to figure out which. What I would suggest just in this picture, and I'm not giving a proof, is that lattices plus lines beat lattices. Beat lines get better resolution. And Woodward did that with Gaussian pulses. Pulsones have the same. Pulses, pulsones have the same kind of structure. And so, if you're interested in radar with pulsones, this blue box has to do with the delay in the dopplife period. That tells you what you could resolve. They are perfect for doing radar. Now, I am going to guess the details are in the paper. That. That we define something called the crystallization condition, which is this condition that the delay period is bigger than the delay spread, Doppler period bigger than the Doppler spread. And what I claim is that the interaction of a doubly spread channel with a time domain called son is predictable in geometric. So more time for more propaganda. Channels don't matter. Channels don't matter. What matters is the interaction of the channel with your modulation. What you care about is a predictable input-output relation. You want to win math prizes? Estimate channels. You want to build a scalable communication system? Build yourself a predictable input-output relation. So it's the input-output relation that you don't actually care about how the input-output relation originated. You don't care about how many paths, because actually all of the curves that I'll show you later are with vehicular A channels, in part because they're representative of real environments, but also in part because I chose the channel so that you didn't have enough bandwidth and time to respond. Have enough bandwidth and time to resolve the challenge. And here, picture is what it means to be predictable. So you send a pulse, you get a collection of replicas corresponding to the different. And predictable means you send a pilot, you just read off the response to that pilot, and you know. And you know what would happen to any other function that you might send. Okay? So this is wireless at the speed of machine learning. Because in the space of a millisecond, you've actually captured the input-output relation. Because you've just read it off from the response to a python. Now, other message in this talk. Other message in this talk is: there are no fading channels. There is only aliasing. And this should be easy for you because you all teach signals and systems. So you all teach aliasing. So here, what's happening is that the channel, which is this purple ellipse, isn't confined in the box. And so if you're sitting here, you're feeling two of these. Feeling two of these replicas. And if instead of here you were here, you would be feeling two replicas, but you would be feeling them in a different way. So it's like over here you have a two by two system of equations, and you have a result. And here you have a different 2x2 set of 2x2 system. And you can't predict the one from the other. So this is aliasing in Doppler. This is aliasing in Doppler, and it gives you selectivity in time. So, frequency selectivity is about aliasing in time. Time selectivity is about aliasing in frequency. But the meta point here is that selectivity, fading channels, these are things that you do to yourself. They're not intrinsic. They're not intrinsic. Alright, this is the good thing that happens. And just in work, you know, you send two things, you get two replicas. Once you know what happens here, you know what happens here. Oh, the other thing that I should say is it's just like convolution. So you're all used to LTI channels where you To LTI channels where you work with convolution. Here, with these doubly spread channels, you're still working with convolution. It's a little different because it comes with a twist. That's why it's called twisted convolution. But it's not intrinsically more difficult. This is the symbol that we'll use. And so the input and the output are related by an effective channel. The effective channel is the result of the transmit filter. The transmit filter, the channel, the receive filter. But it's this what you're requiring from the response that you're planning. And this is what it looks like. So here I brought everything back to the delayed optodomain. Here you see time selectivity, here you see frequency selectivity, and here you see constant energy. What you've produced is a two-dimensional Gaussian channel. I love Gaussian. I love Gaussian channels. Long, long time ago, I worked on modems, and so for me, this is just like working on modems again. Now, I talked about predictability. Here I'm trying to predict what happens to a signal at different points in the square from what happened to the pilot. Blue is gray. Blue is great, green is pretty good, yellow is iffy. And this is what I mean by predictability. Now, these are slides that I put in for Yuri, because he's not here, but let me say anyway. So Yuri wrote these papers on massive multiple access, which are lovely vectors. If I had one If I have one criticism, it's too bad for me. It's that they're additive white Gaussian noise channel. Right? Now, what I've shown you is I've got a way to produce an additive white Gaussian noise channel from a wireless channel. So if I use my modulation, I can actually, and I should say the thing about, I mean, what Yuri did was that he sparked. He sparked me and others, including Krishna, to come up with coding schemes. So, Krishna had these schemes that were based on LDPC codes. I like second-order reball codes. So, we have this software called Chirup, which was developed by my student Sinejafapur. There's a lovely GitHub site where you can download and play with it. And play with it. But you can pick out something like a superposition of 200 code words. Actually, very nice. And so we're starting to think about how we can combine that with the new modulation. I wanted to show that too. And these are pictures, I'm sure. These are pictures about how many we recover as the document. Many we recover as the Doppler spread increases. That's propaganda. This is more propaganda, so signal processing in the delayed opera domain. There's time, there's frequency, there's delayed opera, there's transformations that get from one to the other. At the end of the day, everything's a fully a transform. Alright, so now I'm going to show you some curves. All right. And so here. And so here I'm doing this vehicular A model and I'm giving everyone the benefit of perfect general estimation. And these red curves that you can't see are FDM, OFTM, actually, and TDM. One of the things that I should have said before, actually, I didn't say. Actually, I didn't say before, is that when we take the Doppler period and the delay period, they have to multiply to one. So τpν is 1. We're talking about underspread channels. And so these ZACO TFS is actually a family of modulations that interpolates between TDM and FDM. If you think about it, think about Think about TDM. Think about the delay period getting really long. Think about the pulses getting further and further apart. In the end, the tones disappear, and you're just left with a single pulse. Make a similar argument about FDF. So, this ZAC OTFS is a family of modulations that allows you to interpolate. To interpolate between TDM and FDM, single character and multi-charge. So here's TDM and FDM. And what we're doing here is we're changing the aspect of the period box. As we get closer to FDM, we get in performance, we get closer to FDM. As we get closer to TDM, we get To Tdm, we get closer to TDM. And green is what happens in Philippi, where we this is propaganda about don't learn channels and here So here I did the experiment where it is possible to learn the channel. So I threw, I put on one side the vehicular A model, and I just made a really easy model where the delays are integer multiples of one another, and so it's easy to learn. So I told Zach ODFS to go learn it, and it did just as well as getting perfect. As well as getting perfect CSI. But then I did the experiment where I said, don't bother learning it. Just take what you read of, use that. And you know, it comes really close. That's the important things of it. And in fact, when it's not possible to learn the channel, tell ZACOTSFS to go try-learn the channel, it goes to Learn the channel. It goes to try and learn the channel. Doesn't succeed. This is awful. But the model-free approach is really good. And so here this is playing with the filters gets you gains. Here, I'm sure, I think I'm sure. Here I think I'm showing sync filters. If I use root raise cosine, there's actually ways of making even better filters. This is looking at the impact of high Doppler. So here I'm I'm fixing an SNR. I'm letting the Doppler vary. And what I'm showing is that if you're well inside the crystalline regime, you're really resilient. If you get towards the edges, then you become less resilient. So if you're building a scalable wireless system, it tells you where you should be operating. Tells you where you should be operating. Because if you're operating in the middle of the crystalline regime, you don't have to worry about the characteristics of different users. This is a slide that just says, suppose you're interested in things like interoperability with satellites. There's a way of choosing the delay and Doppler periods so that you can choose a single You can choose a single period which makes interoperability really easy. Now, I want to give you some propaganda. So, I will tell you what's special about twisted convolution. What's special about twisted convolution is that it's associative. Now that seems like why should being associative be really important? Being associative be really important. It just is. Because you see, things like filters, things like channels, they all act by twisted convolution. And so what you have is a cascade of twisted convolutions that relate the input to the output. And if it's associative, you can collapse those to an effective channel. Let me contrast. Let me tell a story. There is a multi-carrier OTFS, which is something that we introduced in 2017. Why did we introduce it? I have to say that these Kohir guys were a little bit naive. They knew they had this really great waveform, and they thought that if they just showed up on Erickson's doorstep and say, Hey Erickson, we have a better waveform, Erickson would say, Erickson would say, Great that you have a better waveform. Let's use your waveform. Erickson said, We like our waveform, please go away. And so they didn't have much success. What they did was they took the ZAC idea and showed you could implement it on two steps: first by passing to time frequency and then doing an overlay on OFDM. Overlay on OFDM. When you do that and you write down what's going on in the transceiver chain, it's this unhappy putting together of periodic and quasi-periodic signal processing. The bottom line is it's not associative. You can't reduce it in the same way. It is less predictable. You can work to make it more predictable. Other people have worked to make it more predictable. All the people have worked to make it more predictable. It's shown that it's better than OFDM in various ways. But it's not. So here I've done a predictability comparison. This is Zach. This is multi-carrier. Blue is better than yellow and green. Zach is more than so here we are. So here we are. We're operating in the crystalline regime. We're looking at performance of Zyko TFS. This is perfect knowledge of the channel. Both for, if you know the channel perfectly, there's no difference between SAC and MC. If you don't, MC doesn't do very well. Doesn't do very well. Zach does very well. So that's good. Oh, this is something I'm not going to talk too much about, but there's a lovely quote by Orwell. What does Orwell say? He says: Every generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it and wiser than the one that comes after it. One that comes after it. Isn't that a lovely quote? So, what does Orwell mean us to take away in the context of Wild's communication? So, every time we make a change, like when we make a change from C DMA to L DMA, we're happy about the change we made because we made the calculation that the benefits of reacting to how channel changes. Channel changes outweigh the benefits of spreading. But we actually leave something behind. There were things that we actually liked about CBRA. So what Orwell is doing is he's asking us to remember what we liked. And here, I'm not going to explain this in this talk, but there's a way of reconnecting with CDMA. So what I've shown here, this is the signal processing chain. Signal processing chain, by transmit filter, you get into the time domain, you reverse, you apply a receive filter, you sample, you produce an input-output relation. There's a degree of freedom that I haven't taken advantage of, which is making filters for the discrete dot button, discrete delayed off-button. And by doing that, I can actually move towards CDMA. As a theorist, one of the things that I like about this is that it's bringing geometry into wireless communication. It's the geometry of lattices. There's an information lattice where the information sits. That's how we modulate the individual horsemen. There's the period lattice. Period lattice is Period lattice is actually the support of the ambiguity function for the Poissons. And then there's the dual of the information lattice, which is the rectangle. This is Mn, that's MN. And they all play a role. Filters are designed on the bigger rectangle. And so, conclusions. Bad news. Bad news, it's becoming impossible to learn channels. Good news, you don't have to. You can still learn input-output relations if you think about the way the modulation interacts with the channel. If you're in this crystalline regime, pulsones enable model-free operation, the model-free The model-free means I send a pilot, I just measure the response. That tells me all I need to know about the input-output reaction. Sure, I can do better with machine learning, but I mean, just from sub-frame to subframe. But it opens up model-free operation. Actually, one of the things I would say is: why do you care about predictable, slowly moving things? And I would say, And I would say, same reason you care about multiple antennas in 4G. When you have a multiple antenna channel rather than single antenna channel, it varies more slowly and predictably. When you have applications that sit above TCP, they want to see slowly moving channels because every time they drop a packet, they drop their rate by a half. And so you get very So, you get very poor rates on rapidly varying channels. Whereas, if you have a channel that's moving slowly, you get very good rate above TCP. Carriers measure rates above TCP. They don't care about below TCP. What makes this possible? Um, technically, we're using waveforms that are geometric modes of the doubly spread channel. That is to say, we're using waveforms that the reflectors move about. So, last slide. Pulson's in the crystalline regime. Then here you must. There you go. That's the talk. I better feel it. Do we have time for
