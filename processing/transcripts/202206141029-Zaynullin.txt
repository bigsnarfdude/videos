So if anybody wants to come, we'll be looking for open problems. And I just want to say to keep it informal and to maintain privacy, we're not going to record it tonight. So Zoom people, I hope you'll come, but please don't record the meeting. This is our. Okay, so we resume, so let me announce the talk by Kirill Zainouli: the canonical dimension of a semi-simple group and the unimodule degree of the root system. Thank you. Of the root system. Thank you very much. It's really a great pleasure for me to be here in person and really thank organizers for this opportunity. So indeed my talk will be sort of about, well, it will consist of two unrelated maybe parts. I mean, the first one deals with a pretty old problem, which I'm going to describe. It's how Describe. It's how to compute or estimate the so-called canonical dimension of a linear algebraic group. And the second part, I'll try to explain how to get a very reasonable estimate using kind of pretty elementary means which involve knowledge about the action of some divided difference the way. So the second part will be pretty elementary. Okay, so let me start. Okay, so let me start with the first geometric parts. And actually, most of the people here probably know a lot about this. I did I see several people who already kind of did a lot of contributions. So, okay, so let me start with canonical damage. Right, so Right, so uh I'll actually give definition not the very original well, not the very original one, but rather sort of modified by many, many people. And maybe, well, I like that definition because it's sort of probably the simplest and the most understandable one. But of course, here the first name I should mention is Zinomi and Berlin. And uh bear who and so uh there's a concept of economical dimension of a linear algebraic group so G is a simple linear group. Over some Q. However, what I would like really to use for that definition is the following version of it. So first, let me define what's the canonical dimension of an algebraic variety, for smooth projected algebraic varieties. So let me fix a su x to be a smooth projective algebraic variety. And so, well, let's just talk. So, what's the canonical dimension of X? And I believe this appeared in the subsequent works by Carpier and Kula. They did a lot of this. Maybe I'm missing some names. Just correct me. Okay, and so what was the story? Well, the story is just, well, you take your variety X and you look at all sub-varieties of X. And with the property that you go to the generic point, if you go to the filter. point, if you go to the filtered rational functions, your y over k you picks as a rational point. And then what you look at, you look at just all dimensions of such varieties and you look at the minimum all such dimensions. This is how one can How one can define it. Of course, this invariant makes sort of no sense if you write it as a rational point already, right? If it has a rational point, well, then this dimension is just T1. So why is K defined, right? Why is K defined? Why is K double? Yes, why is K default? Yes. And of course, I mean, so basically what it means, it means that this invariant measures sort of the complexity of the set of close points, right, of the sub variety. Well, another extreme case would be, say, if the canonical dimension coincides with the dimension of X. In this case, what do we get if you just look at the definition? Well, basically, you'll see that this would mean that x has no rational retracts, right? So there's no rational reference. Because the existence of such a point means that there exists a rational map, right, from x to y. Complex one. And while such a variety is called incompressible point, it's a square. So it's not true that C is a dimension. Okay. Yes, yes. Yes, yes, x x yes, x must have a yeah, x x must have a rational point. It has no rational point, of course. Yeah, so um right and the story about how to describe such incompressible varieties, it's also a long story. There were a lot of examples provided by Mikipakar Pilka. Maybe one of the examples of the Maybe one of the examples. Well, the easiest example would be: say, if you take, right, if you take, say, a central division algebra, and you just take the safety problem, and in this case, the simple diffusion algebra of degree p, right? And in this case, this is an example. This would provide an example of an incompressible direct. Well, other examples also include. You can look at what are hypersurfaces, some of them are Some of them will also give you examples of incompressible variables. Okay, so there's a, well, in general, right, so another thing that I would like now to come back to the canonical dimension of the group. And so, what is that? So, now again, we fix a semi-simple split linear magnitude. And well, what we will look at, well, let's just look at the generic jitters. Or the generic jitters. Well, indeed, what one can take, one can take just the so-called Versoft course of G. So one can use the standard construction and bed G into GLL and take the quotient. To GLM, take the quotient, and then just look at the generic pipe. And well, now let's look at the complete flag variety, G-Mod V, and let's twist it by means of our generic G-torso. This is a so-called air soft flat variety. And then, well, if you look at the most twisted Twisted variety complete flex. Well, the claim again, this is due to results by several many people. The canonical dimension of G can be just said to be the canonical dimension of that person. So, um, right, so the natural question would be how one can compute this invariant. And before even doing this, well, let me look. Well, there's a there's a sort of proppy version. One can introduce a pro-Git propy version of that definition. So, in Git, instead of looking So, indeed, instead of looking at maybe the fastest modification, fastest definition would be instead of requiring that y over k of x is a registered point, one should require that y over k of x as a closed point of degree prior to a certain fixed prime. So let me fix the time here. And in this case, one gets the so-called harmonical p-dimension and of course by the very definition of the majority of the mass And of course, by the very definition, it's clear that the economical p-dimension gives an obvious low boundary for the canonical dimension. Okay, so indeed, coming back, so how one can actually compute this, indeed, the only known procedure of how one can get some estimates for that. Get some estimates for that would be a, well, the low bound for that would be a, well, to you to compute this, right? That's the only known low bound for the canonical dimensional G, idiot, unfortunately. And, well, but, but, that's the good news that this invariant was computed for for all, well one can compute it, for all semi-simple split innovation. Semi-simple split linear algebraic groups. Ah, well, here, of course, I need to mention many names in Japan and Nepuria actually Reichstein as well. Well, myself, I did some applications for exceptional groups, etc. So, the low button, we do know the low button to that. Well, maybe just to give you an idea what kind of numbers are there, for instance, you can look at group, exceptional group, that's my favorite example. If you look group of type of four, well, the low bar, okay, so if you take p equal to. So if you take p equal to the canonical dimension, two dimensional perform is just three and the canonical three dimensional per four is eight. And this is the best low bound for the canonical dimension of performance. Okay, so what about the canonical dimension itself? What about the upper part? Well, unfortunately. Well unfortunately here there are many results in this direction even recent results that need to papers by Nikita Karta actually produced Another found of G and also computed for most of the classical groups. Excluding, I think it's still open some spin and half spin loops some spins hot spins. It's a pity that Nikita is not here. Maybe he already knows all the answers. So far, yeah, so and yeah, for G well, what about exceptional groups? For exceptional groups, um Well, first of all, let me say that canonical dimension of G2 was computed by Kartrin, which is three. But for all other exceptional groups, it's open. Except that there is a very interesting and nice result by Devi Apple. We actually got an We actually got an upper bottle. I think it's pretty recent in I believe 2018 and he gave the best known upper bound for For all simple simply connected and simply laced exceptional ones. So however still this is only a story about upper bound and the precise value of the canonical dimension is still unknown. And what I'm going to talk starting from now is how actually to generalize some of the results of GRAP, but maybe not really generalized, but Maybe not really generalized, but maybe the right correct word here is to say how to simplify and to extend the results of Divyatov to all semi-simple split linear algebraic groups, as well as to simplify some of the computations by needing. And to do that, I'll need now to introduce the. I'll need now to introduce certain language which basically you end up. So, the key idea in this simplification is to use certain elementary, very basic properties of the so-called divided different separators and certain very basic and elementary properties of the so-called mean-Hecky algebra. Okay, so now I'm going to translate. I'm going to come to the story. I want to introduce certain language, so combinatorial language, which will show how to get, for instance, this other button. On this up. And yet, I sort of like this because that's really a very good simplification. For instance, I think Devatov's paper is 61 pages. And I think one can get about different separators using only half a pitch. And I'll be in the power. Okay. Well, to do that, let me also remind you, so there is a way how one can give upper bound using well using say several facts about About intersections of effective divisors on varieties of complete flags. Eventually, this is due to Hafkilka. That's ideally due to Kafkilka. So, what's happening is, well, we just fix some variety of complete flags. And let's look at the harmonical effective devices there. Let me denote each one or classes of devices, HN. Yeah. Yeah, that's a random ch Well, um actually how one can introduce this H1, H2, Hn? Well, those are coming from the very, very classical factoristic map. For instance, you can look at the group of characters. Yeah, so we fix G, we fix So you fix G, you fix V, you fix speed maximum towards different symbols. And well then we can look at polynomial modes. And then there's this map to the homology of G modP. So rather I would use here the algebraic version of the child link of G modP. And this map is classical. You just take a character and send it to the first artistic class, the first job class. Class, first class, of the associated line type. And well, if I take, say, the fundamental weight, for instance, maybe for simplicity, let me assume for a moment the G is simply connected. Yeah, so well, in that case, this T star would be just nothing else, but just the way. But just the wavelengths, and we can take, of course, its basis in terms of fundamental weights. And well, what is hi? Well, hi is just the descriptive class corresponding to the fundamental. So now, so what's the idea? Well, how one can get an apple block? Well, let's just look. How one can get an apple up. Well, let's just look at this Chow input GPUP and let's look at those effective devices. And let's just intersect them with each other several many times and explain the result in terms of the so-called sugar classes. Okay, so well basically what that's looking. What I'm doing here is I'm just looking at H1, so to the power of one, H2 to the power of two. H2 to the power V2, Hn to the power En. And then, well, I'll just write it down so there's a canonical basis here. You can look at, say, look at brief decomposition, look at closures of pure cells, those will give you sugar varieties. Take the classes of sugar varieties, and then you can expand this as a sum, was the sum. Um was a sum, with some coefficients. My okay, so psi w where the index is just runs over all elements of the while group. So this is a while group for both psi's are just super classes, and well some And, well, since those are effective divisors, this is a nice variety. If you intercept effective divisors there, you will get effective cycles, all these coefficients here, integer coefficients, and then what you do, well, you just look at these intersections and check and just pick up those where at least one of those coefficients is actually one. Such intersections and pick those well at least one in double box is one. Let's say poll such a cycle, resection, to be a unimodular cycle. And then what you do, you just look at, well, you just ask yourself how far you can go from the point of view of co-dimension. What's the largest co-dimension is there so that you still have this property. Let me maybe denote it. Okay, so let me call it by unimodal degree. Unimodal to be well maybe I should call it here G to be the largest coordination which possesses a unimodal such as set. Okay, of course one may wonder why don't well we can probably get just to the dimension, right? Maybe this co-dimension is just equals to the dimension. But well, this is the case for some groups, especially for special. Like for instance, for if you take simply connected type AN or CN, this is exactly. So you just reach the N, right? You can get the plus of the point here. But for most of the groups, this is not the case. And indeed, if you just look at intersection of divisors where the degree is equal, the codimension equals to the dimensions of the dimension zero part, then you realize that all these coefficients will be actually divisible by the so-called torsion index. Torsion index. Since the torsion index is not one, most groups. Sorry? What you said is they are going to be divisible by what? Divisible by the torsion index. Torsion index? Torsion index of G. Growth indic torsion index. Okay, so for instance, uh okay, so that's uh yes, actually I actually I'll see okay, so so what is this? Well what what you can do, you can just look at this map. You can just look at this map, this characteristic map, right? And then you just look at its image. And, well, you can just look at, so this will give you a sub-ream, right? This is a so-called characteristic sub-ream. And then you can show that, indeed, if you look at zero cycles, then this will give you a subgroup of finite input. And that's exactly the Daushan. That's a definition. Okay, so right, so now how one can, yeah, so far, so far, what was the idea? The idea was just to compute those intersections, right? And check And check whether you get one here. That's really pretty cool. And of course, you can do this. You can do this. It's okay. You can just use Pirichevalia formula. But the problem is this. Yeah, this formula just tells you what will happen if you just multiply by one twice. And there's an adjust for it. But the form but the problem with this is that The problem with this is that this is not very efficient and effective. And for instance, you will not be able to proceed like that quality. So maybe the good testing case, if you look at this one and try to apply the PD Chevalier formula, you will realize that it's not accessible even by a computer. Well, you you need a very good computer. Of course we can't do it by. What is the relation to the chemical dimension? Relation to the chemical dimension? Yes, I'll say in a few words. So the thing is that when you do this, so if you know this, you know the vertebrae, then there's a formula, then there's a result by Nikita, which tells us that the upper bound for the canonical dimension of G is just given by is, so it's actually completely. So this is what I so very simple. Maybe I should start with this. Yeah, so indeed if you know this number, then you get an upgrade. Can you just explain how these two things are connected? Yes. Okay. Yes, yes, yes. So what's happening is, so what's happening is, okay, so suppose you have a unimoduous cycle. A unimodule cycle. Suppose you have coefficient one here. Then the trick is: okay, so you pick this index, so this would give you a specific sugar class radio. So sugar class times one. Then just multiply both sides of this equality by its concrete dual. And then what will happen is on one side will just get the class of the point. And then on the other side, it's affective cycle. So it has to split into the linear combination. So it has to split into the linear combination of non-negative classes of the points with non-negative coefficients. But he already have a class of the points. So it's very easy to conclude from that that indeed this guy will contain actual variety which will have the respective rational quality. Maybe here I should mention that, of course, the devices that you need to taper. I didn't mention that. Of course, the connection. Mention that of course, the connection is of course need to look at the restriction map, right? You just go to the speaking phase and just look at the induced map. And the things that you look at, these guys here, so basically you would like them to be the so-called rational divisors also. So they should come here. So again, all the intersections are happening in this level. So you look at the script on rational divisors here, so those guys are rational. And then you look at, well, they're still effective, so you set them. And then, well, since you have here the class of the perks, you can leave the problem here and get your variety y. So variety y can be constructed as the intersections of the as the intersections of the disparative classes over there taking the same powers. Yeah, so that's a geometric part of the story. Or maybe actually after the talk I can explain the details. Let me now say the following. Yeah, so as I said, you can compute this number using this nice quiz. Using this nice classical multi-solve. But this is pretty inefficient. And indeed, this is why it has taken 61 pages by Burst's law to proceed. And the only, actually, yeah, and you have to some restrictions, for instance, you can do it. I mean, you have to assume that it's simply connected, because if it is not, then you become even more sophisticated. But you also have the assumption of s simply raised. Also, the assumption of simply waste? Yes, and also simply waste, yes. With E678. For instance, yes, E678. But for F4, is the number is known? Yes, I'll totally. Okay, so now what I'm going to explain is how you can actually overcome this difficulty and how you can actually efficiently compute this number by hand. Number by hand, even for EV, without using any computer. And the trick is actually pretty old. I mean, so there's this very nice old classical formulas. Probably I should mention here the main demo. Even maybe it goes back to Groton somehow. Basically, the idea is this. So instead of looking at the intersection of the Instead of looking at the intersection of divisors here, you can actually translate the problem into the well, looking at the action of certain divided different separators on polynomials here. And then there's a formula which connects these two, namely, for instance, if I want to compute the characteristic map of this monomial, then what's happening. Then what's happening is, oh, let me just write it down. Well, you still get, of course, the sugar classes, but instead of, but here, but the coefficient, that's very nice thing. So you basically apply certain appearances to this form. Where? So now I need to explain what this is. So, well, actually, well, let's just take an element of the while group, look at its reduced worth. And well, then for each of the simple reflections, well, let me define, let's say, Ij. That's the so-called twisted divided difference iterator. It's a usual definition. separator that's it's a usual definition it's this one f minus s i g divided by the descriptive symbol indeed one could show that it's divisible always so you actually will get a polynomial function and this divided different separators okay so if you look at this decomposition then I just find the W it will be its opposite And the thing is that these divided difference operators have plenty of nice properties. For instance, well, of course, they behave like differential operators indeed. So they decrease the degree of homogeneous mononym by one. Well, degree of mononial by one. They satisfy the forms of an algebra. And they satisfy nicer relations on Did they form and so-called perspective if Bokster algebra and even Pickey algebra. And what's nice is that just look at this algebra generated. There are a lot of things known about the action of this on the universe. And this is what I'm going to do because I want to complete these confusions. It's as simple as alpha is a simple root point. So those are fundamental ways. And alphas, I denote simple roots. Of course here I'm talking about the standard picture, right? So when you have this lattice, we'll say, dumbness. Of course it sits in between two, right? The weights and the roots. Take a root system, just look at this. So this would correspond to a simply connected case, and this would Case this would correspond to the joint case. There are, of course, some intermediate versus okay. So basically, why? Okay, so now I claim that I have a total control, well, I have a control over well, I can actually sort of describe these monomials in a very sort of nice and So nice and elementary way, which will give you a coefficient one. Before that, maybe let me introduce the following. So by model the degree of the root system that let me call the largest, okay, so let me call the maximum of the degrees F. F and here the conditions. So think about this monomial screen. So first, of course, we would like them to be non-negative effective. So what it means, it means that we actually would like, okay, first of all, let me look at this. This is my homogeneous polynomial of degree t, homogeneous polynomial. Which is star, and then I need them to be dominant, right? I mean, non-negative. Now, it's plus, or if we put it in this way. So, what it means, it means you just look at non-negative combinations. This is a non-set of non-negative combinations of monomials and fundamentals. And the condition is that reducing w such that w f is one. That's a purely combinatorial description. It has purely combinatorial description, as you've seen. Indeed, yeah, so you really even don't see any sort of group here, right? For instance, you can define it for, I don't know, for finite real roots root systems, or you can even put Katsumudi thing here, whatever. Q, whatever. Makes sense? And um yeah, so how does one compute this? Well here's a one can prove the following lemma. Well this lemma indeed is a consequence knowledge of this action. Let me take it. Or maybe before even stating this, let me introduce the FOIA this trick you describe with the bunker duality now. You can now apply it to any polynomial in the in these intersections, not just to monomials. Yes, you can do this, yes. But because of non-negativity constraints, it doesn't really matter. It doesn't really matter. It's actually a very interesting question. What will happen if you put a calc module in the system? So, um and the thing is that yeah, so maybe before let me sort of state it as a definition. What I call by one chain is the polygon. So let's just look at So let's just look at the link in that. So one check, Y1, YC. So okay, so let's look at linking that, for instance. Let's look at this 5, 6, 7, the most interesting one, this one. And well, let's index it. For instance, I can index it like 1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And what I call by a one-chain is just a sub-connected sub-connect or maybe dilute something. That's why I demode it like this. So I start from simple from the B of text index by A1 and I end up by the B of text index by IA. For instance, from the picture, well, this could be like this. For instance, this one. But that means that, for instance, I go in this direction. And that just means this 87, let me just that's a one G. That's one gene, but indeed this is, I mean, when you have simply simply waste diagrams, then that's the definition. But if you have non-simply waste, then what you also have to require is that the direction goes, I mean the direction you choose this path goes from larger roots to smaller roots. And then, well, And then, well, one can prove the following. So let I1, I a be a one-chain and let F be a monomial copy two. Um okay to all fundamental weights from that chain omega I1 and well then you can prove that for the following two identities so if I apply the chain of my divide different separators to omega Okay of any unknown F, but that's good. Then I'll just get zero if zero is. And second, if I apply the same chain of the parameters for the monomer like this, here n is the same n. So here n is the same n. So n is the length, so it's a power power, but I'm gonna wave of the same length of this change, everything is composite. Then I'll just get I'll leave everything like and while I get using this rule, you can get immediately all the all the answers by Tiratov, most of the answers by Carpienka and so on. For instance, let me just do it for E8. Okay, so here's a graph. Here's a graph. Yeah, so the proof of this lemma takes half a page. It's just by it's an easy induction statement. But of course it relies on some knowledge of these relations. Well, okay, so well, so here, here's that, so you just need to look at your Dinkin diagram and choose the largest possible subchains there. Like, for instance, the first one would be this one, then I just remove this vertex. Then I just remove this vertex. Okay, so for instance, I can take 8, 7, 6. Come at me. For instance, I apply G8, G7, G6, G5, G4, G2, 2, omega 2 to the power part of V4, omega 6. And then I can put any mononial here, I just get still the same mononial. Still the same on the one. And then the trick is that, okay, so what you do, you look at this one chain, take a spectrum. Then the next one would be you just erase this, because F has to be co-prior to this. And then you apply it inductively. So for instance, okay, so you give this one, that's the first chain, then the second would be this one, then would be this one. So each time you just remove the respective things, and so on. So on and in this way you will get explicit. So each time you just substitute the explicit polynomial. And at the end you will get a polynomial of degree you can add up or relax of your chains to be 24 and this will give you the best known upper bound for the canonical dimension. Up above for the canonical dimension, a group of type which is 120, 154, which is 86 subscription. That's it. And of course you can extend it. I mean this, as you see, you can do it for any semi-simple group. For instance, you can do it for just finish, like that. For instance, you can take product of two graphs, two groups of type six, and then you. Type 6, and then you look at the diagonal subgroup for the 3. And then, using this way, you can just get also an upper bound for this group, which will be fitting line. By the previous method, it was impossible. And we'll stop at this point. Maybe questions? Yes. Yes. I'm missing something here. So how do you get one out of the to get one? Oh ah no but but you mean to get one where the direct solutic? Ah but yes yes so but but you do it inductively like okay so you take this one then as next step you take okay so so this is one chain right then the next one will be this one so basically what you write This one, so basically what you can write is T8, T7, T6, T5, T4, T3, T1, apply to, oh look, you just apply to omega 1, 7, right? And then another F. But at this F, you can just put omega 2, 6, and this will give you this one. Right? And each time you grow your position. Right? And each time you will grow your polynomial, and you will end up with the explicit monomial. But at the end, since you will reach the constants, you'll get one. That's all. So each time you just get one power, and then you'll end up with one. Last step that you use will be one. Yeah, the last step is just this one. Yeah, the last step is just this one. So you would say D8. Ah, by the way, I should mention, of course, that whenever you apply it, divide the difference operator, right? Fundamental way. In this case, it should be that's how you get it. Okay, more questions? I have a very naive question. So now you know this estimate for you can return. Know this estimate for the canonical dimension of E8. What does it tell you about E8? The conceptual dimension is less than 86. Well, to be honest, I don't know. Well, it tells you. Well, of course, there are some, for instance, there are a lot of stories behind the propivier. It's relation to ma it it's related to many for instance, it's related to the size of the so-called automotive. Upomotive perspective like variety. It's related to some, well, you can relate it probably to some representations, to the dimension of minimal representation of a p-group or whatever, V-essential dimension. So um well, okay, let let let me say that. For instance, for F four, right, what's what's the best I mean the b What's the best? I mean, the best picture or maybe four is better. So I think the lowest is eight, and the largest is 11. So there are still a lot of 60. So it's a lot of place for improvement. Again, the exact value. What does it tell you? Exact value. What does it tell you, maybe, about algebra or I don't know? To be honest, I don't know. Yes, definitely put. Well, I believe if there will be a proof, so for instance, you say the canonical dimension of four is A, then the proof already will give you a lot of new facts about. The original definition had to do with using canonical representative for each ordinance. For each ordinance minimalizing the rational canonical form for a major. Right. So usually you can't choose just one. So it tells you how many parameters. Yes, subset. I would like also to stress that the I I would like also to stress that the the problem here is really the problem the main there there are several tors torsion primes involved, so it's a mixed torsion prime case. Actually the only known computations for the mixed torsion prime was for I think for PGL6, right, caliothelium and culier, both having a classification of surfaces. So Probably the only known mixed torsion properties. Yes. So this calculation that you do here, does it just give a bound on this U D of sigma? Or does it? It gives you the best bound. No. Okay, so we still kind of uniformize the previous computations. We still don't know U D of sigma. I mean put it on a computer and run it for No, put it on a computer. No, run it for 10 years. No, no, no. No, no, no, no. Actually, yeah, I should mention here, of course, Aristislav developed. He, for instance, he proved that for simply connected groups, simply connected groups, this way, using this, you can translate it back. These numbers are the best known the the numbers that you get using this one chain method are the best known. So they actually compute the unimodule degree. Compute the unimodular degree. But still, it only gives you a bound for the unimodular degree, that's what you need. I'm not saying that I'm computing you, I'm just bound. Don't compute the unimodulative degree. I'm just estimating. You just estimate. But so far for simply connected groups, you can prove that this is exactly that.
