Megostaría much, but now it is possible, but we are here to virtual. And what I voyage well, my idea to Spanish, I have a little fortune if we are clarifying if it is that explication for it. And I want to seroy. So, okay. Puer mirar los slides. Si, okay. Okay. Bueno. Entonces el tema de. The problem that we will talk about in this manner in the group of algebraic groups with symmetries of varieties of algebraic variables. So, in general, in mathematics, I think that in which areas of mathematical areas generally interest when an object, it is interesting to reverse their similarity. In reverse symmetries. So, when we are contracting a geometric object, these symmetries are a group, a group of transformations that preserve this object. For example, we have there that I think two examples, more intuitive, we have to see that the first superficial tier discrete group of symmetries. And for the second, But the second is a sequel that has a platform continuum that we have a group of groups of symmetries. So, in our context, we are interested in studying symmetries from a projective project, and for this in this charge, and in this semana, we are tracking varieties complex. So, we are always working on the So complex. So in this context, in general, we have varied projectives, so they are varied here in the projective space, and they are definitive polynomials. And we have a notion of morphism between variades that simple an application that is also in this definition. For polynomials. So, simply remove objects definitions for equations or polynomial coordinates. So, therefore, we define this: that is the first concept of symmetry, which is very natural in the game, which is the concept of automorphism. So, we have an application of equals in, which is defined by polynomials, this por composition, we have an For composition, we have a structure in a group, which is the group of automorphisms of the varieties. So, the most sensible is the example of the projective space. And here, what passes the automorphisms of projective space, are exactly the transformations of transformations. So, the group of automorphisms have. Group of automorphismos of PNE is simple PG inemasome. So, they are data for matrices, in which they are invertible. So, this is a group that is very concise. And more general managers, if we are varied projective equipment, the group of automorphisms have structured groups. And we can similarly para component. For the componente conexa de la identifidad, and that is what we are a group complex. That want to decide a group and more extract of varied algebraic groups. This wants a complex group. So, what is in general is that we can see the group of automorphisms in two parts. So, there are this part of the component of the The component of the connection of identity that is agebrake group that has structured varieties of algebraic structure, and the discrete group and enumerable. And generally, these two parts of the group will differentiate the group. So, it seems to be a simple, andido, the case of dimension. So, we have. So we have taking complex dimensions, one good, from the point of view of dimension, one because we are working on the complexity, but this also can be this variety, this corcour, but complex, we have also emirated superficial sufferings, so they are real. And there in this case, it is very intended, there is a natural life in three classes, generosity. entry class, generosity positive, genero one that is the top that splano is playing, and genero mask that one is better than two queues varieties of superficial arrangements that have structure hyperbolic structure or negative. So this Negative. So, this comes tricotomía, and this tricotomía also reflects in the group of automorphismos. So, parajeno sero, this is good, the rim, this vimos that the group of automorphisms is PG 2 in the case of group of Toro, the torro have a structure of group structure, so we can mirror for the translations for this structure. So, with that, we. So, with that, we know that the component of the identity identity, the component with the identity, is the torro. So, here we have translations in the torro. And here we have a difference because here we can think that this in these two cases the continuum has positive position, but there is a distinction in these two cases because they first. Pespel two is a variety of affinity and generosity, this variety is a projective variable. So, there is a distinction in two cases, and when the general igual there the group of automorphism is finite. So, we have in the tricotomía positive curve, and negative, this reflects also in a tricotomía between the types of groups. Ecotomía entre los typos de group of automorphismos. So, this is this queer explicit here. And here also, a other example that are examples of the automorphism of iPhon superficial suables. So, here we are, or we are with superficials, well, then the derivative of projectives are definites like polynomials, and the iPers superficials are here and definitely. Superfices are here and they are definites because a equation. So, we are in the past and projective, and we are a equation polynomial of great equation, and this definitely is superficial. So, we describe the group of automorphismos of these superficial superstitions, and we have this theorem of the decoration of 6. I have restrictions of linear almost projective past. So, with two accessions, we are discussing a little more, with these two accessions, all the automorphisms of the superficial superpower, are described by automorphism of the space project. Of projective space that stabilization lawsuperfish. And that are exceptions, so the first is when we have dimension one, so it is a curved projective and great. So here we are an equation of great, this definite in the projective plana curve elliptic curve. This extra case of the tortoise. So in this case, So in this case, and we know that the group of automorphisms have a component connected to the identity, all the curb equipment. So the automorphisms of the pedos that finite. This can be more face, so we have other automorphisms that are. And the other And the other exception is cases of dimension, so it is a complex superficial and great. So, this is what we are seeing in the superficial characters. This is a class of very history in the hebrew. And in this case, what is the In general, what you can pass. This group of automorphismo groups will barrier with the superficial groups. So, there are examples that are infinite groups, there are examples in which a finite group. So, this is a very interesting problem, I guess, the groups of automorphisms of superficial. But what is that discrete group and possibly infinitely? And possibly infinitely group no agean group, which are finite generated, but they are infinite groups. For others, when we say in these two cases, when we automorphism of the environment, of the space project environment Giving stabilizing the superficial style, so we lose groups the automorphisms that linear affects the environment. This will be a subgroup of the group of automorphisms. So we have possibly a infinite group of automorphisms, that's for elliptical cases in many cases for the case of superficial cases, and 3 especially a finite number bien of the path. So the other automorphisms. So this is a little what we discussed in our group of investigation and going to their final, but we have here all automorphisms with no automorphismos of the projective ambience. Of the projective ambient. So, where do we? This is going to discuss a little more. So, this is what I want to say to say about this first type of symmetry type that are automorphic, which is the automorphism. But the horror, what I want to explain a cocoon is explicit what we have rationalized, which is a important. Of the geometry of the hierarchy, and what explicitly is that there are other notions of symmetry, different automorphisms that depend on the problem of geometry that are studying more interesting and more appropriate to study. So, this is what I explained. So, it was going to be the The general problem, classification in geometry of the gebra. So, I'm going to revisit first para case dimension, concrete, or superficial remains. In this case, when we say the classification, first of all, a discrete investment that is generated, these are a topological topic, and And we have the superficial rim, or the complex project of this invariant description. So, here we have all the curbs of generosity, one or a fixed majority. And when we are invariant discrete, what we did is how we were all the superficial rims. All the superficials of Riman de Genero. So, what is here is what we are the total of moduli. So, this para general have a second moduli Meje esto es una varied algebraic variability that is parametrizing all the classes of morphismo de curves of general. So this is a variety in this case when a variety of dimensions will be pointed from the variable class of a superficial rim. So I, for example, families of superficial superficial superficial Families of superficial general esto transcend in this subvariated subject of this space of moduli. So, it is an era very important in algebraic. So, this is what to classify the complex. In civil grand impossible to a classification of human classification. A classification of this manera. So in the manera, intuitive vague, there are many classes, many possible para divided as if in a discrete class, and in case it has a moduli. And I explain why they introduced a notion, it's an operation that is very important in the That is very important in the material, which is the blow up. So, the intuitive idea is that we are here with the plan projective plan, but two planes, we are a point, and replace for a curve, in this case, here for a case that is parametric all the directions tangent in this point. So, how do manera concrete management? Well, of course, Well, we have the segment. Tomamos, for example, the projection for this point. Tomamos we have a whole queue for this point, and projectamos of idea here of a point in the plan, what we are the rectangle, that the point that we are projecting to this point, and we have the intersection with the rest. We have the intersection with the restaurant with the objective. So, in coordinates, this projection is more than the projective coordinate of a XYZ and projectamos in the coordinate X y. So, they are not definite in the point, but we can do the graphic of the production, and when we say, Production, and when we say what we obtain here in this product of TEDS, one is exactly this figure here, which is how intuitively what happens is we are all directions in this point. So, the important thing here is that this two varieties of hebraic, the two, and the blow-up. And they came this pendant, this A E, the pendion normal, here. It is the curve and the point, we have an isomorphism between these two varieties algebraic variables, but not isomorphism because this replacement for a dozen. So, this is what we have the blow up of blocks in a point. This construction is generalized, we can tomorrow the blow-up of what varied in quality subvariated co-dimension for the two. In co dimension, you can explore in co-dimensional, because it changed, but here what we have in dimensions. We have a dimension for the toddler, we can exploit a point, or more generally, we can exploit a sub-variadad of co-dimensional por lumen. So, we can construct a variety, for example, we can emphasize with the plan, and we are pointing, and here the game is another point, and the plots, and what are their conflicts. But what are their finites? We can't say, and we produced a candidate not in varieties, which are very society because here we have isomorphisms, but they are globally isomorphic. So, this torture is for their varieties that we are exploiting, and that supreme, we have We have a isomorphism, and they are varied that they are much appropriated in common, in the dense, but not isomorphic globally. So, this, so with this, we are going to define a other notion that is more appropriate from the point of view of the classification, which is what varieties are viration equivalent. For example, as the blow up of the plan and the original plan. And the problem of classification in the hebraic gem is to describe two passes. The first passage data projective variability here, we contrar the representatives more simple. Much simple equipment in their class of equivalence. For example, we have the blow up of the planet and the plan is passive and magical that the plan is more simple here that their blow-up. So, in this case, we can see a representative more simple possible simple encounter, and we plan in their blow. And we have. And we have all the classes of this with the minimal model program, it is a linear very important investigation in geometry, which is this first pass to projective, in contramos, more simple in their class of equivalence virational. And in this, we construct. And in seguida, we construir moduli to this model minimal model. So, no voyage of the second passage, but the first passage is a very important program in generometer that is minimal model program for dimension estimate, for example, in the cyclo and we have dimension. In dimension two, this is the Italian scale in the cyclovente. In 195, this is much more difficult, and that was much mathematical, but it was finalized by an important paper of Moi, also, this field of 1970. And in dimensions, more great dimensions, that important work, Cascine, and the. So, that's very active in Georgia. And well, one we have this notion of virational transformation, for example, that variable rationality, if it is viration equivalent to P. And well, a problem that is a general idea is to decide when a data varied race. Variedad is rational. So, for example, very construction is a superficial and dimension in when this superficial rationale. So, there are conditions necessary, very queues that are very simple for example, the great aquarium, there and in this por invading this topological queue are predominantly. Derbados for equivalence diracional. For example, we emirate a case of graduate, the quadruple suffering, all data for a great polynomial. So in this case, what we can do is tomorrow in this historiographic projection, so we can put a point in the North, and if we project this Polo Norte, what cost of this manera well not definitely in this point. No vaccine definitely in this point, but it was definitely the progression. This will be a very simple way of and superficial quadrices with a projective pain. So, a quadrica is a rational variable. And we have the exemplar, thanks, this is a problem in the problem, if one dimension. One para dimension problem is a generic efficiency of great es rational one. So, that is a important problem, in general hever, and these interests in problematic types can be appropriated that they are or invariants that are preserved by equivalent ina diracion. And here, I decided that we don't or the Because the group of automorphism groups do not virational. This because it can build up that we have two varieties that are virational equivalent. If we are very happy, in Immiramos here, the composition generally no to have a No, we have a morphismo de, but only a dense age. And the rational transformations of equisitions for a group that will preserve virational equivalence. So what I decided to point out and classification virational. Virational, we have mirror the group of automorphisms, but if the group of transformations virational transformations. And for example, in a theorem of the decoration, I study these subgroups and scores that have a quartic sugar, variable quarter of dimension 3, not rational. Rational group. So, what we are saying is mirror este group of transformations virational dependency. It is a group that the group of tremona groups of projective space, it is a group that is very growing an example in the plan, in the plan, this first exemplify of rational transformation that no automorphism. So, we have in corporate. So, we have projectivas and application that is data for the coordinates, or what we can do in coordinates projectives, is multiplicate by here and all parts, so we have this application. And what is geometrically the segment here directs to coordinates that are contracts. Coordinates that are contrary to the points coordinated here, and for this triangle, what we have an isomorphism. So, the triangle is an isomorphism for this pero estead, they are contraid. And I would say very important classical news: the group of transformations of rational transformations of two generated automorphisms, and that. Ok, this is what I can think that with a discretion, it is all of this group, but it is not a group that allows very complicated groups, solamente, very sentiment, semester that is a group that is not simplest. So, in 2003, when the construction is not. When the mill construction in the first example of subgroup normal groups in the crime group of plano, and another result also very, on finalization in 2009, is the classification of the subgroup of finites, so many studies about the group of cremon groups. And in dimension, if there are a men, so for example, this So, for example, this theorem, as a theorem of network news, is impossible in dimension. So, this is our Judaism, so I want to mention why mathematica is very important to work in the cyclohevente, and it is very connected to general, not much of your work, but contributions. And we, in 1926, that the group of cremon groups and more great groups don't generate by great limited elements. So, it has a general journey, what is not with no, but what generates great. And, for example, more 200 news, construct in the first definite group. In particular, also the group of more grand, also simples. And for this darling, it uses. Well, and this is us much of the program of minimal modes, and now that you see the question about the superficials, so these theorems that explicitly construct two exceptions of curb analytics and catalysts, the automorphisms of the superficial summary of automorphismos linear space. So, we can try So now, we can try to explain where the automorphisms in these exceptions. So, the first thing of curve, what passes in the automorphisms of automorphisms of environment, but every automorphism of the curve is a cremon transformation in the planet. So, that restriction of the cremon transformation. Clemona not the automorphism of the elliptic curve. That is bien dondivien los automorphismos. If not in automorphismos genera of the pedos are transformations of the pedos. And now for the case of catres, well, there is the question that is much a superficial success with a catrice that automorphismos well of transformation, cremonism. Transformación de cremona del Petres. So, this is what we have del problems of touch problem, the first que loso. And there are a recent experience that we are in many places for example there are exemplary automorphisms that biennial transformation of cremona. So, what we want to understand of the automorphisms of the superficial summary. Of the superficial summary biennial of transformation of the Petrica. And this is that what our group will be investigating this investment. So we en el groups women who are experts in the study of superficial catres. So I think that study problems that are virational. So what we're going to do. So, what we do is discuss the theory of automorphisms, superficial catres, and also the theory of operational geometry and classification to understand this problem. So, here my email is here to us in this semana to estudar the problem of here. I can't remember. And well, the material, and also the link of Zoom for the 50s. So here we go, and many gracias for the attention. Lo puedo yir la colegas en Oaxaca perdón, perdo yo segu yo lo puse para que este a plaudiera ni ilo apague. Perdon. Otra veeno.
