So, thank you, Timo, for the introduction. I hope that everybody can hear me. So, this talks about conic stability of polynomials, imaginary projections, and spectraheda. And it's also supposed to give some kind of a survey. It is building upon also the talk that Also, the talk that Peter Brenden gave two hours ago. And the new results in this talk are based on several works with several co-authors. I will come to them. So let me start from some general motivations. So we are interested. So we are interested in real polynomials here. And a very general question is the one: where are my roots? And this already gets interesting in the basic univariate situation. This would be an example of a univariate situation. You start from some real or some complex polynomial in one variable, and then you can think about the complex plane. All the roots are located in the complex plane. All the roots are located in the complex plane. You ask, where are all the roots? And say, one particular question would be: Are the roots all contained in the lower half plane of the complex plane? And notice that even when we start from a complex polynomial, this is a notion that is inherently real because the lower half plane says that the imaginary part is non-positive. So we are using an order relation. So the less than or equal. An order relation, so the less than or equal sign, so there's something inherently real going on here. Okay, so this leads to the notion of stability. So I immediately define it in the multivariate case. So we call a polynomial f with complex coefficients and with variables. complex coefficients and with variables z1 to zn a stable polynomial if every root z of f has at least one component whose imaginary part is non-positive. So this is the definition of a stable polynomial. There are various variations of this in particular in the history of mathematics when you think of other half planes but this is usually the one that is the common one these days. The common one these days, and the very particular one of a univariate, the very particular case of a univariate polynomial has a particular meaning. So, first of all, we call the notion that already Peter Granden used that we call a stable polynomial f with real coefficients a real stable polynomial. And then we can observe that whenever we have a real stable polynomial in one variable, then this is exactly. Variable, then this is exactly the notion of a real rooted polynomial. Because whenever there's a root in the strict lower half plane for a univariate polynomial with real coefficients, then there's also one in the upper half plane and vice versa. Okay, the motivation, I can also refer to Peter Brendin's talk. He gave an even longer list. Let me mention that the original motivation for studying the step. The original motivation for studying the stability notion was coming from differential equations a long, long time ago. And there have been various recent applications and connections to stability. Let me just mention operator theory, theoretical computer science, and combinatorics. In particular, a couple of years ago, there was the prominent solution of the so-called Cadism-Singer conjecture from operator theory. There were also ground And there were also groundbreaking combinatorial results showing the existence of families of Ramanujan graphs for every degree bipartite graphs. And this was done by Markus Speemann and Srivastrataba. And there are many, many other connections, same diker to real algebraic geometry, probability theory, statistical physics, and so on. So a prominent notion in the theory of stable polynomials is the notion of a hyperbolic. Is the notion of a hyperbolic polynomial? And let me mention the notion of a hyperbolic polynomial. So, for the notion of a hyperbolic polynomial, we usually start from a polynomial with real coefficients, and we start from polynomials which. We start from polynomials which are homogeneous, and in this situation, we call the polynomial P a hyperbolic polynomial in direction E. If two conditions are satisfied, so first of all, we have a technical condition that E is not a root of f. And then the main condition is that for every point x in n-dimensional real space, the univariate real function, which maps a value t to p of x plus t. To p of x plus te has only real roots. Okay, so this is a very elementary fundamental concept having to do with real functions. So for this specific given E, we consider all the univariate functions which have direction E. And these hyperbolic polynomials arise in various areas of mathematics. One particular One particular concept that is often quite relevant is the one of a hyperbolicity cone. And what is the hyperbolicity cone with respect to E? So assume that the polynomial P is hyperbolic with respect to E, then the corresponding hyperbolicity cone is the set, which is defined as the set of points x in n-dimensional real space where the univariate polynomial p of x plus t. P of x plus te has only negative roots. And it turns out that this particular set is a convex cone. And therefore, this nicely connects real polynomial with convexity theory. And this has already been observed by Garding in 1959. And he also showed that whenever we know that the polynomial P We know that the polynomial P is hyperbolic with respect to E, then this polynomial is also hyperbolic with respect to every point E prime, which is contained in the hyperbolicity cone with respect to E. Now, what's the connection between the stability notion and the hyperbolicity notion? So, there's the following well-known statement. It tells us that a homogeneous polynomial P with real coefficient is real stable. Coefficient is real stable if and only if P is hyperbolic with respect to every point in the positive orthodox. And from this connection, we also see that the hyperbolicity notion is the kind of slightly more general notion. It's a little bit more universal, but it usually restricts the polynomial to homogeneous polynomials with real coefficients. Polynomials with real coefficients save. Okay, let us go on. So, in this talk, I would like to speak about several recent developments and extensions, in particular one of them. And let me try to sketch some of the recent developments. And let me start my brief history. A brief history with a concept that has been introduced by Greenspan, Kaliushny, Virnikov, and Werdeman. So, generally, of course, there are very variations of stability notions and so on. And in particular, a couple of years ago, they were considering stability with respect to a polyball. And in particular, they were interested in determinantal representations of such polynomials. The next concept that I would like to mention from a recent investigation. That I would like to mention from recent investigations are hyperbolic varieties. They were introduced by Sharmovich and Vinnikov in 2018. And this is like a very genuine generalization of the notion of a hyperbolic polynomial that we have just seen. And I will come back to this concept a little bit later on. This talk is mainly concerned with the notion of conic stability that I will properly define in the next slides and with In the next slides, and we'll give examples and so on. But let me mention that there were also some very recent, more general or more various other generalizations of the stability notion. Peter Brandeis and Jun Hu were studying the concept of Lorentzian polynomials that Peter Brandeis mentioned. And then let me also mention the concept of RingCon, Vincent. Vincent and Yu of positively hyperbolic varieties. I will also come back to this, and this will be the topic of a talk, I think, on Thursday by Josephine Yu. Okay, so all these various concepts are kind of related, but are different. And the general development also shows that there are many, many. Are many, many research directions around generalizations of stable polynomials. Let me motivate the concept of conic stability and also the other concepts by a geometric by a geometric view. So We can take the following viewpoint, so which is a little bit more geometric than the usual viewpoint that Peter Brandeim has usually applied. He has often a very analytic viewpoint. And what I would like to do here is that for a given polynomial f in the variable z1 to zn, I consider all the zeros. The zeros of f. So v of f should be the variety of f. And then I look at all these points and component-wise take the imaginary part. So because the zeros live in n-dimensional complex space, taking the component-wise imaginary parts gives us a set in n-dimensional real space. And this set that I have defined here. That I have defined here, which I call the imaginary projection, is kind of very crucial towards understanding all these various notions of stability. Let me first of all give you some examples here. So these four pictures, which you see on this slide, show four examples of imaginary projections. So the first one is an imaginary projection of a quadratic polynomial. The second one also refers to a certain quadratic polynomial. Refers to a certain quadratic polynomial, the third one refers to a cubic polynomial, and the last one to a polynomial of total degree five. And you might be familiar with the notion of an amoeba and related notions, and this viewpoint of an imaginary projection is very much in the spirit of the notion of an amoeba and its brothers and sisters. So, let me recall that. Let me recall that an amoeba works quite similar: that we look at all the roots of a certain polynomial f and then take component-wise the absolute value. And then there's also the notion of a co-amoeba, which takes not the absolute value, but takes the arguments of these complex numbers. And also, you can see in a similar spirit the tropical. Tropical hypersurfaces and tropical varieties, where from a given polynomial f over the field, say of Poiseux series, you take the smallest exponent. And all of these notions give you kind of nice pictures, say, in real space. And it turns out they all retain a lot of structural properties. And this is the same thing here for the imaginary projection. And first of all, let me First of all, let me note that the stability notion is just something like the yes-no question related to the imaginary projection, namely the polynomial F is stable if and only if the imaginary projection doesn't intersect the positive orthonorm. That was exactly the definition for stability that we used before, but now we can express it more geometrically using these pictures. Using these pictures. And so, therefore, it's very useful to study the structure of these sets in n-dimensional real space. Okay. Many interesting results and fundamental results are known for amoebas and for co-amoebas. A couple of years ago, together with Timo de Wolf and Thorsten Jürgens, we have studied the corresponding questions for the Studied the corresponding questions for the imaginary projection and sometimes it takes very long for whatever reason that my I jump to the next slide. Okay, so the main theory that I would like to mention here is the following one. So whenever we have a polynomial f in the variables z1 to zn. In the variables z1 to zn, say with complex coefficients, then all components of the complement of the closure of the imaginary projections are convex. So, and there's a finite number of these convex components. And these are analogues to the notions of amoebas and co-amoebas, where we have the corresponding results also for these structures, for amoebas. This had been studied by Gelfan, Kapranov, and Zedevinsky. Studied by Gelfan, Kapranov, and Zedevinsky as early as 1993. In particular, this corresponding result for core amoebas had been established by Mooney and Nies in 2009. And for tropical hypersurfaces, this is just polyhedral geometry so that you obtain the convex structure of these components in the complement. So what this shows is that underlying the stability notion, there's a certain concept. There's a certain convex structure, convexity structure. And let me mention some properties, in particular for homogeneous polynomials, f with real coefficients. So first of all, we can note that the imaginary projection is a strict subset of n-imaginal real space if and only if the polynomial f is hyperbolic, that means hyperbolic with respect to. That means hyperbolic with respect to some vector e. And more precisely, in the case of homogeneous polynomials with real coefficients, one can nicely interpret the components in the complement of these imaginary projections in terms of the hyperbolicity cones, namely the components of the complement of the imaginary projection of F in the case of a homogeneous. In the case of a homogeneous polynomial with real coefficients, they coincide exactly with the hyperbolicity cones of F. So, in some sense, for the case of a homogeneous polynomial with real coefficients, one understands well what's going on. But as we'll also see a little bit later, the situation becomes significantly more complicated also for complex polynomials which are not homogeneous. So let me explain this a little further in order to explain that there's a fundamental difference between real and complex coefficients. Let me have a look at quadratic polynomials. So a couple of years ago, together with Timothy Wolf and Thorsten-Jürgens, we studied, say, the case of real polynomials and wanted to understand quite explicitly the image general projections. And for real quadratic polynomials, For real quadratic polynomials, we succeeded. And there are certain structural results which tell us that if we have a real quadratic polynomial with a real coefficient and two variables, then the boundary curve of the imaginary projection is always an algebraic curve. And the irreducible pieces of this curve are of degree at most two. So this would be two examples, two additional examples of. Additional examples of the imaginary projections of quadratic polynomials. So the right one would have some unbounded components in the complements, the left one just has a bounded component. And actually, a couple of years ago, or we at least observed that the complex case was significantly more complicated. Actually, more recently, quite a very recent. More recently, quite very recently, together with Stefan Gardol and Maza Zayari, we also understood the complex case, and Maza Zayari will talk about this in detail on Thursday. And let me point out the following fundamental differences between the real case and the complex case. So in the real case, I mentioned we always have algebraic boundary curves and have irreducible pieces of degree at most two. In the complex case, there's a jump in complexity. So, in particular, first of all, the boundary curve in general is not algebraic anymore, but it might only be semi-algebraic. So, we might need inequalities to describe the boundaries. And then there's a jump in the degree from two to eight. So, actually, it's possible that there are irreducible components in these, a risky closure of these boundary. Closure of these boundary pieces which have degree A. Then this shows that there's really some unexpected phenomenon going on there because of this big jump in degree. And actually, we managed to provide a rather complete classification, which Marza Dayaro will talk about on Thursday, and which also now allows to understand really. To understand, really, at least in the low-degree situation, the imaginary projection of complex quadratic polynomials. Okay, now let's come to the notion of conic stability. So this was already very briefly mentioned in Peter Brandin's talk. I would like to study now and present a very natural generalization of the stability notion, which I Notion, which I call conic stability. And this is motivated by the general development, say, in optimization, where people for a long time have studied linear programming. And linear programming can be seen as looking at linear equations over the non-negative orthons. Non-negative authors, and then there was, say, in the last 20 years an important development towards semi-definite programming and conic programming, where people have replaced the non-negative cone by a general cone or the cone of positive semi-definite matrices. And this has turned out to be a very rich class of optimization problems and with interesting results and very fundamental techniques. So, the same thing can be. So, the same thing can be observed for the stability notion. So, if you look at the things from the viewpoint of the imaginary projection, you define the stability notion by the situation that the imaginary projection does not intersect the interior of the non-negative orthant. And now we can replace the non-negative orthant by a general cone. Say, for our purposes, we assume that always For our purposes, we assume that always our cone is proper, that is closed, convex, pointed, and full-dimensional. And now we can give this generalized definition of stability, where we say that a polynomial f is k-stable with respect to k whenever the image general projection does not intersect the interior of k. Observe that if k is the specific non-negative orthant, so that we consider stability with respect to the non-negative orthon, then this is exactly the notion of stability that we have seen earlier. And this is one, say, important generalization of stability that I would like to study further in this talk. Let me use the opportunity to also Use the opportunity to also mention some more details about the other generalizations that I have mentioned earlier with respect to stability and hyperbolicity. First of all, the hyperbolic varieties introduced by Shamovich and Vinnikov, they start from a, say, projective variety of a certain co-dimension C. So the usual case of a hyperbolic Of hyperbolic polynomial and the corresponding hyperbolic variety would be the one of co-dimension one. So, and this definition can be seen as a kind of very natural generalization of this notion of a hyperbolic polynomial, where we replace the subspaces, the one-dimensional subspaces that play the important role. Subspaces that play the important role in the definition of the hyperbolic polynomials by subspaces of general dimension. And in order to get this work done, we start from a certain variety of codimension C. So in the original situation, we'd have codimension one. And then we ask about hyperbolicity with respect to some real linear subspace L of dimension C minus one. Of dimension c minus one. And the corresponding condition that generalize the notion of hyperbolic polynomials are that x and l do not intersect. And for every real linear subspace L prime, which is a superset of L of dimension C, all the points in X intersected with L prime are real. So this is one natural generalization of the notion of a hyperbolic polynomial. And let me also briefly mention the concept of positive. The concept of positively hyperbolic varieties, which can be seen as a generalization of the stability concept. Also, with respect to a generalization in terms of the dimension, let us start from some variety which is equidimensional of a certain codimension C. So the codimension one situation would be the one of usual stability. And then Rinkhorn, Vincent, and you call Rinkon, Vincent, and you call this variety positively hyperbolic, if and only the following holds. So, to understand this notion, I use the notion of the positive Grasmanian, which is the set of C-dimensional subspaces in n-dimensional space, which have all Pluker coordinates to be positive. And the background of this definition is that you think about the positive code. The positive cone as spanned by the positive one-dimensional subspaces, and we had the connection between stability and the positive cone and the hyperbolicity notion. And now we replace the corresponding one-dimensional one-dimensional rays with positive entries by general subspaces which have General subspaces which have positive Pluka coordinates, which are located in the positive Grossmanian. And so, this is the purpose of the talk on Thursday. And I thought it might be quite useful to put these various generalized notions into a common context. So, let me come to maybe a particular important class of conically stable polynomials. Let us consider the case where The case where the cone k is the cone of real symmetric positive semi-definite matrices. So, k is always a cone in real-dimensional space. And of course, I can consider a space which lives on matrix variables. So, this is what I'm doing here. So, therefore, I usually write now f in terms of the matrix variable z. So, and the matrix variables have. The matrix variables have to be symmetric so that this works because in our real space where the cone is, we want to have real symmetric matrices and we call such a polynomial a PSD stable polynomial if the polynomial is stable in the sense of case stability with respect to the cone of positive semi-definite matrices. So, to be more explicit in terms of the definition that I gave you, this means that f does not have a root in the set of all symmetric complex n by n matrices where the imaginary part is a positive definite real matrix. And this set has occurred in various branches of mathematics, say, in particular. Say, in particular, related to modular forms where this notion is known or known to be the Siegel upper half plane or the Ziegler upper half space. So this is a variation of the notion of the stability. And in some sense, you can also see this as a generalization of the usual stability notion if you think in Notion, if you think in terms of diagonal matrices, so I put this into quotation mark because it's not to be seen in the formal sense, but of course, if you restrict matrices to the diagonals, then the PSD stable notion would boil down to the original stability notion. Let me give you an example. So, let me give you an example for first of all, for a polynomial which is not stable. Polynomial which is not stable. So I consider a polynomial in three variables: z1, z2, and z3, given by this determinant. You can just explicitly evaluate this determinant. And so this nicely factors. That means this function f is nothing else but the product of two linear functions. So we can use the notion of the imaginary projection to understand whether this polynomial. To understand whether this polynomial is stable or not. So, whenever, so there's a question by Maurice. So, go ahead. Is it in the chat? Is there any honest connection between stability and modular forms other than the fact that both live on upper half spaces? Of course, it's a very good question. I cannot give you an honest answer to this. So far, there's I cannot contribute to any results in giving more connections besides the fact that they are exactly using the same concepts, which also shows, in my opinion, that this is something like a very natural concept. But I cannot give you something like strong results on this so far, but I think that's a very interesting research direction for people who are experts in modular forms. Okay. Okay, yes, coming back to this example, whenever we have linear polynomials, we can explicitly compute the or can just read of the imaginary projection just to replace the original variables in terms of certain real variables. This gives us the imaginary projection for the case of real polynomials, and we can explicitly see. And we can explicitly see that the point one half, one one half is a point in the imaginary projection because it satisfies this condition, which is not, which is contained in the positive orthant. So therefore, this is not stable. But now the interesting things happen if I interpret the components as the three distinct components of a two by two matrix. Of a 2 by 2 matrix, I can interpret this polynomial as a PST stable polynomial. So to be more precise, I identify a variable Z, a 2 by 2 matrix Z, with a matrix Z1, Z2, Z2, Z3. And now I can interpret this polynomial as a polynomial on the A polynomial on the matrix variable z, and I claim that this is a PSD stable polynomial, namely, whenever I have a point Y which is in the imaginary projection and which is the imaginary part of a solution of F. Of f, then this cannot be contained in the positive in the cone of positive semi-definite matrices, not contained in the cone of positive definite matrices, because we can explicitly check this. Here, the situation is very easy because we have these linear conditions on y1, y2, and y3. So, therefore, we can just replace in this matrix Y2 by plus or minus y1 plus y3. And now we And now we can just explicitly check this determinant. And by a simple consequence of the arithmetic geometric mean inequality, we see that this is non-positive. And so therefore, this shows us that we cannot have any solution violating the PSD stability condition. Okay, so this would be an example of PSD stability. And for the second part of the talk, I would mainly be talking about case stability and PSD stability. Stability and PSD stability, but maybe this would be a good intermediate point to check whether you have already questions on this notion. Yeah, very good. So maybe let's make a quick break and see whether there are any questions. Yeah, so Jonathan is asking: Is the homogeneous real coefficient case in the real homogeneous case? In the real homogeneous coefficient case, is k stability equivalent to being hyperbolic in a cone containing k? To being hyperbolic in a cone. So it's a very good viewpoint. So it's not quite correct what you have here. So what you have to have is that you have to have K. You have to have k in the hyperbolicity cones of k, but you can express it very closely in the way that was just mentioned here, but it has to be slightly different in the way that I have mentioned it. Okay, are there more questions for Torsten at this point? Okay, otherwise I Okay, otherwise, I just go on and feel free to interrupt me. Yeah, I can ask questions and yes. Okay, so now there's an ocean and yeah, whatever. Let me first of all enrich the set of examples and also then mention one more connection before we go on with review statements. So, first of all, let me also explain what's going on. Let me also explain what's going on with k stability with respect to linear polynomials. So if you have, say, an cone k given, and if you have a linear, an affinely linear polynomial given as A transpose Z plus B, then F is stable if and only if A is contained in the interior of the dual cone of K or minus A is contained in the interior of the dual. In the interior of the dual cone of K. So, let me mention one other example. So, with respect to PSD stability, so one prominent, important example is the determinant of Z on the set of symmetric n by n matrices. Then, this is a crucial example of a PSD stable polynomial. Then, similarly to the situation to the To the situation, to the connection of stable polynomials and hyperbolic polynomials, I can also characterize k-stability in terms of stable polynomials in terms of univariate stability. Namely, a polynomial f is k stable if and only if for every x and y in the n-dimensional real space where y is. antimaginal real space where y is located in the interior of k the univariate polynomial which maps t to f of x plus t y is a stable polynomial so in that sense that's a natural relation to the natural connection between the multivariate setting and the univariate setting okay now i would like to go into um various uh give you um some interesting results which are related to various fundamental results Related to various fundamental results on the usual stability. So, I would like to go into the Hamid-Biele theorem, some stability criteria for determinant polynomials, construction of certain determinant representations, which also gives a connection to spectrahedra, and then also speak at the very end on preservation of PSD stability. Okay, so first of all, an important result concerning stability. The important result concerning stable polynomials is the Hamid-Beta theorem, which connects to the property of interlacing. So, first of all, let me give you the very original univariate version. There are various ways to phrase it. So, whenever we have two univariate polynomials, F and G, they are univariate, then the following are equivalent. So, G plus IF is stable. So, therefore, we can, of course. Therefore, we can, of course, express every complex polynomial in one variable in this form. And therefore, the Hamid-Beder theorem gives a general characterization on the stability of a general univariate complex polynomial. And the corresponding conditions are the following. So, F and G are real stable. And real stable means real rooted. And then there's a certain condition which tells us that the Wronskian. tells us that the Wronskian which is defined as f prime g minus g prime f is non-positive on the real line or you can also phrase it slightly differently you can express this wronskin condition in terms of a properly interlacing condition this is nothing else but a sign condition and let me not go into into into into details of this this just Of this. This just has to do with the combinatorial situation: whether the largest root of f is the largest root among f and g, or whether the largest root of g is the largest root of f and g. And so this is something like a nice interlacing condition behind. And because this interlacing condition means Uh, interlacing condition means that the roots uh appear alternatively, and uh then this uh proper condition just uh yeah tells us whether the largest one has to come from F or from G. Okay, there's um a multivariate generalization of this uh due to uh board share and brain data. Hang on a second, Torsten. There is a question by Frederik in the chat. I have not reached uh I have not reached. Is it equivalent to the pencil? Is it equivalent to the pencil materials in G? Roughly, yes, but you also have to have this additional sign condition. If you just look at the pencil, then this tells you that either all the roots are located in the upper half plane or in the lower half plane. This is also known as a variant of the Hamid-Biele theory. Known as a variant of the Hamid-Biele theorem, which is known as the theorem of Hamid, Kakeya, and Rubreshkov. So, but this is closely correct what you say, but you also need this additional sign condition. Okay, yes, there's a multivariate version which was given by Botsha and Brindan in their theory of multivariate stable polynomials, and which replaces the Wronskian condition by the certain Ronskian condition where we take that there. Wronskin condition where we take the directional derivatives. And also similar, as we have seen before, we can relate the situation to the univariate situation. So f and g are real stable. If and only if for every x and y where y is contained in the positive orthoned, the univariate polynomial f of x plus t y interlaces the univariate. interlaces the univariate polynomial, which maps t to g of x plus ty properly. So therefore, one can boil this down to the univariate Hamid-Biele theorem. And now I would like to present that there's also a kind of natural conic version where we have to replace the directional derivative, where we have to replace the partial derivatives in terms of a directional derivative. Derivative. So let the partial Vf denote the directional derivative of F in a certain direction V. Then we can define the corresponding V Wronskian, generalizing these partial Wronskian. And once we have that, I can state the Koenig-Hamid-Beta theorem, which tells us that for given non-constant polynomials f and z, the following are equivalent. K is a given cone, then the one. Then the one condition is that g plus if is k stable. The next one is that f and g are real k stable and we have the corresponding directional Wronskian conditions. And then the third condition is that we can boil this down to the situation of the univariate situation, namely that for every x and y where y is contained in, sorry, there's something missing here, an element sign in the interior of k. Here, an element sign in the interior of k, the polynomial t, which maps to f of x plus t y, interlaces the polynomial which maps t to g of x plus t y properly. So therefore, there's a nice generalization there, which also shows to my mind that this generalization is very, very natural. Okay, in terms of a polyhedral cone, one can also restrict to just Restrict to just the generator directions of this polyhedral cone. And yeah, let me go on. Petter in his talk two hours ago also mentioned that one very important, maybe the most important class of stable polynomials comes from determinantal representations. And the mother of all stable polynomials. Stable polynomial is the following one. So, whenever we have, say, positive semi-definite matrices A1 to AN, have an Hermitian matrix B, then the polynomial, which is the determinant of Z1, A1 plus Z1, AN plus B is real stable, or the zero polynomial. Peter Brandin had the convention that the zero polynomial is always considered as a stable polynomial. If one does not do the Polynomial. If one does not do this, one has to name it explicitly here. And then it's well known that in the two-dimensional situation, say by results of Bordshair and Brendan, which used the Helic-Elgen-Vinnikov result, it's known that there's also a certain converse direction in two variables, namely, whenever we have a certain real stable polynomial of total degree D, there are real d by D matrices A1 and N2 and a real D by D matrix. And two and a real d by d matrix B such that we have such a determinantal representation for F. Okay, so this is the case for real stable polynomials. And in particular, this gives a way to construct stable polynomials. And of course, it was a very natural and fundamental question. How can we generalize this to the case of PSD stability and other kinds of stability? And or other kinds of connectability. And let me give you this result, which is a result together with Thorst and Jerns from 2018. And this, I think, is a very nice way to construct these polynomials which are PSD stable. And this works as follows. So we start from a matrix A, which consists of blocks Aij. So it's a block matrix. So it's a block matrix. So we have n times n blocks of size d by d. And now we require that this big matrix A, this big block matrix is a positive semi-definite matrix B and also assume that B is a Hermitian D by D matrix. Then in this situation, the polynomial F in the matrix variable Z, which is In the matrix variables z, which is defined as the natural determinant, yeah, the determinant of the sum of a ij zij plus b in the matrix variable zij. This is PSD stable or identically zero. So to give you an example, look at the case where we have a two by two block matrix and every block is of size two. So this would be in the matrix A. In the matrix A, A11 is the left upper block. A12 is the block in the first row and to the right. And A22 is the right lower block. So this gives us all together a 4x4 matrix if we just put this together. And this 4x4 matrix is a. 4x4 matrix is a positive semi-definite matrix. And for that reason, this determinant here gives us a PSD stable matrix. And this is a or gives us a certain class of PSD stable polynomial, which can be seen as some kind of a generalization of the construction of Peter-Brandin and Borgier. And this is a sufficient quite Is a sufficient criterion for a PSD stable polynomial, but it's in general not necessary. For reasons of time, let me not go into the details. Let me also not go into many details of the proof, but because Petter Berndien mentioned the proof of that corresponding underlying result in his talk, let me mention that basically we can transfer our results to his result. And the main important thing that we have to do. Main important thing that we have to do in addition is that we have to work in this construction with a block matrix and so on. And there, it's the nice element that we're using there is the Catri-Rau product, which is a generalization of the tensor product of matrices and which has the nice property to preserve positive semi-definiteness of matrices. Once we have used that construction, we can transfer our results. We can transfer our result to Petter Branduin's results by transferring the real rootedness sub-results towards eigenvalues of a certain Hermitian matrix. Let me not go into more details of this because of reasons of time. Let me mention another aspect connecting conic stability, PSD stability to determinantal representations and spectrahedra in particular. Presentations and spectrahedra, in particular. And say one natural question was also if one can use that sufficient criteria that one can mention as a test, as a sufficient criteria, as a computational criterion to check whether a certain polynomial is PSD stable. And actually, something can be done, and this is very much in the spirit of sums of squares, where everybody knows non-negativity tests are difficult. It's much easier to check. Are difficult, it's much easier to check the sufficient condition of sums of squares, and something similar happens here. And this has to do with a spectrahedral containment problem, which is also contained with positive, which is also concerned with positive maps. And to mention this result briefly, let me mention that we are starting here from a polynomial where we understand the hyperbolicity cones rather explicitly. So let us start from a certain polynomial. So let us start from a certain polynomial of this form here. The initial form is defined in this way. And if we have an initial form which is hyperbolic and irreducible, then we know that this initial form has exactly these two hyperbolicity cones. This is kind of well known. Their closures are spectrahedra. And now basically to give a criterion when a certain polynomial is PSD stable, we can Is PSD stable, we can exactly use the technique that was mentioned later on in the chat. We have spectrahedra here, which relate to the hyperbolicity cones. We have to check whether the corresponding cones, if they are given also by spectrahedral conditions, are contained in these hyperbolicity cones. And for this, we can use the spectrahedral containment problem, which has been a well-studied problem in the theory of. A well-studied problem in the theory of spectrahedra. There are very nice results by Helton, Klepp, and McMalov, Kalov, which have given a sufficient criterion for spectrahedral containment, which can be checked in terms of a positive semi-definite feasibility problem. Okay, so we can write down a positive semi-definite feasibility problem. And if this has a positive solution, then we have a criterion. Have a criterion, so then we have a witness also for PSD stability of a given polynomial. And in some sense, you can see this criterion of something in the same spirit as we have the first step in the Lazar relaxation, which is a very natural step in some bigger hierarchy. Okay, let me go on because my time is running short. Running short, let me mention that one can phrase this into some algorithmic criterion for PSD stability. This has been worked out together with Par Pridet and Stéphane Gadol. And as a last point in my talk, let me mention that there's also something known about PSV stability preservers, but of course, so far not so much known as in the general. known as in the general situation. Let me mention that, for instance, like the differentiation differentiation operator also preserves stability. This is well known for the case of stable polynomials. There we also have stability preservation with respect to inversion. This can be generalized with respect to differentiation. We just have to look at the corresponding directional derivatives. Directional derivatives. And a very recent result, together with Julia Cordinotti and Stefan Gardol, and this is already much more difficult to show, is that PSD stability is preserved under a natural inversion operation. This would be a basic result of this. And we can imitate the original form for the stability version by phrasing this in terms of certain block matrices. So I think my time is. So, I think my time is running very short. So, therefore, let me give a short summary of that kind of overview on conic stability and the image general projection and spectrahedral containment. So, the goal of the talk was to interrelate these various notions. In particular, Notions. In particular, there are nice connections also between the PSD stability problem and the spectrahedral containment problem. Of course, there are many questions still open. In particular, of course, the question of further preservers. So in Peter Bandin's talk, we have seen for the general, for the original definition of stability, a much wider class, much wider classes of stability preservers. Many of these things are currently still open. Many of these things are currently still open in the conic stability case. Communatorial aspects we have are kind of currently working on these questions. This is, of course, also like an interesting line of research. And then also with respect to the geometry of the image annual projection, there are many open questions, in particular, also Marza Zayari will mention some of them in her talk on Thursday. I think I'm stopped here. Let me know if there are questions. Questions, okay, great. Thank you so much, Torsen. Um, and yeah, let me give this to the audience. Um, see whether there are any questions, and I think the first one is already in the chat by Munier. Is there something done on the image and a projection of varieties of co-dimension larger than one? For example, on higher convexity, also, how about the real projection? Um, so uh, nothing has been done on the imaginary projection. Imaginary projection, say, of varieties rather than looking at very specific situations that we have studied, but we have not really looked at, say, these generalizations of these higher co-dimension contextity results that are known for, say, amoebas and co-amoebas, which you have, of course, also involved in with Frank Sutili and the ones by André Henrique for the Andre enrique for the amoeba case. So, therefore, the answer is no, you might have a look at these things. And how about the real projection? In some sense, the real projection is kind of, if you start from a general complex polynomial, it's the same thing structurally going on as in the setting of the imaginary projection. But of course, if you also place some restrictions on the polynomial, say if you that you Polynomials say if you that the polynomial also has real coefficients or so, then of course these situations might differ. But from the viewpoint of complex polynomials, this is of course rather analog to what I have done. Okay. Okay, there's a next question which I see here. It's already in the chat. Yeah, please go on. Yes. Okay, can you say anything about the fiber of the image and error projection over the point in the The point in the image. Can you say something about the point? Yeah, okay. Also, or these I would relate this also towards these notions of amoebas and co-amoebas in particular. It's well known that in the case of amoebas, we have these compact fibers. And here in the situation, this makes many situations more difficult. What makes many situations more difficult is that these fibers are not compact. So, and therefore, of course, this puts this into a situation which maybe looks a little bit more like the situation of a co-amoeba. So, that would be one at hoc answer on your question. Okay, yeah, so then I see that. I see that Frederic and Maurice are raising their hand. No, that was just left over. My hand is not up anymore. Your hand is left over, Maurice. Okay, good. Frédéric, what do we have? I forgot to... No, it's okay. It's okay. Okay, so like no more hands. Okay, then more questions. Okay. Yes. Okay, if there's no, then maybe I would add a question briefly. So you mentioned. So you mentioned that essentially at some point you connect, I think this was in the context of conic stability, the questions to certificates of non-negativity. And I think, I mean, more specifically, I think it was when you looked at the semi-definite cone. Can you just comment a little bit more about this? What you have been basically investigating about this so far and maybe what are few directions from mind? Yes, I see it's getting dark in Germany. I see it's getting dark in Germany and my camera does not catch this. So, therefore, I also have a different camera here. Yes, in brief words, of course, the questions, so you're given, say, something like a polynomial. Answer is a PSD stable, not. In general, it's a difficult question, it's even a difficult question for the usual stability. And what we have here is something like a What we have here is something like a particular subclass of polydomiens which are coming from determinantal representations, which is a subclass. But as I mentioned, there's some connection to the first stage and Lazare relaxation. So it's a non-trivial class. This is what I mentioned. Where we can set up or we can always set up in our framework a positive A positive, so a semi-definite feasibility problem, and it's possible that we obtain the answer yes, and we obtain this answer yes for a sufficiently rich subclass. And if we obtain the answer yes, then this gives something like a proof for PSD stability. And also, we then can construct an explicit determinantal representation that comes from the determinantal criterion that I have mentioned from the one that The one that was discussed in my talk. And so, therefore, these can be seen as some kind of certificates. And I think that, yeah, whatever. It's very much in the spirit, of course, in terms of all the SOS things and so on. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Yeah, final chance. Are there more questions? Yes, please. Maybe a stupid question, I don't know. If you have two varieties, I don't know. If you have two varieties and we take a hypersurface, let's say, and we take the imaginary projection of both and the real projection of both. And we assume that the imaginary projection are homeorphic and the real projection are homeorphic. What can we say about the varieties? Well, it's a good and specific question. So, I talk, I cannot give you a positive answer on that question. So, I do not know if you expected a very precise one. So, whatever, it's something like you look at two projections at the same time, if I got your question correctly. Also, the sound was not very good. I cannot say definite things on what's happening in terms of looking at the projects at the same time. But it's an interesting question. Sure, sure, sure. But it's an interesting question. Sure, sure, sure. Okay. So then, maybe, are there any further questions?
