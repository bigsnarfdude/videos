Okay, well, thank you very much. It's really a delight to participate in this and to see the faces and sometimes the real visages of many people whose work I admire. And so let me get on. Today I'm going to talk about work that has been done in our lab, I'd say for the last Lab, I'd say for the last five or so years, mainly by three people: Nicola Klovalan, who's moved on to a permanent position in New York City, Steffi Tadoli, who's just left our lab, and Robert Young, who's a graduate student. And we've worked on this project with Vasily Studitsky, formerly at Rutgers, but now at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, and our work has been supported. And our work has been supported by the NIH. Basili introduced me a number of years ago to chromatin, which is the assembly of protein, DNA, and RNA that's responsible for the packaging of DNA in eukaryotic cells. And he developed a very interesting system. Interesting system and wanted someone to help him visualize it. What Facility is able to do, and this is a kind of schematic of a piece of DNA, and this piece of DNA can bind histone proteins, forming these small assemblies called nucleosomes, which you can see in this small image. And you can make a protein-decorated DNA molecule. DNA molecule with a number of these particularly specifically spaced sequences. This sequence called 601 very tightly binds nucleosomes. And so you're very sure that you have not plain DNA, but really nucleosome decorated DNA. And at the end of his system, he designs a site called E, which stands for enhancer. It's a protein. It's a protein that is needed to interact with RNA polymerase. The site here, it's called the promoter site on RNA polymerase. And if those two interact, what you get is a signal which is RNA. And so he carried out a number of studies where he could see how effective forming RNA was on a system of nuclear. On a system of nucleosome-decorated DNA versus a system of free DNA. And he measured how much added RNA is formed as a function of the length of this system in terms of the number of nucleosomes that are on it, 4, 7, 13, 25. He actually has gone up to around 50. And then on top of it, he could look at aspects that were rather specific. That were rather specific. We'll see a little bit later what a nucleosome looks like, but it contains organized proteins in a core, but it also contains some rather irregular protein segments at the ends called tails. And he could remove these tails and he could measure the effect on transcription, or he could keep the tails in this system. This system. And here he's explaining that, you know, for example, if he has four nucleosomes, he gets about tenfold more likelihood of forming RNA on the nucleosome-decorated DNA than on the plain DNA. And in fact, we published this almost 10 years ago. Now, the way we approach the problem, of course, is more like the way people at this workshop would. Like the way people at this workshop would approach the problem. We carry out computer simulations and try to assess from the computer simulations the likelihood that some pieces of some molecules placed on the end of this nucleosome decorated system will come into contact. This cylinder is representative of the RNA polymerase protein and the And the other object, which is kind of looks like two cylinders, is representative of the enhancer protein. In fact, these kind of mimic the shape of those in real high-resolution structures. Now, the way we approach this problem, just to give you a sense of what is going on, is you could see the molecule moving and what was moving in this system. And what was moving in this system were the angles and displacements that were describing the relative orientation and position of successive base pairs. And then we had a very simple model. We looked to see how far away these angles were at an instantaneous point of time compared to some rest state, had some force constants, and added up the energy over all steps. The energy over all steps. And of course, you know, made usual Monte Carlo type decisions in terms of whether we're going to keep a configuration or continue. The way that we treated the proteins is again, thinking about it at the level of these steps. But here, for example, is the very best determined crystal structure of a nucleosome. And as I mentioned, there are these tails. And as I mentioned, there are these tails, little bits that are coming off of the structure. And in this particular structure, you can obtain a map in terms of what all these particular steps are doing. And so in this structure, you'll see this parameter called role, which is a kind of bending of successive base pairs following a pattern. And so we would fix that pattern in the system. This distribution on the right. This distribution on the right is basically the range of fluctuations that we're letting the free DNA attain. And then we had some simplified treatment of the protein. The nucleosomes themselves are, I would say, interesting gigantic ions. They contain positive and negatively charged amino acids that hold the whole system together. Here, this is just a schematic. Here, this is just a schematic showing a nucleosome as a cylinder and highlighting sources of greater charge versus lesser charge in terms of the size of these spheres. Here is an example again of what the electrostatic surface would look like based on these charges. And there are spots of charge on the top and bottom, which are known to be important in terms of the association. In terms of the association of nucleosomes in high-resolution structures. Also, if you look at the structure, and we'll look at some other views of it later, it's not really a cylinder. It really looks like two cylinders. And so we worried about the volume that these occupied. And then we also kept track of allowing some of the charges on the surface to fluctuate. And so when we first published When we first published this, we showed that we could account fairly well for these data that Vasily had reported. Where here, this is the plot I showed you a few minutes ago. Here we have the experiments with and without tails. And we're showing you this experimental data, the relative enhancement of the experiment with tails without. Experiment with tails, without tails, and the simulated data are the open curves. And so it was a fairly good preliminary fit when we first did that. And then later we had other papers. Here, for example, is one where we changed the spacing between nucleosomes, how large the free DNA was. And again, we could account for these enhancement levels fairly well. Well, a better way. Well, a better way of keeping track of the effect of spacing, it's also called linker lengths, the length of the DNA linking the two nucleosomes, is to predict something that can be measured experimentally, such as the sedimentation coefficient. The sedimentation coefficient is proportional to the inverse proportional to the distance between Proportional to the distance between the centers of nucleosomes. And so we could, you know, approximate this as a function of linker length based on simulations that we had done. The simulations with Vasily Studitsky were just at 30, 25, and 60. And there is this very interesting oscillatory pattern associated with the variation in linker length. Variation in linker length. And when we made pictures just to get a sense of what was going on, we could see that this variation in the oscillatory pattern seemed to be related to changes in the three-dimensional structure. Now, this is a static structure, but it's based on the averages of those rigid body parameters computed between successive nucleosomes. Successive nucleosomes. And you can see that we go from arrangements where the basic, where the nucleosomes are kind of oriented so that their long axis is perpendicular to a kind of pseudofiber axis, compared to one where the axes of the nucleosomes are pretty much parallel to the fiber axis. And this pattern repeats with roughly a ten-fold helical repeat, which is DNA. And so, you know, perhaps. And so, you know, perhaps something is happening in terms of how these two nucleosomes are related to one another simply because here we may have complete turns of a helix, but here we may have only half of a turn of a double helix, DNA having in the canonical form around 10 or 11 base pairs per turn. But around 2012, the group of 2012, the group of Grigoryev at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center actually measured the sedimentation coefficient of systems like ours as a function of linker length. And of course, one of the things you could see is that the oscillatory drop-off and sedimentation that we predicted had nothing to do with the experimental data. Do with the experimental data that they reported. And they reported it for different ranges of salt concentration for magnesium and sodium. And this model that we had developed to account for the Stoditsky data just wasn't working. Now, the experiment I mentioned to you is a special sequence called 601 developed by the late John Widham. By the late John Widam, found experimentally to hold nucleosomes more tightly than naturally occurring sequences. The structure that I was showing is this that's illustrated here, the very best resolved nucleosome core particle structure determined almost 20 years ago by Kurt Davy in Tim Richmond's lab, and still. Still, the very best resolved structure. And what you can see is this particular nucleosome had a different sequence compared to the 601 sequence, which just happened to appear later in another structure that was determined. And in fact, if you use this later structure, which is a complex of a nucleosome with a With another chromatin protein called RCC1, that's represented by the red curve. This is the same kind of simulation I showed you before, whereas previously we had the blue curve that was out of phase. You could see that the red curve was in much better phase with the experimental data. And we started to wonder why, you know. Why? And one of the things we did was we just started looking at various features of these two structures and thinking about them in the context of sequence. So one of the things we did is we looked at the terminal base pairs, the first and the last, and we looked to see, you know, what was the orientation of the normals of these base pairs. And we could see that the And we could see that the structure we'd been using had one orientation, which was a bit different from the structure that seemed to fit the sedimentation data. There weren't many examples of nucleosome structures with the 601 sequence, but they did seem to maybe have a peak in this region where the 3-MVD, the one with the protein occurred. And of course, the one that was. And of course, the one that was best resolved fit very well in the distribution that all contained this alpha satellite sequence. And of course, this also tells you an interesting kind of story about high resolution structure determinations. You know, if you exceed with one system, you keep using it again and again, and perhaps might make minor changes. And so that's why some of why this reoccurs so frequently. Now, here's another Now, here's another way that we looked at that structure. We said, well, let's take base pair 70 residues away from the center of the structure, which is called the dyad, and look to see where the ends of the chain were. And we could see that there was a number of structures, there were a cluster of points where the ends turn. Uh ends termed, and there, and then here was a second set of structures that terminated elsewhere. And we could see that not only were there differences in orientation, but there were differences in placement. And, you know, aside from wondering about, well, could this be related to one sequence or another? We also knew that the length of DNA that was crystallized on these structures varied. So most of the ones that had That had this displacement contained 147 base pairs, whereas this larger cluster contained both 145 and 146 base pairs. Well, recently, we decided just look at the system as a whole and not just at the ends. And among the thing you can see is, yes, here's this cluster of points that's very far away from this other cluster of points. From this other cluster of points. But on top of it, there's this very interesting kind of overall rotation of one part of some of these nucleosomes with respect to the other. And we became interested in that and thought, well, you know, what might cause a change in rotation? And so we thought we would look at the twist. And so this is around 180 or. 80 or so nucleosome structures. And they're put into various groupings. And here we're going between the center of the nucleosome, 70 base pairs preceding it, 70 base pairs following it, and we're keeping track of what is the twisting at individual steps. And you can see some patterns are arising. For example, this. For example, this group labeled five has a region that's undertwisted near minus 50, a region that's under twisted near minus 20, near plus 20, and near plus 50. And in fact, none of the others have that particular feature. And on the right, you can see that we've added up the net twist and compared it to the average value. Compared it to the average value, and in fact, many of the structures that are in this region called five are undertwisted compared to the average, whereas some of these that are in six and seven are over-twisted. And in fact, the group that is labeled five, the one with this unique under twisting, is really the one that's separated from all the others. So here we have that whole array that I showed you before. We have that whole array that I showed you before, but we have examples of the different structures, and they're color-coded as to whether they were under or over-twisted. And so you can see here's all of them, but clearly this one stands out as being under-twisted. And you also see some under-twisting in this group three, but it hasn't really changed. And what is most interesting about this is the structure that we were studying. We were studying and trying to account for the Vasily-Suditsky data was in group five, whereas the protein model that we were studying was in group seven. And so if you go back to simulations, you can start looking at the structure at the level of neighboring base pairs, and you can see that on average, changing the twist. Changing the twist on the nucleosome has large effects in terms of the orientation of successive nucleosomes. These are average structures, the type that I showed you before, that are computed based on the average rigid body parameters that are seen between these in simulations of a larger fragment. And here, the spacing between the center of one nuclear. Between the center of one nucleosome and the next is 172 base pairs, which means that this linker DNA is around 25 base pairs. And here it's around 30 base pairs. The center from one nucleosome to the center of the other being 177. And we have a linker of about 30 base pairs. So this is similar in terms of the behavior. It's similar in spacing compared to the system that we were using with the Studitsky data. And then here is using an over-twisted nucleosome. And you can see that it look, you get the impression that it's actually rotated around here, but it's really the way the DNA is entering and exiting the nucleosome. And so, you know, this And so, you know, this at 172 doesn't look too different from the over-twisted nucleosome at 177 and similarly here. And in fact, one of the things we did was we measured a kind of torsion angle that would relate the orientation of successive nucleosomes. And here are these distributions where we go from the under-twisted to the over-twisted nucleosome. And here we take the nucleus to the nucleus Nucleosome. And here we take a system where what we're changing is the spacing between nucleosomes. And so, you know, going from here to here is maybe the equivalent of two or three base pair differences in the spacing of that orientation. Okay, so now this brings us back to an old story that is probably familiar. Probably familiar to some of you going back to 1988 from the lab of Arya Prunel, where he was studying nucleosome decorated DNA mini circles. So what I've talked about up to this point are open pieces of nucleosome decorated DNA that we've simulated and that have been studied either through the enhancer-promoter interactions by Vasily Staditsky. By Vasily Stoditsky, or the sedimentation work by the lab of Grigoria. And these early papers revealed something interesting, where here is a kind of schematic of an electron microscopic image of a DNA mini circle. These all have 359 base pairs. Here's one with one nucleosome on. With one nucleosome on it, and carried out under two conditions: in the absence and in the presence of sodium chloride. And then one with two nucleosomes on it carried out in the absence and the presence of nucleosomes. And so it salt. And so you can see this kind of overall change in the configuration of the structures. Of the structures. And this inspired us a number of years later in our lab to see what we could do. Now, at that time, nobody knew what a nucleosome was like. And so we just, you know, had a mathematical representation of the nucleosome being a left-handed superhelix. There were very poorly resolved structures of nucleosome, but not a high resolution. But not a high-resolution structure at that point. And at this time, we were simply using some curves to represent the shape of the free DNA. And we varied how much wrapping the DNA performed around this particular shape. And among the interesting things we saw is that as we change the wrapping from one and a quarter. The wrapping from one and a quarter to one and a half to one and five eighths to one and three-quarter turns, we obtain differences in shape. And of course, we could keep track of that with the familiar writing number that many of you think about. And we did these simulations only keeping track of the bending. These particular nucleosomes or this system was relaxed in the sense that there was no In the sense that there was no torsional stress on it. But the interesting thing were these sudden jumps in transition that was going on. And so recently, Rob Young in our lab has gone back to this old problem, but now is looking at it from the point of view of, well, let's put these different Put these different types of crystal structures on there. And I can't see the screen, so I don't know which color is which. I think the one that's in orange is the over-twisted nucleosome called 5B0Z. And I think the 1KX5 might be the purple one or the green one. I don't remember which. The other is also a relatively under-twisted nucleosome. And these all have linking number 33. Have linking number 33, and you can see that just these very subtle differences in the pathway are leading to a different response of these particular model systems to opening. In this case, we were describing opening in terms of how many base pairs were peeled away from each end or how many. Each end, or how many base pairs remained on the structure. And we were starting with base pairs going from minus 70 to plus 70. The diet is zero, so that's why this number is 141, and removing around 20 base pairs total, 10 from each end. So just a small little move. And then in the case of the over-twisted nucleosome, you can we've So you can, we've kept track of the average linking number in these particular systems. And this is reminiscent of a really nice study that David Swigone did some years ago with Erwin Tobias. And in this particular case where we have our over-twisted nucleosome, we have more of a mix of topoisomers than we do with the under-twisted nucleosomes. So the messages that I want to do is. So, the messages that I wanted to deliver today is: I'm really talking about something that is an ancient problem in terms of chromatin. There's a classic problem called the DNA linking number paradox, where molecular biologists were carrying out studies on the SB40 mini chromosome, which is a circular molecule of DNA that contains around 24, 25 nucleosomes on it. Nucleosomes on it. And they, from those experiments, said that the apparent twisting was less than that was expected from the coarse particle structure. To them, it looked as if there might be a contribution of minus one per nucleosome to the writing number. Here, more recently, we've been looking at the buildup of twist. We've been looking at the buildup of TWIST over the growing library of high-resolution structures of nucleosomes. And we saw this surprising presence of undertwisted as well as over-twisted DNA. You see, this early idea of over-twisting had persisted for years and years, just saying DNA on the nucleosome is over-twisted. But in fact, the DNA on this model that we've been using. On this model that we'd been using to account for the Studitsky data, and we only chose it because it was the very best resolved structure, actually turns out to be under-twisted. In fact, even a little undertwisted compared to canonical B DNA. And of course, as I tried to illustrate, the differences within the nucleosome themselves change the orientation of successive nucleosomes and they will affect. Nucleosomes and they will affect the configurations of larger nucleosome-decorated DNA changes. And then also the nucleosomal pathway will introduce subtle perturbations in a protein-free loop that's anchored by nucleosomes in a mini circle. And so with that, thank you for your attention. And thank you again for the opportunity to speak here.
