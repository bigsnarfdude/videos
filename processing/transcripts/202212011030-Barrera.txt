And he is from the University of Santiago, and he will tell us about periods, integrals, and eigenvarieties. Over to you, Daniel. Thanks a lot for the presentation. And firstly, I apologize that I am not there. I will be very happy to be there discussing with you in this very nice city. This is very nice city, but okay, I'm here, and so now I will give my talk. And thanks a lot for the invitation. Okay, so I have one hour, I think. Yeah. Okay, so what I want to speak about period integrals and again, varieties, how you see in the title. So let's see. Let's see. Okay, so my talk has four parts. Mainly, the three first are the main parts of the talk. The last one is just a few words about what we can do with the main result of this talk. So I will start explaining what is the words that are appearing in the title. So pre-integrals at the beginning, I will say some few words and I can varieties them. Words and eigenvarieties then. And I will state the main theorem in part three, then evaluation of the comology, I will give the proof. Okay. And then, as I say, page last part, I will just give some ideas very briefly. So before to start, I would like to know, if there are questions on the chat, I can see a little bit, but sometimes I will not follow that. Maybe the organizer can tell me if there is any question or observation. Me if there is any question of observation, please. Okay, so let's start with period intervals. Okay, so first I will just give the definition. What is it? So first it fix two reductive groups, G and H, H inside of the G, we will fix this, both over Q. Okay, we will fix. We will call A this group, which is the intersection of H with the maximal split torus of the center of G. In the practice, in both examples, this A will be essentially the center of G, so maybe you can ignore this part. Okay, so we fixed some caspidal automorphic representation of G. I have the video here, maybe. I have the video here. Maybe I will okay. A cash flow automatic representation of G. We suppose the central character is trivial on this A. Okay. Okay. So now we fix a character chi of this quotient and we define the following functional linear of over pi. So you give So it's given by the following formula. It's essentially the integral of the form, automorphic form in pi over h. That is what you are doing, taking the integral along h. Okay. These are called the period integrals that appear in the title of this talk. These are the name, the role. The main role, these are the numbers, the period integrals. Okay, so what we so in gen so in general, it expected several relation between these numbers with other structures over facts. So the non-vanishing of these period integrals is related with functionality. Okay, so if this period If this period is non-zero over the automorphic representation, so the automorphic representation comes from another group determined from G and H. This is also related with some automorphic L functions, these period integrals. So, which is the goal of my talk? The goal of my talk is more a mix between this is much more. This is much more automorphic and complex to something more piadic. So, my goal is to, in two cases, in two examples that you will see in a few minutes, is to explain a piadic variation kind of of these period integrals. Relate this periodic variation with periodic variation of functorality. I mean, you okay, so you put functorality in periodic families and. And relate this with automorphic L values, okay? L-functions. So, this is the goal of my talk. So, now I will concentrate a bit on this, the period integrals in some examples. So, my talk is based on two examples. And these two examples will be around all this hour, will be the example. Be the examples I will follow. So, the first one is, I call it the Chalaika example. Let's explain a bit the context. So, which is the example? In this case, we take, we fix a number bigger or equal than one. We call G the this group that will be this group in this case, G of 2N over. In this case, GL2N over Q and the group H is GLN cross GLN embedded in G diagonally. This is the Shalaika situation. Relate with the expectation that I mentioned before, we have the following result. So here. Oh, wait. Okay. Okay, so this the following result, the following theorem is a consequence of the works of Jackie Chalaika in the 90s, Frid with Jacket in the 93, Handle Sajak in 2009, and Asgari Chahiri 2011. If maybe if I'm wrong here about the reference, please tell me. And the theorems say. And the theorems say oh, it's changing. Oh, yes. So the theorem is just explain the expectation that I mentioned before. So the following statements are equivalent. So firstly, a period integral is non-zero. So here I'm not very precise because the period integral is a modification, a small modification of the period that I say some slightly different. That I said some slides ago, but it's almost essentially what I wrote before. So the non-zero of this period integral is related with the automorphic representation to come from some globally generic caspier automorphic representation of J-Spin 2n plus 1. So in this case, as you see, in this situation, the This situation, the functorality is from just pin to n plus one. Okay, and finally, uh the twisted exterior square L function of pi, a twist given by some character that I ignored here, but okay, have a poll in S equal one. These three statements are equivalent and kind of prove this. And kind of prove the expectation that I mentioned before. Okay. Okay, that is the Chalaika situation. So, one word about the name Chalaika that is not part of the theorem. So, these three properties are equivalent to the automorphic representation to admit a Shalaika model. So, to say what is a Chalica model, I need to introduce some integral to write some form. Use some integral to write some formulas that I don't want to write, but at least I can give you some consequence of this fact. So the first one is that admitting a Chaleika model, I allow you to describe the L values of the standard function of pi to have an integral representation, as for modern forms for zero q or q in the classical case. Yeah. Observe here that the L function appearing in this integral representation is a standard one. It's not the exterior power that appear in the theorem before. Okay, another consequence, firstly, this fact is proved by Friedwich and Jackett in 93, I forgot to say. If you assume that pi is comological, so you can use a comology. So, you can use a cohomology to prove some algebraicity results for these critical values of the standard function. That was proved by Grobner and Ragram in 2014. And this work of Ragram is very important in our paper, our construction, our work. Okay, so the second example is, I call it the ASI. So, which is this? So, which is this situation? So, in this situation, we fix again a number n bigger or equal than one, but we fix now a field which is an imaginary quadratic field, an alpha extension of degree two over Q. So which are the groups? Again, we need a G and H. So, G will be the restriction of to Q from E of G L N. Ah, there is a mistake there, it's G L N E. Mistake there is gln e. Sorry, okay, and h will be gln q over q inside g okay that is our our context in the aside situation okay and we have again a kind of a theorem explaining this expectation that I mentioned at the beginning in this example too. This is due to the work of This is due to the work of Fricker in 1988, Fricker Sinonev in 95, and Ginsburg Ralis Sudhi in 2011. So maybe if there is a problem with the bibliography, please tell me because I'm just using these facts. So, of course, if there is any problem, please tell me. Okay, so the theorem says the following. The theorem, say the following: take an automorphic, a caspital automorphic representation of G again. You have an equivalence between three facts. The first one is some period integrals are non-zero. In this case, I'm more precise. So pH1 is the period that I state at the beginning with the trivial character. It doesn't non-zero when n is odd. When n is odd, and when n is even, we consider the twist, we consider this quadratic character of the quadratic extension. Okay, so the non-vanishing of this period in each corresponding case is equivalent to the fact that the caspier automorphic representation comes from another, a caspier automorphic representation from unitary groups. So in this situation, in this example, I call a side. In this example, I call a SI. So the group, the functorality chrome from unitary groups. And the L function appearing here is the SIL function, okay? So this is, if you have a pole, this SIL function has a pole in S equal one. So this is equivalent to the other two statements. So one observation. So you have two asi functions in this case, and the other one. In this case, and the other one you have a is holomorphic at the SQL one, I think. Okay, so this okay, so the character, as I said, is the quadratic keratic attached extension. So that is the situation about the integral periods that I wanted to explain. So as you see, so we will have two examples that we will be giving some ideas in more precise ideas in each example. More precise ideas in each example while I'm explaining some general facts. So maybe there is a question. So before, so I will speak now. I made, oh, sorry, maybe I made a mistake about the name. It's Flickr. Oh, sorry. So, sorry. Maybe every Freaker is Flickr. I'm sorry. It is Flickr. Oh, sorry. And I think I wrote. And I think I wrote flicker in all my on the slides. Sorry. Okay. Before to, now I want to pass to the second words that appear in the title of my talk are the eigenvarieties. So before to pass, there maybe there is an observation about these period integrals before to pass to this other topic. Maybe there is some mistake, maybe in something. No? Okay. Okay. If there are no more observations, maybe I will explain the second subject appear on the title of my talk. So now I want to explain what are the eigenvariators, give some brief idea, and I will state the main theorem. And okay, so that is. And okay, so that is the motivation in this part. Okay, so I can vary this. So I will not give a precise construction in general, but just a few words about what they are. This is a more non-Archimedean subject. But to have an idea what are the eigenvarieties, we have some slogans that can be useful. For example, And can be useful. For example, a first 11 that I like, you can think about eigenvarieties as non-Archimedean modly spaces of periodic automorphic representations. Also, you can think something about more more movement, kind of they are geometrical objects which encode the periodic deformation of the automorphic representations. Of the automorphic representations. Okay, now you feel that you are moving the automorphic representation. Okay, so at the end, they are really geometrical objects and they are rigid varieties or non-Archimedean analytic varieties which contain automorphic representation. So to study them, to construct them and to study them is a very interesting subject. A is a very interesting subject about the construction. There are different ways to construct them. I would like to mention three of them, which the first one is kind of called a Heiger, or maybe Heiger is more Koleman theory, which are the classical one, and Higher-Koleman theory, which are the new ideas that appeared the last four or five years by Florian Boxer. By Jurian Boxer. And this line of construction of eigenvarieties, which is more algebraic, you use the algebraic structure of the Shimura varieties. It's more coherent cohomology. Okay, so we can say that it starts with Hida in 86, Kolyman in 97 made these steps, and then there are And then there are 2010, there are a lot, a lot of works. And I would like, I'm not mentioning a lot of them, like Bazar, Genevieve, and Andreta Jovita Pilony in 2015. And recently, Voxer Piloni, sorry, put in the opposite Voxer Pilony. 2021, they const Voxer Pilony, they. Voxer Piloni, they higher Kolyma theory developed, and now they are writing a higher HIDA theory, which is normally will be appearing soon. Oh, sorry, put Voxer Piloni in the opposite direction. It's Voxer Piloni Soro. Okay, another approach to construct tiging varieties are our conversion cohomology, which is a more group cohomology. Group cohomology. And this is start with the Stevens in 1994, 2000s, like an Ach Stevens in 2008, Urvan 2011, Hans in 2017, and there are more works refining a bit their construction. And the last approach to construct them are the completed cohomology. You say, well, just this is this is Is this started with Emerton in 2006, Hill 2007, Calgary Emerton, Loffer, and there are more works too? So, this the last one is very important in Langland's program, Piatic Langland problem. I have the impression, but maybe I'm lying. Well, in any case, in these works, we will concentrate in over conversion cohorts. So, this is the procedure that we will. The procedure that we will take and we will use in our works. Okay, so let's. My goal now is in this generality to give some ideas of what is a convergent cohomology. And then we pass to the two examples we have in mind. Shall I can assign to put more down to earth the ideas? Oh, so okay, we fix a prime number p, which is the prime number that is appearing in all the light, the last slides. The last slides. We need some notations. We will suppose the G squares is split at P and we fix a model over Z P okay. That is to avoid the use of Bruhatit building this theory. But we fix a Borel subgroup of G, hence its unipotent radical and T a maximal torus inside of P. Using this notation, we define Using this notation, we define the Iwahori subgroup, which is called EWP, and are the elements of this GZP such that mod P below to the Borel. These groups already appear in the mini course of both types, I have the impression. And appear some more refined subgroups called parahoric. But in this talk, I will just concentrate in Ivahori subgroup. Okay, as our conversion comology is something comological, so we need some object to take the comology of it. And these are, to define this, we fix a level, which is K, which is an open compact subgroup of the finite point of G. And as the level at P will always be inside of the Iwahori. We need Ivahori level to produce pietic variation. To produce p atic variation. So we suppose the p-part of this open compact subgroup is contained in the Wahori subgroup. So the geometrical object that we will take the cohomology and we will use in this construction are called the arithmetic manifolds attached to G of level K is this double quotient. It's a usual double quotient that, so I need to explain the right maybe, which is K infinity. Explain the right, maybe, which is K infinity circ is essentially the connected component of the identity of K infinity, which K infinity is the center times the maximum compact subgroup of GR. Okay, so observe that here we are not asking any algebraic structure on yk. This can be just a This can be just a manifold, I mean, a real manifold. Okay, and this is enough to construct a commission common to produce pietic variation, as you will see. Okay, so still in this generality, we have the space which we will take the cohomology, and now we need some coefficients. So, the reconvergent cohomology is made from a singular cohomology of this manifold, but with huge coefficients. So, let me explain. Of coefficients. So now let me explain which are the coefficients. Okay, so the notion of the deformation is kind of we are thinking that we are parametrizing by the weight of the automorphic representation. So we need a weighted space, which is some subset of this homomorphism of the torus, as you see here, the continuous homomorphisms from the ZP points of the torus. Okay, so depending on the situation, we use W more smaller, bigger, or depending what you want to do. So if you have an application in mind, you use W or smaller, bigger, or what, in fact, what you can to use. This W encode the epiodic variation of the weights of the automotive presentation. So in the two examples that we have, I will be more. Samples that we have, I will be more precise. So in a few minutes. Okay, so let's now construct the coefficients of this cohomology that we will use. We fix an affinoid of this weight space, the convenient one weight space, and we call the OU. I'm not sure if you can see the hand on the screen. Yes. Yes. I have a pointer that is ah, so now I'm around all you is fine. Ah, great. Okay, I didn't realize that I can use the oh, okay. So perfect. So this OU is the ring of rigid function over U. Okay. Okay, using this huge ring that we have here, we define this du. These are the locally analytic distribution over the Zp point of the unipotent radical of the Borel. You remember that we fixed before this N. Okay, essentially this is some copies of Zp, Zp power something with, yeah. Yeah. Oh, so that is the model du, just all u-valued local distribution over NZP. And finally, we can define the work conversion cohomology. So it's essential is only the singular cohomology with compact support. This is where we are using here with coefficient in du. So to be more precise, du have is endowed with an action of Is endowed with an action of the Iwahori, the EWP that I introduced before. And then you can produce a local system over the arithmetic manifold of YK, and you consider this singular cohomology. So this is the over-convergent cohomology. So what is the eigenvariety? Because this is kind of given the production of the periodic deformation. The piadic deformation, but more precisely, the eigenvarieties, you construct them by some affinoids. You glue the different affinoid, different affinoids that I wrote, S P T U, okay? Varying U, U, U, vary U between all the other affinoids of W. But I need to say what is P U. So P U is essentially the Hecke algebra acting in this overconvergent cohort. Over convergent comology. So you cut a bit the over-convergent comology, you will reduce a little bit, it's too big, but you will see in the examples what we do with them. But that is essentially the eigenvariety are constructed by the Hecke action on the overconversion cohomology. Okay. So that is the that is the this general introduction to eigenvariety. General introduction to eigenvarieties. I hope that I give some idea. And in any case, in the two examples that I have now, the Chalican side, you will see a little bit more precisely what I'm saying. So let's say some, come back to the example which is Shalaika, Shalaika example. So the automorphic representation that we will occur here are given. Are given. I will describe them now. So, firstly, let me explain which are the weights of in this situation. The weights are this table of numbers attached to a weight, so like that's a dominant weight with respect to some upper triangular matrices, which is the Borel. We have attached the V lambda, which is the algebraic reduced representation of G of highest weight lambda. Okay, so we. So we give some adjective to these weights. So we call this the weight to be regular if the inequalities are strict. And we call it pure if there is a relation between the first one and the last one, the second one and the before last one, etc. And if the sum, the consecutive sum is constant. So if there exists some W such that these sums are Such that these sums are constant. So you see, there is some restriction on the weights now. So that will imply which piece of the weight space we will take in a few seconds. Which are the automorphic representation we care? So we will fix a Caspian automorphic representation of G such that is regular algebraic, which means that appear in the cohomology. That appear in the cohomology of the locally symmetric space. Here, this V lambda dual is the local system attached to V lambda dual, which is the dual linear of V lambda. We'll suppose also that lambda is regular and pure. In the proof of the main theorem that we'll state in a few seconds, you will see the use of this, the regularity. Also, we suppose that pi. We suppose that pi has such a Leica model, as in the first part of the when we were discussing about this integral period. So, you remember that I didn't explain what's such a Leica model, but you can think that comes from some G S pin 2n plus 1 if the automorphic representation come from this group. Okay, an automorphic representation satisfying these two extra conditions is called a RAS car. RAS car is Car. RASCAR is regular algebraic S is from Shalika. Okay, you can also think about symplectic and Caspel automorphic representation. Okay, this automorphic representation that we fix appear in the cohomology. And you can be very precise about which degrees this appear. And in fact, it appears in oh, there is a Oh, there is a problem with the video. Okay, in fact, this appears in degrees n squared and n squared plus n minus one. This then appear in n times in n comology degrees. The number of times that appear in the comology have some other interpretation, and that you can see in Penkate's conjectures, but in any case, here we don't, we are not, there's no relation with that. Relation with that, but it's not random. And oops, okay. Okay, so in all these works that I'm in the two samples that I'm describing here, we will concentrate in the top degree, which is n squared plus n minus one. We call this top degree, where automorphic representation appears, t okay, so now the eigenvariety. So this, that was the automorphic representation. That was the automorphic representation. We care in the Chalica setting, which is the weight space. The weight space is the pure weight space. So we want that the pure classical weights that I described before, these Qn tuples of integers having connection between the borders, the first and the last one. We want these classical weights to be dense here. To be dense here. So that naturally tells you that the dimension of this weight space is n plus 1 because you have the first n plus this w, which is the purity of the weight. This is our weight space. So now we can repeat the procedure using the overconversion cohomology. So we fix an open affinoid containing the weight we care about because Because remember that we fix an automorphic representation phi with weight lambda. Okay, so we fix u containing this lambda and we work over this. So we consider the top degree of a conversion cohomology. And here there is this subtility. The HTC, the top degree of a conversion combination is too big. All these models are too big. All these models are too big, so we need to cut them in a precise way using the UP operator. This is the spectral properties of the UP operators, which play an important role in the theory. So we obtain this HU, which is well behaved, at least finitely generated OU model at least, and we have some properties with respect to the UP operator. There is this slope decomposition. There is this slope decomposition properties that play an important role. Anyway, using this H U is how we construct our eigenvariety in this situation. So we call pi u the image of this of the Heke algebra in the endomorphism acting in this H U. This is an OU model again. Okay. And the eigenvarieties is constructed using this. Is use is construct using this pi u as before. Okay, so remark that we are taking the maximal spectrum of pi u, the maximal spectrum in terms of origin geometry. But it is only the only we are just taking care of the algebra acting on the top degree cohomology. And it's because that I mentioned here the top degree eigenvariety. Okay. Okay. We don't glue them and to construct a global object, we just work locally. That is what we are doing. So we call E this maximal spectrum, which is endowed with a map to the weight space. This is a projection to the weight space. So each point has a weight in some way. point have a weight in some way. Okay, this is our geometrical object. So now we have both. We have the optomorphic representation we care and we have the geometrical object. So now we can state the theorem. So we would suppose that pi is of level one, it's spherical everywhere, in other words, as so you need in particular it's spherical at p, but I say Particular, it's a spragal at P, but I say that we need a Iwahori level at P. So we fix a pure refinement that is called, in general, a P stabilization, as maybe you know, in our modular forms. But you need to do something at P to have level, Ivahori level at P. So, what's mean P refinement is only the automorphic representation, it's a couple automorphic representation plus this alpha. So, alpha is So, alpha is a system of eigenvalues appearing in this invariant space. Okay, so here you have several UP operators acting and you consider the eigenvalues that appear there. Okay, so that is a pure refinement. So, maybe I'm so this is the theorem. So, this theorem is a joint work with Dimitrov Graham. Of Graham, Georza, and Williams. It's a work that from this year, 2022, and you can find it in archive. So which is the state event? So we fix an automophicular presentation as before, and we fix a purifyment. So here I need three names which are maybe obscure. So to be so we suppose that the purifying was regular. That the perify was regular, it's a small slope, half a small slope, and half a islike. So, maybe I can say some words of this. Maybe regular means a multiplicity one. Small slope means that you can connect very directly over conversion chromology with the classical chromology. That means small slope, or imply at least. Or imply at least. Okay. Anchalaika means: okay, all what you are doing here, despite tilde, lives in gel 2n. But you want something that comes from just pin 2n plus 1. So you cannot fix any refinement as you want. You need to fix some purefinement that, in some way, will be produced from some pure refinement of just p2n plus 1. And that is we call Shalaika. And that is we call Shalaika. Okay. And what we prove is the diegen variety is et al. at our point. So implicitly here, there is the fact that we can produce a point in the eigenvariety corresponding to our purefinement. Okay. And the second part of the theorem say that, okay, is it talent? So you fix the unique irreducible component pathway to our point. And if you look at all the points in this component which correspond. This component which corresponds to Rascar, I mean, correspond to really classical automorphic representation. This set is dense inside of this component. That is the main theorem of this example that I wanted to explain to you. It's a very geometrical example. And in the proof, as you will see, the period integrals are very, very important. The integrals are very, very important. So, that from that, the title of this talk. Okay, so you will see in a few minutes how work the proof, and it's very interesting because it's a very geometrical and periodic statement, but you will see the connection between the period integrals and both interact and produce some results and give much, much more a donor consequence that I will give some words at the end. That I will give some words at the end about periodical functions. Okay, so one more observation: that this result also is valid if we work over totally real number fields. If we want to drop the level one assumption, we need to add more hypothesis on some hypothesis, for example, the Gala representation of pi. Okay, what about the aside situation? What about the ASI situation? So, in the ASI situation, we need to fix our representation. Here, I will, this is a work in progress, so I will be much less explicit. So, well, we fixed the situation is very similar, in fact. We fix a Caspi automorphic representation of this group here, G here, which remember that is not Gel to N. Remember that it's not GL2N, it's GLNAE. We suppose that it comes from some unitary group, and we suppose also it's homological. It's very similar to the other situations, as you see. Okay, so in this case, we also have this in the situation that the automotive representation below to different degrees of the cohomology and the top degree. And the top degree again is we can be very precise: is this one n times n plus one over two, and that minus one? That is the degree of the top degree of the cohomology which pi appear. And again, we will be we will concentrate ourselves in this degree of the cohomology and we kind of repeat the procedure, the process we performed before. So we consider the top degree. So, we consider the top degree again variety again. And in this case, observe that the automorphic representation needs to be conjugate self-dual. That imposes some condition on the weights. And there is some analog of the sum to be constant, as in the Shalaika case, which impose the condition that you have dimension n. You are in dimension n. I mean, you have n freedom to move the weights. I mean, so the dimension of the weight space that you care here is of dimension and okay, maybe we can work with essentially conjugates of that. Okay, I'm not sure. Okay, but in any case, it's dimension n, that's our situation. And as before, we consider a point of the eigenvariety. Of the eigenvariety, of this top-degree eigenvariety, attached to a pure refinement of the automorphic representation. We suppose that the purefinement give a point there. And the theorem, which is a theorem in progress, is very analog to the other one. So here we need to suppose some conditions. So the condition at P should be analog to the previous theorem. The previous theorem, some paid stuff that allows you to develop the method. And the non-vanishing condition, I will say some words in a few seconds. So we prove, we should be able to prove that the eigenvalue is etal at pi and the irreducible component containing our point should contain a lot of Sarisky dense. Yeah, a Zarinsky dense set of points corresponding to automorphic representation coming from unitary groups. So it's very similar to what we prove in the other situation. That is the theorem in this aside case that we are trying to, we are working now. Some words about the condition. So the non-vanishing condition comes from the work of Grobner, Harris, and Lapid. Yeah, this work is crucial for what we are doing. And the condition and P are, as I said before, analog to the other one. Okay, so these are the two theorems that I wanted to show you. Okay, that was my motivation to explain you, was to say these two theorems. So a prior. So, a priori, so you don't see very well the connection between periodic integrals and the main theorems. So, in this part of my talk, which is almost the last part because the periodical function is very short, it's one of the slide just, I will explain the proof of the theorems and how the connection between periodic integrals and piadic variation, and eigenvariators plays a role here. Around here, how this works. Okay, so firstly, I will just precise that I will explain the proof of the first theorem. And the statement is here. So we fix an automorphic representation and a pure refinement with the same properties as before. Then we need to prove etalness as Zarinski density of Rascar. density of rascals in the Euros local that is that we need to to do okay uh so if this i remember this is i recall that it's a chalaika situation i will just give the proof in the stalika situation okay just to be precise as i'm so the key tool in the proof of this is the evaluation maps on the over conversion cohomology which are kind of a piadic Which are kind of a periodic variation of these period integrals. And now you realize, I didn't explain it, but reading that, you realize that the connection between the two parts of my talk, maybe, I hope. Okay. So here, all this talk is Chalaika. So the title Chalaika is there just to recall the Chalaika. So the groups are GF2N and GLN cross GLN inside GL2N dio. These are the situation. Are the this is the situation, okay? So the first reduction of the proof is the following. So the eigenvariety is this E, which is the maximal spectrum of this Heke algebra acting in a piece of the overconvergent cohomology. Everything is top degree. The first proposition that we prove is the following. So if you call C, the connected component containing Python. Component containing pi tilde, this will be a maximal spectrum of some t is not will be a tu algebra, this t, okay? So what your goal is to prove it tallness, we need to describe t if we prove that t is nice, we prove it all this. That is the goal, okay. Um, observe that here is just the connected components, is it's not, I'm not saying. Is it's not, I'm not saying, I'm not taking any irreducible components, just the connected component, all the irreducible components that pass potentially through our points. We want to prove that this contains just one component, one irreducible component. That is our goal. And of course, we're going to prove the data. Okay, so we prove that there exists an ideal of this, the ring of prejudice function over u such that you can Such that you can describe these main objects appearing here in the following way. So the piece of our conversion cohomology attached to our connected components is very simple. It's a cyclic model of our OU. And then we deduce that the Hecke algebra of just this component, the part of the Heke algebra attached to this connected component. Attached to this connected component is of the same shape. Okay, that is the first part of the proposition, and here it's very important that we are working in top degree. Okay, we cannot prove it, could prove this if we are working in the bottom degree, for example. We have other consequences in bottom degree, but in top degree, we can prove this kind of cyclicness. Another important ingredient here are the small slope and the regularity of the period. Regularity of the pure refinements. Don't mix regular of the pure refinement or regular with the automorphic representation are two regular conditions. Because regular, you can, the multiplicity one and small slope, you can relate with the classic acomology. So you can prove this. Okay, so to prove, to finish the proof with this, given this proposition, we need to prove that the ideal is trivial. That if you see here. That if you see here, so the Heckel algebra attached to the connected component will be just OU. So that will prove it allness. And to prove the density of Rascar, given the first part of my talk, is essentially to prove non-vanishing of period integrals, which we will take care now. So to do this, we need some relation of period integral with cohomology. Integral with comology. Okay, so this is again we come back to the classical situation with no operation. We consider the following manifold. So you see it's almost the same that the kind of the same arithmetic manifold attached to H. The only difference is here, is in L infinity here. So L infinity. Here. So L infinity is the connected component of the identity of L infinity, which is K infinity intersection of H. So one important fact here is the center of G is here. Okay. And this difference between the arithmetic meaningful of H with this XH is the dimension that changed by one. And in fact, that is called a numerical coincidence. It's a numerical coincidence that the dimension is exactly the top degree of the cohomology, exactly the top degree of the cohomology. And that is very useful for define this to the description of the period integrals in terms of cohology. That was made by Grobner-Ragram, the work that I mentioned before. They construct some evaluation map on the cohomology, observe that this is the top-degree cohomology where a The top-degree cohomology where appear the automorphic representation. And the automorphic representation will give you a class here, and you take this evaluation map, and this class will be related with the period integral. And in fact, this evaluation map have more properties that I will mention in a few seconds. But before, just to explain the construction of this evaluation map, which is very important for us. Important for us. So there you need to use the cycle XH inside YK. Integrating along XH, you produce this evolution map. And at some point, you need to use branching laws, which is what is branching laws, is how you see H representation inside of algebraic representation of G. This is a very classical topic. Okay. Okay. So recall. Recall that so till now we have period integrals, now we have these evaluations on the cohomology by Grop Neuron Ragogram. And so what we are going to do is to construct this, so we construct in this work this big evaluation maps such that you have this U here. So you fill there the periodic variation of the evaluation map you have before. In fact, you have. In fact, you have much more, but for the purposes of this proof, it's enough to take one of these evaluation maps and to explain the idea. So, in fact, if you specialize this QS1 at lambda from some classical weight, you recover the other evaluation maps. And remember, the evaluation map is related with the period integral. So, you have a kind of a pi-adic variation of period integrals. That is kind of the title of this part. Kind of the title of this part, I want to mention. So, here, what is D Z P star OU? It's just the OU valued locally analytic distribution over Z P star. Okay, that is very interesting that this space exactly is the home of the ideal functions. So, that will give, I will give some words at, I will say some words at the end. Okay. Okay. To construct these big evolution maps, we need to use the cycle. Evolution maps: we need to use the cycles and we need to use some new stuff that we developed, are that we use is periodic families of branching laws. So, that is very interesting how to produce these periodic families of branching laws. It's part of this work with this year. You can see there is very interesting. We hope it's a new idea. Okay. Okay, so one of what some properties of the So, what are some properties of this FU? So, one property is just free from the construction, is OU linear. It's very from the construction is very simple, but it's crucial, you will see in a few seconds. Okay, so the non-vanishing of a view at some classical point implies the non-vanishing of period integrals. That is because the construction of Roger Ram is. Of Ragogram is related with period integrals. So we are putting in families this evolution for open ragrams. So that is the second point. And the last point is that I will not use here, but you will see at the end is this C critical values of automorphical functions, this evaluation map. That is come from the work of Grobner-Raugram. Okay, with this view, we can just finish the proof very quickly. Look, so to prove the talents, we need to remember that we need to. To prove the talent, we need to remember that we need to prove that the ideal i is zero. But consider the following diagram. So, this here is the evaluation map FU. This is the piece of the HU that we concern to us, which is attached to our connected component, what we care about, and this isomorphic to that. Okay, so finally, you get a map, an OU linear map from OU model O I to this model. This model, but this model is OU torture-free. And the non-ban, so now you remember the OU linear map, let me explain by order. This is crucial. So the non-management of FU around pi tilde. Why is true? Because you are taking regular automatic representation with the weight, there is a difference between the consecutive weight. So you can you have non-management of L values, but it's um. Values by some results, and you can this implies that this evaluation map is non-valued around your point, and you are done. You cannot have a non-zero map from a torsion model, from a non-torsion model. So I need to be zero. Finally, the density of Rascar is the non-vanishing, essentially. Okay, the non-vanishing or previous non-vanishing of non-vanishing of period integrals and that that is the proof that is the proof so as you see the evaluation maps this i i state here are crucial to to prove this geometrical consequence of the eigenvariety okay the proof in the in the other situation should be the same but we are it's work in progress okay in the aside case Case. I have the last part. This is very easy. So it's the application to periodical functions. I will finish with this. I have four minutes. So in one minute, I will finish. Okay. How we so as you see in the Shalaika situation, the evaluation maps give much more information that we needed to prove the tallness and the density of. The tallness and the density of points. As you see here, this evolution maps see the critical values of PID of complex L function. And this automorphic L function are the standard one. Okay? It's a standard L function attached to this RAS car. And also, if we come back a little, oh, maybe not. Oh, here, this is the home of periodical functions. So, as you see here, so we have this is a natural consequence of this method. Consequence of this method, we need to work a bit more and to prove to do our calculations. But I hope I give the idea that the one application in the Schalaika settings is the construction of periodical functions. So in fact, what we construct is an n plus two variable periodical function, which interpolates critical values of this standard function of the RASCAR, which vary in the eigenvariate. Okay, uh look at there is n plus two variables, yeah, because we win one more variable because the cyclotomic variation, okay, so that's we have a lot of evaluation maps, and and of course you can see here, in fact, here you have kind of the cyclotomic variation. So you have n plus one plus plus one is n plus two. That is the n plus two variable. And in the psych case, which is, as I said before, Which is, as I said before, it's a joint work with Bagley Lee and Chris Williams. The expectation is to prove against some kind of, to obtain a pi-adic analytic function, which will be n variables only here, which interpolate the residue of this ai complex cell function, where the automorphic representation pi vary in the eigenvariety. Okay, then that is all that I wanted to say, and thanks a lot. Wanted to say, and thanks a lot for the invitation. Thank you. Are there any questions or comments? All right, so if there are no questions, that's thanks. Question: Let's answer again.
