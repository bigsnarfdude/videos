Thanks, Urban. First of all, I'd like to thank the organizers of this beautiful workshop and a very nice topic and this very beautiful location. And I would also like to apologize to the organizers, Shaurya, Arpana and Shajit, that I couldn't make it due to some timing issues and bureaucratic issues on my end. No fault of yours. Hopefully, you'll forgive me and remember me in the next edition. Remember me in the next edition of this workshop again. So, my talk is based on some recently concluded work with my student Gaurav Katoch. This is the archive number 2303. A couple of months. And my older collaborator, Jiren, who's at Sun Yat-sen University in China. And this work actually, we started thinking about this in 2020, just after we concluded another work. After we concluded another work with a couple of other collaborators, Eliza Robinovici and Stefano Bolonisi in 2018, which was based on space-like singularities. In this work, we tackled time-like singularities, but the seeds of this project was sown when we were working in the older project. All of us have some common connection. G, Stefano, and myself, we were all postdocs at the RACA Institute in Jerusalem, where Eliezer was the group leader at that point. Eliezer was the group leader at that point. So it's kind of a continuation of the, you know, so it's a one project in the same team. So let me start with some introduction. Although this is a very August audience and I don't need to introduce this subject, but I felt obliged just in case anyone is there who is not familiar with these things. But I apologize for wasting time if people are already familiar with this. The way we understand With this, the way we understand the holography now, gravitational holography in particular, which is the duality between non-gravitational theory in D dimensions and gravitational theory in D plus N number of dimensions, is that the bulk geometry, gravity or bulk geometry is the representation of the boundary state quantum entanglement structure. So the quantum entanglement structure of the boundary state gets encoded into the bulk geometry. And this line of thought started with the work of UNT. Started with the work of Yuan Takanagi in 2006, who demonstrated that the Feynman Neumann entropy of a particular sub-region in the quantum field theory is dual to some kind of an area or its minimal area in the bulk. And then another element of this was multi-senior paper ER equals EPR, which makes, you know, it's very obvious that EPR, which is a quantum entanglement property, is dual to Einstein-Rosenbridge, which is the geometric or GR property. And then Ramstone can. And then Ramstonk actually made this into a slogan that spatial connectivity should be thought of as a representation of the quantum entanglement of the boundary, non-gravitational boundary state. And then Swingle, also another element came from studying tensor networks, which were representations of wave functions in many body systems. These tensor networks look often kind of discretization or tessellations of some kind of negative curved spacetime or anti-descenter spacetime. And it is it is spacetime. So, all these elements are pointing out towards this ultimate understanding of holography: is that the bulk geometry is a way of geometry, it represents the geometry of the Hilbert space or quantum entanglement. And a prototypical example, the post-to-child of this is, of course, the eternal ADS black hole. As Maldo Sena proposed, this is dual to the thermal field double state in the CFT. So, in the boundary, if you see the Penrose diagram, which is The boundary, if you see the Penrose diagram, which is offsided, you have the CF2 CFTs, which are in the Camoupeel double, which is an entangled state of the two CFTs. And this geometry, the eternal ADS geometry, is the dual representation of this entangling state. There are some papers I'm not going to quote because there's a lot of work done. I'm just going to put a few papers. So, this idea was further pushed, and we could actually recover the dynamics of gravity that is an. Dynamics of gravity, that is Einstein field equations from studying equations about the boundary state endanger, in particular endangered entropy, phoneme and entropy. There are some papers in this direction I pointed out, not an exhaustive list, but not only linearized Einstein equation, you can recover corrections to Einstein equation, but just by looking at the boundary state entanglement structure. So, entanglement knows about gravity, or in other words, gravity is a representation of quantum entanglement. The talk is about complexity. The talk is about complexity. I think from the title of the workshop, it is clear, abundantly clear, everybody knows about this, but still, I'm going to emphasize that the computational complexity of the CFT state, which is another measure of entanglement, different from fundamental entropy or something else. And this is sort of thought of as a dual to the spatial volume in bulk. And this comes from looking at this green segment, which I have in this mineral diagram, which is sometimes known as the Einstein-Rosen bridge. Einstein-Rosen bridge. If you look at the time evolution of this Einstein-Rosen bridge, as you go upwards in the diagram, it kind of lengthens, the length increases, or the volume increases. And in the CFT, you cannot find any other quantity other than computational complexity, which can mimic this behavior. So the natural dual of this ERB volume is this complexity C, which I have not defined yet. I'll maybe define and spend one or two minutes in defining this as well as I can. As well as I can. So, this is the only quantity, only candidate which is kind of dual to this growing feature of this ERB volume and this eternal 80s geometry. And from this, such can surmise that, okay, we must have another quantity in the C C F T which is not entanglement entropy, which is not some correlation function, but has to be completely new thing, which is the complexity, which captures this late time growth of the Einstein-Rosen bridge. And so there are a couple of equations. I'm going to come back to that later. But at this point, after introducing, let me just give the outline of what I'm going to talk about. First, I'll just give a popular kind of definition of computational quantum complexity. And then I'm going to talk about the elements of the dictionary which are related to this work, which is the complexity volume and complexity action conjectures. And then I'm going to talk about the work on cosmological singularities, which was done by Barbona. Singularities, which was done by Barbon and Rob Novichi, which led us in this direction. And I'll look at the CB versus CA results and try to summarize some of the universal features which we noted about cosmological singularities. These are space-like singularities. Once we are done with that, I'll switch our attention to time-like negative singularities and ADCFT. In particular, with the idea of testing something which is known as the GovStud criterion. This is our latest work, which was put out in March. Latest work, which was put out in March. In this direction, the first time, like negative singularity, I'll consider is something which is known as the negative mash watch ladius. And we'll see that complexity too. We can develop a criterion which can also detect some kind of naked singularities, which are either allowed in a UV complete theory of gravity or that they're disallowed. And we'll see how it fares against the Gupsa criteria. Then we'll look at another. Then we'll look at another time-like singularity, naked time-like singularity, which is known as the Kasner or time-like. I'm sorry, it is just not S ADS, it's just ADS. I'm sorry, this is typo here. So time-like Kasner ADS, this can be thought of as a weak rotation of the usual space-like Kasner ADS singularity, which we discussed in the paper with Stefano and Rafinovici. So, this is kind of an analytic width rotation of that geometry, but this time it has an That geometry, but this time it has a naked time-like singularity, and we would like to see what complexity has to inform us about singularity in particular. And finally, the most interesting case would be naked singularities, which arise in something which is known as the Einstein scalar theory in ADS. Now, the Einstein scalar theory is very frequently used as dual to condense matter systems in the ADS-CMT literature. And often, in such kind of bottom-up approach to. Often in such kind of bottom-up approach to holography, you end up having backgrounds which have naked singularities. And it's a natural question in such a setting to ask is that whether these naked singularities which are arising in this bottom-up model philography modeling can end matter system, can these be accommodated in truly UV complete theory, for example, string theory or something? And Goopstick criteria tells you, gives you a simple rule of thumb, which you can use to say yes or no. You can use to say yes and no, and we will see that we can formulate an analogous criteria using action complexity as well. Okay, and then finally, I'll conclude and give an outlook for the recent, you know, coming short-term future. Okay, so computation complexity, again, I apologize. Most of you are aware of this. Just for completeness, I included this slide. Computation complexity is not something that's natural to us as a quantum field theorist or quantum field theory people. Or, uh, you know, quantum field theory people do not consider this kind of quantities at all. This we have borrowed from the toolkit of computer science or information theory, and it's supposed to quantify the difficulty of performing some kind of a task. And the ingredients which you need to define this well is a system, a set of states, reference state, or some kind of origin, O, and a set of simple operations which you will know, which Which you will use to navigate between from the reference state to some other states. So, in addition, if we go to continuum systems, which I have not included here, and you need another additional ingredient, which is to say, which is called tolerance. That is, for discrete systems, you don't need this, but for continuum systems, you can only reach a target states to some accuracy. You cannot read the 100% accuracy. So, you need the tolerance as well. So, you need the tolerance as well, but I'm not including that for the time being. So, the complexity of a state A, a target state A, with respect to a reference state O is defined to be the minimum number of simple operations which you need to go from O to A. So, this minimum is important. Otherwise, it is completely ambiguous. So, the word minimum is important. Although you can point out there are many ambiguities in the descriptions definition because the reference state can be completely arbitrary, and the simple operations also can be. And the simple operations also can be arbitrary, but I will give some kind of justification of what we mean by these, especially in the quantum gravity framework, in the holographic duality framework. Reference states will be taken to be a state which is which has zero, which has no entanglement. Like, for example, if you're taking a series of bits, it could be a product state. For example, the wave function is just a product of the wave functions. So, that kind of states do not have entanglement. That would be ideal. Have entanglement that would be an ideal reference state for the discussion. And simple operations, also, we have some restrictions that cannot be completely arbitrary. For holographic equality, we will think about simple operations as something which is an operation which is involving only a few number of qubits at the few number of degrees of freedom, which involve a few number of degrees of freedom. For example, you can have nearest neighbor or something like two or k local operations. So these are also restricted. We cannot be completely arbitrary. These are also restricted. We cannot be completely arbitrary. Classically, of course, we don't need to think about this quantity because if you compute the complexity, for example, if you take n classical spin or eigen spins, then the maximum complexity scaled with n, the number of degrees of freedom or number of eigen spins, which is same as the maximum of entropy. So the level of complexity of the system, of a classical system, is well captured already by. Well, captured already by entropy, and you don't need to invoke this new definition. But the picture changes dramatically when you go to the quantum arena, in which case, what I've given is a generic state, the number of states in the system increase exponentially in the degree of freedom that I'm finding out now. I don't know if my cursor is visible, but two raised to the n. I'm assuming cube bits, so two raised to the n. The Hilbert space now is scaling it. Is not scaling it exponentially with a degrees of freedom. As the complexity also scales exponentially in the number of degrees of freedom, this alpha i, these coefficients, you have two raised to the n number of coefficients, which you can change the state with. So the complexity of this quantum system is exponentially increased. So things are not as boring as in classical physics and quantum mechanics. All right, so this is what you know intrigued Richard Feynman in the 1980s. Can I ask you a question, please? Yeah, yeah, please go ahead. So, you said that the reference state should be the one where there is no entanglement. So, I mean, no, in general, the reference state can be anything. But for our purposes, we will choose a physical state which has no entanglements, for example. That would be our reference state. But in general, there is no restriction. But from a physics point of view, from the holographic point of view, I would try to take a state which is a reference state. To take a state which is a reference state which has zero entanglement because I want complexity to categorize or quantify the amount of entanglement, so it's better that the reference state has no entanglement. All right, are there any other questions? I'm sure this is all familiar to everybody. So, how does complexity evolve with time? If we take a system, how does complexity evolve with time? This is a kind of Evolve with time. This is a kind of ideal behavior. What I have in this plot is kind of an expected behavior. It is not always, I mean, there's no proof of this. No one has done any experiment to show this or anything. It's just expected behavior. We expect a complexity. So let's say I introduce a perturbation in the system and the perturbation propagates throughout the system. In that kind of a system, how does complexity evolve with time? And the expectation is that it would increase with time. That it would increase with time, the quantum entanglement will spread throughout the system, so it grows. There's a growth part, and this growth will go on for a long time because, as I said, the maximal complexity is exponential in the number of degrees of freedom. And then you expect an exponential in the number of degrees of freedom time in which this complexity will saturate. And this is far larger than the time in which end entropy saturated, which is polynomial. And some powers are. And some powers of the number of degrees of freedom. So, for example, if you have charge or if you have energy, the time in which the energy will be partitioned or the charge will be spread throughout the system would scale polynomially in n, but entanglement, quantum entanglement, would keep on increasing till you reach a time which is exponential in the number of degrees of freedom. Once exponential complexity is reached, the system would spend a lot of time in this region of high complexity because you can show by Because you can show by just some, you know, some heuristic argument that majority of the states on the Hilbert space, majority of the vast majority of the states in the Hilbert space have high complexity and maximum, near maximum complexity. So the system spends a lot of time in this near maximum complexity region. And then when you come to a time which is double exponential in the number of degrees of freedom, which is the popular recurrence time, the system goes to a state which is arbitrarily close to its initial state, and at that point, the Initial state, then at that point the complexity might even decrease. So, this is the kind of expected behavior of complexity. But as I said, there is no demonstration of it from this part of the diagram, the growth part, at least I think you can prove in some cases. So the entropy saturation time, they said it's polynomial in n raised to some power of p. Complexity saturation is the potential time. So this initial growth slope, DC, DT. World slope, DCDT, also another object which has been looked at in the literature for many systems, is should be of the order of T times S. The reason you have the C times S is because S gives you the number of degrees, it's extensive in the number of degrees of freedom, since complexity, if you have a larger system, you must have the rate of change of complexity should be proportionately large. So you have something which is proportional to the degrees of freedom S. And this T put in for dimensional reason is. Um, put in for dimensional reason is actually something which sets the rate. It sets the rate. Okay, you cannot put anything else. Dimensional analysis tells you it has to be something which has the dimensions of energy and it has to be an intensive quantity because S is already an extensive quantity. So then the only choice left is S. So DCDT should be of the order of T times S. This is what we expect, another expectation. All right, now let's go back to holography because, okay, complexity is fine, but we want to connect it to holography. Fine, but we want to connect it to holography. So, as I said, Suskin realized that complexity is the only candidate for this Einstein-Roden bridge because there is no other physical quantity in the CFT which mimics this late time linear growth, especially after equilibrium. After equilibrium, if you look at local probes, such as correlation functions or even entanglement entropy that saturates, and there is no after equilibrium, there is no nothing which is linearly included. There is no nothing which is linearly increasing with time, but that would signal still out of equilibrium. And complexity is the only candidate. So he proposed this formula, which is known as complexity volume formula, because one side you have complexity of the CFT state, and on the other side, you have the volume of this Einstein-Rosen bridge. Instead, he generalized it that it's not just the Einstein-Rosen bridge, it's actually a maximum volume size. So you have this green line, which you can see in the Pine Rose diagram, which stretches from one boundary to the other boundary. Which stretches from one boundary to the other boundary. For reasons of convenience, I'm working with the eternal radius black hole, but this can be generalized. This is applicable to general one-sided geometries as well. The idea is that you have these two times. Now, given these two times, which are fixed, and the slice, which is anchored at these two points, the slice has to be the one which maximizes the spatial volume. So that's why sigma max, maximum volume slice, and divided by some dimensional factors from some factors which are actually motivated by. Factors which are actually motivated by dimensional analysis. G Newton should be there because it's an extensive quantity. So to get right powers of n squared using the holographic dictionary, it means that you have to put one over G Newton. And of course, then you still need a factor of length, which is a bit arbitrary, but it's supposed to be, this RC is supposed to be some characteristic length scale of the geometry. It's kind of ambiguous. For ADS, people work with the ADS radius. For flat space geometries, R, you can take to be the Schwarzschild length scale. So it has to. Length scale. So it has to be some characteristic length scale, not exactly well defined. So on the face of it, so you can ask, okay, complexity is a nice thing, but you can study the black hole interior, which other probes cannot. But it still doesn't seem like it is going to address anything, it is going to capture any feature of the singularity because this is a maximal volume slide and the volume crunches at the singularity. So it should stay as far away from the singularity as possible to become in order to become to be a maximal volume slide. Become to be a maximum volume slice. So, a priori or prima facie, there is no reason these two might be related. So, perhaps there are no relations, and I'm wasting my time studying complexity and the relationship between complexity and singularities. But soon after, Sotskin proposed another proposal regarding complexity, in which he said that the complexity of the boundary state can also be given by the Also, be given by the on-shell action over something called the Wheeler-DeWitt patch, as you can see. So, the Wheeler-DeWitt patch is the region within this pink rhombus. You can see and the singularity at the top, and then the spink quadrilateral. You can see the region inside there is something which is called the Wheeler-DeWitt patch. If you have the boundary times TL and TR, then this you can draw light cones. And this region is known as the Wheeler-DeWitt patch, most probably because it is a support. Most probably because it is a support for the relative bit wave function at these times T L and T R. And this is a very universal looking formula. You don't have any arbitrary factors of characteristic length or anything like that. So it's a very nice universal looking formula. And the qualitative difference, the striking difference with respect to volume complexity is that this wheeler divided patch actually touches the singularity. So it receives the contribution from the singularity directly. So it might be that, you know. Be that there is a chance that singularities can be coded in the complexity in the complexity itself. So as I said, this is a universal form, but there are some complications. You have to null boundary, these boundaries. You have to define new kind of surface terms, which were done by Liner et al. And Myers, one of the speakers in this conference, I guess. So this is now very well defined. So you have 10 minutes. Oh, I'm sorry. So, eternal black hole revisited. So, this wheel bit patch will get a finite contribution from the singularity. And indeed, it does know about a singularity. So, let me talk about cosmological singularities. Let me skip this because I'm out of time and this is a bit of an older project. Let me skip directly to the topic of time-like singularities. So, as I said, Singularities. So, as I said, time-like singularities arise a lot in the holographic literature, especially in the ADS-Condon matter systems, when you have bottom-up holographic models. So, such singularities actually result most often, because if you start from a 10-dimensional geometry, string theory geometry, and you take string length to zero, in which you just assume gravity, and then you compactify certain dimensions, you end up with such kind of singularity. You end up with such kind of singularities there, which are not there in the small background to begin with. I'm sorry, is there a question? No, no, go ahead. All right. So the idea is that such kind of time-like singularities might be resolved by lifting the theory to higher dimensions or eventually if we include springy states. And we have many examples of such kind of things in the literature. I'm not going to go in. So Gupster gave a sort of rule of thumb to tell which kind of negative singularities in this bottom. Which kind of negative singularities in this bottom-up holographic models can actually be resolved or cured by string theory? And what and the opposite case, in which those negative singularities cannot appear in a UV-complete theory like string theory, and those bottom-up holographic models are useless in some sense, they're pathological and should not be considered. So his idea is that those naked singularities which are obtained as extremal limits of some cloaked or horizon geometries with horizon, so in the zero temperature. Horizon. So, in the zero temperature limit, those kinds of if you have naked singularities, those kinds of naked singularities are allowed. Anything else which cannot be thought of as an extremal limit of a closed singularity, it cannot be allowed in this UV complete theory. This is what string theory gives you. And of course, this is not very well defined. It is an expanding list of items which go into this Gupta criteria, Gupta originally formulated in 2001, and then criteria. Formulated in 2001. And then Karitsis and others have keep on making additions to the list. You need to have this. That, for example, Guptsus started with the fact that the potential should be bounded from above and so on and so forth. There are many criteria, but this is the working criteria I will go ahead with, that those negative singularities, which are obtained as extremal limits of closed singularities, are allowed in string theory. They're allowed in the semi-classical limit. So, one more example. So, one more example is the negative mass watch radius. Of course, this manifestly violates the Gapser criteria. There is no closed geometry in which you can turn off temperature and then this becomes a negative time, a negative mass watch shield. We also know the pathological feature of the CFT. If you think of the correspondence between the ADM mass and the CFT energy, it tells you that the energy should be negative. So, if a CFT has this kind of negative energy states, it doesn't have a ground state. So, it is dual to pathological. Ground state, so it is dual to pathological theory if at all there exists a dual theory. So, um, we computed the action complexity of this uh object. As you can see, the pink region is the wheely-de-wit patch, and uh you get UV-different pieces coming from the near the boundary, and from the singularity, there's actually zero contribution, vanishing contribution from the singularity. Um, you get some dependence on the mass, which is, of course, accurately given by this kind of a dimensional analysis. Dimensional analysis divergent UV divergent species also show that the theory is dual, the dual theory is local, but the overall complexity is less than global ADS. So this we kind of take, this is the upshot of the entire work is that if you have a singularity singularity, and if you compute the action complexity of that, if you get an answer which is less than pure ADS, empty ADS, then you have a singularity which cannot be realized in string theory. be realized in string theory. Just like Goopser criteria, which tells you which can be, which cannot be cured in string theory, we have a criteria which is that if you have an action complexity which is less than MTADS, that singularity cannot be realized in a complete theory of gravity. So this is the criteria which we formulated. And then let's check this with something called time-like Casner ADS. This is the metric which was obtained by one of our collaborators. This is the metric, as you can see, you have a black ring function of See, you have a black ring function alpha, beta, gamma, the Casner exponents. But note that now you have the time, so that's why time like Casner, and the sum of these Casner exponents is one, and the sum of squares also one. Z naught is not the horizon, but the location of the singularity. Now we can compute the, so this is not obtained as again, extremal limit of a cloaked singularity, is not obtained that way. We just obtained it, we obtained it by doing a weak rotation. Obtained it by doing a weak rotation. So, this is not something looks at criteria. It tells you immediately that this is not allowed singularity in string theory. If this, so let's compute the complexity of this. We completed the action complexity, and you can see there's a contribution which is just like the pure ADS, the point for ADS contribution. And then the sub-leading contribution is actually negative in sign. So, again, it is negative and finite for all values of alpha. Remember, alpha can only between be lie between zero and one. Be lie between zero and one with the constraint of the sum of these are one as well. So actually, complexity is lower than empty corporate ideas. So again, Gookser criteria tells you it is not allowed. If you formulate a complexity criteria, which tells you, which is our criteria, which is that it cannot be have a value less than MTADS, then both of these are in sync and they tell you that, okay, this kind of singularity can never arise in the semi-classical limit of a UV-complete theory of gravity. Complete the area of gravity. So, finally, Arpan, how much time do I have? Three, four minutes. Okay. So, finally, I will look at this interesting system, which is known as the Einstein scalar system. Again, this is very common in ADS condensed matter literature. This is the kind of metric you have. Again, Fr is this function, this redshift factor. You can see this. Shift factor. You can see this coefficient delta here. That there's not this parameter delta here, which is very important. And this scalar field is also given by phi is a scalar field. So for delta less than one over squared of three, Goops' criteria is validated. You can show that A, either the V of phi, the potential, which I have not written here, it's a big expression, is bounded from above. And also, you can show that this geometry is not realized at the extremal limit of a finite temperature geometry. So we computed the So, we computed the action complexity for this, and this is the answer we have. Now, you can see here delta is, as usual, this exponent, and epsilon is actually an IR cutoff. So, epsilon is an IR cutoff. Now, you can see these two pieces will be there even when you have pure radius. And this is the extra term. Now, if C is positive and larger than pure radius for delta greater than 1 over G, it's very visible because. Than one over three, it's very visible because if delta is greater than one over three, this is the positive number and this goes to zero. So, um, this is you have pure radius piece plus something positive, so that is fine. But if you take this region, which is the forbidden region according to Gupser, then this is a negative number first. First thing to notice is this number is negative, third term. And this epsilon, because its exponent becomes a negative power, so it's IR divergent with a minus sign. So it's negative and infinite. With a minus sign. So it's negative and infinite. So this tells you that if delta is less than one third, one over square root of three, that is not an allowed kind of singularity in spring theory. That should not be. This is what complexity, action complexity tells you. So it's again, Lupster criteria and complexity criteria are in sync with each other. So maybe I will take one more minute to conclude. So time-like naked single solutions in general, generically, they can have complexity more or less than the MTAD. Complexity more or less than the MT ADS geometry. Now, we have proposed an action complexity test for singularities. Having action complexity less compared to MT ADS is not allowed in a USB-complete QG theory. We have seen for all three examples, this is in sync with Bookster criterion, which I story I didn't have time to mention. Volume complexity is not a reliable tool. The results are not as strong as action complexity. You get some concordance with action complex. Concordance with action complexity, but not entire agreement. And to affirm our conviction, to really declare this is as good a criteria as Groups of Criteria, we need to conduct a more comprehensive survey of other negatively time-like singular geometries. In the ADS condensed matter literature, it's full of such kind of geometry. So we should do a more broader study, perhaps, to reaffirm our claims. But for the time being, I would like to say that action complexity. I would like to say that action complexity gives you another criteria to detect singularities, naked singularities, which can or cannot arise in a UV-complete theory of gravity. And it's simpler than Guppswick criteria, because in Guppswick criteria, you have to first decide, answer the question, is there a finite temperature geometry close to singularity, which in which if we take an extremal limit, I will get back my original naked singularity or not? That process is not easy because you have to solve the supergravity equation for with the To solve the supergravity equation with some blackening function, which would give you this kind of a solution. So it's not a ready instant answer, but if you use the action complexity criteria, which we suggest, that answer should be immediately obvious because computing action complexity is just computing a bunch of integrals. That's all you need to do. No need to solve Einstein equation or anything. For example, in our previous project in which we worked with some little string theory in which we had a bulk, it took a while for people to find out what would be the final temperature geometry almost works. What would be the final temperature geometry almost two or three years? So, you know, it's not always easy to tell whether there is a finite temperature geometry, which in the zero temperature limit will give me back my original singular background. So COPSER criteria is not so straightforward to implement, but I'm hoping that the action complexity test for singularity will be much easier thing to easier diagnostic to detect allowable singularity versus non-allowable singularity. I would like to conclude here. Take questions. Take questions if there are any. I have a question. Anyone have any questions? Yes, I have a question from online. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. So I thought that all solutions with naked singularities are excluded by string theory. Is that not right? No, no, no, that is not right. I mean, so this is what Gupsura, if you notice, if you look at the What Guptsur, if you know this, if you look at the ADS CMT literature, where people don't usually start from the 10-dimensional background, but they have some effective low-energy bottom-up holography model, these kind of naked singularity in the parameter space, if you vary the parameters in those kind of theories, those kind of bottom-up models, it's very easy to obtain naked time-like singularities. And then the question was that why are we getting, we are doing string theory, holographic duality is the part of string theory, why are we getting these naked singularities? And then Guptze gave a criteria that, okay, these are allowed. That's okay, these are allowed in the semi-classical limit, and he also gave the region rationale why they arise. The rationale is that we are taking these kind of singular limits in which the stringy state is taken to zero, and then some compactification scale, you know, it also goes to zero. So when you take such kind of limits, you might expect some kind of singularities. This is the reason why, even in a UV complete theory, you might expect naked time-like singularities. But are these singularities artifacts of time-like? Is artifacts of taking the effect of field theory where you can't exactly right? So, from a bottom-up model, you are not going to be able to tell what is in the UB theory, will they survive or not? So, Gupster grave a criteria that, okay, if this naked singularity can be realized at the zero temperature limit of some cloaked singularity, then this singularity, naked singularity is allowed in the full UV complete string theory. Otherwise, it is not allowed. Theory, otherwise, it is not allowed, and you have to abandon that model, effective holography model. You have to abandon. This is some kind of just like you know, you have IA restrictions to UB completion, that kind of a you know, it's a it's a it's in that kind of a theme. What here we are proposing is even groups of criteria is not very easy to implement because you have to find a finite time, like a finite temperature geometry, which in zero temperature limit would reduce to your singular geometry. That it work itself is not very easy. Um, so maybe action complete. So, maybe action complexity is an alternative proposal criteria which you can implement quickly and determine. Okay, thanks. Did I answer a good question? Yes. Thanks. Any other questions? So, if not, we should thank you. Go ahead for the talk. Thank you. Should I answer? Should I answer? Yeah, and go to the next stop.
