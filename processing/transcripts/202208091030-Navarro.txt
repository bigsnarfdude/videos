Please go ahead. Thanks very much for the introduction, and thanks to all the organizers for the invitation. It's a pleasure to come here to present my talk. So today I'm going to talk about moduli spaces of compact RCD zero and structure. And if you feel like something isn't clear at any time, just feel free to open your microphone and interrupt me. I will try my best to answer your question. I will try my best to answer your question. So, first, I will start with a short introduction about the problem we're going to study. And I will start with the problem in the smooth case, then speak about the singular analog of the smooth case, which is going to be the R C D case, and finish this section with some main results. Then I will go through some preliminaries. So, first of all, I will introduce some topological results. Introduce some topological results on RCD0 and spaces and introduce some objects on them. I will then introduce the lift, the Albanese and Sulmap, which are going to be pretty important to describe how structures are going to split on the universal cover. And I will conclude this section with an example. So here we're going to study the interval direct product with S1 to see a bit what the objects are going to be equal to in this case of this particular example. In this case, of this particular example. So, then in the third part, I will try to prove some continuity statements. So, this is going to be the most technical part of the talk. And first, I will prove the continuity of the Albanese and Sol maps introduced in the preliminaries. And I will then show that the lift map is a homeomorphism. So, more details about that later. And I will conclude with some applications. So, we will first prove theorem one and then prove theorem two using the constant. Then proof theorem to using the continuity statements. So let me start by introducing a problem in the case of smooth Riemannian manifold. So in this case, first, we fix a closed manifold, so compact without boundaries. And the first question you can ask, which is a common question, is whether there exists any metric G smooth such that the rich curvature of this metric is non-negative. So this question has been studied a lot, and another question that you can ask when Another question that you can ask when the first question admits a positive answer is: What does the space of non-negatively curved metric on the manifold M look like? So, this is a bit vague, and the common way to answer this question is to study the topological properties of what is called the moduli space of non-negatively Ricci curved metric on M. So, more precisely, this moduli space is simply the set of all smooth metric with non-negative Ricci curvature cosi. Negative Richie curvature co-strainted by isometry. And to make this a topological space, we can handle this set with the topology of smooth convergence. So question one, as I said, has been studied extensively. So just to cite a few examples, in dimension two, using Gauss-Bonnet theorem and the surface classification, the only possibility for a manifold to admit non-negative Richie curvature are either S2, RP2, T2, or the Klein bottle K2. T2 or the Klein bottle K2. And in dimension 3, thanks to a result of Hamilton using Ricci flow, it's possible to show that such a manifold has to be diffeomorphic to a space form, hence classifying the three-dimensional closed manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature. And finally, in all dimensions, there are also topological obstructions such as Bonhemai's theorem and Boekner's formula, just to cite two examples. So, however, So, however, question one has been studied extensively, but question two has not been studied much in the case of non-negative Richie curvature. And here I'm just going to introduce a first result on their homotopy groups that's been proven by Tuschmann and Wiemiller in 2021. And here's the result: so we take a closed manifold M of dimension N that admits a non-negative Lichly curved metric and with a trivial And with a trivial fundamental group. Then we take a k-dimensional torus where k is different from 8, 9, and 10. And the result goes this way. The moduli space of non-negatively richy curved metrics on the direct product has non-trivial higher rational homotopy groups. So, this is one result we're going to try to extend to the RCD setting. And it's going to be interesting because, as we will see later, in dimension two, all moduli spaces are. Dimension two, all moduli spaces are going to be contractible. So, this goes into contrast with that, as it shows in a certain way to what extent these moduli spaces can have complicated topology. So, I'm now going to try to speak about the R C D case. So the singular analog of non negative Ricci curvature and dimension less than n, I think that was explained in yesterday's talk by Fabio Cavalletti, are R C D zero n spaces. Are RCD0 and spaces? So in this case, first I'm going to fix a compact topological space x and a dimension bound. So just a real number that is at least one. And the first definition we're going to use, so this is the most important definition here, is that given a distance d that is metrizing the topology of x and given a full support measure m, we say that the triple x dm is an R C D zero end structure. Is an RCD zero n structure on the topological space X if it satisfies the RCD0 n condition. So this is going to be the analogous of a smooth metric with non-negative Ricci curvature on a manifold of dimension n. And yeah, that's the singular analog. And then for the moduli space that we're going to study, here goes the definition. So the moduli space of R C D 0 and structures on the topological space x. Space X is the following quotient space. So I denote it M0N of X, and this is the set of all R C D 0 and structure on X quotiented by isomorphism of metric measure spaces. And the natural topology to use is the metric measure, the measure Gromov-Hausdorff topology on this space. So in a way, we've all defined things in an analysis. We've all defined things in an analogous way to the smooth setting. The main difference here is that this space is handled with kind of a weak topology, which is the measured Gromoff-Hausdorff topology, because there's no such thing as a smooth topology to handle this space with in this case. So even though the results are going to be similar, the techniques are going to be different in principle because of this particular point. So the two questions we're going to study in this talk are the following. So, first question, So, first question: Are there any RCD0 and structure under space X? And if so, what can we say about the topology of the associated moduli space of RCD0 and structure? Sorry, I have a question. I missed the definition of equivalence in the moduli spaces. Oh yeah, sure. So the equivalence that I'm taking here is that X D M is equivalent to X D plus M. equivalent to x, z prime, m prime, if and only if there exists an isometry between the matrix spaces such that the push forward of the first measure is the second measure. So such a map five is called an isomorphism of metric measure space, and this is the equivalence relation we take on this big set here. This big set here. Okay. Okay, thank you. So, the two results I want to talk about in these talks are the following. So, the first result, we proved it with Andrea Mondino in 2021, and it is some kind of a singular analog to Tuschmann's and Wimeler's results. And here it goes. So, given a dimension n bigger than one, and given a compact topological space, there at Compact topological space that admits an RCD zero and structure such that, so I'm going to say a bit more about this. This is some kind of a special condition, but we want the revised fundamental group to be zero. This is a bit different than having a trivial fundamental group, but I'm going to say a bit more about that later. And we also fix a k-dimensional torus with dimensions different from eight, nine, and ten. So in this case, what we can say is that the moduli space of says that the moduli space of RCD0 n plus k structure on the direct product has non-trivial higher rational homotopy groups. Then the second result I want to talk about, and as I said, it goes in contrast with the first result, is the following that I proved in 2022. So given a compact topological space, X, that admits an R C D 02 structure, the moduli space of R C D 02 structure on X Of RCD0 to structure on X is contractible. So I'm going to try to introduce some ideas to prove these results. So, first of all, first of all, I'm going to introduce some topological results that one can say about RCD zero and spaces. So, we fix a dimension bound n, and we fix again a compact topological space that admits an R C D zero and structure. Space that admits an RCD zero and structure. So these are always going to be the hypothesis we take all along the talk. A first result that I want to mention, and this is thanks to Mondino and Wei, is that such a space X admits a universal cover X tilde, and I'm going to denote P, the universal covering projection. And to this universal cover, the common object to associate is the deck transformation. And to draw the analogy with the fundamental group, we define Fundamental group, we define the revised fundamental group of X as this group of the transformation. So, an important remark here, and I think Guofeng Wei is going to say more about that later, is that a priori, this group is not isomorphic to the fundamental group. It's only a quotient of the fundamental group, and we would have an isomorphism if and only if the space X is semi-locally simply connected. Semi-locally simply connected. However, this has not been proven yet for RCD spaces. It is true for collapsed and non-collapsed street limit spaces, but for RCD, we don't know this yet. So that's why we denote it with a bar on top of it. It's supposed to be different. So now we know that such our space that is fixed admits an R C D structure. So I'm going to fix one. And another classical result is that it is possible to lift. Is that it is possible to lift this structure onto the universal cover such that the universal covering projection is a local isomorphism? So, this lifted structure is defined in a unique way such that we have a local isomorphism, and it is called the lift of the structure XDM. So, a nice property of this lift is that the revised fundamental group acts by isomorphism of metric measure spaces, which were the thing that Which were the thing that I defined just before the equivalence relation. Then, in the case of RCD zero and spaces, we have access to a splitting theorem that was proven by Jigli in the case of RCD spaces. And thanks to that, there exists a map, which is called a splitting map, going from the lifted structure on the universal cover onto a direct product. So the first term here is an RCD0. Here is an RCD0 n minus k space. I think Daniele presented the result. And it is compact with a trivial revised fundamental group. And Rk is always going to be handled with the Euclidean distance and the Lebesgue measure. So the important feature here is that the map phi is an isomorphism of metric measure spaces. So we fix such a map. And because the first factor here is compact, the isomorphism. compact the isomorphism group of the direct product has to split so the isomorphism of x bar d bar m bar plus r k is simply equal to the isomorphism of x bar d bar m bar cross the isomorphism of rk in particular thanks to this property if i fix an element in the revised fundamental group i mentioned before that such a transformation acts by isomorphism of metric measure space therefore Of metric measure space. Therefore, if I conjugate it with the splitting phi, I get an isomorphism of the direct product, and such an isomorphism splits. Therefore, I have two components, two components, a first one acting on X-bar, a first one acting on Rk, both by isomorphism. And I define the Euclidean homomorphism associated to the splitting phi as this map. So the R component of this conjugation. Of this conjugation. So, this map is going to be very important here. So, stop me if there's something you didn't really understand here. So, a first result that I want to explain is that given such a splitting phi and such an R C D structure on X, the kernel of the Euclidean homomorphism that I just introduced the page before is a finite subgroup of the revised fundamental group. Of the revised fundamental group. Second result, which is going to be very important later, is that the image of this Euclidean homomorphism is a crystallographic subgroup of the isometries of RK. Crystallographic means that it acts discretely and co-compactly on RK. So I'm going to sketch the proof of this result, which is quite short, so we'll get warm up. That's nice. So for the first points, note that if we have an element in the kernel, Note that if we have an element in the kernel of the Euclidean homomorphism, by definition, the component acting on R acts trivially. Therefore, the translate by eta of x bar plus zero is also x bar plus zero. So you can see that the kernel of the Euclidean homomorphism is a subset of the set of transformation in the revised fundamental group whose translate of x-bar plus translate of x bar cross zero intersects x bar cross zero but we know that pi one bar is the group of the transformation so it acts properly therefore such a set has to be finite because x bar cross zero is compact so the kernel has to be finite then we want to see why this group is a crystallographic subgroup of the isometries of RK so first I'm going to explain why it acts co-compactly so this is just uh yeah Yeah, oh, yes, thanks. So, just a quick question because it's relevant right here. How is this different from the Bieberbach theorem of Mondino and Wei? Is this just an extension of that? Which result do you mean? I mean this, the finite kernel under. Yeah, the final. This is commonly known for non-negative lichy curvature, and I'm not sure it was done for the RCD spaces, but this is just to sketch the proof. It's a standard result. I don't claim that I proved. Result: I don't claim that I proved that. Oh, no, I just was wondering if it's a but I think it's uh so you know you have this structure result for non-negative uh Ricci curvature on a compact manifold, and you have this Chiger-Grommol result which says that the universal cover is going to split with where you have a compact simply connected factor which is the sole and you have an RK factor. Then, like this proof is kind of standard in the case of. Kind of standard in the case of smooth Riemannian manifold and the proof is actually pretty much exactly the same for RCD spaces. So what do you mean by the first Bibobar theorem? It is that for me, the first Bibobar theorem says that if you have a crystallographic subgroup of the isometries of Rn, then it admits a finite index subgroup acting as translation. Yeah, so just whether that proof was different from what you're going to obtain in number two? Yes, I think it's a bit different. I think I'm going to explain why it's a crystallographic subgroup. And I think Bieber Bar's theorem explain what we can say about a crystallographic subgroup. So I'm going to use Bieberber's result later. Great, thanks. So let me just explain quickly what. So, let me just explain quickly why it acts co-compactly on Rk. So, here we know that X-bar plus RK is isomorphic to the universal cover. So, in particular, it projects onto the base space X. So, we have a projection here, but we can also project this onto the Rk factor and then project it onto the quotient. So, because everything behaves well, there is a well-defined map mu, such that we have a commutative diagram here, and every map is such a map. And every map is surjective. So μ has to be surjective, and it is continuous. So just using the fact that x is continuous, this space, that x is compact, I'm sorry, the image by a continuous map has to be compact. So the quotient is compact, which means gamma phi acts co-compactly. Then to show that it acts discreetly is like pretty much the same thing as for result number one. So I'm not going to do it. Result number one. So I'm not going to do it, but I'm happy to answer questions if you have questions about that. So, next result I want to talk about. So, I'm just going to come back a tiny bit. Here in the splitting, we have an integer k that appears. And a priority, this integer k is going to depend both on the splitting and also on the RCD structure that we fixed on x, which I called xdm. So, result number three says that this integral doesn't depend either on Integral doesn't depend either on the structure or the splitting map file. So it's a topological invariant of X. The second result I want to talk about is that given two RCD structures on X and given two splitting maps, phi 1 and Phi 2, the crystallographic group that we obtained have to be conjugated by an affine transformation. So first, result number three. So here I'm going to use Biba Ba's first. Here, I'm going to use Bieber Bauer's first theorem, which means that gamma phi admits a finite index subgroup acting by pure translation. So this means that gamma phi has polynomial growth of order k. Then we've seen that gamma phi is isomorphic to pi 1 bar quotiented by the kernel, and the kernel is finite. Therefore, pi 1 bar also has polynomial growth of order k. So this integral k, you can simply define it as a topological invariant. simply define it as a topological invariant of x and as the polynomial growth order of its revised fundamental group. Therefore, it cannot depend on the splitting and the R C D structure. Then for the reason number two, so number four actually, you can observe that we have an exact sequence here. So zero goes into the kernel of the Euclidean homomorphism, which is included in Is included in the revised fundamental group and which goes into the crystallographic group thanks to our Euclidean homomorphism. So the important point here is that this is crystallographic and this is finite. And there is a result of weaking, which says that in such condition, the kernel of phi i has to be the maximal finite normal subgroup of phi 1 bar of x. Of pi one bar of x. In particular, it is unique. It is characterized by this condition to be the maximal finite normal subgroup of pi one bar. This implies that because the kernel of phi 1 and the kernel of phi 2 have the same property, they have to be equal. And therefore, gamma phi 1, which is isomorphic to pi 1 bar divided by the first kernel, this is equal to pi 1 bar divided by the second kernel, is also isomorphic to gamma phi 2. So here we have So here we have two crystallographic subgroups of RK that are isomorphic, and the second theorem of Bibar tells us that they have to be conjugated by an affine transformation. So this concludes with the proof of this little result. And as a conclusion, if we fix a representant of, like we fix a splitting phi and an R C D structure X D M and I call gamma this gamma phi, we fix it for. This gamma phi, we fix it for now. And imagine I take another R C D zero and structure on X, which I call X D prime M prime for convenience, and we fix a splitting phi prime associated to this other R C D structure. Then to this splitting phi prime, I can associate the quotient Rk quotiented by gamma of phi prime. And thanks to result number two, this is a flat orbifold. And thanks to result number four. And thanks to result number four, it is a finely equivalent to Rk quotiented by gamma. In particular, to phi prime, the splitting and the R C D structure, the new one, we get a flat metric on Rk quotiented by gamma. Okay? So I'm going to use that to introduce three maps that we can associate to our topological space X. And the first one is the lift map. So give us So, given an R C D structure on X, actually its equivalence class, we associate the equivalence class of its lift. And this is going to be a quantity in the moduli space of equivariant structure on the universal cover. So, by this, I'm going to define what it is now. So, it's a tiny bit different as the previous one. So, this is the set of R C D structure on the universal cover, such that the revised fundamental group acts by RCD. Revised fundamental group acts by isomorphism. And we caution this space not only by isomorphism of metric measure space, but also by equivariant isomorphism of metric measure space. So I want that the isomorphism commutes with Deck transformation, basically. And the natural topology to end OD space with is the equivariant measure-Gromo-Hausdorff topology. So this has been introduced by Fukaya in the case of Ponti Measure. By Foucault, in the case of Pontian metric spaces handled with a group function, and it's not too hard to generalize this to the case of equivariant metric measure spaces. So that's for the lift map, which basically describes how we lift structure. Then goes the sole map. So given an R C D structure on X, X D prime M prime, I can take a splitting, phi prime, and this splitting has two factors. Has two factors, a compact factor, an RK factor. So the image by the Solmap is defined to be the compact factor. And this goes in the space of full support RCD spaces quotiented by isomorphism of metric measure space endowed with the measured Gromoff order of topology. So this is our Sun map describing how one of the factors splits. The other map is the Albanese map and it's going to describe how the second factor. map and is going to describe how the second factor splits and to our structure x d prime m prime we just associate the equivalence class of rk quotiented by gamma phi prime which as i said before is a flat orbifold metric on the quotient space rk divided by gamma so it goes in particular in the moduli space a flat metric on this orbifold endowed with the chlorofardo topology so that's for uh For the objects I wanted to define, and we can go through a first example to see how these objects behave. And the example I wanted to talk about was the case where X is the interval direct product with a circle and the dimension bound is 2. So in this case, if we fix XDM, an RCD02 structure on the direct product, we can, as before, fix the splitting. So we have the So, we have the universal covering projection here, the lift, the splitting. And the first question you can ask is: what is this integer k here? So, as we said before, this integer k has to be equal to the polynomial growth order of the revised fundamental group. Our space here is a topological manifold. So, in particular, the revised fundamental group is the same as the fundamental group, which is the group of integer Z. Which is the group of integers z, and it has polynomial growth of order one. So k here has to be equal to one. Therefore, the sole here is a compact RCD0, one space with trivial revised fundamental group. And thanks to a result of Cavelliti and Milmann, it has to take the form of an interval handled with Euclidean distance and a constant multiple of the Lebesgue measure, where r and a are just positive numbers. Positive numbers. So now you might start asking how does this z factor here of the revised fundamental group acts on this space, on both factor? And you can see that if it doesn't act trivially on this factor here, x-bar, which is the interval, because there are only two isometries of such a space, and because your base space is the quotient by the action, then you're gonna see that X has to be homeomorphic to a mobile band. Homeomorphic to a mobius band. However, it's not the case, it's a direct product. Therefore, the Z factor has to act trivially on the compact factor here of the splitting. Therefore, it only acts by translation on the R factor here, which means that there is a positive number B such that for every X bar T in the direct product, the generator of the integer, so one, acts by translation on the other. acts by translation on the R factor. So to x bar t, you get x bar t plus b. So this means that, for example, the Euclidean homomorphism that I defined before is simply the maps going from Z to the isometries of R generated by the translation by B. The sole homomorphism, which is the part acting on the compact factor, is trivial. And the crystallographic group that we get is BZ, acting by translation. Acting by translation. So, thanks to that and the definition of before, you see that the Albanese map sends this equivalence class to the orbifold structure on the torus, which is in this case is going to be R divided by Bz, which is the circle of perimeter B. And you see that the sole is the interval of length R handled with the Euclidean distance and this constant multiple of the Lebesgue mirror. So So here we have that X is simply the product of this space. And a nice thing to see here is that the R that we obtained in the sole here is simply the diameter of the sole. The A here that we obtain in the measure part is the mass of the sole divided by R and the B here that appear in the circle factor is the diameter of the Albanese map applied to Vanese map applied to our triple divided by two. So, in particular, we can express Xdm by means of diameter of Sol and mass of Sol and diameter of the Alpanese map. So, what we get here is we get a correspondence going from R3 to the moduli space of R C D 0 to structure on X, which to R, A, and B associates simply this product that we just saw before. And this map, it's easy to show that it is continuous. This map, it's easy to show that it is continuous and bjective. However, it's a bit harder to see why the inverse is continuous. And just because of these three formulas that I showed you here, if we manage to show that the soul and the Albanese map are continuous, you easily get that the inverse is continuous and then you get a homeomorphism. Therefore, up to proving the continuity of the Albanese and Sol map, you get that the moduli space of RCD02 structure and the interval Zero to structure and the interval direct product with the circle is simply R3. In particular, it's contractible, it's one of the examples that we're going to get later. So you can see why it's important to show this continuity statement. And now I'm going to start talking about these continuity statements. So I'm going to try to sketch the proof of some of these results. And the first one I want to talk about is that the lift map that I introduced before is Lift map that I introduced before is a homeomorphism. So, here you might notice that in the statement, I said it's a homeomorphism on pointed moduli spaces. This is simply because in the case when x tilde is not compact, you have to add this requirement, otherwise it's wrong. But in the case when the universal core is compact, you can cut off this pointed factor and it's going to be true as well. So, before sketching the proof of this result, I'm going to Sketching the proof of this result, I'm going to have to introduce a few definitions. So, the most important one, and I believe it was introduced by Sormani and Wei when they were studying universal cover of rich limit spaces. Not universal cover, covering spaces in general. They actually showed that such a rich limit space admits a universal cover. The main ingredient in their proof, I mean, the main object that they had to introduce is the following. So, if we have an So, if we have an RCD zero instruction X, so X D M, and a number delta positive, so this is going to be the important number here. Then there exists a unique covering space, which we call X delta, going on to X, with covering projection P delta, that is determined by the following condition. And the condition is that That I want the push forward of the fundamental group to be the subgroup of the fundamental group generated by loops of the form omega minus one composed with alpha composed with omega, where omega is simply a path starting from x, any path, and alpha is a loop contained in a pole of radius less than delta. So, this is the important notion here, here. The alpha here, you want it to be. The alpha that here you want it to be contained in a small ball. So, this universal covering space is unique, determined that way. And in particular, it has the nice property that balls of radius less than delta are evenly covered by the covering projection. Then, as before, because we have a covering projection, you can lift the RCDC random structure onto the covering space such that the covering projection is located. Such that the covering projection is a local isomorphism, and such that the group of deck transformations associated to this transformation acts by isomorphism of metric measure space. So, this is exactly the same thing as before for the universal cover. And I'm going to show dependence in XDM, I'm going to denote it this way. So, G delta of Xdm is the group of Dex transformation associated to such a P delta. Okay, so these are the only two objects the query. So, these are the only two objects that we're really going to need. And the question you might ask is: how is this x delta related to the universal cover x tilde? So, the important notion here is the notion of the systol of the R C D structure X D M. So, the C-stoll of the RCD structure is simply the minimum distance that you get in the fibers. So, more specifically, if d tilde is the lifted distance to the universal cover. Lifted distance to the universal cover, you want to take the infinimum of the distances between eta x tilde and x tilde, where x tilde is any point in the universal cover and eta is any transformation that is not trivial. So for example, if you look at the universal covering projection going from R to the direct product of the circle with radius A and circle of radius B, then you can see that in the fibers you have a picture like that, where some You have a picture like that, where some points have a small distance between them, and some points have a bigger distance between them. So the smaller distance is going to be B, because I asked it to be smaller than A, and the bigger distance is equal to A. And by definition, the systole in this case is simply going to be equal to the smaller distance B. So, how is X tilde related to X delta? So, here it goes, and this is a result that was proven. Goes, and this is a result that was proven by Somani and Wei in the case of rich limit spaces, and then Mondino and Wei in the case of RCD spaces. And the result says the following: Is that for any delta strictly smaller than the systole divided by two, then the lift to the universal cover has to be isomorphic as a metric measure space to the lift to the corresponding X delta. So this basically means that for any delta small enough, Any deltas small enough, the only thing that you're going to get with your X deltas are the universal cover. It is stationary. So now I'm going to sketch the proof of the result and I'm only going to show the continuity of P star because it would take too long to do the rest. So our maps go from two moduli spaces and both of these moduli spaces are militarizable. Therefore, I only have to consider sequences to show the result. Sequences to show the result. And here I assume that I have a sequence of pointed measure grommar-haused of structure on X converging to a limit, pointed measure structure on X. So the limit is X d infinity, M infinity, little X infinity. And this quantity is the pointed measure chroma force of distance. And I assume that this goes to zero. So what we need to show is that the equivariance pointed measured chromophores of distance between That would show that our map P star is continuous. So to do that, I'm introducing two quantities. So the first quantity is the systole of the universal cover of the limit divided by two. So you can see that it is exactly this quantity appearing here, but for the limit. And then I take delta to be delta infinity divided by delta delta delta To be delta infinity divided by 2. So here it's an arbitrary choice. I could have taken delta to be anything strictly smaller than delta infinity. And to continue, we're going to fix epsilon isometries, realizing the convergence of the sequence to the limit. So this is the epsilon n isometries. So an idea to show that we have equivalent convergence of the sequence to the limit would be to lift. To the limit would be to lift these epsilon isometries to get epsilon isometries on the lift of the limit. And the idea to do that comes from Somanian way. And the estimates of the lifts were computed by Reviron in her PhD thesis. And the idea, as I said, would be to lift the maps. But it's not trivial because the maps are not continuous. So how do you lift such a map? And the idea is the following. And the idea is the following. So you have our point xn in the base space of the sequence, and this point lifts to xn delta in the corresponding delta cover of the sequence. And now you take any points in the delta cover associated to the sequence, let's call it y delta. And our goal here is to define what is the image of this y delta. So, you want to define it, the image, by f and tilde, such that you have a commutative diagram here. So, how do you do that? You take a minimizing geodesic between x and delta and y delta, and you partition it with a big partition into omega 0, omega 1, omega 2, blah, blah, blah, until omega n, such that the distance of two consecutive points is strictly smaller than the parameter delta of the delta core. Of the delta cover. Then, once you have this partition, you can project it onto the sequence. So, I call the corresponding point omega i bar, starting from xn ending to y. And then we had fixed epsilon isometries fn. So I can send everything back to the limits. And we also get another partition, but this time I'm not looking at the little path, I'm just looking at the points. So we get a point. At the points, so we get a point z0 bar, which is the origin of the limit, z1 bar, z2 bar, etc., onto zn bar, which is by definition the image by fn of y. And what is nice is that because these points are at distance strictly less than delta plus epsilon, which is strictly less than delta infinity, balls of radius smaller than delta have to be evenly covered. Have to be evenly covered by the universal covering projection map. Therefore, if you have this origin in the universal cover, there's going to be a unique point projecting onto Z1 bar that we call Z1 that is at smallest distance to this origin. And then you can continue. You lift Z2 bar in a closed ball around Z1, etc., and you end up with some Zn that is close to Zn minus one. And this is how you define Fn. And this is how you define f n tilde of this starting point, y delta. And you have a few things to show, and you have to show that this doesn't depend on the choice of the minimizing geodesic. You also have to show that it doesn't depend on the partition. All of this is because we chose the parameter delta to be very small and small enough compared to the universal covering projection. So So, a result of so many and weight and reviron says that when n is large, we can assume this condition. Seems a bit random, but it's convenient for the computation. So when n is large, we have 5 epsilon n smaller than delta smaller than delta infinity minus 3 epsilon n divided by 2. The first result is that g delta of x d n m n is isomorphic to the pi 1 bar of x. To the pi one bar of x. So, this is the group of the transformation of the delta cover associated to the sequence, and the result says that it is isomorphic to the revised fundamental group. Second result says that the covariant pointed gromo-harstorf distance between the delta covers of the sequence endode with this G delta, the group of the transformation, and x tilde d infinity tilde endode with the revised fundamental group is smaller than a certain function of epsilon n, which goes to zero when n goes. Which goes to zero when n goes to infinity. So, this results, the map that you need to use to show that this distance is small are exactly the one I introduced before here. So, this gives you an idea of how we do it. Then you have to compute to estimate the distortion. So, in order to conclude, here you can notice that I have equivalent point in Glomof Hausdorff, but not equivariant point in measured Glomof Hausdorff. Measured from a Hausdorff. So you need to show a priority that the push forward of the measures converge in a good way. And then this here, a priority is not necessarily the universal cover. You need to show that it is. So you need to show that x delta handled with the lift of the measure is the universal cover. So I'm only going to do one. And to do one, you can observe that we have a triple of covering spaces. We have the universal cover over the sequence, we have the delta. Sequence, we have the delta cover, and because this is universal, you have another covering between the two of them here. Therefore, there is a well-defined canonical surjective morphism between the group of deck transformation on X and G delta. So, this just means that the deck transformation of P surjects onto deck transformation on Q. And the kernel of this map is trivial if and only. The kernel of this map is trivial if and only if the two spaces are isomorphic, asometric measure spaces in particular. So this is just thanks to the construction of this map. So however, what you can say is that because of the result number one of Sorman, Yenway, and Rivero, you have an isomorphism here. And I just constructed a surjective map here. Therefore, the composite. Here. Therefore, the composition of these two maps gives rise to a surjective map from the pi one bar onto itself. And a nice property of the pi one bar is that the quotient of itself by a finite group is crystallographic. In particular, it has to satisfy the HOF property. And what is the HOP property? It is that any surjective map from the group to itself has to be an isomorphism. So the pi1 bar has to satisfy this group property. In particular, the map phi here is an isomorphism, and therefore the map nu here has to be injective, which basically means that the universal cover is the delta cover on the sequence. And this concludes the things I wanted to talk about for this proof. So, minus the push forward of the measure converging to the measure, you get that the map P is the Get that the lift map is continuous. Then showing that the inverse is continuous is a bit more easy, but we won't have time for that. So then another result that we proved with Andrea is that the Albanese map and the Sul maps are continuous. And I'm happy to go back to the sketch of the proof of this result, but I But I think it might be more interesting to see how we get an application of this result to prove the main theorem. Because I think we only have 50 minutes for the token. I just have like six minutes, 30 left. So I think I prefer explaining the end than going over this proof. I'm happy to answer questions about how we prove this result later, if you feel like it. So I'm going to try. So, I'm going to try to get some applications now. And as we said before, the first application of these results are going to be theorem one, which we proved with Andrea in 2021. And just to state the result again, the result goes this way. So, we fix a compact topological space with trivial revised fundamental group and suppose that it admits an R C D 0 n structure where n is a dimension bound. Where n is a dimension bound that is at least one. We also fix a k-dimensional torus where k is different from eight, nine, and ten, where k is bigger than four. Then the moduli space of RCD0 n plus k structure on the direct product has non-trivial higher rational homotopy groups. So, more precisely, you might wonder what are these non-trivial groups. So, when k is equal to 4, the k here, what we can say is that Here, what we can say is that the third rational homotopy groups of this moduli space, RCD0 N plus K structure on X cross TK, is going to surject on the rational numbers. When K is strictly bigger than 4 and K is different from 8, 9, and 10, it is the pi 5 that is going to surjectant to Q. So this proof is going to be exactly the same pretty much than Tuschmann and Wiemer. Than Tuschmann and Wimeller, apart from some continuity statements, what is hard and different from them was to show that the Albanese map is continuous with the different topology that we have. So how do we do this proof? So first, because the pi 1 bar of X is trivial, the universal cover of the direct product is simply X direct product with Rk projecting onto the torus here. Then it is pretty straightforward to see, using the definition of the Albanese map, that the Albanese map is going to go from the moduli space of RCD0 n plus k structure on x cross TK onto the moduli space of flat metric on a certain orbifold. And this orbifold is going to be the k-dimensional torus here. And you can also show using the definition that this map admits the following section, which to a flat metric. To a flat metric on the torus associates the structure on x tk defined in the following way. So I take the torus handled with the Riemannian distance induced by G here and the Hausdorff measure and take the product with Xdm, where Xdm is a certain fixed RCD structure on X. So the good property that we're going to have is that if we compose A with S, we A with S, we simply get the identity on the moduli space of flat metric on the torus. And S, it's not too hard to show that it's continuous. So therefore, because this is a section, the rational homotopy groups of this big space here have to surject onto the rational homotopy group of this moduli space here. And to conclude, this is an observation of Tuschmann and Wiemer again. When k is equal to 4, the pi 3 of the moduli space of flat metric on T4, the this rational homotopy groups is isomorphic to Q. Same thing for pi 5 when K is strictly bigger than 4, and you get the result that way. So now, maybe to finish, I'm going to try to say a few words about the Going to try to say a few words about the second result, which says that when X is compact and admits an R C D 02 structure, then the moduli space of R C D 02 structure on X is contractible. So the first step of the proof is to determine what kind of space X has to be homeomorphic to. And there are only 10 possibilities here. And if X is compact and admits an RCD02 structure, then it has to be homeomorphic to one of the following spaces. Homeomorphic to one of the following spaces in this list. So either the singleton, or the interval, or the circle, or T2, the two-dimensional torus, or the Klein bottle, or the direct product of S1 and the interval, or the Mobius band, or S2 or RP2, or the closed disk. So this is the same. So, this is the same list that you would get in the smooth setting. What's surprising is that we get the same for RCD spaces. And how do you do that? So, we can fix an R C D zero to structure on X. And thanks to the constancy of the dimension, which was proven by Bruet and Semola in the case of R C D spaces, and which was explained later before this afternoon, is that there is a unique integral k called the essential dimension of X, such that Dimension of x such that the measure of the k regular set is positive. In particular, m is going to be absolutely continuous with respect to the Hausdorff measure corresponding to this integer k. So in case where this integer k, the essential dimension is zero, it is trivial that x is the singleton. Then when the dimension is one, it is a result of u and such that says that x has to be isomorphic to X has to be isomorphic to the interval or to the one-dimensional circle. Then, when the dimension is two, what we can do is fix a structure, lift it to the universal cover as we did before, and fix a splitting file. And you get a sol and a R factor. So, there are going to be three cases to consider. The K here could be equal to 0, 1, or 2. If it's equal to 2, If it's equal to two, it means that the dimension of the compact factor of the splitting is zero. Therefore, this compact factor is a singleton. And this implies that x is homeomorphic to x tilde quotiented by the pi one bar. And because the compact factor is trivial, this is the same as R2 quotiented by the gamma of phi. But because pi one bar acts freely, gamma of phi also have to act freely. Have to act freely. This means that the gamma phi is a B-bub-bar subgroup of isometries of Rk, of R2 in this case, and there are only two B-bub-bar subgroup of R2. The first one leading to the torus, R2 quotiented by Z2, the second one leading to the Klein bottle. So, yeah, here I just wrote the two groups. And the last, the second case is when k is equal to one. When k is equal to one. So this implies by a result of Cavalier and Milman mentioned before that x bar, d bar, m bar is an interval endod with your feed and distance and the constant of the Lebesgue measure. Then the compact, your homomorphism describing how the fundamental group acts on this compact part goes from the revised fundamental group onto the isomorphism of this metric measure space. But there's not much isomorphism. But there's not much isomorphism on this metric measure space. There's only the identity and the reflection with center R divided by 2. So this space has two elements, is isomorphic to Z over 2Z. And there are simply two cases to consider. Either the image is trivial. In this case, X has to be homeomorphic to the direct product of a circle and an interval. The other case is when the image is this full group, and in this case, you get the model. And in this case, you get the Mobius band. And finally, the last case to consider is when k is equal to zero. So in this case, it means that the universal cover X tilde is homeomorphic to X bar, which is compact. So this basically means that the pi one bar is finite. And sorry, so in this case, we have X D M, which is R. We have Xdm, which is RCD02, M absolutely continuous with respect to H2, and X compact. Therefore, thanks to the result of Ronda, M is a constant multiple of the two-dimensional Hausdorff measure. So this means that Xd handled with H2 is a non-collapsed RCD02 space. And there is the result of Litchak and Stadler, which means that this has to be an Alexandrov space of non-negative curvature and dimension 2. In particular, it is a topological surface. It is a topological surface, possibly with boundary. And there is only a limited amount of topological surfaces that are compact with a finite fundamental group. And this leads to S2, RP2, and D2. To conclude, you want to show that the moduli space is contractible. And the thing to do here is to compute this moduli space exactly to give some parameterization. Exactly to give some parametrization, some topological parametrization for each of the elements in the list. And I think I'm done, but just to say a last word, for the singleton, it is pretty trivial. For the case of the interval, it's thanks to a result of Cavali and Milman that we get it. Then, for the case of the so-called Klein bottle NT2, it is combining results of Betiel-Derzhinsky Picione. Derzinski Picchion results of Ronda and the result of Tuschmann and Wimüller that we get the results using the continuity of the Albanese and Sol map. That was the example we just studied before. We get it for the mobile band and the direct product of the circle with the interval. That's the example we studied before, which was homeomorphic to R3. And the hardest case are the cases of S2, RP2, and D bar2. And these ones. P2 and D bar2. And these ones, using results of Honda and Litchak Stadler, is enough to this space admits a retract onto moduli space of non-negatively curved metric on X in the cells of Alexandrov. So you have to study these spaces. And in the case of the sphere, it has been done by Belle Gradek, and it is related to some spaces of compact INR3, which are contractible. So the main work for me here was. Work for me here was to compute the moduli space of non-negatively rich, sorry, the non-negative Alexandre curvature on Rp2 and D2. But using some ideas of Belgrade, it is also possible to show that in this case the moduli space is contractible. You actually compute its homeomorphism type, related with some spaces of convex compacta, and then show that these guys are contractible. I'm happy to answer with. I'm happy to answer with two questions regarding this, but I think that's enough for the talk if you have any questions. Sorry, can I ask a question about this? So the interesting case, as you say, is this two-dimensional, really, simply connected case. So is it basically just like Is it basically just like Rishi flow? Is that at all to contract everything to a point here? Maybe for S2, I'm not sure about it. Yeah, there was a good remark. I was contacted by Tomar Richard, who thinks that it is possible to do it with Ricci flow because there is a well-defined notion of Ricci flow and two-dimensional alexandra spaces. And I tried to do it this way later, but I felt like there was a result that was missing. There was a result that was missing. We discussed this a bit with him and with Andrea and felt like there was still something missing to do it this way. So I did it like in a different way. So for S2, I'm going to write one thing here. For you want to parametrize the, sorry. You want to parametrize non-negative curvature on S2 and this result is already. And this result has already been proven by Berry Gradek. And for this, you can take the space of convex compactor in R3 with dimension 2, R3, Steiner point at the origin, and D, as I said, convex, compact. This space, you endo it with the Hausdorff distance on R3 and you quotient it by the order. And you quotient it by the orthogonal group. And if D is dimension 3, you send it onto the boundary metric, which gives you a non-negatively curved metric on S2. If it is two-dimensional, you just take the double. And it's possible to show that this map is a homeomorphism. And then it's easy to see that this is contractible. Right. And for the disk? And for the disk, the good idea is to. So if you have. Good idea is to. So, if you have a non-negatively curved metric on the disk, you can take the double. So, you get a non-negatively curved metric on the sphere. And you can show that there are, yeah, there are only three possibilities. Either the metric is going to look like you have a three-dimensional convex compactor that is symmetric. Convex compactor that is symmetric with respect to a certain vector alpha, and you take the half space, or you have the flat two-dimensional convex compactor, or you have the double that is symmetric with respect to a certain vector alpha, and you take only the part over this and under this, so half of the double somehow. Okay, there's another question. This is more relating to the equivalent classes. So you take the chromo-half-source topology on all the RCD structures, and then you identify by isomorphisms. These equivalent classes are induced by the homeomorphism group acting by push, pullback, and push-forward of measures, or it's Push forward of measures, or it's a bit more, it's bigger, it's just by taking all measurable functions. And I guess you're also fixing a populion X, yeah. So, here, because I fixed, I fixed X, it is simply a set at first. So, you look at the triple X D M where D is a distance and M is a full support measure, such that this is R C D 0 N. So, really, this can be seen as a subset of. is like a can be seen as a subset of the set of distances on x cross the measures on x if you want and then you caution this space by saying that x d1 m1 is equivalent to x d2 m2 if and only if there exists an isometry between xd1 and xd2. And x d2 such that the push forward of the measure, the number one, is the second measure. So, such a map phi here, because it's an isometry between the metric spaces, it has to be a homomorphism, if you want. But I'm not questioning. I don't know if that's what you were asking. Yeah, it's actually the you're just consuming all homeomorphisms, right? All homeomorphisms, right? You take any homeomorphism and then M2 and M2. So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You could write it as this space quotiented by homomorphism of X. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, yeah, you're right. Yeah, that was my question. Okay, and I have a second question related to the end. Maybe I got lost somewhere with the proof of the albanism map, but your result of classifying two labs. Your result of classifying two-dimensional Alexander space with P1 bar equals zero. Well, you use the continuity of the Albanese map. But could you consider the case where this group pi one bar is not trivial or it gets more complicated? Okay, so maybe to be to be more clear, some examples in the list had none. In the list had non-trivial revised fundamental group, which was isomorphic to Z, basically, and dimension two. So there were only two examples in this case. There was the Mobius band and the product of the circle with the interval. And in this case, I didn't prove it actually, I just said it. But that was one of the examples, this one, S1 plus I. And this one we saw. And this one we saw that if the Albanese and Sull map were continuous, then we had a parametrization of this moduli space, which would give R3. And it is pretty much the same for the modulus band. It is almost the same proof. You just use, you get a parametrization with R3 that is a one-to-one correspondence, and you want to show that it is continuous. And it is continuous because the quantities are going to depend on the diameter of the Albanese map, the mass of the... Of the Albanese map, the mass of the Albanese map, and such things. So, this is really just the continuity of the Albanese map and the Solmap. These were the harder cases, and they were harder because they had finite fundamental group. And therefore, it was not really interesting to see how the Albanese and Solmap behave for this space. So, for these ones, you have to use different techniques. Okay, thanks. Okay, so any other questions for Dimitri? Yes, actually. So first of all, thank you very much for your nice talk and hi to everyone there. I just wanted to make a little comment in regard to that what we did actually works. Actually, it works also when you replace the torus by any other flat manifold or maybe Morvifold, as long as you know something about the respective moduli spaces and homotopic groups. So if they are non-trivial, for instance, you could actually get rid of some more dimensional restrictions. If you especially look at flat orbifolds in dimension three, a form of Mentioned three, a former student of mine, Anna Carla Perez, she found three manifolds, flat ones, where the modular space, for instance, has non-trivial infinite pi one, something like a three-punctured sphere. And I think so in that sense, but everything we did basically works for any closed-fed manifold instead of the Taurus. So I suppose you can. So, I suppose you can generalize your results still a little bit. Okay. Thanks very much. Please welcome. Great. So, any more questions? Okay, if not, then let's thank Dimitri again.
