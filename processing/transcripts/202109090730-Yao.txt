Kind invitation. I'd love to participate in person in Oaxaca, but anyway, I'm also so glad to participate in this virtual conference. So today I will be discussing the uniqueness and non-uniqueness of steady states of the aggregation diffusion equation, which is a topic that has already appeared in Eduardo Manini's talk on Tuesday. So although I will be talking So, although I will be talking about a slightly different kernel and using different techniques. So, this is the joint work with Matthias Delgadino at Oxford and Shuka Yen at Oklahoma State University. So, let me first quickly introduce the equation, which already appeared in Eduardo's talk before. So, we consider this evolution equation here, where there is a density row, and so there are And so there are two opposite effects that are governing the evolution of Rho. The first term is a degenerate diffusion term. And throughout the talk, I'm going to assume that M is bigger than or equal to one. And the biological meaning is that, so we want rho to be modeling the population density of certain species. And the m bigger than one models the anti-overcrowding effect. And opposite to this effect, And opposite to this effect, so the species tends to aggregate, so which is a phenomenon called chemotexis that is commonly observed among certain species of bacteria and slime mold. So namely that the population density is experiencing an additional drift term, where the drift velocity is given by the gradient of W convolved with œÅ. So, which is a non-local term, it means that for any Term, it means that for any two particles, they are experiencing the velocity that are either pointing towards or away from each other. And so it depends on whether W is attractive or repulsive. So throughout the talk, I'm going to assume that W is an attractive interaction potential, which means that W is the radially symmetric function, and then it is increasing in the radial variable R. So the most So the most classical example is the Keller-Siegel equation, where W is the Newtonian potential in 2D. So it's allowed to have a singularity near the origin, but outside of the origin, we assume that W is smooth. And so for this equation, the whole family of equation, the global well-posedness versus the finite time blow-up criteria is well studied. Is well studied. So, namely, that, for example, for Newtonian potential, it's known that, so intuitively, we expect that, well, the bigger the power M is, if the solution is trying to blow up and form a delta function, then the nonlinear diffusion term would be having a stronger tendency to prevent the singularity to form if M is bigger. If m is bigger, right? And this can be rigorously proved that so for Newtonian potential, that there is this critical power 2 minus 2 over d, such that the m bigger than that will lead to the global existence with a uniformly bounded in time L infinity norm. But if m is less than that, then there could be a finite time blow up. So, this is the result for the Newtonian potential, but likewise that But likewise, that for whenever W is, we know how singular W is near the origin. So, whenever we know there is a certain power, then there will be a critical power m that depends on the power of W near the origin. So, when M is bigger than this critical coefficient, we say that this is the diffusion-dominated regime. So, let me mention that even though the well-posedness versus the blow-up criteria Versus the blow-up criteria is known. So, even in the case that the well-posedness is known, the long-time behavior of the solution still remains unclear in many cases. And this is the goal of our work. So, in the analysis of this equation, probably the most important tool is that this equation has the natural associated free energy functional right here. So we can see that it has two terms. So, we can see that it has two terms. Roughly speaking, the first term comes from the nonlinear diffusion term, whereas the second term comes from this non-local aggregation term. And so this is what the functional looks like if m is strictly bigger than one. And when m is exactly equal to one, the first term will converge to the integral of rho log rho. So, why is this functional important? Well, if we just formally take the time If we just formally take the time derivative along a solution, then a quick computation gives us that the time derivative of this functional is equal to negative of this integral right here, which means that this functional is always non-increasing along a solution. So it is a natural Lyabton functional. But it is actually more than a Lyabdon functional in the sense that Functional in the sense that whenever this functional has certain displacement convexity, so for example, that if W is being lambda semi-convex would be sufficient. So then in this case, the solution is actually a gradient flow of this functional, which means that at each moment, the solution is going down in the direction where this functional decrease the fast. Decrease the fastest. And whenever we are talking about gradient flows, we need to specify not only the functional, but also the metric space. And here, the metric space is the metric space of the probability densities indeed by the two Wascherstein distance. Okay, so this is the corresponding energy functional. And eventually, our goal is to understand the long time dynamics. And in order to do that, a key step is To do that, a key step is to identify the stationary solutions. So, towards this direction, we can ask ourselves the following questions. The first one is that let's say that we are given a mass. And by the way, mass is just the integral of rho, which is preserved during the evolution because of the divergence structure of the equation. So, let's say that for a given mass, do we know whether there exists a stationary solution? Whether there exists a stationary solution or not? And so, if the answer is yes, then we would further like to ask that: well, what are they? So, for example, are they necessarily radially symmetric? And if the answer is also yes, then we would like to further ask ourselves that, well, what about the uniqueness? Is it unique within the radially symmetric class? And if we are so lucky that the answer to all of these questions is yes. To all of these questions, is yes, it would mean that there exists a unique steady state up to a translation. And now we can finally ask ourselves the final question: Are they global attractors for the evolution equation? So for the first question of the existence of the stationary solutions, this question has been quite satisfactorily answered. So, namely, that the existence of So, the existence of stationary solution is usually done by looking for the global minimizer of that functional among the densities with the given mass. And so this can be done by a concentration compactness argument given by Leons. And so Leons did it for the Newtonian potential, although his argument can also be generalized to the power law kernels. So the result. So, the result is that as long as m is bigger than this critical number here, which is exactly this sharp power splitting the diffusion-dominated case where we have global existence versus the aggregation-dominated case where there can be blow-up. So, he showed that as long as we are in this diffusion-dominated case, there exists a global minimizer. And so, Pedrosian shows that. So, Bedrosian shows that, well, so for any attractive potential, for any potential, for any attractive potential, as long as M is bigger than two, there exists a global minimizer. And so, and as for M between one and two, more recently, Carrillo, Delgadino, and Patakini has given more precise criteria of the existence versus the non-existence. Versus the non-existence of the global minimizer. So these are the questions regarding the existence of steady state. And now let me briefly mention the question of whether they are symmetric or not. So first of all, that using the Ries rearrangement inequality, we almost get for free that the global minimizer of E must be radially decreasing, because if they are not, then we just Because if they are not, then we just simply rearrange it to, and then under the rearrangement, the rearrangement inequality says that the distribution function doesn't change, and therefore the entropy term stays constant, but the interaction energy is going to drop if it is not radially decreasing to begin with. So, this is the quick argument that shows that every global minimizer must be radially decreasing. Must be radially decreasing. But stationary solutions doesn't necessarily mean they are global minimizers, right? They could be local minimizers, or maybe they're simply just critical points of the energy functional. Nevertheless, we also give a positive answer to this question for all the stationary solutions. So together with Jose Carrillo, Sabine Hidmeier, and Bruno Volzone, we used continuous Deiner symmetrization. Used continuous Steiner symmetrization techniques to prove that all the steady states have to be radially decreasing up to a translation. And this is for all the attractive potentials that are no more singular than a Newtonian potential. So our idea is that assuming that there is a steady state that is not radially decreasing, we use the continuous Deiner symmetrization to make it a little bit more symmetric along a carefully constructed perturbation. And then we show that. Perturbation. And then we show that this energy functional is dropping to the first order under this perturbation, which would contradict with the fact that a steady state should be a critical point of the energy functional. So, and then later for more singular potential, Carillo, Hoffman, Maimini, and Vorzone also obtains the symmetry up to a translation for steady space for the Ries potentials. So, this is the symmetry. So, this is the symmetry question. And now, let me move on to the uniqueness question. So, we know that now, in order to get uniqueness, we only need for any attractive potential, we only need to focus on the class of radially symmetric steady state, right? But now the question is that, well, is there only one for a given mass, do we know whether there's only one radially symmetric steady state or can Symmetric steady state, or can there be multiple one of them? So, uniqueness was only known in the following cases. So, for Newtonian potentials in the diffusion-dominated regime, the results can date back to as early as Lieb and Yao, where they prove that for 3D for the Newtonian potential, because in that case, even though the equation itself is non-local. Equation itself is non-local. If one look at the mass variable, this can actually be reduced into a local ODE. And then we show that, well, the steady state is actually unique. And together with Ingwong Kim, we generalized it to the case where the potential is the Newtonian potential convolved with the radially decreasing potential. And Carrillo, Castorina, and Volzone covered the D equal to 2Ks because the Lee and Yao proof. Because the Lieben-Yao proof only works for D equal to 3 or higher. So, more recently, for Reese potentials, the uniqueness was also obtained for all the Reese potentials in the diffusion-dominated regime. So this was already reviewed in details in Eduardo's talk on Tuesday. So, let me just briefly mention these results. The first results deal with the 1D case, and then the later two deals with the 1. Decays and then the later two deals with the higher dimension. So, however, in all of these previous works, the exact structure of the power law structure plays an important role. And for the convex potential, it's also known that as long as W is the convex function, the steady state is unique, and this follows from the displacement convexity of the energy function. Of the energy functional. And this is proved by McKen. So, our goal is to show that, well, for just a general attractive potential, which means that W is just a radially increasing function without any additional convexity or power law structure. So, to the best of our knowledge, for these general attractive potentials, the only results was known in the special case. Was known in the special case where m is equal to 2 and w also needs to have some certain regularity near the origin. So, this was done first in the one-dimensional case by Berger, DiFrancesco, and Fernac, and then Kuype generalized it to the multi-dimensional case. So, in their proof, only the special power m equal to 2 was covered because they are using the special structure that when m is equal to 2, both the nonlinear diffusion term. Both the nonlinear diffusion term and the aggregation term, they are both the quadratic functions of rho, and then this exact balance plays an important role in their proof. So together with Matthias and Shikai, we settled this question for a general attractive potential. So namely, we show that the m equal to 2 special case that is appeared in the previous work is indeed the critical power. Is indeed the critical power here. So, as long as m is bigger than or equal to 2, and w is an attractive potential with this mild condition on its derivative. So, notice that when the, so w prime of being r to the minus d minus 1, this is like the case where w is like borderline integrable. So, basically, we just need w to be a little bit integrable for any delta bigger than zero. Zero. And as long as this w is locally integral, then we show that there is at most one steady state for any given mass. So basically, we show that the radial steady states are actually unique. So the idea of proof is based on the simple naive calculus idea that to make our life easier, let's say that assume that there is the rigorous gradient flow structure. Rigorous gradient flow structure. If not, it can be done, although the proof is a bit longer. So, if there is this rigorous gradient flow structure, then the steady states are critical points of this energy functional. So, what we are going to do is that suppose we have two different radiosteady states. We want to construct some interpolation curve connecting them such that the energy function of That the energy functional along this curve is strictly convex. And then, once this is done, it means that, well, so if the interpolation along these two points, if there is the curve that interpolation along these two points are convex, then they cannot both be critical points of this energy function. So this is, of course, a very naive idea, but the question is that, well, how do we construct such a Well, how do we construct such an interpolation curve and does it exist at all? So, one may be tempted to do linear interpolation, but it doesn't work because, in order to be convex along the linear interpolation, the Fourier transform of W needs to have a certain sign, which we do not want to assume that. And one may also be attempted to do two-wascherstein metric, but then convexity along this interpolation is equivalent. Along this interpolation is equivalent to W being convex itself, which is also another condition that we don't want to impose. So we just want to assume a general attractive interaction potential. Okay, so the main idea of our proof is the construction of a novel interpolation curve between two radially decreasing functions. So let me first explain it using step functions, and I will then move on to the definition for Then move on to the definition of such interpolation for general functions. So let's say that we have this row zero and row one, and both of them are step functions with mass one half and one half in each of the layer. And so for any t between zero and one, we want to construct this interpolation in the middle as follows. So if row zero and row one are step functions with two steps, then we want this middle guy here. And then we want this middle guy here to be also a step function with two steps, with also mass one half and one half, such that for each layer, we want the height of this layer to be linearly interpolating between the left and right. And notice that once we specify that the height is linearly interpolating, the width will have no choice because the mass of that layer is fixed at one half. So the width will have to like automatically adjust itself. To like automatically adjust itself during the interpolation. So, we want to point out that this is neither the linear interpolation nor the geodesics into Wascherstein metric or any Wascherstein metric. So, this is the definition for step functions, but one by passing the number of steps to infinity, we can also define it for general functions. So, namely that for any radially decreasing function rho here. Decreasing function rho here, we can define the so-called height function with respect to mass. It means that whenever we are given a mass s, that is a number between zero and one, so there will be a unique height such that the mass under this horizontal plane is exactly equal to that given number s. Okay, so the height function would be a function of mass and function of mass. And actually the function, the density rho can be uniquely recovered by the height function. Okay, so given rho, the height function is uniquely determined and then vice versa. And now our interpolation is defined as that. So let's say h0 and h1 are the height function for the two given density row 0 and rho1. So we let the height function. So we let the height function of this interpolating function t to be simply a linear interpolation between the two height functions h0 and h1. And so the density function then, rho t, is recovered from this height function h t, although the formula is quite involved when you try to write it in terms of rho zero and row one. So that's a definition of the So that's a definition of the interpolation. And why are we defining this? Because we are going to show that somehow for this interpolation, for so let's first look at the entropy functional. So a very explicit computation allows us to rewrite this entropy functional, not in terms of the density row, but in terms of its height function. And then if we want to check whether it is convex along this interpolation. Convex along this interpolation, taking two derivatives give us that, well, the second derivative is equal to this whole bunch of things here, where so the integral is always positive. So really, it depends on whether m is bigger than 2 or less than 2. So namely, that the entropy functional is convex along this interpolation if and only if m is bigger than or equal to 2. And then, as for the interaction energy, so we found it. So, we found it very surprising that it turns out that the interaction energy is strictly convex along the curve, and the condition that we need is exactly that W needs to be attractive, which means W is a radially increasing function of R, and no other conditions are needed. So, putting these two pieces together, we have the convexity results for bigger than or equal to two. So, that's least. To two. So that leads to the uniqueness. And so let me just end by commenting that: well, you may wonder whether this you clearly see how our proof fails for m less than two, because one is concave, one is convex. But is this just a limitation of our proof, or is there really non-uniqueness? So we were able to show that for any m between one and two, there indeed exists a smooth. There indeed exists a smooth attractive potential that has an infinite sequence of radially decreasing steady states, always the same mass. So, which means that combining this with the previous results, the uniqueness for m bigger than or equal to 2 is indeed sharp. So, our idea of the non-uniqueness proof is that, so we were using the fact that for so starting. For so, starting with any, let's say, increasing smooth potential W, so that it has this steady state rho S to begin with. So our approach is done by that we want to modify the tail of W such that the rho S itself remains a steady state, but then after modifying it, we want to show that there exists a new steady state. That there exists a new steady state. Okay, so let me just very quickly just give you a hand-waving explanation. So, first of all, we were crucially relying on the fact m bigger than one, because the steady states for m bigger than one are compact, which means that once we have this one steady state with support R, then as long as we are modifying the potential outside of support to R, this rho S will not feel it, so he will still. Will not feel it, so he will still happily stay as a steady state, right? And now, why do we modify the tail to be with the constant slope that is a very which the slope is much less than one? Because if we've completely set the slope to be flat outside a certain radius, then that potential is equal to an integrable potential up to an additive constant. And for integrable potentials, it's known. Potentials, it's known that m bigger than two and less than two serves as the threshold in the sense that if m is less than two, a very flat initial data will stay flatter and flatter for all the time. Okay, it's more energy favorable for a flat initial data to become even more flatter. So, we were taking advantage of this fact by setting the slope to be something that is tiny, but not exactly zero. On the one hand, we were still able to On the one hand, we were still able to show that a very flat initial data will remain flat for all time. But on the other hand, that as long as the slope is something bigger than zero outside the certain radius, it is still a linearly increasing slope, which means that the solutions will stay flat, but they are not allowed to completely escape to infinity because the energy functional is increasing linearly. So it's these two things put together will give us that. Will give us that, well, so as time goes to infinity, we are able to extract a sequence such that the solution converges to something that is much flatter than rho s, but they still cannot escape to infinity. So which means there has to be a new steady state that is much flatter than rho s. And then once we have one of them, we can iterate this procedure to modify the tails again and again to have an infinite fair. Again, to have an infinite family of them. So that is the uniqueness and non-uniqueness idea. And let me just end by commenting two open questions. The first one is that unfortunately for the linear diffusion case, both of our proofs fails. So we still don't know that whether for generic attractive potential, whether there's uniqueness or not. And the next question concerns. The next question concerns the dynamical behavior, because eventually we would like to address that. Well, if there is uniqueness, is it a global attractor? But there is still some essential difficulty to get there because we need to show that the mass cannot escape to infinity to be able to run a compactness argument. And so we don't know how to do that. So it seems to me that's the most advanced progress in this direction. Advanced progress in this direction is done by Ri Wen Shu, where he shows that for large M, the diffusion power M, if M is sufficiently large, then the solution indeed converge to the unique steady states in 1D and 2D. Okay, that's all I want to talk about. Sorry for going over time and thank you for your attention. I am, this is like two pictures that I took in Oaxaca when I visited it 10 years ago. I hope I'll be able to visit it again. I hope I'll be able to visit it again in person sometime in the future. Thank you. Thank you, Yao. For the very nice talk. So is there any question? I have just one question. Hi, Yao. How are you doing? Oh, hey, Bruno. Good to see you. Good to see you. Yes, me too. It's just a question related to the uniqueness of the first part of your talk. So, as far as I see, it strictly depends on the sign of the second derivative of the entropy, right? Along the flow? Right, yes. So, do you think that this can be generalized also for more general entropies, like not just for pure power? Uh, for uh, for pure pure power entropy, like route to the M? Uh, yeah, that's a good point. Um, so yeah, it is sufficient that the second derivative of the entropy is non-negative, right? Uh, right. Yeah, I think we have tried to do that computation, and I vaguely remember that for um fractional diffusion, it's also um Also, have the certain convexity. Actually, I think in that case, the fractional diffusion should have the same concavity, just the same like the linear diffusion. That we have checked. I don't know whether you have any other type of diffusion in mind. Yeah.
