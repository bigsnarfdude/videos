And so we have two papers on those topics. And this is the second that I am going to report on. And the first one, I expect that Sam will say something about it. Okay, so let's start about recalling a couple of things about MG bar. So you look at the modelized case of curves. At the moduli space of curves, and if you look at its boundary divisor, which splits into a union of irreducible divisors, and this corresponds to curves that are irreducible and they are degenerations, and for delta I, these are the curves which are reducible to components of general i respectively g minus i and for their degeneration. And all their generations. And you have also the canonical divisor of MGBAR. And this is a famous calculation due to Harrison Mumford. This is equal to 13 times the Hoch class minus 2 times delta 0 minus 3 times delta 1 minus dot dot dot 2 times delta G O 2. And there is this very And there is this very famous question whether this class is positive or negative, or what is the Codara dimension of energy. And so this is a question about the positivity of this class. Well, this is a difficult question. The class doesn't look particularly positive. It has a lot of negativity in it. Lambda, of course, is positive, but the boundary is there. And the way Mumford approached this problem, and then this way. Approach this problem, and then this was really then extended to lots of other moduli spaces, was to construct a section by algebraic geometry. Construct an effective divisor D on Mg, bar, and then you write its class as uh a combination of the generators of the Picard group of M G, so this is A lambda minus the sum of B i delta I. Of Bi delta I. So you have something like this, such that, so okay, so that you have the slope invariance of M G, of D. So this is S D, the slope. This is per definition the ratio of the Hodge class by the smallest boundary. So now, if this, yeah, so basically I just want to say this: empty bar is of general type for a given genus, if and only if. If and only if there exists D in Mg bar such that effective divisor such that the slope of D is less than the slope of the canonical, which is 13 halves. So this, that's some, I don't, I have to say more about this, but this is something, a question that, you know, you reduce this problem of constructing a section of the canonical divisor to a question of constructing effective divisors having this. Constructing effective divisors having this slope. And I just want to say: so, if you have such a D, yes, then of course you can write your canonical divisor as a positive combination of lambda plus this D that you found plus some other boundary stuff here, which is boundary. Yeah, so this is, and the point is, alpha and beta in this square are positive, and you use. And you use the fact, so this is definitely effective. And lambda, you have to know something about it. This is almost ample, so this is actually a big class. So it can be written as ample plus effective. So the whole thing is very effective. It's big. So it has the maximum number of sections and therefore MG is of general type. Should I say more about this, please? Yeah, should I say more about this, please? It's a strategy, essentially. It uses a lot of facts about the geometry of mg-bar, but as I say, it's a well-known thing, and it's a well-known strategy to prove that moduli spaces are general type, and it has been used for moduli of Barrietties, for moduli-sophere varieties, modulus key-free surfaces, and all their pointed versions. So, then, people, the question, of course, is how do you The question, of course, is how do you construct these devices? And so the classical answer is, so for me, classical is not quite so classical as Eric's, but let's say, you know, 80s, 1980s, not 1880s. So it's real neutral devices, yeah. So real and Uto were active in the 1880s, yeah? In the 1880s, yeah? But I am talking about the Harris and Eisenberg Harris Mumford. So the answer is how to construct D, and one is brilliant to divisors. And well, so if you were there at Isabel Stock, hopefully, and so if you don't remember the Bremen number, then you cannot meet out. So, right, I will just say that taking off where she left is that you take you look at the locus of curves which have a certain linear system. So you fix integers D and R, and you look at this locus. So this is the locus of curves of G and G, which C has a linear system GRD. Right? So this is what we So, this is what we heard about. And so, if this number is the Brill-Newton number is negative one, so I recall this, this is g minus r plus one times g minus v plus r. If this is negative one, so then, of course, on the related theorem, you know that this will be a proper sub-variety of mg. The general curve will not have such a linear system, but and then you would expect naively that the locus of curves having such a linear system is called. Of having such a linear system with codimension one. And all these expectations are in fact hard theorems. But they have been proven by Eisenberg and Harris. So in this case, MGRD is in fact an irreducible divisor. This is by no means trivial. And Eisenberg says one of the big successes of the theory of limit linear series was that they were able to compute the class of this divisor and the closure of infar and the slope of this. energy bar and the slope of this divisor is this number 6 plus 12 over g plus 1 so I gave you this definition rather quickly and in fact always it turns out that you it's enough to look at the ratio of the lambda versus delta 0 so you can ignore actually the other coefficients well for the purpose of this talk so this is a quite remarkable result because it does not Because it does not depend on R and D. So all these devices are proportional. And well, you can now compare this number to 6 plus 12 to 13 over 2. So this is not so difficult. And you see that, so when is this, the slope of this, less than the slope of the canonical? This is precisely when G is. Precisely when G is greater than equal to 24. And this is this theorem that in this range mg bar is of general type. And this is one of the really major theorems in algebraic geometry, say, in the last 50 years, I think, without a doubt, due to Harris-Manford-Isenberg. So, this is my five-minute summary of your work. So, any questions about this? Those are two different papers, right? That Harrison provides, but no, three. Okay, but what was the. Can you say something about what does what? Because uh. Yeah, so um I can say something. Do you want to say something? Yeah, I can say. But so, anyway, so okay. But so anyway, so okay, so first Harry Seman would be the odd genus case with admissible covers. And so for admissible covers, you have to solve this equation for R equals one. Yeah, but this implies that G has to be an odd number. Okay. And then Harris had a second paper, still with food spaces, to take care of the even genus case, looking at covers with some ramification, but he got it for G c 40 or something. It's a very difficult paper. And then there was the development of the theory of limitation. Was the development of the theory of limitlining a series, which came a bit later, and then they solved all the cases. And of those of you who pay attention, then you will say, okay, but maybe this equation doesn't have always a solution, yeah? So this will be particularly the case when g plus 1 is a prime number. Then you cannot solve this equation. And then you have to use other devices. And these are dispetri devices and so on. And so this is also the reason for breaking the alphabetical order. So this is my. So, this is my choice of presenting. Other questions? Is it increasing or decreasing? You want to sidetrack me, huh? I won't take you seriously anymore. Does that depend on the compactification? So, the compactification is the minimum compactification. So, of course, the state. There is also a very difficult stuff here, but you know, I should, I'm sleeping this under the ramp. So, I already mentioned this is something that does not. Mention this is something that does not make sense for the step. It makes sense for the coarse moduli space. And you have to study the singularities of the coarse moduli space and you have to show that they are kind of ideally canonical or almost canonical or impose no junction conditions and this is very difficult, but this has been carried out in this paper. All right. So 6 plus 12 over g plus 1. So this number also appears This number also appears as a very prominent appearance in the world of K3 surfaces. And so I'm going to do a calculation for you. So there's a connection to K3 surfaces. To K3s. So you start with the K3 surface. And let's assume that it's a general K-3 surface. Assume that it's a general GF surface. So the Picard group of this is generated of rank one generated by Kerroginus G. So C squared is 2G minus 2. So then you have now, so I have, okay, so I have now, I take a Left School pencil on this KT surface. So this is a Left Shot pencil. Yeah? So this Left Shades. So I mean, you know, I have a G-dimensional space of Have a G-dimensional space of curves on this on this KP surface. So here is, right, so, okay, this is the K3 surface, and here is C lambda, a La Schaecher span. I move. I take a P1 in this linear system, yeah? And there will be only inadequate of. There will be only irreducible curves in this pencil, and you can now compute the slope of this pencil. So, this induces this curve, so this I can view this as a curve inside NG bar. So, it's a rational curve in Ng bar, and I compute the parameters of this pencil, and I look at the intersection at the ratio of the boundaries of how many singular fibers are in this pencil compared to the intersection with the Host class. Intersection with the Host class. This is an eminently doable calculation. And you turn out to get exactly C territus. And this is saying something quite remarkable. It says, if I put together this calculation that Eisenberg and Harris did, and which had actually no connection to K-free surfaces, I say that. Surfaces, I say that this intersection of this pencil with all the bunito divisors is zero. And that means that this pencil, what does it mean that I take a divisor and I take a pencil, a curve intersects at zero? Well, it means that the intersection is either disjoint or it's inside there, entirely. And what happens generically is that, in fact, it's the That in fact it's disjoint, and this is a connection with another famous theorem of Lazarus Hill, which says that if I take a curve on a general surface like this, it will satisfy the WNET theorem. That curve will satisfy the B-Neuter theorem. So there is a connection to Lazarus' theorem. So think of Lazarusfeld's theorem that such a That such a C is real neutral general. Can you say again why is the intersection zero? Excuse me? Can you say again why is the intersection zero? I guess that. Well, so there is this calculation. This is an enormous amount of work, yeah? So I'm kind of, you have this class. And this is a much simpler calculation. Essentially, you just do the lab, you know, you have a vibration. You have a vibration over a curve, and you get this number. So you observe this. And then. My question was the vehicle side. My question is probably more elementary than the biggest side. What is the question? How do we observe the vertex? How do you observe it? Because it's the same number. It's a linear relation. It's a linear relation. Exactly. It's a slope. I have a vector space of dimension 2. dimension 2. So I have yes. So basically what I'm saying is that this F G R D is basically up to a constant. It's 6 plus 12 or G plus 1 lambda minus delta. Ignore the constant. And I intersect this now with this class and I get zero because it's the same slope. So this I kind of simplify because there are the coefficients here. I think this is about the question. I think this is about the question. So it's just linear algebra. So essentially, the point is that it's the same number. And this is not a miracle because independently Lazarus have proved this, that every curve in this linear system will be linear to general. Okay. Other questions? How hard is it to show that Gamba is not contained in the Gola Gilopus? Not half. Have even nothing. It's his theory. I'm going to tell him you said that. It's recorded then. Yeah, it's recorded. It's no, it's his theorem. It's a quite remarkable theorem. It's pretty much the only class of smooth curves, curves on the PLB surface, that satisfy this theorem, that I bring you to general. Constructing a breed. General. Constructing a pre-neutral curve is extremely difficult, a concrete one. So, all these proofs, and there are many variations, they are kind of by degeneration. And here, he's giving you one, a smooth one. It's quite remarkable. Okay. Fine. So, right, so okay, other questions. So, we got to the six plus turbo G plus one. So, yes, so then there was a question: can you do better than Bruneuter? So, this is like Better than Bruneuta, so this is let's record this question. Can one construct B D on mg bar with slope less than 6 plus 12 or g plus 1. And the answer is yes, you can do such a thing, and the constructions are complicated. There are no simple constructions, but there are, yes, is the answer. And I don't want to go through the history of this, but I will just say one theorem here. And this is in the first paper with Jensen and Pain, that both M22 and M23 are of Jensen type. And this is done by By it's a very long story, but you know, at the end of the day, you have to construct this, which beat this inequality. And in fact, you have even less than 13 over halves, 13 halves. So there are such things. But this is not what I want to say. So there are many counterexamples, actually. I mean, many. I'm aware of two infinite series of counterexamples. And they are complicated. They are typically syzygetic. They are consist of curves which Consist of curves which violate some CCG property. And I don't intend to explain how these are constructed. So what are these counter examples to? What? You said counter examples what? Well, so to disconnecture that you cannot do this. So there are examples, if you want, of devices that have a slow plus and C plus 1. So it is not true that okay, so I know anyways. So I will just say something which will look out of the blue right now. I'll try to explain it then. So it's a rather amazing fact that all these examples verify the Verify the following inequality. S of B is less than 6 plus 12 over G plus 1, but it's bigger than 6 plus 10 over G. So, what is 6 plus 10 over G? So, of course, this inequality will work only if G is at least Only if g is at least 10 or something like this, yeah? Should be 11 because otherwise. Okay, so I have to give you an interpretation. So I gave you an interpretation of 6 plus 10 over g plus 1 is simply the pencil of curves on a smooth, you know, a pencil, a general pencil on a K3 surface. So what is 6 plus 10 over G? So I start, so what is the geometric relevance of 6 plus 10 over G? Of 6 plus 10 over G. So actually, it's obtained from the 6 plus 10 over G plus 1 by a simple operation. Namely, you start with a K3 surface which is of genus G minus 1. Okay? And you look at this K3 surface, and now I look at the Left School's pencil. A Lefschetz pencil. This is a pencil of curse of genus G minus 1. Okay, something like this. And well, such a pencil will have two G minus two base points. And I take two of them. I single out two of them. This is one and this is the other. And what I can do, I can create, so this is a pencil of curves of genus G minus one. And I can have here X and Y. I single out two base points. And I identify this curve at these two base points. And I will get. points. And I will get a curve like this. So this is C lambda, where I identify X and Y. And now this is lambda is in P1. So I get the pencil, I call it maybe lambda prime. This is in the boundary divisor and delta 0, but this is in mg. So I increase the genus by 1. Yes? So I do the same thing as before, but for g minus 1, and I identify. And I identify at two points. I get the pencil in, it's not gonna be, it's gonna be a pencil of singular curves, but it's in the boundary divisor delta zero. And let's compute the same numbers as before. And well, this is very easy intersection theory on MG. Well, if you have solved that problem. And I would like to say that this is the slope that you get: 6 plus 10 over G. plus 10 over g. So lambda prime intersection delta if I yeah so this is on mg is in fact six plus ten equal g so do you see why? So of course the g plus one in the denominator becomes a g because I start with genus g, you know, with cursor genus g minus one. And I would have here what I had something like 6g plus 18. So g goes to g minus 1, so I get 6g. G goes to g minus 1, so I get 6g plus 12. And from this, I have to subtract 2. So why do you have to subtract 2? Because when you compute the intersection number, you have to, to intersection with the delta 0, you have to subtract the normal bundle corresponding to the two mark points. And these are two psi classes that appear several times in this conference already. And they are both of degree negative 1. So you subtract from the 6g plus 10, you get 6g plus 10. This is the answer. And this is The answer. And this is a really a remarkable inequality that you know these the slopes of these devices are rational functions of quotients of polynomials degree 11 and 10. So it's rather remarkable that you have this inequality. And this I observed a while ago. So in fact, there's this question, whether this is, perhaps, here is a question. Perhaps, is it always true that That S of D is greater than C plus 10 of G or any B, on any Ng. And so if you believe this, it would imply that Mg is kind of uniruled up to genus 20 or something. So the answer to this question is yes for genus up to 12. So this is a, you know, you are not going to disprove this conjecture by looking at the case of genus 4 or something like this. Why? Because I sort of, the proof is kind of indicated on the blackboard already. It turns out that all the way up to, let's look focus on genus 12. So there is a result that a curve of genus up to 11, general curve of genus up to 11, and genus 10 is a 11, and genus 10 is a sort of exception, lies on a K3 surface. You just count parameters. How many curves line a K3 surface? It's G plus 19 parameters you compare to 3G minus 3, and you see it's gonna, they, you know, for G up to 11, they are all gonna be there. And the argument I described here shows that, in fact, this construction, even for genus up to 12, fills up the boundary device of delta zero. And the curve I produce here is a move, is a. The curve I produce here is a sweeping curve of the boundary divisor. Any effective divisor will have to intersect it one negatively. And this actually proves this inequality. So the first case you would like to, I mean if you want to test this really, so what comes after genus 12? 13. So this is how we get to genus to prove. What? So hard to prove. So, can you say again what happens in genus 12? So, okay. So, for genus 12, right, you look at M12. I look at the boundary divisor of M12. This is curves of genus 11, right, with two points attached. But the curve of genus 11 lies on a KFV surface. So I put it on a KFV surface, and I carry out this construction. Now, any device, this curve, this construction. This curve, this construction will sweep out the boundary divisor delta zero. Any effective divisor must intersect a sweeping curve non-negatively. So it will intersect this gamma prime non-negatively. And since this is the slope, it will satisfy this inequality. And the same works for the smaller general. So the first three-year test of this is genus 13. Yeah. Other questions? Anyway, so we got to genus 13. So this is one. There's many good reasons to go to genus 13. In some sense, it's the first case where, yeah, how to say, the geometry of the moduli space is really interesting. In the sense that, what can I say? Of course, there's a lot of interesting things about curves of hologenes, yeah? But the curves on K-free surfaces. The curves on K-free surfaces govern this geometry of the mobilized space in a very precise way. And this is really the first case where this is no longer the case. Genus 13. And so we had a strategy to deal with this case, and this strategy involves non-abelian real nucleotide. This is higher-ranked real nucleus. So, this was some sort of motivation, you know. Of motivation, you know. So, why we wrote a very long paper on genus 13. Yeah, so this is the motivation. So, now I start with non-obedient renewed theory. So, with this discussion, genus 13 was too peculiar, then we can start again. So, and we start with non-obedium renewator theory. So, before you go non-obedient, may I ask? Please, simple word in question. So, this trick of joining two points and Of joining two points and cracking Q delta one. Could you try and repeat it and join more points and go up a little bit? Yeah, you can. But then you are not going to be, you are going to have two dimension two loci in delta zero. You will never fill up a division. So you're going to fill up smaller and smaller loci. And for the birational geometry, then that's not enough to derive any conclusions. There is any number of interesting conjectures about. So if you do this construction, you take a kernel K-fi surface and Construction: You take a curve on a K-fi surface and start identifying points. So it says R discurs dense in moduli. So there's all sorts of nice conjectures. But it won't, you cannot derive anything here because it's nothing, you are sweeping low sides that have too high coding. This is by that count you said earlier? This is by the pervert count you said. No, but so essentially what Renzo was saying, why can't I do several? You know, I can do something like this, yeah? This is gonna be co-dimension two. This is going to be co-dimension 2 in engine. So this very simple trick, I said principle trick is not a trick. That a sweeping curve of a divisor, so if any divisor must understand, must intersect the sweeping curve of a divisor non-negatively another divisor, this won't work for high condemnations. What might I just sweep out? What if I discreet patterns are one by any irrational? No, but this guy is hard to implement this, essentially. But it's kinda it's hard to implement this, essentially. It's hard to essentially a priori, this sweeping out by rational curves implies that this locus is unirule. And you try to do it for other devices, they won't be unirule. You can try to, it's okay, I see now, I understand your question. You can try to do it with other indeed, but you're going to get worse numerics. This is the optimal numeric. Okay. So, bring it to theory into non-obedience. Brunita theory, non-abelian. So, what is non-abelian? So, there was a lot of abelian reunited theory. So, this means rank one reunit theory. Now, there is a non-abelian reunitive theory because you replace GL1 by GL2. And you look at vector boundaries of rank 2 on curves. So, C is a curve. And you fix an integer, and I denote SU omega k. Omega k this is the locus of semi-stable vector bundles of rank two on C with canonical determinant and k-sections. This is a very interesting locus. There is There is very good reason to study this condition, to put this condition. It has to do again with TF3 surfaces because I should. Anyway, so let's look at this locus. So this is a Lagrangian degeneracy locus. So it's not a classical degeneracy locus like the WRT episode I was talking about. So it's a Lagrangian degeneracy locus of expected co-dimension. Dimension, dimension, rather, dimension, 3g minus 3 minus k plus 1 choose 2. Okay, this is the expected cool dimension. So how do you get this expected cool dimension? I mean, I would be very fast. Essentially, the deformation of this problem, so you deform bundles with this condition, is governed by something that I call the sort of. I call the deformation theory of this problem is governed by the following map. So it's a map from SIM2 of A0 of B into A0 of SIM2 of B. And this I call the Mukai Petri map. So Petri because it looks like a Petri map, but it's not quite, and Mukai because he really made a lot of nice things about it. Made a lot of nice things about it, you know, pointed out its use. And so basically, what you're saying is that if this is subjective, injective, sorry, if mu is injective, then SUC omega k is smooth of the expected dimension at this point. And of expected dimensions. And then you see, I go. And then you see, I hope, this dimension counts. So, what are the so this guy here is k plus 1 choose 2. And this one you do Riemann Roch. And what you get is 3G minus 3. Therefore, this dimension. So, this 3G minus 3 is not the 3G minus 3 you may think it is. It's not the dimension of the moduli space of curves. This is the dimension of the moduli space of vector balance of rank 2 with fixed determination. Space to vector balance of rank 2 with fixed determinant. This is another 3G balance. And this is, right? So essentially, this is the taji space, is the annihilator of the image of this map cell, and it's expected dimension and so on. Proving, there's a theorem, a very nice theorem of Techido, who proved that indeed μE is injective for C-generatic. An E-arbitrary, but her proof does not establish existence, actually. So I should say something. Everything that is in this high-rank non-obedium reunitive theory is incomparably more difficult than rank one. Much more difficult. And so, in fact, And so, in fact, not even the behavior of the generic curve is not clarified somehow, right? Despite having a lot of papers, somehow the really fundamental questions have not really been correct. And in fact, this theorem is actually a very nice counterexample to my pessimistic statement, because actually this is a very good theorem. It says that for a generic curve, you expect this to be a very good idea. Is there any sense in which non-abelian brain? Is there any sense in which non-abelian Wildner theory contains classical Wildlander theory? Sure. Yeah, of course, because you can always take a, yeah, so you can take any L, like rank one, and you can make L plus omega minus L. Well, you are not going to object that this is not stable, but in general it's not, but in some sense, yeah, you you can right, it does contain via extensions and so on. But you you capture a totally new phenomenon, phenomena. New phenomena. So, for instance, curves on K3 surfaces by this theorem of Lasma's field are generic for n-quantity theory. And they are not generic for non-abelium linear theory. That's another theorem of Mukai and Boisin. Anyway, the study of this loss is sort of influenced somehow. When you say divergence theory, do you mean that the kernel is? Do you mean that the kernel is some kind of traceless cell? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, right. So you start to deform, you deform your bundles of ranked one occurred, you put this condition, and that's what you get here. So you have to prove the injectivity of this map, and there is no. So Mukai calls down. So Mukai has a very nice paper where actually he introduces this terminology, non-abidium-breed theory, and I took it. And uh I borrow it from him. Okay, all right. So I am interested today in the case when this expected dimension is zero. So three t minus three because k plus one choose two. Okay, so let's try to solve this equation. So, what are the first solutions? k equals to 5, 5 times 6. k equals 5 is g equals 6. k equals 6, g equals 8, yes. So these cases are simple. So these are due to Mukai. They are actually very famous papers. They are actually very famous papers. So, for instance, this is saying that any curvogenous state has a unique model in Grassmanni and G26 and so on. But actually, it's what Eric was saying here. So, this is everything is governed by rank 1 period. And the next case that is really beyond this is k equals to 8. And in this case, g is equal to 13. And you have k equals 9. And you have k equals 9 and then g equals 16. Okay, so today, so there are very interesting stories in both cases, but today I will deal only with this. And this is the subject of this paper with David and Sam. Why is it that you are interested in the because this is what we can do at the moment? So in this case, right, you have a finite cover of Mg. So this is right. No, it's So this is the right. No, it's so in this case you have so in this case you have a finite cover, let's say so SUG omega. So this is the parameter space of curves and such a vector bundle. So what was my notation? It was SUC omega k. Maybe I should put also k and you expect this to be And you expect this to be a finite cover. Final. But even this is not clear, because as I say, existence is not really established in these cases. So it's not just because you may not have a bundle. And then Titchido theorem is vectors. Possible. Okay, so anyway, so this is right. It would be very nice to do all the cases at once, but this is what we can do. At once, but this is what we can do. Okay, so we have a but so alright, so maybe I should summarize some results. So let's summarize the results. So this is in this paper with Jensen and with Ping. Okay, so we say first of all that the first thing you wanna know is what's the degree of discolor. You want to know is what's the degree of this curve. And we say that a general curve curve C, units of D carries precisely three such vector domes. E in SUC omega. And this is, I mean for me, it was a major surprise that the number is so low. Means that you have a modular cover, SU13 omega 8, a 3 to 1 cover. 3 to 1 cover, a modular cover of N step. There is a modular cover of N step of degree 3. So this is kind of unprecedented. So the only cover of such low degree I know is in genus 4. When I take a G13 canonical curve has lies on the quartet, the quadratic has two rulings. But even for genus 5, 6, and so on, these brilliant limited covers which are Three inherited covers, which have degrees given by Catalan numbers, those are much higher than three. Or one away, they are not single digits, yeah? So this is you have a modular cover of degree three, modular space covering three to one m sub d. The second result is that this moduli space this module cover is in fact irrational. Well, that of course implies that M13 is uniration, but this was already known. And then this number three is, okay, so if you have a finite cover, what's the most natural thing you could look at? You have a finite cover between varieties, you want to have a divisor. Well, the ramification locus is the answer. And this is indeed what we call the non-avelium reunitive divisor. The non-avelian Billion real neutral device. So, what is this garbage? The ramification locus of this map theta? So, I will call this MUCHAPETI 13. And this is the locus of those curves of genus 13. Well, so I kind of, you know, this is the differential of the map, so to say. You have to have, you know, that there exists an E, such a bundle. Such a bundle such that μE is not isomorphism. So these are of the same rate. And I look at this general syllocus. So this is a divisor. And we can compute its slope. And the slope of this is this quantity. So you take the closure in mg bar, and you get the following. Can you get the following number? You get 4109 divided by 610. So this is equal to 6.73 data data, which is less than 6 plus 10 over 3, plus 10 over g, which is actually bigger. This turns out to be something like 6.76. 6.76. So the answer to this question that I posed is negative. In the worst case, where it could possibly fail, namely genus 13. Yeah, so this locus is, as I was explaining, is the ramification locus of this device. It's the locus where the MUCAIP3 method is not isomorphism. Okay, any questions? Is it irreducible? Yeah. So what? Sorry, what? The failure? That I don't know. Probably, but I don't know. It is, of course, easy that you see because part of this theorem. So this was of some interest, right? Because you could ask maybe it's really one-to-one or has three components, but it's in fact unirational. So it's really a three-to-one metric. Yeah. So as I say, the existence, so this is some structure here. So, this is some structure here that is really mysterious. I don't, we don't understand this structure. Why there is this feat to uncover? So, what does the non-applicant ringlet devisor gain you? So, it gives you the best known devisor of smallest slope that you know on M13. In fact, so it gives you, okay, applications, you mean, yeah, there are applications. Yeah. It cannot give you that it's object because it's not right, you can only prove. Right, you can only prove that it's general type if it has a chance of being a general type. But one should not be obsessed by this question in life of proving that the moduli space is of general type. There are also other nice goals to pursue. But actually, the next theorem is that something is of general type. So exactly. So I will say this. So we look at the locus RG. This is the MgPZ2. Okay? So this is curves endowed with the eta double cover and one group of degeneration. So this is local, the moduli space of pin varieties of moduli pins. Well, imparabies. Yeah? Because there is a match of pre-map to Ag minus 1. So this is the studying of the codidimension of this is also a rather important problem. And anyway, so this is a theorem that follows from our paper. Is that R13 is a general type. And it is known that, in fact, so I should say here. In fact, so I should say here: the study of this moduli space is important for uniformization of moduli fibelium varieties. So it is known that Rg is unirule for genus at most 8. There are many people here, and it's general type for 14 or 10, but not 16. We don't know 16, and so 13 is the smallest. And so 13 is the smallest genus where this result, where H is known to be a general. And the proof, the sketch of the proof of this is: well, we use this divisor in the following way, that we will essentially construct a divisor on R13 with very good properties, and this is the universal theta divisor. So this is the on R13. On R13. So this is theta 13. Let me write it, I guess. So this is the locus of C and eta. So eta is a point of order 2. So every point, you know, these are, you know, curve and a point of order 2 in the Jacobian. And the condition I'm imposing is that there is such a bundle, one of the three, such that this has a section for some P in S, U, C, whatever. What was my notation? Oh my god. Omega 8. Right? So this is a bundle of slope g minus 1. So the non-vanishing of this is a divisor in the moduli space. And essentially computing the class, we know enough about, you know, in our paper to be able to compute the class of this divisor. And then this shows that R17 is of general type. So this is one application of this theorem to actually proving that things are of general type. The G16 and AS16, the one over and out story. That's another story. That's another talk. Yeah, this is worked out. Partly worked out, yeah. It's a very interesting story, I suppose. But it shows that the... It proves at the end of the day that M16 is uniruled. It doesn't get you G16. That doesn't. No, I haven't tried so hard either, but I don't know. No. So hard either, but I don't know, not easy. Okay, fine. So, I should say something. Okay, so the time is running. And other questions? So, okay, so I should say, essentially, how do we get this? It's not clear from what I say here how to get from here to that, right? I should say something that essentially what everything boils down to calculating explicitly. Of calculating explicitly one tautological class on this moduli space. Namely, the tautological class in question is: you take the universal curve over this moduli space, and I compactify it in some way now, which I don't want to discuss in detail, because there is no time for that. But it's enough for me to do it uh for us to do a comp uh uh a partial compact function. And here is an certain, yeah. So this is this three to one thing, so this is the universal error. So, this is the universal error. And here you have a universal rank 2 vector bundle, universal rank 2 bundle. And with the canonical determinant. And essentially what you would like to do is you take the C1 and the C2 of this class, you have the C2, this is an element in chow 2 of this, and you push this forward, you get to this moduli space, and you push this further via theta. You get this class, I don't know how to call it. You get this class, I don't know how to call it, I call it gamma. And essentially, the crucial aspect here is to calculate this class. What is gamma? And the question is, why can we do it for genus 13 and we cannot do it for other genera? And the reason is there is a very happy accident happening in this case. Yeah, I should say something. I don't have time to discuss this free here. Is free here. This y is exactly free. So this is actually a long determinant calculation. So, okay, you set up the class and you start to compute a determinant, right? And the problem is that this determinant is not like a determinant that appears in Reunuter theory, in classical Reeneto theory, rank-quanitar theory. Those are, at the end of the day, one-term determinants, and one-term determinants we know how to compute. These are determinants that involve the entries are. Determinants that involve the entries are given by this Yuzagiev formula. I don't see a structure at least of this determinant. What is this the determinant of? This is a Lagrangian degeneracy locus. So you can compute it on the space of Hecke transformations. The degree of this map in general, this is for every G, will be... So there's some morphism of vector variables and yeah, but it's in Lagrangian setting, yeah? So we apply this Lagrangian full temperature. So, apply this Lagrangian Fulton Prague formalism or whatever. There is a determinant condition that is there. Anyway, it's a determinant. So, you have to compute it. I can tell you what are the numbers here. What are the numbers for this in these cases? So, the numbers are of SU2 omega, whatever. Omega K. So, the numbers are 1 for genus 6 and 8. This is clear from Mukai. 3, genus 13. Genus 13. This is clear from our work because we computed the determinant. Then it's amazingly low genus 1611. So I was really astonished that you get such low numbers. And the next case is genus 23, which is a genus that accompanies us for a web. And this is for k equals 11. And then the answer is 11,260. Is 11,268 and then the next one I computed also, and it's higher. So I don't know. So there is, of course, as I say, this is very incipient. There is no, it would be nice to have Schubert calculus, to have tableaus or something. This is waiting to be discovered. There is a lot of structures about this low side that a n a non-binary neutral theory that is not clear. Being able to field this is not clear. Okay, so but now I will discuss so this can go away. So, why can we do it for 13 and we cannot do it for other genera? And this is essentially, as I say, you have to compute this tautological class. And well, all right, so I will okay, so the last topic of my Okay, so the last topic of my talk is the resonance divisor and the strong maximum amplitude. Okay. Okay, so you start with such an object as I introduced. Start with E over C, rank 2 over C rank 2, A0 of E is 8. And you look now at the determinant. And you look now at the determinant map, physical ready bounds. And you observe now that this is dimension 13 and this is dimension 8. And what you observed is that A0 of omega is two times A0 of E minus 3. Cannot argue this. And what does this mean? Uh and what does this mean? It means this is uh one more than two A0 T minus four, which uh means which is the dimension of a Grassmannian G to whatever, G to eight. And it turns out that then, because of this, that what I call the resonance divisor, and this is the locus of pairs C and a vector bundle, with the property that there exists S1 and S2 sections in A0V. Sections in A0V which wedge to zero when I take the determinant. This is a divisor. Why is a divisor? Because this condition, I can write it as saying that the kernel of the projectivization of the kernel intersects the Grassmannian G plus non-empty. The Grassmannian The Grassmannian is identified with the space of tensors of rank 2, and I'm asking that there be a tensor of rank 2 in the kernel. So this is a co-dimension 1 only in this case, because it's the dimension of the Grassmannian is G2, dimension of G20 is 2n minus 1. So this is a divisor in this case. On one hand, we know on one hand. Hand, we know on one hand we will be able to compute the class of this device. On the other hand, we will be able to describe geometrically what this device is. Because what does it mean that there are two sections which wedge to zero? That means that those sections are everywhere proportional, and therefore they generate a pencil A inside E. So this is a subline, a line sublime. So, this is a sub-line, a line sub-bundle with A0 of V at least two. So, basically, this is the locus, so Res is basically imposing the condition that this E has a sub-pencil. And now you ask the question, what type of pencil could this be? And well, you were at Isabel Sock. What is the colonity of a curve of genus 13? The colonity is 8. There are two possibilities. So, how can so how How does A look like? Well, it either has gonality one less than expected. Then it turns out that it's always there. I mean, what I want to say is that the seven gonal divisor is in this locus. But there is the important case when A is a G18. And with A is a G18, then I just look at this. Then I just look at this condition. And I have here omega minus A. I write it as an extension like this. And I just compute now. And I have here a G18. This is the generic situation. And this by Riemann Rock, this is a G516. And this has eight sections. So I have two sections here, six sections, six here. So every section will lift. So this is either condition, it's a geometric condition. So, this is a geometric condition that every section will lift. And by extensions, this, let me write this L, you know, so this is G516. This can be rephrased in the following way. This can be replaced in saying that this map, right, that this map from SIM2 of H. From seam two of H0 of L into H0 of L squared is not surjective. This is just extensions. So you have a vector bundle such that every section leaves precisely when that map is not surjective. And you start now to calculate dimensions here. So this is a G516. So this is 7 choose 2, which is 21. And this is by being. And this is by Riemann-Roch. So this is 2 times 2 says 30, 2 plus 1 minus 13. This is 20. So you ask this locus to be non-subjective, therefore, so this device, so let's call this device a D13. So this is the locus of those curves in GNOT13 with the property that there exists a G516. A G516 on C with mu L not of maximal rate, which means subjective. And you see that's expected to be a divisor because this is, I look at something from a vector space of dimension twenty one into a vector space of dimension twenty. So what is the condition the locus that the the expected codimension that this map be not subjective is codimension. not subjective is co-dimensional two but I have a one-dimensional family of G18s and so the the dimension of this W516 on on this curve so dimensional parameter space of L is one so you have a cover of M13 with one-dimensional fibers and you impose a condition of co-dimension two you expect to have a device okay so expect Okay, so expect is the key word, yeah? And anyway, so summarizing this discussion that I have, this resonance divisor, I haven't discussed why resonance, but I can say something later about it. So it turns out that basically this resonance divisor, the closure of this resonance divisor, can be written as D13 plus turns out three times the Burbin space. Okay, I have finished in two minutes if I Two minutes if I just the punchline here. So, okay, dealing with this takes a large part of the pin. And this is where tropical geometry comes into. And Sam is going to discuss, so look at this condition, the proof that M22 and 23 is of general type, uses divisors of very similar flavor. And there is here two aspects. One is There is here two aspects. One is calculating the class of this divisor, which we do somehow. So we know how to calculate this divisor. Of course, we know this. So we know the one side, the right-hand side to calculate it. What is extremely difficult is to prove that this is indeed a divisor. And this is done with tropical methods, right? So the hardest thing is that showing that, you know, I said expected, expected, expected. Well, you have to sort of prove all this. Prove all these expectations. So showing that this thing is a divisor. Yes. Hard. Calculating the class is not easy, but doable. Anyway, you know this. On the other hand, so you know everything on this side. On the other hand, this condition can be interpreted. This is a condition, it's a very simple linear algebra condition at the level of the universe. Of the universal moduli space, this 3 to 1 cover, SU138 over M13. On the other hand, you get a formula here in terms of this class lambda. It is of this class of the Tagoch class. This class that I introduced, this is the push forward of the C2 of the universal boundaries and some boundaries. And you have this relation, you computed everything here on one side, so at the end of the day, you get this gamma. At the end of the day, you get this gamma in this way. You get the gamma geometrically, you know what gamma is, and that's what. Then, once you get the gamma, by some Rimaro calculations, which are easy, you can compute the non-obedium Blue Nutri divisor, you can compute the universal theta divisor, and everything you want. Right, so what doesn't work like this for other genera is that you do not have this identity. Identity. Okay, so I think I will sort of stop here. I intended to do more, but this is what I could. So, thank you very much. Questions? Can you say something about the how how you do the virtual class computation for deep thinking? Sure. So maybe Sam you want to explain this tomorrow? No no. No? Okay. No, I don't think he he should do the tropical stuff. Oh, so we do it with test with test curves, but essentially it's test surfaces. So it's a lot of work because there's a lot of tests essentially. So you write on the most standard test curves and you push The test curves, and you push to pull them back to this. It's a Hurvitz space, right? And you work there. And then there, since you have one-dimensional fiber, you have to compute various local along these test surfaces there. And you compute them. You take care of the excess. Sorry, but the surfaces are all pullbacks. Yeah, they are pullbacks of curves, right? And you do the calculations there, yeah? And you you you cut some excess and then you at the end of the day. But this is uh theoretically not different than our calculation in genius twenty two and twenty three. Calculation in genus 22 and 23, it's about the same level of difficulty. So, actually, this we can do for rho equals 1 or 2, we can do this for higher rho if we are really depressed, really. It's not for arbitrary row, not at all. Maybe this will also be in December's talk tomorrow, but so you said showing D13 as a divisor is hard, but so is it showing that there's at least one component that is code mention one or showing that. Component that is could be one or show that there are like one component. No, so this is not so hard to show that there is one component. But what could be, so this is a, so the problem is that you have some locus here that, so this locus, so how was, what was Isovers? I don't know what was isopest, I don't remember. G526 locus, yeah? So I have this G526 locus over N3. And these are one-dimensional fibers, and I have something of expected. And I have something of expected co-dimension 2 here. I really have to prove this. We have to prove this: that every component of that locus is a co-dimension 2, because otherwise the calculation that we do with the test surfaces is not... It's really a virtual calculation. And then you cannot derive anything. If you have a ghost component that you won't see. So, and then you have to, right? So, and essentially, you cannot work here. You can do some projective geometry. You can do some projective generation and stuff like this, and you can exhibit a component. But this does not eliminate the possibility that if I take the generic curve, that will have another linear system for which the condition lays down. And for this, you need essentially what you need. You assume this map is not subjective, and you tropicalize this. And then you chain of loops and so on, and then So on, and then you write a number of pages, and then at the end of the day or the years, then it's clear. You also need this thing that you don't have a four-dimensional one component over which there is extra stuff, yeah. There is more possibilities you could sleep, and we really have used all the possibilities to sleep out. I mean, you're gonna. You're gonna you're saying the corner is one of the dominoes. Yeah, so right, so what could what Sam is saying that you okay, you you you prove this for a generic curve, yeah, but essentially that okay, so that this degeneracy locus will not dominate M sub D. But this does not rule out the possibility of having other components of excessive dimension which map to divisors with excessive with positive dimensional fibers. So you have to prove this strong MRC not only over the Strong MRC, not only over the generic point, but in fact over all the divisors of NG. Right? So then this is kind of an infinite amount of information, so then you do some tricks with the intersection theorem on NG to reduce it to a finite amount of tasks, and we overcome those tasks. But so the theoretical difficulties in carrying out this aspect in genus 13 are essentially the same as for 22 and 23. What what is there left? What mg bar is there left for higher dimensional? Right. Uh so so I did the yeah I use a different column here. So 17 to 21 is with the divergence of M 16 though? Yeah, I know you should change change it around do it. No, no, but that No, no, but I know you know I know it's uni root, yeah. All right, let's thank the speaker again join us for a banana after hours today. Well, sixty, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I think that's it's done. Yeah, yeah, that is that. Yeah, it depends. Do you have anything to do with that? Okay, that's interactive. There's stuff that's hard work, but fun there's stuff there. It's just hard work. Yeah. Okay. Also I mean uh one needs fundamentally new techniques for twenty twenty one. So like instead of So like instead of
