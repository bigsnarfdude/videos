Okay, well, good afternoon, everyone. My name is Linda Hino. And before I start, I want to acknowledge that Dave's work allowed me to have a professional life and a career. And a career, mostly in cyclostratigraphy, so certainly not in advanced statistics and math. And also, I would like to acknowledge Jeffrey Park, whose codes and guidance I've relied on for the past 35 years. I'm indebted to both of you, so thank you. So today I'd like to report on, I'm losing my voice, I don't know why. I'm losing my voice. I don't know why. I would like to report on my voice is gone. Let me see if I can keep it going here. It might be wise to refill that glass. It might be wise to refill that glass. Can you wait just one moment while I go get some more water? Maybe something more potent. You could make a bad joke about a concentration measure. Bad jokes are good. All right. Bad jokes are good. All right, let me try again. Okay, so today I'd like to report on a multi-taper study by a former undergraduate student at George Mason University, Jude Al-Aswad. And she's now a PhD student at Stanford, but she's working on paleobiology. So she left this area. And together we And together we analyzed earth tide signals and two strain meters from the PBO network. And this is shown here. It's in the western United States along the western U.S. plate boundary. And also there's one over in Yellowstone. So let's take a look. So the plate bound So, the Plate Boundary Observatory, or the PBO, was a geodetic component of EarthScope. And it has about 80 strain meters. And the first one was installed in 2003. And most of them are still working today, or many of them. And they have over the years detected ETS. Detected ETS events and aseismic events, co-seismic deformation, SACH and tsunami signals, and earth tides. And earth tides is what we were interested in analyzing. I want to say that this was an effort to train Drew how to use multi-tapers. And we found many wonderful things. So. So, first of all, the reason why strain meters were included in the observatory is because they bridge the gap between the detection envelopes of GPS receivers and seismology. So at long periods, GPS has greater sensitivity, which you can see here in green, than strain readers by one to two orders of magnitude. But at short periods, But at short periods, in time scales between seconds to a month, strain meter sensitivities, and this is the lower boundary, is one to three orders of magnitude greater than GPS. So that is the main reason. And we were drawn to this because of that. So Strain meters have been around for decades at this point. And the ones that were used in the PBO, they are operated by UNAPCO today. They consist of four vertically equispaced gauges that measure strain extension and compression horizontally at different orientations. So it does not get the up and down vertical component. Up and down vertical component. These gauges, of which there are four, are put, are stacked and then they are grouted into boreholes in competent rock starting at around 100 meters depth. The gauges will change diameter in response to strain along the gauge axis and the gauge axis, for example, shown. Axis, for example, shown from the top shows that there is a gap here, D2, and when strain moves it back and forth, there's a change in capacitance that is recorded. And it's roughly calibrated so that a change in four picometers horizontally along the width of the train strain meters equates to about what they call. Equates to about what they call nanostrain, 0.05 nanostrain. So you'll see the y-axis and nanostrain. So strains induced by earth tides are about tens of nanostrain, so thousands of picometers in this environment. And they recorded these and they do record them still at five-minute intervals. So the strain meets. So, the strain meters is the sum of different responses. The one we're interested in are the earth tides, but there's also when you're close to the ocean, there's an ocean tide component to that. There's also long-term drifts or trends that is related primarily to borehole relaxation, but it can also be related to tectonics over very long term. There are also responses to other effects, primarily. Responses to other effects, primarily air pressure and temperature, rainstorms, maybe sea level. And then there are also these data offsets that occur episodically related to deformation and potentially also to instrument issues. So, this is an example of a single day record taken at a borehole in. At a borehole in Seaside, Oregon, and these are the records produced by each of the gauges. Each one is in a different orientation. I guess I didn't make that clear here. They are in different orientations, mostly at 90 degree angles from each other. Some are at 30 degrees. And so they produce, they record the earth tides, but of course, since they're in different orientations, they have different phases. They have different phases. So, this one here, this CH0 gauge, is close to 200 degrees north of east and or east of north. And so this one is closest to the orientations that we decided to use. And we'll talk about that next. So we decided to look at two borehole strain meters, five years. Meters, five years of synchronized five-minute sample data. It really is the best data I've ever looked at in my life and the longest, perhaps, in terms of relative to the signal, to the frequencies that we were looking at. So the first one is B001 at Sequim, Washington. And we chose to look at gauge zero. To look at gauge zero, this is along the Cascadia subduction zone. Unfortunately, it's very close to the Pacific Ocean, so it has some oceanic effects. And it also has a maritime climate. And gauge two, we were interested in, was at Yellowstone on top of the mantle plume. It is, however, 100 meters from Yellowstone Lake, and it also has interesting information. It also has interesting implications for the records. It has a continental climate. And so, in some, both of these are very, very different tectonic regimes and have very different climatologies. And we wanted to see what we could see with these. So, just to give you a few more details, the Secret Washington. Uh, the Sekram Washington borehole meter was installed in 2005 and was stalled at a depth of about 500 feet. You should also notice that each of these have seismometers that are also in the borehole, and they are grouted in with a special grout so that they're stable, presumably, hopefully. And so by the time I get By the time they get down to the bottom, they don't really know the orientations that they started with of the different strain meters. So they have some sort of a way to do that again, to measure it again. So as far as we know, at Sequim, CH0 is orientated along 200 degrees north of east of north. And Yellowstone. And Yellowstone was installed in 2008, and it's a little bit shallower, and it has a gauge that's oriented at 205 degrees, 0.1. So we thought those would be consistent. They would at least give us consistent orientations of the signals that were recorded. Okay, so here they are. Okay, so here they are. These are amazing signals. This is five years worth of data taken at five-minute intervals. And so you can see that it has over the five years a very long, dramatic decrease in microstrain. This is a relaxation response of the borehole after it was installed. Still going on, I mean, it was installed in 2004, no F5, and still going on. No, five, and still going on in 2011 through 2015. And that's our five years. And this inset shows you a small 20-day detail of what the signal looks like. So you can sort of see it's going, it has other things associated with it that we don't understand yet. At Yellowstone, over the same time. Yellowstone over the same time interval, we have a very different response. It's also going decreasing, but then it seems to change directions as we get to the final year. And again, this is the same 20 days in 2014 in July shown here for comparison. Now, if you remove these curves, then you can see You can see that they have very strong annual signals. It's very, very strong and dominant in the Yellowstone record, presumably because of the continental climate. And it's more subdued in terms of amplitude and more complex in the maritime climate of the second station. Circumstation. So, before we go any further, we thought we should compare these signals with the Earth Tide model. So, we selected Solid.f, which is the Earth Tide model by DeHaante. It was recently updated in 2018. And so we analyzed over the same time period at one-minute intervals the solid Earth. The solid earth tides and U, V, and W components, north, east, and up. And this is shown in the Z displacement or the up. And it includes Love Sheetah displacement corrections, but there's no oceanic or atmospheric loading or polar motion components that have been added. So it's just the pure lunar solar horcing. Horsing. So again, this is the same 20 days, and I compare this one from Sequim to the model here. So it seems to line up pretty well. It seems to be flipped in phase. I'm not sure why yet. But at station B94, again, you can see that at least these seem to be slightly phase shift. Phase shifted in terms of the Fortnitely cycle. So, we don't understand why that is. So, obviously, there are these very dramatic other non-tidal perhaps components that are interfering with the title record or hiding it. Okay, so in the next one here, now finally we're going to look at the multi-taper spectral. The multi-taper spectral estimates. These are three pi multi-tapers, adaptive weight, adapt, data adaptive weighted. And these are straight up. There's nothing fancy about this. This is exactly how I have been using multi-tapers, according to Dave Thompson, all these years. So this is a three-pi multi-tapered spectrum. Multi-tapered spectrum all the way out to the Nyquist frequency for Sequim, and this one goes all the way out. This is for Yellowstone, goes all the way out also to Nyquist frequency. And this inset just sort of zooms in on this interval here between 0 and 15 cycles per day. So the numbers just show the major peaks, the bands with major peaks. And What's notable is that over here for the Yellowstone Station, we have a number of peaks down around below 15 cycles per day, but then there's this big peak here at 78 minutes and another one down here at 11 minutes. This all resolved at extremely low power levels and it would And it wouldn't be resolved at all if we had not retained the five-minute sampling interval. So I'll get back to this in a moment. Meanwhile, let's look at the interval from zero to five cycles per day and compare it with the tidal constituents given by our Earth tide model. So this is shown up here at the top, and they are the same. They are the same for each of the stations. The only difference, of course, will be the phase, excuse me, which we'll see shortly. And then this is the SEQIM Washington record showing very nice tidal constituents, you know, all the major tidal constituents, not every single one, however, in the diurnal band and then over in the semi-diurnal band. So they're all lined up very beautifully. M2 is lined up. Very beautifully. M2 is lined up with N2. Of course, N2 is not at 2. This is the principal lunar semi-diurnal tide, but a little bit shifted towards slightly lower frequency. And out here, we see these other components, which are related to the seasonal cycles that are affecting the records. The records. So, first, let me talk a little bit about this fascinating record with the 78 minutes. I was not the first to discover it, but I was the first to show it in a spectrum. These are related to sashes that are excited in Yellowstone Lake whenever a weather. Stone Lake, whenever a weather front moves through. And basically, here's Site 944. This is what we're analyzing. And this is another strain meter up here north of the lake. And so water sloshes between the basins, these two basins, every 78 minutes. And so when they press down on the crust, then of course they produce a strain response in the strain meters. In the strain meters. It's heaviest, of course, it's largest, of course, close to the lake, and then it's smaller but still observable 30 kilometers away at site 206. So here is an example from July 12, 2012 of a seiche in the sea in the excuse me in the lake level that occurred. This is when the passing Is when the passing weather front came through and excited this, and it goes fairly long time up to 10 centimeters over the course of a day. And this is picked up by our strain meter right away, and it moves along, and then it dissipates within a day. And then there's a smaller response over here in. In String Meter B206. So these are episodic, and so they're not large signals, but they're beautifully detected by the multi-taper analysis. So we decided also, of course, to run a harmonic analysis and look at the details of the diurnal bands and the semi-diurnal bands. So these are here for These are here for Sequin Washington record. And then below here is for Yellowstone. So this is in cycles per day. So it's very, we zoomed in very close to see these lines, which are recorded at 99.99% significance level. These are using adaptive weighted estimates. Estimates of the amplitudes as well as the significance, the degrees of freedom and significance. So what you can see, what's unusual here is P1 is the solar diurnal component. And then there's one right at one cycle per day. Now, this is not a tidal frequency, this is a temperature and or barometer. And/or barometric pressure, probably temperature frequency that affects the strain on a seasonal basis. Then the major component in the band is K1, which is the lunar diurnal. And years ago when we first did this analysis, we were happy with that. And we were happy with these three. And we stopped our analysis there. But I came back to look at it again. But I came back to look at it again and I noticed that. Well, there's this line and then there's this line, and they are predicted lines and have predictive frequencies. Actually, they're somewhat predicted, but also they are inferred just to the right of K1. And these are the psi1 and phi1 tidal constituents. Constituents. I'll get back to these later. They are very problematic, I mean, to interpret, but they have been recorded here. Whereas over in Yellowstone, it looks like there might be a record of Psi 1, but it's not recording with high significance, and Phi 1 is not there at all. So we were very impressed. I was re very impressed again by the capability of the multi-tapers to see these components. The amplitude here is in log scale, so they're really very weak. And so just to finish out what we looked at, we looked at the semi-diurnal band as well, where we detected the T. Band as well where we detected the T T2, although it does not have high significance. And this is the larger solar elliptic component. And S2, which occurs exactly at two cycles per day, and that's the principal solar semi-diurnal time. M2, on the other hand, is way over here outside of this graph, and that's the lunar semadaron. Lunar semi-diurnal. And then K2, which is over here. And this is the lunisolar semi-diurnal time. We see the same responses in Yellowstone. And in fact, only the S2 tide here has a significant line associated with it. So I'll get back to, you know, I was impressed. I was sort of unhappy with the high noise level that seems to be present in these records. And then now I've gone back to look at some of the other records and I realized that we looked at some of the two worst records with the highest amount of noise, broadband noise, all the way. Broadband noise all over across it. And so, if we go back and look at other records, we may even get better resolution of these components. The other thing I want to say is that you really have to have about five years of data to be able to see these components because they're so closely spaced. So, strain meters now have excellent resolution, frequency resolution for that. All right, we did a couple. All right, we did a couple of things. And one thing was we wanted to compare using the harmonic analysis phase estimates, we wanted to compare the time lags between the two stations at specific frequencies, at the K1 diurnal frequency, for example. So when we did that, we found that the time lag associated between the two. Between the two was at 2.6 hours. And we did the same thing for the K2 semi-diurnal tide. And that showed a time lag of 1.8 hours. So we're a little nonplussed by this because, of course, these two stations are only separated by 12.5 degrees longitude, which gives you about 0.5. Which gives you about 0.84 hours of time lag that should occur as the tide crosses the two stations. And just looking at the model, these are both the model for B001 and B944. Again, we should be much closer in terms of timeline. So we So we want to do some more research. I did talk to Jeffrey Park about this, and he thinks we should definitely go into coherency and look and see what's happening. I have not done that yet. But before I close, I wanted to talk a little bit about SI1 and Phi 1. And these are associated, unfortunately, with what we know. What we know, what is known as the radiational tides. And this is the radiational tides actually involve solar radiation changing the temperature of the ground and the air and causes, induces a tidal response. So it's not a gravity, it's not induced by gravity changes. Induced by gravity changes. So we believe that, of course, our estimates must have components from these two radiational tide components. And so we would like to understand how we can estimate that and remove it. The other interesting aspect is that once we remove those. Once we remove those effects, then the next thing we can do is potentially plot them up and to see how they agree with this resonance model for the nearly diurnal free wobble, which occurs close to the diurnal frequency. And there's a resonance that occurs right there. And K1 and P1 are somewhat associated with that, as are in That, as are in a great, there's a very large response with Phi 1 and Psi 1, Psi 1 in particular. So we would like to understand that better and see if our data can be incorporated into the nearly diurnal free wobble of the Earth resonance model. So, what next? We would like to. We would like to, if we can find someone, to analyze additional PBO strain meter records in order to develop a robust tidal lag database for the PBO region in the western United States. And we'd like to investigate ocean tidal records for effects on strain meter earth tide signals, which we have. NOAA has multiple stations, some of them. Multiple stations, some of them very, very close to the PBO stations. And I've already analyzed some of them. Amazing. They do show SI1 and Phi1 tides in the one closest to the Sikwim, Washington station. We also want to analyze the meteorological records for radiational tidal corrections. And those are also available. Also available courtesy of NOAA. Unbelievable. There's an unbelievable amount of data out there that is available starting probably, I think all of them start around 2010 or so. And the goals nominally would be to construct a tidally derived crustal gravity profile across the western U.S. And then separately, this seems really hard, but has But has been done before by one of Jeffrey Park's colleagues, Antonella Marusso. We'd like to apply the Psi1 and Phi1 tidal constituents to the near-diurnal free wobble resonance model for the Earth. Okay, well, thank you very much. Okay, well, thank you very much.
