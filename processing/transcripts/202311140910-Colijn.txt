Defection. So, when we think about surveillance, we have these two kind of classic definitions: one by the WHO and one by the CDC. It's about this continuous systematic collection and analysis and interpretation of data. The point being that you need to be able to respond in real time to a pandemic. The CDC's definition is similar. It's an ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation. Collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data, really essential for planning, implementing, and evaluating public health practice and interventions. CDC talks about a number of different attributes of surveillance data. It has to be simple, flexible, acceptable, sensitive, have a certain positive predictive value, representative. Representative and timely. We can kind of think about some really nice idealized data sources for doing surveillance. So Imperial College and the UK Public Health Agency both set up separate representative surveillance systems in the UK during the pandemic. Surveillance systems in the UK during the pandemic. So, REACT-1 was a monthly survey of 100,000 people that requested swabs to be mailed back. And this kind of a surveillance system is able to provide relatively robust data on viral activity. We've talked about this as well here. Talked about this as well here in Canada, trying to make the case for this kind of a surveillance system. So the idea being to kind of break our reliance on clinical and outbreak data and think about having kind of custom surveillance-specific data sources. So, in this paper, just the way we kind of set up our thinking was around having. Set up our thinking was around having three tiers of surveillance. So, having the broadest level of surveillance being this aggregate ecologic information on wastewater surveillance, relatively efficient to sample a large population that way. And then in a second tier, having representative surveillance that is kind of a lot more granular. And then in a third tier, having And then in a third tier, having far more granular, detailed genomic data. So that would be kind of a sub-sample of your representative surveillance data amongst the positives. And then obviously a number of different principles around surveillance, particularly around equity and identifying disparities. And then a second really important one being openness, so making data as public as possible. Possible. The thing is that these idealized data sets or this idealized approach hasn't yet panned out. We aren't in the process of setting up a representative data system. I think on the wastewater front, we are doing actually quite well. You know, we are setting up pan-Canadian wastewater data. But at the moment, I'm not aware of any. At the moment, I'm not aware of any projects to set up idealized, simple, random, representative surveillance of respiratory infections. So we're actually highly reliant upon what I call routine surveillance data sources. So a lot of these are, some of these are data that existed prior to the pandemic, and some of them actually have been set up since. Have been set up since the pandemic. Like behavioral data would be things like mobility data and our genomic data capacity has increased a lot, as well as wastewater data. So I wanted to talk a little bit about one of the major sources, if you want to think about long-term surveillance for influenza or various different respiratory viruses, are lab-based surveillance. Are lab-based surveillance. And so lab-based surveillance in Canada is summarized in this program called the RPDSS. These are data that are submitted by provinces. They're data that are collected as part of clinical testing. They're not in any way representative. And these data are kind of summarized in this report. Across provinces, Across provinces, provinces do things a little bit differently in each province. So I just put a link to my organization's respiratory virus data. We're in the process of actually trying to kind of improve these data. So providing longer time series, providing the data in a more downloadable fashion and customizable fashion. I'd be happy to sh show you the specifics. I'll show you the specifics after or in a little bit. And then also adding a little bit more stratification to the surveillance data that we provide. Problem with this data is obviously that it's not representative and especially it changes incredibly quickly. So this data comes from, for the most part, From, for the most part, clinical testing. And so, this is a test requisition form that kind of gives you an idea of the kind of data that gets collected alongside the test sample. So, you're collecting data on health card information, specimen types. We do collect some information on symptom status, but not all of this data is necessarily 100% complete. This data is necessarily 100% complete. You can kind of imagine some of the fields are very complete, like patient setting will be very complete, the submitter information is going to be very complete, and generally the patient information is complete. You can also think about symptom surveillance data like flu watchers. These are important data sources that have been somewhat underused. So, flu watchers. Somewhat underused. So, Flu Watchers is a survey that's done by volunteers. So, it's not a representative sample in any way. If you're part of the Flu Watchers program, I'm part of the Flu Watchers program. I submit simple information on a weekly basis to Flu Watchers. And it's kind of like another system that used to be called Flu Near You, that's set up by Jonathan Brownstein, but now I believe it's called. Brownstein, but now I believe it's called Outbreaks Near You. Sorry. It's gone through several different name changes because it's also been called COVID Near You at one point. Anyhow, so and then on top of this we have data on vaccination. People are probably familiar with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination data, but in Canada, we actually don't have particularly Timely data on vaccine coverage, which is a major, I see as a kind of a major impediment to doing real-time surveillance of respiratory infections like influenza. I have the Canadian Community Health Survey. It asks about influenza immunization status in the past 12 months. And then we also have the Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Coverage Survey, which is conducted in January. Coverage survey, which is conducted in January of each year. But we don't know anything for those first several months of the flu season. And we don't know how coverage continues to change over the year. I don't know the exact delays with which that vaccine coverage information is set up. These data sources enable us to do like vaccine efficacy studies, but only at the end of the season. Anyway. The end of the season. Anyway, so I don't want to take much more time. So we began having some discussions around: okay, well, what can we do in this context of, you know, we're thinking about idealized data sources and the current data sources. How could we kind of have this discussion around, you know, specifically improving the data sources that we actually have alongside advocating for improved. For improved respiratory virus surveillance data. And we had this discussion as part of, you know, some members here as part of the FAC external modeling group that kind of started to capture some thoughts around improving surveillance data. And then we talked a little bit about, I think this was a Nick Ogden quote: testing practices change like a Harry Potter painting. So I think there was. A Harry Potter painting. So I think there was some discussion around documenting testing practices or maybe the futility of documenting testing practices in different jurisdictions and different approaches for improving surveillance data. And so we have a few different questions. And Sally brought up this neat idea or this neat analogy to eBird for participatory birding. The idea with eBird, in my understanding, I've never used it. Has anybody used eBird? Understanding, I've never used it. Has anybody used eBird here? Does anybody use this? My understanding, maybe you can tell us a little bit about it. I've barely used it at all. I mean, I've played with it. I don't know if anybody else. I've used it as a data source a couple of times, and also I know people that report on it. Yeah, there's several interesting aspects. Interesting aspects. I guess something that might be relevant to this is so is this citizen science effort when people see birds if they're birders or naturalists or otherwise interested, they report the sightings. And so eBirds gets a lot of reports and some people report many sightings. Many sightings, and it is clear that these are all high quality, but I mean, there's so many tens of millions of reports, so surely some people are just joking when they say they see some exotic bird in the mineral products. So there's some data. So based on someone's history, there's sort of an automatic method that Sort of an automatic method that eBird has, as well as hand curation to figure out whether or not the site is actually real, and then they'll annotate the database with scores of the reliability reports. Okay, that's cool. So another thing that might be interesting for the discrete, some birds are really sought after by birds, especially birds that are in danger or That are endangered or rare. And so these sightings are actually filtered at random database in the sense that we cannot download this information. So there is some censoring in the public face and houseplace. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, I think the way, you know, when Sally had mentioned this, it was kind of with the idea that it was like the carrot approach to improving your surveillance data, in that BIRD was actually. That birders actually, in my understanding, like the tool because it provides them a way of kind of classifying their data and having a record of what they've seen and they find it useful for themselves. And so there might be some kind of analogy with maybe symptom surveillance, where you might be able to improve symptom-based surveillance approaches if those are, if you benefit from it as an individual. As an individual reporting your symptom status, it might help you, I guess, properly diagnose the condition that you have. Another thought that I have is around developing better reporting guidelines. And part of an ulterior motive for this discussion is to think about how we might be able to contribute or make sure that modelers' perspectives are incorporated into reporting guidelines. Incorporated into reporting guidelines for respiratory infections because public health agencies actually don't have a model for how to do respiratory virus surveillance. We could use one, I think, in order to improve our surveillance data. So that would be something that we could, I would call that the stick, in that if you had this reporting guideline, you could go, you know, somebody working at a public health agency could go to their boss or whatever. Their boss, or whatever, and say, Look, there's this guideline, and we're not doing these things. Let's, you know, get up to speed. Yeah, David. Can you elaborate on the first point? The testing practices that change? Well, especially during the COVID pandemic, eligibility criteria were highly variable. Like, I'm thinking very specifically about, you can think about the change between pre-Omicron. Between pre-Omicron that occurred in almost every jurisdiction after Omicron, where eligibility criteria dropped. They weren't doing mass testing anymore. That was more of a... I'm just going to, I know I have some thoughts about this, and I'll not get on it too much. But it's like, you know, you have these plots that we make or they make where you have reported cases on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. And time on the x-axis. And you have overcome, it goes up and then it goes down and stays really low forever. And it's like we're saying we're going to count the number of pets. And all through 2021, we asked everybody how many pets do you have? How many pets do you have? And then sometime in 2022, we decided actually we're only looking at Chihuahuas now. And so now the number of people who have pets have gone down and stayed down dramatically. But actually, we're kind of only like now we're looking at Chihuahuas, and before we were looking at all the pets. And there are these plots that are tremendously. Pets. And then these plots are like tremendously misleading because the units are actually not the same at all. The units are still positive tests, okay? But actually, it's like, yeah, chihuahuas are pets. But you have a 50th as many chihuahuas as you have cats. For example, I don't know if you noticed Chihuahuas. Okay, that's what that. Okay, what are we looking at? Is it like normal endemic respiratory infections or exceptional? Uh, exceptional. I mean, and I agree with you, right? I mean, it's this only complete, but uh, so I don't know what else Nick Ogden meant, but that was what I was thinking when he made that comment. Yeah, oh, okay. But for this discussion overall, what are we talking about? For the discussion this morning, like, are we talking about what will happen if another SARS-CoV-2 like tiny PI come in and what would would we need? Or also what would we need? What would we need on a regular basis to do modeling on seasonal descriptive infections, STIs, or whatever? I mean, it's just to frame the discussion. Because, I mean, again, ideally from episode is is very yes, I mean it's it's annoying from a modern point of view. But it's going to be exceptional, I think. Yeah. Maybe I'm wrong, but yeah. Could be a long, but yeah, yeah, we don't have to get too hung up on this. What we wanted to do was like put some notes about the discussions from October so that we didn't just repeat those discussions here. Yeah, so I think we really wanted to have a discussion around some combination of routine, like improving routine respiratory virus surveillance in order to prepare for the next respiratory virus pandemic. Pandemic because whatever models we create for routine respiratory infections are kind of the models that we'll go back to eventually. We continue to have a lot of basically seasonal epidemics of routine respiratory infections, and there would be a benefit to improving surveillance data on this that could translate to a pandemic, to pandemic periods. Did you want to show the pyramid? So, did you want to show the pyramid or did you want to get right into these discussions? Do you want me to put the data source list on there, or how do you want to? So, I think we can kind of jump in. I also meant to just talk a little bit about surveillance pyramid and thinking about what levels of reporting we might, or what estimands we might be interested in. Because, at least in epidemiology, we often talk about this kind of model of. Talk about this kind of model of how cases get reported. So you have this theoretical or real amount that is the number of infections, prevalent infections in a population at any given time, of which a subset are symptomatic and a further subset are likely to go to healthcare. Generally, these people would be a little bit older that get diagnosed correctly and then get reported with a Reported with a test. And so, in general, this surveillance pyramid changes throughout time based on eligibility criteria, as we've mentioned, and is not necessarily that the cases that get reported aren't necessarily representative in any way of overall cases. This is my pyramid. These are infections. I don't know if you can read the ones there. If you can read the ones there, these are positive tests. And there, it's like this really nice linear thing. And if you just knew the ratio of the areas between the blue triangle and the orange region, you would just be able to get infections from your reported cases. That would be great, right? But there's just like we know an ascertainment fraction, it's constant, it's the same. We just multiply, and we're done. We can do modeling with all these lab-based data. It's great. But actually, the pyramid looks like this. This. And there's all different lines at different times and different age groups and different risk factors. And so we don't really have an estimate of, you know, there's all these categories in there, infections and symptomatic, and then symptomatic infections that get sick and then people who get tested and then eventually positive tests. There's just this blob. And I think that's one of the challenges of taking our data source lab-based data and doing modeling with it, right? So we just don't know what these things mean, these positive tests of like, well, so like, so what? Like, well, so, like, so what? Yeah. Mike? No, I mean, I just want to say that it's getting a Christmas season, so it's not surprising folks like that. Anyway, so I just want to also punch your idea in. There's two sides, right? Well, there's multiple angles. There's also the compliance from the public side, as in, like, you get an infection, or the people actually going in to get testing. Yeah, healthcare-seeking behavior. That's part of it. Yeah, healthcare seeking behavior. GP behavior is quite different. Yes. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, so in our models, we just automatically assume that people that are infected or infectious, they'll go and get tested, but that's really not how it works in reality. And I think I just want to jump back because you listed a lot of, I think, most of the content from Channel, my inner public health agency. Channel, my inner public health regions of Canada is that we also are interested in looking at what's happening internationally and given that, what are the risks that are bringing on. So from what we learned with the COVID pandemic is that we aren't really brewing our own variants in Canada. A lot of the variants are actually brought in from other countries. Every variant starts in some small jurisdiction somewhere. It could have been us. Yes, of course, yeah. But I just want to say that. That maybe there needs to be a risk assessment of what is the probability variant or something that starts within Canada versus imported from other places as well. And I think we have our own little problems and limitations at every PT level, and I think it needs to be tailored according to resource and et cetera. But when you look at the big picture from a national level, we're also interested in. Level, we're also interested in what are the connections from Ontario to other crops as well. Because if Ontario is such a big hub to get these things or has a higher risk of getting something and spread out and starting, that being the starting point in Canada, for example. Yeah, that's a really good point. Like, do we have that kind of data? Radiation, like inter like interventional sequence data. Jeff's team has done the analysis. Team has done the analysis. Jan? Yeah, I think it's important to note that the higher the vaccination uptake, the lower the cases reported you're going to get as well. Because your symptoms, you're not going to get infected or your symptoms are so mild that you're not going to go and seek health care and you're not even going to be tested because it's so mild. So it'd be nice if cases reported was delineated between cases reported in non-vaccinated. Reported in non-vaccinated versus vaccinated, but that requires linked data, which is much harder to get. Vaccination status being part of routine respiratory infection surveillance. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to me as well. And not something that I had initially thought of. It's a great point for the stratifying. I mean, Kevin is at the end of this going to make a case for better stratification on lab-based data. On lab-based data, and that's an important aspect of it. Okay. But there's the capacity to ask those questions when you're, you know, these forms that people fill out, they can be asked without necessarily having linked data per se by the vaccination status of individuals. I mean, obviously better to do it with linked data, but there would be multiple ways of getting to that data. There's also reporting bias in whether they got vaccinated to someone in healthcare. Vaccinated to someone in healthcare. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So self-report might be a little bit biased. Yeah. Okay. Do you want to go to the discussion questions? I think what we wanted, well, I guess I'll make my pitch or maybe, I don't know, I think, go back to the pyramid for one second. I think for modeling, what we really want is a combination of, well, okay, we want lots of things for modeling. Modeling is a great way. You can do anything. anything. Okay, but one thing I really like for modeling is infections. That, like, from infections come the outcomes. From infections come the wastewater signals. From infections come the dynamics. From infections come the immunity plus vaccination. If you can think about infections, I think you have a much better basis for doing modeling than if you can only think about outcomes or if you can only think about these other things. So I want to make a case for infections, and I'll do that at the end when Kevin makes a case for strategies. The end when Kevin makes a case for stratification. Okay, where was I going with that? Oh, yeah. So, an amazing thing to do would be like what Kevin wrote about in the CMAJ paper and what StratsCan tried to do with this in-spot survey. If anybody has details about that, send it to us because I kind of would have to dig them up. And what the React people did and what the ONS people did. And that's, in a way, it's like great for modeling, especially if you do it every day and idealize things. What we have is these real things, and I'll make the list of the four data. Things and I'll make the list of the four data sources there. And I think we're focusing a bit more on lab-based data because that's one of Kevin's aims from this discussion was to get towards like that guideline that we could say, like, hey, what's a great lab-based respiratory surveillance system? Like, how's like a, do you get a gold star on your system? And that could be a document that could be used to help inspire people. So, in between, like, this sort of terrible stuff we have, terrible in the sense that it's all like routine and Sense that it's all like routine and biased and kind of not quite right in all the ways. And the ideal thing: are there ways that we can push what we have to be a little bit better or a lot better for the purposes of modeling the kinds of things that we all did in the pandemic or elsewhere for the purposes of asking and answering the kinds of questions that policymakers and public health institutions need to know the answers to. So, we're not, you know, experts on how to deliver healthcare systems. I'll speak for myself, but most of us are modelers or statisticians or. Or modelers or statisticians or thinkers in this kind of space. So, the idea of this discussion is to ask: okay, there's these data that we actually have, there's an ideal world that is wonderful and probably not feasible, although we should continue to advocate for those ideal things. What can we do with the data we have? What can we do to push it to be a little better for modeling? And what do we think as a community about that gold standard? What's the gold standard? So, that's the yeah, totally. And I think another dimension of discussion that we could have is like, Discussion that we could have was like around what kind of studies are needed to better understand how surveillance systems actually work. Are there kind of what mathematical approaches that would actually help capture variation in testing practices and how they change over time? And then you can go to rules. You know, what happens, like, are, you know, when respiratory virus surveillance testing changes throughout the year and the winter respiratory season. In the winter respiratory season, you get this massive surge in testing, and then every summertime, people obviously come in to get tested much less. And how could you actually model that to get to infection? Is there a way to leverage modeling to get to infections as well? So both, you know, what data improvements do we need, but also what modeling approaches might be beneficial there. Alright, I'm just putting the data types. And I'm putting these last two. These are the same. You saw them already, but I thought if we're going to type data type X, you might want to know what X ranges over. That's what X ranges over here. And I put these last two in brackets because they're not really considered part of a routine respiratory infection. Part of a routine respiratory infectious disease surveillance program, not because they're not important and wonderful, just because they're not probably likely to be in these routine data sources. Maybe immunity is a bit, you mentioned that there is some vaccination data. So if I could find a little eraser, I could keep the brightness off. Okay, so here's like you know, here's some thoughts that I have around surveillance data. I think, you know, obviously, Obviously, an additional improvement could be greater stratification by health equity-related factors or neighborhood factors. So, one could think of household crowding in the neighborhood. Stats can derive data that's based on the forest rotation area. That would be like a great additional stratification variable. And it's something that provinces could provide because we have postal code information on people that are tested. Are tested. So that would be one additional covariate that would be beneficial to look at. Sorry, there was a practical question raised in the chat of whether the camera can be aimed at the board rather than I don't know. Oh. So people online cannot see the board. Right. I don't know how to do that. Basically, all I'm doing on the board is making notes from the discussion. From the discussion, one thing we could do is get a volunteer to put the things from the board in the Zoom chat so that you at least have them there. Why not put it in the document? Or in the document? Or in the Google Doc. Yeah, can I have a volunteer to just, when we put things on the board, just enter them in the Google Doc so that they're there? Don't everybody jump at once. There won't be a ton because I think we want to leave the screen up. So it's not going to be like the whole conversation. So, this is not going to be like the whole conversation. Thank you, Jesse. Okay. Thanks, Zoom folks. Jesse has kindly volunteered to put a few of these things from the board into the Zoom, into the Google Doc. If you want, you can even take a picture and drop it into the Google Doc. Let's see how complicated they do. I mean, I can't do justice to the Christmas tree. Yeah. You could just take this picture each time we erase a section. Well, I guess those are the real-time problems. Yeah. I'm not here. Yeah. I'm not here. Anyway, just for a description, on the left-hand side of the board, I just listed the data sources: X, lab-based, positive and negative tests, and who they're in, genomics, outcome, immunity, and behavior. Those are the five things. And those were on one of Kevin's slides. And then on the right side, there's like notes from earlier, which Jesse will add. Okay, so what would help these data sources? What are some strengths and limitations of them for you in your work as a modeler or for how you imagine other people's modeling work goes or answering questions? What could be improved about this? For example, Kevin mentioned stratification. And what supplemental things could help these data sources support modeling? Go. The other thing is lab-based surveys. The other thing is, is lab-based surveillance just not even worth dealing with? And should we just burn it down and advocate 100% for maybe we get to TETSCAN? Every week they're going to send out 100,000 people to measure all the respiratory infections. And that sounds expensive to me. Yeah. Michael? Well, since you mentioned staff, Anna. One of the key things is outbreak detection. Is outbreak detection and the sample size for outbreak detection would be enormous. But is there some way one could imagine saying there would be some sort of a triggering event or accumulation of cases that could then be used as the basis for much more targeted sample selection that eventually, as needed, growing to what the UK was doing there without act or the react. Yeah. Yeah, so for outbreak detection, that works a bit differently. I don't think that's done through these really routine things. But if there's a new thing that comes, I think there is a system. Maybe Gordon knows about it. Do you want to say a little bit about? Yeah, I'm just... We're talking here a lot about the data types, the inputs that create possible answers to a whole range of questions. And I think maybe it's worth taking a moment just to be a bit more specific. Taking a moment just to be a bit more specific about the questions and the classes of questions that we want to tackle. There's the detect type question. Is it there? Is it not there? Is it there globally? Is it there locally at the community level? If we think about remote communities, their responses, who detected, the respond within that community, it's about something at that scale, whereas nationally or internationally, it's about does it exist somewhere, what's the threat to Canada? Exists somewhere, what's the threat to Canada, to my province, to my municipality. So there's that detection piece, and then the other piece is the tracking, things like flu, RSV. We know every year it's going to happen, we know we've prepared a bunch of vaccines and tried to deploy it, but what we're concerned about is how is it tracking? Is it looking like a normal year? Is it looking like an inception year? So I think the modelling begins to come in much more when, you know, okay, what is the Of when, you know, okay, what is the expected trajectory for this year? What we're assuming in terms of the characteristics of the pathogen, this is what we're assuming in terms of the characteristics of the susceptible population. And the modelling is about how do we connect those two, say, something sensible. So I think those kinds of questions drive what is different about the pathogen this time or this pathogen. And that's there's a lot of lab work. And that's there's a lot of lab work uh involved in that. It's what are the mutations, what's the phenotype, what do we know in terms of its strengths and weaknesses against our interventions, which drives us to thinking about what are the pathogen characteristics that matter and how do they relate to our possible interventions? Because at the end of the day, the questions are geared towards what can we do ahead. I think that matters, and that's where we start to think about what are the mechanisms of infection transmission intervention. And again, again, biased and coming at it from the genomics perspective, but can we use the genomics to do those predictions of the susceptibilities and kind of provide that input to the modeling? Yeah, this is what we're expecting. We've got this menu of interventions, and these ones. These ones look like they are suitable at the infection level, not so much at the population level, but at that granular level, and then escalate up through the modelling. So Gordon, just to you're off. Like what I see here is like I highlight, Michael had like a great comment that I'm kind of going to fuse with yours a little bit, where it sounds like there's these detectives. You know, there's these detect type questions. There's also this idea that not necessarily everything is going to happen in Ontario, and it's going to be homegrown. And so one piece that I think is incredibly important for doing a lot of different infectious disease modeling is good information on international travel to be able to track aggregation risk. I saw that models were very efficient when you had it. Efficient when you had international flight data at predicting what the probability of when something will start spreading in another country based on some of those thoughts. But I like that distinction between the detect type questions and the projection type questions, where one definitely needs to have this international complement as well as a genomic complement. I mean, everything needs that genomic. I mean, everything is that genomic competence probably connected to outcome data because when there is a new thing, that's what people actually track. They track, like, there's a new unexplained pneumonia in 41 people in the city of Wuhan, and we gather data about that. And then there's the metagenomics that led to the sequencing of the first virus, and there's virus detection. So a new outbreak would often be like a new pneumonia, a new respiratory, you know, severe respiratory. A new respiratory, you know, severe respiratory infection would come up as like a new kind of unexplained pneumonia that isn't coming up positive on the panels of existing respiratory pathogens. And so then there is also this initiative called the First Hundred, where the first hundred cases of a new pathogen, like very detailed data is obtained about those individuals. And like that's a great initiative. And I don't think it's part of this kind of routine public health surveillance conversation, but it is really important. So taking that, I mean, the first hundred gig. Taking that mean the first hundred gives you your baseline, and for everything we're doing, we kind of need that baseline to compare against. But as we saw with COVID, you know, strain A didn't last all that long, strain B came along and emerged, and then all the other variants after that. So we're dealing with something dynamic, which is where the tracking and what is different now as an epidemic or an event progresses. And figuring out what is different, there's two parts. There's the genotype's relatively easy to look at, but does it matter? Is that change important or not? There's thousands of variants that are inconsequential compared to everything else. But what matters is that linkage word that you've got there, link to not just vaccination status, but intervention system. So, what treatments have been. So, what treatments have been applied and how effective were they? Are you talking about clinical treatments? Clinical treatments, maybe non-pharmaceutical interventions as well, if we want to make things really complicated, but think about just the simple or more direct interventions. Like NPIs, like in some kind of time series, because to me that's actually quite easy to do because if the case is on a given date, what NPI. You know what NPIs in your jurisdiction were applied? Yep, when you're looking at it holistically from a statistical perspective, but if you're looking at it mechanistically, so we're looking at populations of people, which are the communities that we are trying to understand the effect on. But the driver to the infections is pathogens. So we need to trace our interactions with the pathogens and how we are shaping. And how we are shaping and influencing will is how are the pathogens different? How do we look at the strains that are circulating and differentiate that that's the one we need to pay attention to? That's the one that's going to give us more trouble than the others. That's the one that we need to develop a different countermeasure to because it looks like we're seeing worse outcomes in the cohort that were treated with that by figuring out how to apply. Apply like figuring out how to apply targeted interventions. Yeah, and that's the one where the timing matters. You know, this is all emerging information. And then going back afterwards, doing more of the quantitative work in terms of how did we do it and what do we learn for the next season. So building the linkages between the lab. The linkages between the lab or building and maintaining the linkages between lab testing, the clinical, the requisition that you saw, and the long-term outcomes, the changes that happen after that initial contact between the patient and the specimen that was done for testing. So those are areas I think where the data needs to well maintained the clinical and public health infrastructure. Clinical and public health infrastructure. And then, yeah, if those linkages are there, then we can work with them potentially. Yeah, so just I think Jane had a question just to cut you off. I'm going to circle back though, because I do have some comments, like thinking about NPIs specifically. We don't have that many NPIs in place anymore at this point, or any. So what would be the equivalent of that? I guess it would be kind of contact information data or Contact information data or contact surveys, right? There's contact surveys, they're also using the genomics directly as a complement to contact tracing. If you can do a phylogeny and show different pathways of infection through multiple individuals through the genomics, you can confer, even calibrate the contact tracing perhaps to say what percentage is being captured or who far is being used. Be captured or the R is being missed. Okay. So genomics. For understanding contacts. Yeah, so you've got two types of linkage. There's linkage between the data sets, but there's also the linkage between cases through genomics, through contact tracing. There are complementary ways of... Yeah, I think the links between people is really important. That's how infections actually spread through contact between people. So if we only capture separate things or aggregated things, we miss that. And I think, you know, as you We missed that. And I think genomics, as you know, I think genomics tend to help with that. But I do think that. But I do want to go to Jane and others. Just quickly to clarify, you're talking about, again, like emerging viruses. You're not talking about seasonal influenza. Seasonal influenza emerges every year and the like you know new variants have. Best to have a line list with phylogeny of cases of seasonal influenza emerges every year. We have multiple incomplete surveillance approaches. If we can link those, we can accentuate the strengths of each of them. And hopefully, on the right time scales, depending on the speed of evolution of a particular pathogen. If it's TB, it's very, very long. If it's TB, it's very, very long. If it's COVID, it's very short. So if you need to piggyback on the normal, like the standard surveillance that we have in our VDSS, for example. After the lab tests that are being done. For influenza? You see those there? We have a good percentage of those so that we can provide feedback to the epidemiologist and say, Have a look at this cohort. Here's a list of case numbers. Have a look at those 'cause from our perspective those are weird. Because, from our perspective, those are weird. Or vice versa. We're seeing different outcomes in these patients. Is there anything that links them? But we can only do that if the linkages are there. What we couldn't do with the travel was we could do some of the linkages, and it was really helpful at showing things like the vaccine effectiveness in travellers for different variants. We could see differences and you know, you can map the movements of the variants. Map and movements of the people better than with movement of people across the country or across the land. Jane, did you have a comment? We keep trying. Let's try again. I was going to say, I was part of developing a protocol for First View 100. And some things that you need to think about are when you're doing the genotyping or whatever, it helps you understand the fitness of different imported. Imported strains or variants, but it also gives you an idea of when you do have a reported case with a different genotype or phenotype, whatever you want to call it, then you can also get a sense if that person hasn't traveled, then you can get a sense of the asymptomatic infections that are coming in as well. And then, when you're looking at your contact tracing or even just doing your genomics, it really helps you identify. That really helps you identify the serial interval that you need to be thinking about. And when you're looking at your age groups and your different severities of infection, the serial interval can be different. So all of those things. I think when we're talking about surveillance too, you can get a lot of surveillance from people to volunteer, but you're not going to get a lot of surveillance in children. And those are questions that we had during COVID and for any infectious disease. COVID and for any infectious disease, how much is it affecting children? So maybe we need to think about a special surveillance program just for children. And then with long-term, with the elderly, we can think about the surveillance or the signaling from long-term care facilities that can really help out with some of those things too. But of course, hospitalization and stuff like that, too. But we need to be thinking about the elderly, the children, and then the rest of the population and surveillance. Rest of the population and surveillance needs to be modified for those different groups. Yeah, I completely like completely agree with that. Stratification by long-term care facility statuses.
