Speaker here Peter Montero from Vad Pariso is going to talk about projection manifolds who stand at Bundle is already. Thank you very much, Frank. Thank you very much for the invitation to the organizers for making this possible. It's really a pleasure to be here. So I will talk about joint work with Vladimir Benedetti at the JON with Juliet Prieto. With Juliet Prieto, ICTP, and Sergio Grancoso and Volparais as well. So I will start with some motivation. Oh, sorry. Motivation of the problem. I mean, historical motivation. Then, as I promise in the abstract, I will tell you some general stuff about Ulrich bundles, how to construct them, what are they, I mean, why are they interacting with? Have I mean, why are they interesting? And then I will show you some new results and well, the ingredients that we used for proving them. And there are many questions in the middle, so I hope that you can catch up some nice problems. I think there are many of them. Okay, so let me start with a very, very, very classical question, which is the following. So you have a So we have a hypersurface, predictive space, which is smooth. This is important for the rest of the talk. And then a very naive question, very classical question, can you express this equation F as the determinant of a matrix of linear forms? In other words, a matrices whose entries are linear forms, right? So it's just by degree reasons the reasons the um the size of this matrix has to be um the degree of the of the function f right um which i call d here and there is i mean this problem is very old i think the first uh full positive answer is by dixon who proved that every plane curve can be written as a determinant of some matrix okay uh in dimension two this is more interesting um Two, this is more interesting. Um, of course, when the degree is one, it's just a linear form, so you can do it right for d equals two. Uh, this is a nice small example. Uh, you have a quadric, right? So you can change the coordinates, and you have this determinant. Everyone see a determinant here, right? Um, and for d equals three, this is a theorem by Kylie. Actually, this is one of the first in such a way you can prove that. Can prove that the result that we saw today, right? That a cubic surface has 27 lines on it. So, this is another way to prove it, a very classical way. But we will see today, I will show you, I mean, sketch, that this is not true when the degree is four or higher. And well, in dimension, oh, sorry, in dimension three or more, we have another problem because of the theory. Problem because of the theory, I don't know, of determinantal varieties, is that if you have a determinant equal to zero and defines a three-dimensional object, for instance, this object is singular. So it's not a good thing if you want to look at the smooth hypersurfaces. But you can change slightly the question using Hilbert and Stelensat, right? So you can ask: can you find A matrix of linear forms such that the determinant is the power of your equation, f to the r. So, right now, for degree reasons, the size of your matrix is Rd, right? So, this is the question. As you will see, it's a tricky question, but it was fully answered by Arnobo Villa. I'll debate, I mean, some years ago, 20 years ago. And it's a very nice answer. So, if you have such a hypersurface, then the positive answer to our question, namely that f, a power of f is the determinant of a matrix, is equivalent to the existence of a vector bundle of rank r, where r is exactly this number here, the power that you are looking at. The power that you are looking at with a linear resolution. So you have your vector bundle, of course. Here I am abusing of notation. You should push forward if you want to, but you know, and also I am identifying the shift of sections and the geometric vector boundary, as you may know. Okay. So you have a linear resolution, and here you have precisely your matrix. So I won't give you the proof. The proof is on Bovil's paper, but let me just say a word. If you have the linear resolution, then the determinant of this L vanishes exactly on X. So by Hilvernus-Tellensatz, L is a multiple of a power of F, and by degree of reasons, you get the results. And the other side is more subtle. Once you have your matrix, like on the left, you can produce the map here from the first. The map here from the first to the second factor, and you can define the coconut to be e. And the tricky part is to show that this is locally free, and you can use commutative algebra stuff like Oslander bound theorem, whatever. It's a computation. I'm not saying that this is easy, but this is the main result, the full answer. And actually, Bobil also proved that this vector bundle E can be characterized in terms of some common. Characterized in terms of some comological conditions. Okay, that's also part of the content of this thing. And this last part was generalized by Asimov Schreier Weyman to any smooth variety, if you want, polarized variety. In other words, it's an embedded variety. You need to see this variety inside some fixed projected space. Okay. And once you have this fixed polar. Fixed polarized variety, a vector bundle, well, admits a linear resolution from zero, minus one, minus codimension. Of course, here the codimension is just one, so it's a short linear resolution. This is equivalent actually to these four conditions. The first one is very geometric. You take your variety inside some projective space, you project, you take a linear projection, which is finite, and you ask. Which is finite, and you ask that the push forward is a trivial vector value. This is very useful. I mean, this is very geometric, but it's very useful if you want to prove, for instance, semi-stability and stuff like that. So you have also a vanishing of many homology groups. Okay. And I have this fourth one, which I will write on the blackboard, which is a vanishing condition of 2n. condition of two n homology groups. So we have a h i of e minus i has to be zero for every i greater than one, so one to the n, right? And h j e minus j minus one has to be zero for every g from zero to n minus one. And well, all these conditions are equivalent. And well, all these conditions are equivalent. And if any of this is satisfied, we say that E is an Ulrich band with respect to the polarization, if you want. So this is the definition. It's very, very nice because it generalizes this observation, but this theorem by Bobil. And there are some very nice consequences. Very nice consequences for this kind of bundles. First of all, as I just told you, this depends on an embedding or equivalently on a very ample line bundle, H, right, that you can use to embed your variety. And then this vector bundle is arithmetically coem-maccolet, ACM, with respect to H. Okay? So here you have to be very careful because it's actually respect to H. For instance, just to a remark, you know this Horrocks theorem, right? You know this Horrocks theorem, right? That says that if you have a vector bundle on the projective space, this is a direct sum of line bundles if and only if E is O1 ACM ACM. Okay. This is Horror's theorem, a homological characterization of being a split vector bundle. Split vector bundle. But as you will see in a few minutes, the tangent bundle of P2, which is not the sum of two line bundles, is actually O2 ACN. So you have to be careful because we will prove that this is, I mean, we'll see what that this is an ultras bundle, but of course it's not split. Okay, so just a remark to be careful. What else? Ah, this is very important. This is very important. You can also show that the global sections, the dimension of the global sections, is the rank of the bundle times the degree. This is also important, so I will write it somewhere, maybe here. Some property is that H0 XE is the rank of any degree of X, where the degree, as you may know, is just the self-intersection of this very ample linement. Self-intersection of this very ample element. And this is very important for historical reasons because Ulrich actually was looking at modules, finally generated ACM modules over coin macular rings. And actually, this is the maximum number of generators. So he asked, when do we have actually the maximum number? Where can it be reached? Right? This is the. Reached, right? This is the original motivation from commutative algebra. But in geometric terms, it's a very nice formula for the global sections. Actually, it's very funny because in Cessor talk, we saw like half of this half of the dimension, actually, or at the degree. I don't know. I don't remember, but it's kind of similar formula. I don't know if they're related or not. Okay, another important thing that also maybe I will write is that. Maybe I will write is that E is globally generate. Actually, it's stronger, it's all zero regular in a sense of custom manford, but this implies that it's globally generated. This bundles also behave very well with respect to hyperplane sections. You have your X and you take a hyperplane section, you can, of course, restrict your bundle. Restrict your bundle, restrict your polarization, and you give a new, you have a new Urich bundle. This is very nice from this point of view. You can take also, of course, since this is a homological definition. You can take direct sums and you can get also new examples, for example. As I just told you, the direct sum is a new example. So you cannot expect actually that Auric bundles to be stable, right? But there are. Right, but they are semi-stable. In other words, you know, for any non-zero subshift F, the slope that we saw also in Cesar talk is less than the, of F is less than the slope of E. So this is very nice. Actually, there are G-Sec curves stable and they're not always stable, but a funny fact, if you want, is that for these bundles, for rubility bundles, slow stability is equivalent. Log instability is equivalent to Giesecker instability. This is just a nice property as well. And so, the main conjecture question already in the work of Ulrich is that, is it true that every projective variety, polarized projective variety, carry an old response? So, this is the main question of the talk. I mean, of the topic, actually. So, I have to also warn you that even in the future, Also, warn you that even in the few cases that I will show you in a few minutes where the answer is actually positive, that we can actually show an Ulrich bundle, it is quite difficult to determine the optimal answer. So the minimum rank that works. I will show you examples that are a little bit crazy. Even for very simple examples, like quadrics, smooth quadrics, this can be very wild, I would say. Very wild, I would say. Okay. So, questions so far? No? Okay. Okay. Let me let me give you a glimpse on some of the known cases and actually many of the known cases. These are, how to say it? This question started with the work of Ulrich, who essentially went commutative algebra in the 80s, right? Then it was, how to say, it has a second life. Say it has a second life with the works of Bovir, Estenbad Freyer, women, and it has a third life right now, which is a more geometric approach, I mean, rather than a commutative algebra approach to try to produce these bundles. So this is kind of the third life of this question. So, first of all, on the projective space, you have Urich bundles of any rank. You have the trivial vector bundle. This is good. Bundle, this is good, and essentially, yeah, as I saw, as I told you, by the Horrocks theorem, you are kind of looking at the same kind of bundle. I mean, morally speaking. On the quadric, a smooth quadric of dimension N, actually the spinner bundles constructed by Ottaviani, right, are Ulrich bundles. So you can show that. And actually, that's the And actually, that's the best you can do. This is the rank of these bundles, and this is actually the Ulrich complexity of the quadrat. So, this is huge, it's exponential on the dimension. If I give you a very simple, going back to the original question, if I give you a very simple equation of a quadrat, right? Like x0 square, xn, x square. n x square to the r equals to the determinant of something well this is actually the r is huge even for this simple example um okay uh and as i told you before um it's not always true that you can do that trick uh with r equals to one in other words with a line bundle ulrich line bundle Line bundle, Ulrich line bundle for say quadric surfaces, surfaces of degree four, even. And the reason of that is because this is a general statement that if you have a hypersurface with a degree, of course, greater than two. Otherwise, you can do it, of course, with Picard one. Then there's no Ulrich Line Bamboo. So, first of all, let me just tell you that by left. Let me just tell you that by Lebschet's hyperplane section theorem, this condition is automatic if the dimension of the hypersurface is three or higher. And for surfaces in P3, you have this beautiful Netro-Levschetz theorem that says that a general surface has pica rank one, right? So in particular, you have a negative answer for surfaces for the very original question. So let me give you a Question. So let me give you an argument. This is actually very funny. So, first of all, as I told you, the URI condition is a homological thing. It's written on the blackboard. And so one of the conditions is that the H naught of your vector bundle, of your candidate, twisted by minus one, has to be zero. In vector bundle slang, I think this is called. In a vector bundle slang, I think this is called like initialize it, I'm correct. Initialize it vector bundle. And the other thing is that you have this nice formula for the global sections is the rank, which is one, times the degree, which is D. Okay. So since your light bundle is a multiple of your generator, the first identity is A minus one, right? And the second is A. And this, of course, is zero. The other one is not zero. So the only possibility is. zero so the only possibility is that a is equal to one right is the only thing that happen sorry uh right but if a is equal to one well you to zero sorry i'm sorry to zero um you replace here you have the that h0 has to be one so the degree is one and then you are finished so this is a nice argument that shows you that uh in general you cannot expect to have ulrich line bundles Ulrich Leimbandos. That's like, uh, however, uh, there is a very nice result by Baglin, Hersov, and Ulrich that says that on every smooth, every smooth, complete intersection, you have an unreal bundle, sorry, of maybe very large rank. But you have it. And the proof is uses essentially commutative algebra. Okay, it's very algebraic proof. Okay, it's great. It's great. So, another very important example are Grossmanians. So, you have actually have homogeneous vector bundles. This is a work by Costa Miroroy, Costa and Miroroy, sorry. And there are partial results for rational homogeneous spaces. So, you have how to say if the group is simple of, if the Picard rank of this thing is one, I think this is. One. I think this is okay. Even for the exceptional ones, there are recent results. But as long as the PCR rank is two or higher, then you have only partial results. Okay, so a nice thing, I mean, the only dimension in which we have a very full answer is for curves. For curves, we have actually the following result by Acem and Schreier and Wayman: that every curve. Weyman that every curve carries a Ulrich line bundle. In particular, we can reprove the Dixon result at the very beginning that every plane curve can be written as a determinant of a metric of linear forms in a very real way, right? So, well, this is true. And actually, the thing is that for curves, your vanishing conditions are very simple because you have, I mean, you have essentially two dimensions of homology to check, I mean, two possibilities. Check, I mean, two possibilities. Uh, so the first one is H one E minus one, and the second one is H0 of E minus one. So it's okay. And so you define this guy to be L. No. Yeah, you define this guy to be L. So you want to check this vanishing, you use Raymond Rocket. Vanishing, you use Riemann Rock essentially, and you prove that a very general line bundle. Say, I mean, if you want, you have the Picard variety of line bundles of degree G minus one, you have the theta divisor, and then you take some guy outside, and this works. And then you twist, so you get the original E. You twist back, right? And this, so you have this Ulrich Leigman. This is just an easy computation, but it's very, very nice. Potation buttons is very, very nice. So every curve carries a Uric line button. And for surfaces, actually, the picture is quite open, I would say. First of all, there are some new results for blow-ups of, but I will say that even the question of if you have a surface and you have the blow-ups of this surface, it's already subtle. It's already subtle to produce a new punzel upstairs. So, but if we restrict ourselves to minimal surfaces, the answer is yes for codaira dimension minus infinity by the work of Casanellas Harcher, Miro-Roic, Point Joppins. For Codaira dimension zero, this is because of the work of Bovil, Aprodu, Farkas Ortega, Faienci. I have to say here that the I have to say here that the most difficult case are K-3 surfaces. This is the most difficult case. Historically, first it was proven for general key tree surfaces and then for any key tree surface. And for Codaider dimension one or two, actually this is quite open. There are examples that many, I mean, families where this works. Many families where this works, but it's essentially open. So we have a lot of work. That's a good thing. And for trifles, besides, I don't know, homogeneous spaces and products and stuff like that, the only thing that we know, if I'm not wrong, are Fano trefolds. Fanal triple. So this was done by Bobil. Actually, not every Fano Trifles, as you may know. Maybe I can define Fano. Maybe I can define Fano. So let me recall that X is Fano, X smooth projective is Fano if the anti-canonical bundle is ample. And if the dimension of X is equals to 3, there are exactly 105 families of these guys. There are 17 of Picar Rang 1. Of Picard rank one, and there are 87 plus one of Picard rank two. I write it in that way because the Picard rank one case was done by Iskovsky in the end of the 70s. And then Mori and Mukai used Mori theory, minimal model program, to produce the 87 that are over there. That was in the 80s. And then in 2003, they find a missing guy, which is the one over there. Which is the one over there, okay? So, but okay, I will only for a subset actually of these 17 families, you can produce all respondents. Okay, so that was kind of our starting point, actually, because we wanted to produce some new examples on treefuls. Three folds, right? So, let me tell you how to construct Ulrich bundles. Essentially, there are more or less besides the commutative algebra stuff by Ulrich essentially, there are more or less four geometric methods to construct these guys. Okay, I will explain two of them, the ones in green. Well, the first one is Nova Lefschetz type arguments used by Aprodur, Farkas Ortega for K tree surfaces. For K-3 surfaces. The second one is the Kailiba Karak and Harshan Sur construction by Bovil. I mean, it was around. The third one is the formation of theory arguments. This is very nice, actually. I won't explain anything about it, but in a few words, the idea is that you produce some ships which are not locally free, but that satisfy your numerical conditions that I will tell you, and then you defer. That I will tell you, and then you defirm inside the module space to get a locally free example, which is not, of course, not explicit at all. Okay. And the third, sorry, the fourth method is by the channel classes that we saw today, right? So let me just recall you the Kaili Vaccarak property with a drawing that's very classical. So, the thing is that you have a surface, this works for surfaces very well, and you have a subset, sub-scheme, maybe locally complete intersection, I didn't write it, on the surface, and you say that it verifies the Kailibakaract property with respect to some line bundle. If you take a curve inside, let me, for instance, the most typical examples are all. Are all cubics on P2, right? So you take, for instance, nine points, which lines on the intersection of two cubic curves, which are the generated in my drawing, are 11 and nine lines. And the Kailabakarak theorem or property tells you that if you have a curve on this linear system, On this linear system, which passes through all of these points except for one, eight in this case, then it has to pass through the last one. This is Kaili Vagram. And you can, I mean, write it down in a more general setting, but this is the idea, right? So the thing is that if you have this Kylie-Bakarak condition, then you can use the Harshan cert. Then you can use the Hershon-Sur condition, you produce an extension of the ideal shift of this sub-scheme. And this condition ensures that this shift is not only a shift, not only a coherent shift, but it's locally free. This is very nice. If you want to read the proof, this is on the book of Heubreka and Len, somewhere. You can check out the appendix. It's a very nice proof. And the important thing, Important thing is that once you have this exact sequence, you can compute the first churn class, actually the terminant of this E, and the second churn class as well, which is the Z. So this is very nice. We have a very nice description of the churn classes of E. And if life is good and everything is perfect, then if you have luck, which is sometimes the case, you can produce. Sometimes the case, you can produce a very, I mean, a suitable set of points in such a way this works. For instance, let me just tell you, because this works actually in some examples that I just mentioned to you before. You have a surface, right, inside PN, capital N. You take M plus two points. Of course, this satisfies Kayli-Bakeric condition. Just because you're inside a PN. Think about it. Think about it. But it works, right? I just do linear algebra if you want. Okay. Actually, it works. That's surprisingly funny and beautiful. Well, so you have your exact sequence, you have your vector bundle, and by tensoring by some convenient line bundle, you produce, well, I mean, you have a lot of freedom, of course, of produce new vector bundles. If you have luck, you have an Ulrich bundle. Have luck, you have an Ulrich bundle. But the main question is, of course, how to guess this guy, the right guy, the right line bundle. And this is the fourth method that I mentioned before. This is by using churn classes. So this is a result by Casnati, John Franco Casnati, which tells you that if you have a surface and you have a vector bundle of rank R, then Well, as I told you, the Ulrich condition translates into twice the dimension vanishing in comology. Okay, so in this case, it's four comology vanishings. So the content of this statement is that you can reduce these four vanishings to two convenient vanishings, H0, which is good, right? We all love global sections, H2, which is also good because you have several. H2, which is also good because you have served all essentially global sections, and two numerical conditions involving term classes. So it's very nice because you can guess which L some times and actually works. You can produce, for instance, in, I don't know, here's a brook surface. Yes, I think that's the proof, etc. And also, I have to mention that this, this, I mean, this was, of course, our starting point, try to. Of course, our starting point, try to understand more easy conditions to construct or to verify that the bundle is URI in higher dimensions. So I have to mention this remark by Angelo Felicia Lopez that says that you have a polarized n-fold, so dimension n, of Picard rank one, then the first turn class is very special. The rank, a half of the rank times this device. It's very, very explicit, very nice. So, our first, I mean, observation is just a remark if you want, but this is very useful. This is slow blem. Okay, so let me write it because I will use it again. So, slow blem is that, well, the slope, right? But let me just write it in an equivalent way. Write it in an equivalent way. The first general class of E dot H minus one is the rank divided by two, the canonical divisor plus m plus one times h dots h. So this formula will come again many times. And well, that was our small starting point. Our small starting point, and actually, we get analog analog results for triples. We can prove some identities, alakasnati, in other words, some comology vanishing and some identities on the churn classes on trifolds. So, since it's a trifold, you have to look at the first churn class times h squared, the second churn class time h, and the third churn class. Age and the third churn class. So, and you have this. I won't put it on the blackboard because it's a mess, but you have it, you can check it in principle. And I have to say also that there is a very recent work by Chiro Ciliberto, Flamini, and Knudsen that says that you can also reformulate this vanishing plus churn classes formula into some, I think, one less vanish, some churn class formula. Some churn-class formulas, which are the same that we found, and the existence of a very special curve on this treefold. This is very nice, actually. Anyway, just a remark, if you are interested. I have to say, when we were at this point, actually, we changed the direction of things because we noticed that this slope lemma was useful to study the possibility. To study the positivity of the tangent bundle. And that's why the name of the talk is a variety with a tangent Ulrich bundle and not new examples on trifles because we changed the direction once we realized it, then we can use this to study positivity of the tangent bundle. So actually, it's a nice question. I'm very interested if you want to produce new examples on triple. This actually will be super nice. Even for a vignette triple. Super nice. Even for a Billian treefold, we don't know. Okay. So let me give you the results. So, as I just told you, the change of direction was the fact that the slope lemma can be used to study positivity of the tangent bubble. So let me just recall you a very, very, very nice result by book. By Buxom de Media Pon Peternelle, BDPP, right? And which is the following. So if you have a X smooth projective manifold, and you have a movable curve, I won't explain what it is properly. It's just a class of a curve which moves in a family. For the sake of this talk, Uh, for the sake of this talk, the main example is your very ample line bundle, you intersect with itself in such a way you have a curve, right? And this is a movable curve. This is the only example that you need, okay? And the thing is that you have, once you have a curve, a movable curve, you can define the slope of a shift, right? Like in the formula that I just gave you a few slides before. Few slides before. And so you can have stability in oceans and you can have a hardened narrow SIMA filtration. And this is very nice because you have a stability condition, which depends on your curve, alpha, and you look at the hardener similar filtration of the tangent bundle. So this gives you like a filtration of your bundle, right? You have this graded pieces, right? The quotient. Graded pieces, right? The quotient, the semi-stable quotients, and you have the slopes, right? And the beautiful thing about this hardened narrow small filtration is that the slopes are ordered, right? It's a strictly increasing sequence. So you have the notion of a minimal slope, and you have the notion of a maximum slope. And this is the most beautiful thing, I think, is very geometric, very beautiful, is that the Geometric, very beautiful, is that the condition that the minimal slope is positive, yeah, strictly positive, is equivalent to the fact that x is rationally connected. In other words, that every two points can be joined by a chain of rational curves. And the fact that the maximal slope is positive is equivalent to the fact that x is uniro. So, it's a very beautiful numerical characterization of some rational properties. Okay. So, just wanted to say, this is a slope thing, right? And we have a slope thing right over there. So we have to use it, right? So we changed everything. And the natural question right now is: okay, constructing Ulrich bundles is very difficult. It's very non-explicit. Non-explicit. So we have to take the question the other way around. Can we find some canonically attached bundles on your variety which are ultimate? If so, morally speaking, the variety should be very special, right? This is the moral thing. So the first attempt was to look at the tangent bundle and the cotangent bundle. Okay. So before stating the main result, let me give you some examples. So for curves, you have a degree. You have a degree D curve of genus G. Of course, the cotangent bundle is just a canonical device, already. And the Ulrich condition, which is written over there, is that this homology H1 has to vanish. And by servuality, this is just H0 of H, which gives you your embedding into the projective space. So it's not zero. So it's not zero. Oh, okay. It's never Ulrich. The tangent bundle, however, well, the same thing gives you some condition on comology, some vanishing on comology, just the Ulrich condition. And you can check just by playing with Grimmer Rock, it's an exercise if you want, that this is non-zero if the genus of the curve is at least one. So you only have to deal with P1. And once again, And again, once again, you put it, you know the canonical device for P1, you put it inside, you check the conditions, and you get some easy inequalities. And actually, the only possible answer that actually works is that D equals 3. In other words, you have the twisted cubic on P3. This is the only curve with the Ulrich's tangent button. Okay, this is a nice example. Now, let me give you some examples for surfaces. For surfaces. So once again, you have a surface on Pn of degree D, which is the H squared. And you ask if the cotangent fund is Ulrich. So once again, the slope lemma, which is written over here, tells you that the first turn class, which is the canonical device over definition, dot H has to be some stuff to, I mean, this is super easy, right? So you show therefore that H squared has to be zero, which is impossible. Has to be zero, which is impossible. So the cotangent bundle is never Ulrich for surfaces. Let me give you how to say a sketch in the case of the tangent bundle, but not for Ulrich bundles, but for special Ulrich bundles. So first of all, let me give you the general definition. An Ulrich bundle is said to be special if the rank is two, so rank two vector bundle, and they determine. And the determinant is the canonical divisor plus m plus one h. So as you may see on the blackboard, this special condition implies the slope inequality, because of course it's not equivalent unless the Picard rank is one, for instance. It's a stronger condition that implies that you know, of course. That implies that you know, of course, the first term class, but it's more than that. Okay, well, this is not just a funky definition, it actually comes from the original problem. If you have a rank two vector bundle on a hypersurface, it gives you an equation to the square, right, by the original discussion. And actually, this is special Urich bundles arise from the following question. When can you write the form F as the Faffian of some matrix? The Faffian of some matrix. You have the chance to be a Faffian because it's a F squared. And this is actually equivalent to the existence of an older special order bundle. So it's actually interesting because of that. Okay, so let me sketch the proof once you have the, once the tangent bundle is special. Okay, so well, you have this first term class, which is equal to this guy. First of all, by definition, the first First of all, by definition, the first term class is the anti-canonical bundle, and it has to be the canonical class 3H. In other words, twice the anti-canonical is 3H. So we, oh, I erase it. I know, it's here. So the surface is Fano. But for surfaces, we don't use the word Fano, we use Del Petzo, right? So it's a Del Petzo surface. That's very nice because we know very well the Del Petzo surfaces are P2. Are P2, the blowout P2 up to eight points in general position, and P1 times P1. So in particular, you know very well the Picard group. It's a torsion free group. It's a set to some Picard rank. But very concretely, the equality minus canonical equals 3H, you should think it as an equality of vectors in a lattice. So you can resolve, I mean, you can easily convince yourself. Easily convince yourself that the only way that this is possible is the anti-canonical is three times some ample device. And now, maybe this is an overkill, but I have to tell you. There's a very nice theorem by Koyashio Shi that says the following. By definition, funo variety has ample anti-canonical devices. So the anti-canonical The anti-canonical can be written as some integer I call i of x times some ample device. The maximum of this number is called the final index or your variety. And you can show by Riemann Rock that this index is actually between one and the dimension plus one. For example, if the projective space, the well, you know, the anti-canality. The well, you know, the anti-canonical device or n plus one and hyperplane. So the final index is n plus one. And the Kovayashi-Shai theorem says that the converse is true. Actually, for quadrics as well. But anyway, I won't enter into the details. So here we have n plus one, which is three. So it has to be p2. And once it's p2, and then everything is clear because you know the anti-canonical divisor, so you can resolve this equation. Can resolve this equation and find that H has to be O2. And you know, this surface is the Veronese surface in P5. So, this is an example. And, well, of course, this is a candidate. And then you check by classical vanishing theorems that it actually works. I don't know, but vanishing if you want. Okay. So, the theorem is that these are the only examples. So, you have, first of all, that the cotangent bundle is never Ulrich bundle. Tangent bundle is never Ulrich bundle, and that the only varieties, polarized varieties with the Ulrich tangent bundle are the twisted cubic and the Veronese surface. This is the theorem. So let me give you some ingredients. Okay, sorry, maybe before that, some questions so far? Questions so far? About the standard? Okay. So let me give you some some Let me give you some a list of ingredients. So just for, I don't know, just for fun, if you want, it's a remark, that for surfaces, you can give a proof, a low-tech proof if you want, only using classical birational geometry of surfaces, plus one ingredient, which is a radar solution to Fujita conjecture. Let me just recall you what Fujita conjecture. Let me just recall you what Fujita conjecture is. If you have an ample line bundle, A on a variety, you know that a multiple has to be very ample, okay? But it's hard to guess this multiple. For curves, you can say things, but the Fujita conjecture says that if you have this bundle, A plus you multiply by N plus 2 and you add the canonical divisor, this is very important. This is very important. And the only case where we know that the answer is true is for surfaces. This is a theorem by Rader. And it's a very nice criterion that tells you if you have a very nice divisor, B, then Ks plus D is very ample unless very, very concrete conditions that, of course, this M plus 2 has to be. M plus 2 has to be for H. They don't hold. That's the proof, essentially. I mean, of course, I'm simply oversimplifying it, but this is a key ingredient. And only using this ingredient, you can give actually a proof for surfaces with, I mean, not passing through the next things that I will tell. Okay. But for the general case, we need the following ingredients. First of all, Ingredients. First of all, a very small remark is that the tangent bundle for Pn is not Ulrich for P3 or higher dimension. This is just a computation because what is H0 of the tangent bundle, the global vector fields? This is the Lie algebra of the automorphism group of your variety. So it's the dimension of the Lie algebra SL. SL M plus one. And you can compute it. This is less than the expected dimension. That one of the properties of being Ulrich is that the H naught is the rank times the degree. And you can check by hand, but this is not possible if the dimension is too, I mean, three or high. That's it. That's just a remark that you cannot hope that P3 has a tangent, Ulrich tangent bond. Another thing is that. Another thing is that our slope lemma tells you actually that your variety has to be rationally connected if the tangent or the cotangent bundle is Ulrich. So it's just a computation, but you have to do it, but you actually compute, you argue that the minimal slope is strictly positive. So it's rationally connected. A very nice thing about rationally connected varieties is the same thing as P. Is the same thing as PN, they don't have holomorphic one-forms. So the cotangent bundle cannot be Ulrich because there's no sections. So it finished. So, okay. So we have to deal with the tangent bundle. And the second very classical result, very beautiful result is if the tangent bundle is globally generated, which is the case because Ulrich bundles are globally generated, then the Globally generated, then the variety has to be homogeneous. In other words, it has to be an abelian variety times a rational homogeneous space, G mod P. However, it's a rationally connected variety, and abelian variety has a lot of differential forms. So you cannot have this abelian variety factor. And once again, a small remark. Okay, we read off of the abelian variety, but it's still super interesting to produce already. But it's still super interesting to produce all ref bundles over there. We only know it for elliptic curves and surfaces. So, just a remark. Okay, so we have to deal with rational homogeneous spaces. And a very nice thing is that once again, the slope lemma gives you a bound for the dimension of H naught, which is the dimension of the Lie algebra of the automorphism group. So you have, in principle, So you have, in principle, a lot of automorphisms. And then you need this guy. So this table is, well, this is the geometry. Sorry? Yeah, it's a parabolic, but maximal parabolic, which in geometric terms, I know that, I mean, you have all this Li algebra language, but in algebraic geometry, Language, but in algebraic geometry language, the Picard rank is one. So, oops, sorry. So, for Picard rank one homogeneous spaces, you have this very nice table that gives you the dimension of the Lie algebra G, which is the automorphism groups, and the dimension of the geometric object, the variety. So you can check in principle your condition, your bound for the dimension of the global section. It's not very funny, at least for the section. It's not very funny, at least for the exceptional ones, it's quite easy. You spend some minutes and you convince yourself that it's not possible. And then for the classical one, well, you have to do it, right? And you, oops, sorry. And you will get a finalist that I will tell you right now. So in the sketch of the proof, which is the end of the tone. So as I promised, for surfacing, you can give a low-tech. You can give a low-tech proof. Let me give you the proof, a sketch at least, and it's the following. So, for the sake of the talk, I won't use the Radar theorem because I won't enter into the details. It's longer. So, I will use this result by Campana Pound to get a shortcut. So. So, the slope lemma gives you this that the intersection of the canonical divisor with your very ample length bundle has to be negative. In other words, your canonical divisor is not so defective. Because so defective divisor, if you want a definition, that intersection with very with every ample divisor has to be positive or zero. And once again, BDPP tells you that this is equivalent to being uni-room. Equivalent to being uni-room. But actually, we have more here. We have that is rational connected. So I will directly use that. So this by rational to be true. Then, but in general, just to mention it very quickly, in general, you have that S is rationally equivalent to some curve times P1, and you use this Rader theorem to prove that actually gamma is P1. But for the sake of the time, I won't do that. So you pick a general curve by Bertini. This is a smooth, irreducible curve. You compute the genus, but you know a lot of these intersection numbers. So you have a very explicit formula, and the genus has to be positive. So the degree has to be four. And what you replace, and then you have that intersection of the canonical divisor with H has to be. Canonical divisor with h has to be minus six. Okay, on the other hand, you have Casnati identities which tell you also what happens with the second churn class, which is the Euler characteristic that we saw today. So you have a formula for the second for the Euler class. I mean, using only the fact that this Ulrich, and then you use the netter formula to simplify this. simplify this this this uh oul characteristic to this quantity one over five k square minus four and since it's birational to p2 and the oil character the oil characteristic of the structure shift is a virational invariant then has to be the same as p2 which is one and then you have a rational surface with canonic and with k square equals to nine i by classical classification of of minimal rational surfaces has to be p2 and then everything To be p2, and then everything works, and finally, uh, for the case of uh high dimensions, pig R1. Well, as I told you, the Ulrich condition implies that the automorphism group is big. And you have this big table, you have a lot of patience, you check that the only possible homogeneous varieties we have big automorphism groups are the projected space, the quadric, and this Grassmannian 25 of planes inside C5. Inside C5. Okay. And actually, you can say more because if the dimension is odd, then you can actually refine this bound and you can reduce yourself since you know that the projective space is not an example, as I told you before. You reduce yourself to the even-dimensional quadric and this Grass Manion. And this is just a computation for the even-dimensional quadric. Dimensional quadric, the degree, how to say, has to be there's typo. Sorry. Well, I'm sorry. Well, you know that the Ulrich condition, I mean, this slope lemma gives you this, that the H ser of the tangent bundle has to be. H ser of the tangent bundle has to be the dimension times the degree n plus one. Ah, sorry, that's the degree times some integer. Okay, and you know that this is the dimension of the automorphism group. And you can compute it because you know it is the classical G algebra. And just by parity reasons, on the left side is even, on the right side is odd, it's impossible. And for the Grasmanian, once again, you have that the Have that the H naught has to be the dimension of your variety, which is six, because it's the rank of the tangent bundle, don't forget about that, times the degree, which you don't know, and has to be the dimension of this V algebra, which is 24. In other words, the degree has to be four, which is impossible, because you know that this is a very classical, actually final variety. It's the graph minus two, five, it's a degree five. It's a degree five variety inside P9 by the Pluker embedding. You take several hyperplane sections and you get the Del Petzo surface of degree five, right? And well, this is impossible because of, again, this has to be a multiple of five. So that's more or less the sketch of the proof. And just to finish, just the general case is, I mean, you cannot avoid Lie algebra stuff, unfortunately. I mean, unfortunately. I mean, unfortunately, if you want, you have to do it using Lie algebra things. You can show that the Picard group of this homogeneous space is generated by homogeneous line bundles. Then the canonical can be written, therefore, as a combination of them. And each coefficient has to be strictly positive. And you show this is a computation with Lie algebra that there's no dilemma that this. That the slope lemma, that is a necessary condition, does not hold if one of the coefficients is strictly less than the dimension. Okay? In other words, you only have to care about homogeneous varieties in such a way that the coefficient is greater or equal than the dimension. Let me just tell you one thing. If the Picard rank is one, this condition tells you exactly that the Fano index is n or n plus one. Is n or n plus one. And by the Covayashi-Shay theorem, it has to be the projective space of a quadrant. But if the pico rank is higher, of course, you can have a very strange vector. I don't know. All the entries are relatively prime or something. And the final index can be one. I don't know. You lose control of the final index because it's a vector right now. Well, so you have to do it by hand and you show that. It by hand, and you show that the only possibilities are pn, the quadric, and p1 times pn minus 1. And once again, you show by hand that the last one does not have a Ulrich tangent bond. And that's a proof. Just to finish, let me tell you, as I already mentioned, that even for available varieties, it's very interesting. I think that it's worth to look at available tree folds. We actually We actually have a small comment that if an avenue tree will have an special Ulrich bundle, then it has to carry a very special curve. But I don't know how to produce this curve or to prove that it does not exist. I don't think they are. No, I don't think, yeah. I don't think they are. No, I don't think, yeah. So, well, this is, I think, a very concrete and nice question. And of course, this idea of using Campana-Pan theorem and BDPP is often used in the context of foliations as well. There is a notion of fanofoliation, which is an extension of phanovarieties. There are works by Stéphane Druel and By Stefan Druel and Carolina Raúl about them about that. So it's a natural question to look at maybe at Ulrich foliations. I think maybe it can be interesting and they should impose some restriction on the variety, on the foliation maybe. And another thing is, okay, the cotangent bundle is not Ulrich, but what about some twist of the cotangent bundle? Actually, I know that Angelo Felicillope is actually also working on the Also, working on the twist of the tangent bundle. But the cotangent bundle, I think, is interesting because varieties of general type tend to have a positive cotangent bundle. And just to finish, I think it would be very, very interesting to look at the quotients of the ball. These are varieties of general type with ample canonical divisor. These are on the these varieties. Varieties verify the quality in the Bogomolov-Mediao Kayau inequality, so are very interesting. And also they are very interesting because Arnobovil has a possible counter-example of the non-existence of Ulrich Bundle on a surface of this type, which comes from a work of Blasius and Blasius and Rogaski, which is a the name is motifs for Hilbert modular forms. They constructed some surfaces and Boville said that maybe this could be a conterexample, but I mean, there's still a lot of work to do. So, well, let me finish with that. Thank you very much for the very nice question. Any question in the audience here? What about the Zoom audience? No? Oh, there are no questions, then let's thank Pedro again for his very nice talk. Now we have 10 minutes break, and then there will be the last.
