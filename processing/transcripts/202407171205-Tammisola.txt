Thank you. Today I'm going to talk about elastometic fluid flow that's in randomized corros media. But before I do that, I wanted to introduce my group. So here we are in June, about to go canoe and it's this June. And I think we look a little bit nervous because Bit nervous because we are not used to water. Water is a Newtonian fluid, and almost everyone works either with years fluids or pixel-stick fluids. And most of us also work with simulations, so we do from low to high Reynolds numbers and often also multi-phase flows, particles, droplets, wetting, and so forth. Yes, but what I'm going to present today is not by the people, not by us who went anywhere, but it's rather by alumni of the Rather, by alumni of the group. So, the recent work is by Emad and Zaid to London, and also some of the results that I will refer to, which are previous results, are also together with Dalet. And of course, our collaborators try to mark up the results. Yeah, so I think you have seen a few definitions of useless fluid. Yeah, this is what I usually use, the very phenomenological one. Very phenomenological one. So basically, we can think about user fluid as behaving like a soft solid if the local stress level is lower than the users. And as soon as we go above the users, then it will start to flow like a pupil. So this is a very simplified description, of course. So if we take a tube of toothpaste and we put it upside down, the toothpaste doesn't immediately just flow out because it behaves like a soft solid. Because it behaves like a soft solid. But if you start squeezing the tube, then you can create enough stress near the walls, so you can fluidize near the walls. Whereas in the middle, the material is still like a solid plug. So you get this what we call unhealthy and yielders. And again, so toothpaste is not the only users to it, but it's very common in natur nature and industry to have users. And this is from the Andrew Review here. From the Android review of them. So, I wanted to also point out this use fluid, which is carbacol, which is often used for experiments. And what is true to carbacol and also some other of these fluids is that they don't only have blisters, they have also other properties, such as other non-Newtonian properties, such as a little bit of elasticity. And it depends on the flow case if that matters or not. So, this is one flow case when it has matter. It's a settling particle in carbohydrate, and it's a very slow settling. So, we are in a Stokes flow regime. So, if it was a Newtonian unit, you would expect the velocity field in the experiment, which here is shown by velocity magnetic shown by colours, you would expect it to be symmetric top and down. But apparently, it's not. So, if you start to simulate this, the first thing to try would probably be the Bingham model. It has been done for a long time. So, in Bingham model, you have a geez but you don't have any elasticity. But it turns out that then you cannot capture this asymmetry. So, it's not only in one case, but in general, you cannot capture that. But then it turns out that if you use an elastic physioplastic model, so you have to stress and some elasticity. Stress stand some elasticity, for instance the ceramic EVP model, then you can get an asymmetric velocity field, which is actually a bit similar to what you might get in this possibility. So this is a flow kind of around an optical, and because poros media consists of obstacles, we can maybe expect some elastic effects in poros media flows as well. So this was the motivation originally why we started uh looking at this flow. Looking at this flow. So, we have been looking at flow yields as fluids through porous media, both LSD viscoplastic and in some cases viscoplastic in these white papers. And of course, for the applications, as for everyone, you would like to have some kind of dark-like glow, or at least you would like to know how the pressure drop of the medium is related to the flow rate. Of the medium is related to the fluid. So, and that also how that depends on the fluid. So, these would be the non-dimensional numbers of porous medium. So, here I'm showing a randomized porous medium that consists of so these obstacles are circles and they have a diameter D. So, that diameter is the current. Is the characteristics length scale of the problem. And the characteristic velocity scale we take by because we impose the flow rate. So we don't impose a particular velocity profile, but we impose the flow rate. And then this is a periodic remain. So we take the mean flow across the cross-section, the transparent velocity scale. And when we do this, we get these non-dimensional numbers. So the most important one one of the most important ones is the Bingham number. One of the most important ones is the Bingham number, which relates the yield stress to the viscous stress. And this one we vary between 0 and 500. And the second one, which is also important here, is the Weisenberg number, which relates elastic forces to viscous forces. And we vary this, well, mostly between 0 and 0.5, but in some cases, we've got Weisenberg number 10. And the solid volume fraction of this porous media is between 10 and 30%. 30%. So, this is the recent study, but in order to understand the open questions that we wanted to answer, I'm going to give a little bit of a background here from previous studies of elastovisco-based flow in quantum media. So, the first question is: Does elasto-viscopistic flow and viscopastic flow become the same thing when you go to very high Bingham numbers? So, you would assume that very high Bingham numbers here. It's very high behind numbers. Users dominate everything else. So maybe they become less healthy. So we were studying previously elastomiscoristic flow in modern porous media. And this we can understand by if we assume that the porous medium is a uniform array of obstacles, then we just take a periodic unit cell here and we analyze the And we analyzed the flow in this unit cell. And this we can do in plasto-viscoplastic and in viscoplastic cases. So, this we did. We had two unit cells: we had a symmetric cell and a staggered cell. And we most the flow rate and then we measured the pressure drop process. And again, these equations I think have been already shown by others for slash one. Shown by others, for instance, Mark, but let's repeat a little bit. So, we are solving the Navier stokes. So, it's not completely inertial, it's the Navier stokes, where we have, of course, the usual viscous stress, but in addition, we have this extra stress, which comes from the elasto-viscoplasticity. And in the elasto-viscoplastic case, we use the Saramito 2007 model to calculate this extra stress. Calculate this extra stress. So, I will not dive so much into the model, but I will just say that the two extreme cases are: if we have a zero Bingham number here, then this becomes the on-roid B model. And if we have a zero visible number, then it will become the Bingham model. And we are also solving the Bingham model. However, because of numerical reasons, we cannot use actually the same method to use. Use actually the same method to use to solve the elastomiscoplastic and miscoplastic case. So, in the electromiscoplastic case, we are doing direct numerical simulations using our EPP code. So, we are iterating the number stops and this positive equation in time together. And in this coplastic case, we are solving the flow by augmenting Lagrange meter. So, cut the very long story short, The very long story short, this was the pressure drop that we got in these four different cases. So here we have Bingham number on the horizontal axis and the pressure drop on the vertical axis. And we have four different curves. The red curves are for only sophisticognastic flow. And we can see that they are a bit different at low Bingham numbers, but they get the same slope at high Bingham numbers. Then we have the Numbers. Then we have the two blue ones. They are the elastomiscoplastic cases at quite the low elasticity value. And they are a little bit higher at the low BNAM numbers, but then it seems like they are going to the same value at Pingham number 10. And in this case, we didn't go past pingham number 10, we were not able to at that point, but we kind of concluded. We kind of concluded at that point as a hypothesis that because the flows are at the pressure was the same at Bingham number 10, so then probably when we increase the Bingham number, then they will just be more and more like EBP, will be like EP. So this was our hypothesis, so that maybe they just follow each other. However, we could not be completely sure about that. And why is that? This was because of several studies. So, one of this was by with Enmod. So, here we have a wavy channel and in both figures we have the same Weissen Barry number and we have different Bingham numbers. So, this Binghair number is larger than this Bighane number. And I would like to point out, especially this, I mean, the velocity, asymmetry, and asymmetry of the unguili. Asymmetry of the unyielding regions here. So note that at these higher Bingham numbers, the asymmetry is much stronger than at the lower Bingham number. But the Weisenberry number is the same for both of them. So we have to conclude that the asymmetry increases with the Bingham number, which was a surprise original. So not only with Weissen-Berry number, but also with the Bingham number. And then when MRT simulation for many. For many values of being ammunition bison vary, he obtained this colour map of a level of asymmetry in the flow. And you can see that clearly asymmetry increases to the corner where Weisenberry and Bingham are both large. But also we have plotted these contours of constant product of Bingham and Weisenberry number. And we can see that the asymmetry roughly follows the contours of constant. The contours of constant Bingham time, the Weisenberg Hammer. So, at least in this case, I mean the Bingham are moderate, but in this case, we can see that elastic effects are proportional to the product of Bingham and Weisenberg number. And we have seen a similar thing in many different flows, in fact. So, in many different flows from turbulent channel flow to droplet in a elastomiscope to droplet in a shear flow. We can see that elastic effects are actually increasing with Bingham number as well. And sometimes we get a non-multinuous development as well, and new effects when both numbers are moderated. So considering this, when we increase the Bingham number, so of course plasticity becomes stronger, but we didn't know how the elastic effects would be affected. So will that actually be the equal? So will actually the EVP follow the VP or would it be harder or easier to push the electroviscopacity? This was actually one of the main questions we wanted to answer. So we wanted to go in the electroviscopacy flow to higher Bingham numbers. So that was one question. A second question was: we also hadn't looked at high wasn't very numbers. High Weisenberry numbers, or at least higher Weisenberry numbers. We had only looked at them very briefly in the very first paper. So here we have a flow at Bingham 1 and Weisenberry 0.5. And the unyielding regions are shown by that here. And what we can see is that the unyielding regions actually start to fluctuate in time at Weisenberry number 0.5, which they did not do at low Weisenberry number. So we were also So we were also wondering this could be some kind of elastic instability and does that increase then when we, in magnitude, when we increase the Weissenberg number. So this was the second question. And we also had a third question. So there is one particular difference in here since fluids in the model porous media to the random porous media. So not so much in the pressure drop, which is So, not so much in the pressure drop, which is simpler, but in the flow character, because user fluids are prone to channelization. So, this is a viscoplastic flow simulation by Gemma, but this similar channelization has been seen by many, many others, Loretta and UFR and so on. So, at low Bingham numbers, we have flow across many channels. So, this is the velocity magnitude radiant. But when we increase the Bingham number, But when we increase the Bingham number more and more, then finally we get only flow in one single channel. So this is what we call channelization. And we really wanted to look at randomized poros media to see if there is channelization in the elastic scoplastic node as well. Okay, so this led us to the most recent study that was recently published in Theoretical and Computational Theory Dynamics. Of thermodynamics and in the special issue of stable and unstable flow, time-dependent flows of visuals. So, since I'm an associate editor in the journal, I just wanted to also bring up this as one more possibility if you haven't already submitted your work in all other special issues that you have. Okay, so this is the study in Random Poros Media. Is the study in random porous media, and we are studying three different volume fractions from 10% to 30%. And in a 30% case, we have 220 cylindrical obstacles in real name. And to solve this EVP problem, so we did both EVP and EP calculations, but in the EVP problem, we used our usual EVP code and some characteristics of the EPA. And some characteristics of the code are that it's very highly parallel, so we can run easily on HPC architectures and it does K to thousands of processors, so that's been a good thing. Then otherwise, we need some way to introduce these obstacles in the domain. And in this study, we use the immersed boundary method, which is second-order calculation. Which is second-order category with the direct fossil metal, where we had Magrasian points on the cylinders and then a polygarian read around the cylinder. Then we used a logo formation approach to handle numerically the instabilities at a little bit higher while the parameter. And there is several validation cases also in the paper, but we wanted to do some extra validations because it's kind of known that immersed battery method is not. Merced battery method is not most accurate around the solid boundaries, or the stress is not so accurate around solid boundaries. So, we wanted to at least convince ourselves that we are sufficiently accurate. So, we did two test cases. So, the first one was particle is in shear flow. And here I would like to thank Mark for proposing this test case. So, here we are testing particle torque in a web flow and how And around half of the particle talk is because of vischolastic stresses. So, here we are comparing our torque against experiments and simulations using other methods and we see a good agreement there. Then we also tried flow around a cylinder, which is more challenging. And we quantified the level of accuracy. It's not perfect, but if we keep whatever number Was a very number around below 0.5, which we did in most of the cases, then we are doing a reasonable job. At least if we want to put 200 silhouettes in the remain, then we have to satisfy this. Okay, so now to the results. So, this is first the generalization in elasto-viscoplastic fluise. We start. We start from the purely viscoelastic case, so we can number zero at the left, and then we increase the yield stress to the right. So in the viscoelastic case, we have some preferential flow paths already, but there are several of them. When we start increasing the Binghaw number, we more and more converge to only one flow path, even if not completely, so there are some other paths around as well. Around as well. But I would like to point out we are only at pinghan number 500. So, also in the viscoplastic case, when we observe complete channelization, we should be at least a pinghan number 1000 or 10,000. So, we see a very similar structure of the generalization. And then this would be the one, Weisenberry number 10 case, just for comparison. So, here we have Weisenberry 0.05, which is low Weisenberry number. Low Weisenberry number and at different Bingham numbers. And then I wanted to compare the generalization to what happens at a bit higher Weisenberry numbers. So we can see that also at the higher Weisenberry numbers we still get that channelization, that high digital numbers. So we can safely say that the channelization is quite the robust feature in the Random Westeros media and not so much dependent on the Western dynamic. Okay, maybe even more interesting would be to look at again because we have elastic stresses in the flow, so let's look at the trace of conformation tensor, which gives you a measure of elastic stressing. So this is just one example. There are many more in a paper. So here I'm showing Poissonberry number 0.05 and a 10% body fraction. So we start from the viscolastic case here, because the Poissonberry number is low, we need Number is low, we will see, of course, some stress localization here, but it's not, the values are not so strong. We have the same polar scale in all the figures. So, when we start increasing the Bingham number, so first we can see that the average values increase, and definitely also the maximum values increase. And when we start going to the higher Bingham numbers, then we can also see this. We can also see these kind of biofringent stands that have been shown several times today, also in viscolastic weed flows. So, we can clearly say also here that the features which are typical of viscolastic flows, they increase when we just keep the Weissen parameter constant but we increase the behavior moment. And when we see these kind of strands, of course, the question arises: is there some elastic tolerance here also? Terrorists here also? And the answer is yes. How do we have numbers? So, this is the pressure drop against time for different cases. So, the first row here shows the same Weisenberry number as I showed before, 0.05. And we have three different volume fractions. So, of course, in all these cases, the pressure drop increases with the volume fraction as we expect. Then, when we increase the Bingham number, again, for We increase the Bingham number again for each volume fraction the pressure drop increases, and this we also expect. This is the same in this choice. And also here, the pressure drop has increased a lot. This is mainly a factual reason, is mainly the increase in pinghal number. But in addition to that, then we see that the perfect drop is not completely steady. So we see some fluctuations here at all different. At all different poly fractions. And if we then start increasing, this bottom row is for a little bit higher, Maison Bill number, 0.5. So here we can see, I mean the overall level of the pressure drop is not higher, but we can see that the fluctuations are higher. So this also is in agreement with what Marco presented yesterday in the wavy channel floor. Okay, so now for the little Okay, so now finally the important question that we wanted to answer. So what happens at the higher bingal number for the illustration scopast fluid flow? And now we are only answering this in randomized forest media. But anyway, so there is a lot of data here, so let me try to summarize a little bit. These solid lines are for viscoplastic cases. Cases and the different colours are for different body fractions. So, all the piscoplastic cases they have this same slope at high Liga numbers. And then, if you look at the same colours but dashed lines, they are elastomistoplastic cases. So, in all of the cases, actually, if you look for instance at the red line, so the elastovistoplastic So the electrovistoplastic pressure drop is lower at the high P1 numbers. And this is consistent along all the cases. If we then start to analyze a little bit the effect of Weiser Perry number in more detail, we can also see that there is a non-monotonious development. So, in all the cases at low bingo numbers, we have Being of numbers, we have almost complete agreement between viscoplastic and elastomiscoplastic pressure. So these lines are on top of each other. When we start increasing the Poisonberry number, which is the diagonal signals here, then at low pinhar numbers, we observe an increase of the pressure drop due to elasticity. And this could have several explanations. This could have several explanations. So, one would be the appearance of elastic turbulence, which we already saw at Weisenberg number 0.5, at least at Bingham number 1. Another could be that we have more pads here and they are more torches, and it's simply more takes more force to push the elastic flow through the spread of pads. So more uh geometric uh features. Geometric features. But then the question is: so, how why do we have this consistent decrease with Weissenberry number at higher B home numbers? And this is also consistent across the cases. And this, we believe, it doesn't have anything to do with elastic turbulence. It's simply kind of elastic reduction in a straight channel flow. So, if we think about this. So, if we think about this where high big numbers where the flow is very channelized, so we can very idealistically think about this as the straight channel flow. And if we look at straight laminar channel flows, which we did in our previous study with Markov, also we looked at turbulent flows, but this is the velocity profiles for laminar flows. So, we can see that with the bison-buried number, clearly the plugged region becomes narrower. Narrower and this has the effect that the velocity slope near the wall is lower. So even if we introduce the elasticity, because of the change in the velocity profile, we get the target reduction in the laminar regime. And this we can quantify by looking at the friction factor, which decreases in the laminar channel flow. So even if this is not linear channel, So, even if this is not laminar channel flow, we believe we see basically the same effect: that when we increase the bison-by-number, the plug thickness decreases, and this is why the drag is reduced, even despite that steady disease. Which brings me to the conclusions. So, in the recent study, we have investigated electroviscoplastic fluids in cross-media up to pinham number five hundred. To Bingham number 500. And we found that fluid elasticity affects pressure drop in two ways. So it increases the resistance at low Bingham, which is something we have seen also in previous studies, but it seems to decrease the resistance at high Bingham numbers. We also observed elastic instability and some ketic flow even at low Weisenberry number if the product of Heisenberg and Bingham is calculated, which is something that is interesting. Which is something that is recently seen in other studies as well, in simple geometries. And we also saw that eternalization happens also in LOS and visible steel flows, and it's rather robust with respect to waste and brain. Thank you. Do you have time for a question? Thank you very much for the nice presentation. I just have a question.
