Joint work with actually several people, some of whom are in the audience at this conference. So there is one paper with Elisabetta Gyodaro, Leonje Kremel and Eduard Vehisel, which is a few years ago already. But my main focus will be on the recent work with my PhD student, Ennis Gallenmüller, at Ulm. Miller at Ulm. And I will also mention another result, similar results jointly with Václav Macha. So the topic is, well, on the relationship between weak and measure-value solutions for, well, for this talk, the isentropic compressible Euler system, which looks like this. Probably everyone has seen this. Seen this and well, for most of this talk, we will make the same assumption on the pressure that Andre had already made in his talk on Monday, where we will actually take the pressure to be rho squared. But in any case, for all of this talk, we will consider a barotropic pressure law. And then, what is also, I think, standard For everyone in this audience, is that there is an energy balance relation here that formally holds, where we have an energy density, which itself is composed of a kinetic and a potential part. So the capital P here is the pressure potential, which in the specific case of a barrel. Specific case of a barotropic pressure law is up to a constant the same as the pressure itself. So you can also imagine this as rho to the gamma. And there is an associated energy flux. So as a result, one obtains, at least if the solution is smooth, the conservation of energy even locally, which is expressed through this equation. This equation. Now, of course, upon the onset of shocks or other irregularities, we will in general not be able to keep the equality here. Rather, by, well, what in the theory of hyperbolic conservation laws in general would somehow be a manifestation of the second law of thermodynamics. Here it's Law of thermodynamics. Here it's a bit different. In any case, we could potentially lose energy and we will get an inequality here. So this is what in hyperbolic conservation laws is called the entropy inequality, although in this specific case, the physical interpretation is not that of an entropy, but of an energy. And we will henceforth only And we will henceforth only consider weak solutions of the isentropic Euler system that satisfy this entropy inequality. Now, as Andre explained nicely on Monday, this isentropic Euler system is susceptible to methods of convex integration, which result in the presentation of the Which result in the presence of infinitely many admissible weak solutions for certain initial data. And let me restate what Andre already mentioned. So his important result with Elizabeth Achiodaroli and Camilo de Lelis, where you can show that there exists certain Riemann initial data that possess a Um, that possess a classical shock solution, or well, I mean, it could be any kind of self-similar solution that is classically known, like a combination of shocks or refaction waves or even contact discontinuities. But in the case that there is one shock, one can certainly construct by means of convex integration infinitely many admissible solutions that are, of course, different than from the classical. Of course, different than from the classical self-similar shock solution. So, here actually, this is Riemann data for the one-dimensional problem, but you immediately, in these wild convex integration solutions, will see a dependence on the other space variable x1. So, then a question that is frequently asked is that Frequently asked is that of selection criteria. So we have this infinite zoo of solutions and some people like to know which one is the correct one. So people would like to see the actual shock solution as distinguished compared to all these wild, non-unique solutions. But the question is, So, now that the entropy condition does not suffice to single out a unique solution, maybe there are other such conditions. Now, I'm not sure if this is even the right question to ask, but what I certainly would concede is that one should aim to find selection, well, not selection criteria that give exactly one solution that remains, but maybe some criteria to rule out some solutions, but to reduce. But to retain possibly other solutions which still may be non-unique. In any case, the question of selection is highly debated. And a hot candidate for a selection mechanism is the vanishing viscosity limit. So, in the compressible situation, this might be formulated here with the help of compressible Navier-Stokes equations. And the question is, Equations and the question is: well, okay, if I put just some parameter in front of the Newtonian stress tensor and I let that go to zero, well, formally I would expect to get a solution to Euler, but is that really the case? And this is, of course, very, very difficult. But in any case, the question seems somehow reasonable. Case the question seems somehow reasonable because it is known that solutions exist for Navi-Stokes, at least when the adiabatic exponent is sufficiently large. This is the existence theory of Lyons and Feierhisel that has also been mentioned several times in this workshop. Well, one problem is that, as I said, it's not even clear whether in such a vanishing viscosity In such a vanishing viscosity limit, whatever we get will be a solution of the Euler equations, because this is the old problem that everyone knows, that I cannot simply pass to the weak limit under a nonlinearity, and we do have nonlinearities here. So one kind of trick to bypass this problem is not really bypassing the problem because you don't solve the problem by doing this, but one thing you could do in any case. But one thing you could do in any case is to switch to a kind of probabilistic framework in that you would no longer look for functions rho and v as solutions to your fluid equation, but you would consider a probability distribution in phase space. So a probability distribution that gives you the probability that density and velocity are And velocity are in a certain region in state space or phase space. And in this way, you could consider a weak solution to your equations as a special case of such a probabilistic framework, because, well, if you know exactly that the fluid has density ρ and velocity v, then you could encode that as a Dirac probability measure. And now, in this space of probability measures that in addition depend on the domain, so you call them parametrized probability measures or young measures, then you can certainly pass to some weak limit and you will get some parametrized probability measure, which I call mu. And the price you pay is that it might no longer be Dirac, so you might have an actual smeared. Have an actual smeared-out probability distribution for your limiting fluid density and velocity. But the advantage is that it is easy to show that, well, such a probability measure will solve the Euler equations in a certain averaged sense. So, and in what sense do I mean? I mean, in the sense that, well, if you take the average. That well, if you take the average density and the average, say, convection term, which means simply you take the expectation of all these quantities with respect to your probability measure, then you can write this equation here, or this system of equations, which looks deceptively like the isentropic Euler system, only that, of course. Only that, of course, there is some cheating involved by using these bars, like these expectations. So if you had something like dt rho bar v bar plus divergence rho bar v bar times v bar and so on, then that would be an honest weak solution of the Euler equations. But of course, I take the average over the entire nonlinearity. The average over the entire non-linearities. So the Bary centers, rho-bar and v-bar, do in general not constitute a weak solution of the Euler equations, but they constitute, well, what is called a measure-valued solution. Now, it is important to say here, because that sometimes leads to confusion, that a measure-valued solution, at least in the way I use the term, means just any parametrized probability. Any parametrized probability measure whose first two moments satisfy the Euler equations in this sense. I do not mean to somehow suggest that a measure-valued solution automatically is generated, say, by a viscosity limit. And this is precisely the question that I will ask in this talk. What is the, well, I mean, which measure values? Well, I mean, which measure-valued solutions do come from a sequence of honest solutions? Now, I hinted at, well, the fact that somehow by introducing measure-valued solutions, you commit some kind of cheating in the existence theory. And this is also because all this information is lost when you. All this information is lost when you want to commute between nonlinearities and weak limits. So, the interesting stuff that happens is kind of lost in the measure-valued solution. And also, I mean, you can give a probabilistic description of the fluid that is, however, very incomplete because you, for instance, you cannot describe two-point correlations. This is something that people do in other frames. In other frameworks, but this kind of primitive measure-valid solution that I presented here only gives the one-point statistics of the flow. So when I study measure-valid solutions, I think I have to justify why I do it. And I think in recent years, there has been increased interest again. So I put nothing here on the slides with respect to the history. On the slides with respect to the history of these solutions. Let me just say that this particular formulation was introduced for conservation laws by Di Perna in the 80s. And then for the incompressible Euler equations, there was some generalization, taking into account also effects of concentration due to Dependen and Maida. And this is essentially these were the These were the pioneers of this concept. But recently, interest has increased again. So measure-valid solutions, one thing is that you can show that they enjoy the weak-strong uniqueness property. There was a talk yesterday by Jakob Wojnitsky who talked about a similar topic: weak-strong uniqueness for some kind of very weak solution. And this somehow is This somehow is something that works somehow surprisingly, even for measure-valued solutions, which in general would exhibit a very high degree of non-uniqueness. And this is nothing to do with convex integration, but only with the fact that the measure-value solution is defined by a differential constraint on its first two moments. Now, if I give you two moments of a probability measure, then you can give me like a Me like a million different probability measures that agree in these first two moments. So, in this sense, yes, measure-valid solutions are highly unique, but somehow surprisingly, if you put an additional energy condition on the measure-valid solution, then you will find that as long as a strong solution exists, it is unique in the class of measure-valid solutions. And this has far-reaching implications to. To the study of the respective systems of fluid dynamics, for instance, the compressible Navier-Stokes. There are very nice papers of Eduard, Feyeraisel, and Maria Lukachova, for instance, on the convergence of numerical schemes for compressible Navier-Stokes, which use this measure-valued dissipative measure-valued framework and the non-weak-strong uniqueness that we proved in a paper with. That we proved in a paper with Edward and Piotrin Agnieszka. But also, maybe from a more turbulence-oriented viewpoint, there are very interesting recent numerical simulations by the group of Sid Mishera and Eitan Tadmo, where they find that somehow I mean, something that people in turbulence, of course, had expected for decades. So it's not like this is a completely new idea, but they gave some very nice numerical experiments where they showed that, in fact, what is stable in a turbulent flow is not so much the flow itself, obviously, because, well, that is very unstable, and slight perturbations in the initial datum for a shear flow, for instance, would lead. For a shear flow, for instance, would lead to a completely different solution, yet, certain statistical measures of the flow are stable under perturbations. So, one might rather favor such a probabilistic viewpoint. Anyway, so now the question really is what is the relation between What is the relation between measure-valued and weak solutions? Can I obtain every measure-valued solution from an approximating sequence of weak solutions? And the answer for the incompressible Euler equations was given in a paper with Laszlo Sekehidi, where we showed that yes, the answer is yes. So every measure-valued solution to the incompressible Euler equations comes from Euler equations come from a sequence of, in fact, weak solutions of the incompressible Euler equations, which is another argument in favor of measure-value of solutions because it shows that this solution concept is in fact not much weaker than the regular distributional concept. What is not known, however, is what is the relation with the vanishing viscosity limit. This is a very interesting question. So, the only thing we could show is that So, the only thing we could show is that you can approximate or generate every measure-value solution by a sequence of weak solutions of the Euler equations, not of, say, Navier-Stokes or anything else. And then the question that has, well, occupied me for a long time now is: well, what does it look like in the compressible situation? Now, to answer this question, in fact, I cannot fully answer the question. In fact, I cannot fully answer the question, but I can give a partial result. And for this, I need to take a little detour. So it turns out that an important criterion somehow in this business is a linear criterion, which does not catch the full Euler system, but only But only a much weaker linear constraint, well, differential constraint, which is linear. So, suppose in the isentropic Euler equations, I replaced every nonlinearity by a new independent, no, a new dependent variable. So, I would get this linear system that you see here, which is, of course, highly underdetermined. So, I wouldn't say this is a system of PDEs, I would say it's. This is a system of PDEs, I would say it's a linear differential constraint. And if I enlarge my state space to not just get rho, the density at the momentum of the fluid, but also these kind of dummy variables that represent the nonlinearities for the convection and the pressure. So then I have a large state space, but then I can abstractly consider linear differential homogeneous operators acting. Operators acting on such a map that goes into this enlarged state space. And then I can, for the analysis of, say, compensated compactness, or the other extreme would be convex integration. So for the analysis of oscillatory behavior of a system of PDEs, I need to know, well, how this constraint is related. Constraint is related to the possibility of oscillations. This is encoded in the so-called wave cone. And the wave cone, so I have to be a bit quicker now because my time is running out, but the wave cone tells you exactly which directions of oscillation are allowed by the differential constraint. Or to put it negatively, the differential constraint will restrict your Will restrict your possible directions of oscillation. And well-known examples are the rank one condition. If you take the linear constraint to encode the fact that something is a gradient, this is important in, say, elasticity theory. But if we choose the linear constraint that we had in connection with our compressible Euler system, this will boil down to, well, vectors in state space. Well, vectors in state space that can be arranged into a matrix that is singular. This is just an easy computation, more or less. Just translate the linear constraint into Fourier space and you get an algebraic condition, which is now this determinant condition. And then you can prove something like a compensated compactness statement. In this case, it's a generalization of a well-known rigidity. Lemma of Ball and James from the 80s. So we had a precursor version of this in the paper with Andre and Elisabetta and Edward, but with Dennis we also generalized this to non-constant states. And it just means that if I have two states in state space that are not connected through the wave cone, then I cannot have a non-trivial Have a non-trivial Young measure generated by a sequence that takes values that oscillate between Z1 and Z2. So, really, the interpretation is that such a sequence restrained by this condition A cannot oscillate between states that are not lambda connected. So, it's an extension, as I said, of Ball and James. And okay, we can prove it somehow. And you can. And you can get something better that is important for the vanishing viscosity limit. So, as a last thing, let me give the main theorem with Dennis. So, now we take the quadratic pressure law, just like in the paper of Chodaroli, De Lelis, and Cremel, because we want to use their construction. And we prove: okay, there exists an admissible measure-valued solution. An admissible measure-valued solution starting from perfectly atomic, perfectly deterministic initial data, which first of all does not arise from a sequence of weak solutions of isentropic Euler, but also it does not arise as a vanishing viscosity limit of compressible Navier-Stokes. And in fact, this initial condition that we take is precisely the initial condition from the paper. Condition from the paper of Elisabeth D'Arange and Camillo. So, and well, one reason why I think this is interesting is that it simply constitutes a very strong contrast with the incompressible case. The other reason I think this is important is that really it gives something interesting, something non-trivial in terms of the selection. In terms of this selection question, at least on the level of measure-valued solutions. So you have very many measure-valued solutions to the given initial data, and the question is, can I throw some of them away because they're not physical? And here we showed that, well, at least I can come up with some measure valid solution, is a perfectly honest measure valid solution with the energy property and everything. With the energy property and everything, but it does not arise as a viscosity limit, so it should be considered as unphysical. So that's a very partial answer to the selection problem. And there was a precursor result, as I said, with Elisabetta and Andre and Eduard. And we were able to construct a similar example for the full compressible Euler system very recently together with Václav Macha. Together with Vaslav Macha. So I think I should stop here. Thank you very much.
