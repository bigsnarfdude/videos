Good intro. Okay, thank you to the organizers for the invitation. My caveat for this talk is that I'm not talking about algebraic topology, and I'm not really talking about geometric group theory at all either, which is rare for me. But this is a topic that I've been working really hard on and very interested in lately. And very interested in lately. So if things seem unfamiliar, just ask questions. Like there's no rush. Okay. Everything I'm going to talk about is joint work with Daryl Cooper and Leslie Mabrakis. Daryl's at Santa Barbara and Leslie's one of his grad students. And so we'll just start with the overall idea, which dates back to Thurston. If you just take a family of manifolds, let's say like surfaces, hyperbolic surfaces, three manifolds, whatever. Folds, whatever. Then the goal is to find M. And I'm using a very vague language in the beginning. I'll formalize everything later, but I need to give you motivation. So the goal is to find the set M, which is called like a finite construction kit with gluing rules. I don't know why some of that went away. Those are gluing rules. Such that the set of compact or sometimes closed manifolds. Sometimes closed manifolds that can be built with these pieces is exactly the set that you started with. Okay, so usually we call this Thurston's Legos, and that's how you should think about it. I have these little pieces, and I have ways that they can snap together. And if I just snap together as many as I want in whatever combinations, I can build all the manifolds in my set T and I can't build anything else. Okay, so that's what the sort of Lego construction is. Of Lego construction kit idea is. So we're just going to start off with an example. This is not the official definition that I'm going to use, but like I think it makes sense to start with this definition since the example is nice with this definition and it gives some motivation. So let's just say I take the circle and I'm just going to give it a cell structure like this. R, G, and B are originally for red, green, and blue. None of the colors match today, but they're just letters on, they're just labels on the edges. Labels on the edges. And the thing that I want to try to construct is all covers of this S1 of degree three or more. Okay, so I need to build all of them and I need to not build covers of smaller degree. Okay, so this is my construction kit and I have to give you gluing rolls. Okay, so there's five pieces. And the gluing rolls, when I write them down, I goes to J means that the end. Goes to J means that the end of the ith piece is glued to the start of the Jth piece. Okay, so here are my gluing rules. Okay, so one being glued to two means that you can take the end of two and map it to one. Sorry, map it to piece two and click them together. Two being able to be glued to three says you take the end of the two piece and you can glue it to the beginning of the three piece and so on. So three, you can glue to four. Three, you can also glue to five. Three, you can also glue to five. Notice, like it ends with the B, starts with the V. So you snap those two edges together. Three can glue to one, four can glue to one, and five can glue to one. I promise there's some combinations that are actually missing there, even though it seems like I just am allowed all gluings. I'm not. So I'm clicking them together. When you see two Gs, you snap them, and you'll see this in the pictures. It becomes a green and blue. Becomes a green and blue dotted, like alternating dashed line. So that's like in Legos, literally, when you connect things, you just snap the two pieces together. So there must be some overlap. That's my gluing. Okay. I wouldn't say that because I'm not just like concatenating it. Okay, maybe. I don't know. I'm not going to say that though. It's just if you really want to write out the word, you write it out and then you take the last letter off and stick it to the next piece. Okay. It's just imagine clicking together. Okay, it's just imagine clicking together. When I show you the pictures, it should make more sense. Okay, so again, if I'm gluing two to three, I take this R and it has to match with an R at the beginning of the next piece that I'm saying I'm gluing to, and those two things snap together. So notice that I haven't glued anything that doesn't end with the same letter that the next piece begins with. Okay? I'm turning my notifications off. It's five to eight to five just the same one as little rules and you cannot glue that. You cannot glue five to five. Yeah, yeah. Blue five to five. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so these are all the gluing rules. I'm not saying this is like a unique way to do it. This is just a way that works. Okay, so I need to do two different things, and this is going to be a theme throughout the talk. I always need to build with my pieces the set of things I'm aiming for. So here, this kit is going to build all covers of degree bigger than or equal to three. And I don't want to build any other closed one manifolds. Okay? That part is usually the harder part. The second part is. Is usually the harder part. The second part is much more difficult. So that's why I have to be much more careful. Okay, so here's the little hint. Okay, pieces one, two, and three are going to build all covers of degree 3K. Pieces one, two, three, and four will build all covers of degree 3K and 3K plus 1. And then 1, 2, 3, and 5 will build all covers of degree 3K and then 3K plus 2. And then I'm done. So let me show you some examples to actually motivate that. Okay, so. Actually, motivate that. Okay, so here are some. Okay, what did I do for the degree three cover? I took a one piece, so that's the blue thing. So, where is that? You see, I started dashing where I've clicked things together. So, this is the blue piece. I've clicked on the next one is the green piece, the two piece. And then to that, I clicked on this three piece and then closed up by clicking these together. And that's all according to my gluing rules. Everything is valid in my gluing rules. rules. Everything is valid in my gluing rules. Okay, so piece one gets glued to two, two gets glued to three, and then three closes up with one, and the end and the beginning get glued together. Okay, you can count up the vertices. It goes RBG all the way around. There's enough of them. There's exactly the right number of vertices in that. So it's a degree three cover. Okay, how do you construct the degree four cover? Okay, so I drew it for you, but let's just write down what the actual rules are. So what I did here was I took the one piece. Oh, I can't write. Okay, the one piece. You see that? I can't write. Okay, the one piece. You see, that's the blue part here. I realize I also have a laser. Okay. And then I have that's glued to the two piece. Ah, damn it. Okay, then I glued to the three piece. Then I added in the four piece to give me one more collection of vertices and one more collection RBG. And then I closed up to one. So actually, let me draw it like a cycle the way I did before. Okay, and that's where you see how this four piece gives you just enough to get. Gives you just enough to get like 3k plus one. Okay, so this is a degree three cover, and I edited to get one more by adding in that four piece at the end. Similarly, for this degree five cover, if you can see this, I did the one piece glued to the two piece, glued to the three piece, glued to the five piece, and then back to the one. So this five piece is actually giving you that three plus two. So 3K plus two. Okay, so now you start to see the pattern. Plus two. Okay, so now you start to see the pattern. In the degree six cover, does anybody want to guess what this is? Like that. Oh, sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. That's not the way I've been writing it. Three and then close up. Let me see if I did that right. One, two, three, one, two, three, and close up. That's right. Okay, so now if I want to make the degree seven cover, I do one, two, three, one, two, three, four, and then close up, and so on. Okay. And so on. Okay, I don't remember what I wrote under here. Ah, that's what I wrote. Okay, so I have one, two, three, one, two, three, and then the four piece. I want to do the next ones. One, two, three, one, two, three, five piece glue up. And that's how you see that you get all covers of degree 3K, 3K plus 1, and 3K plus 2. And the harder part is how I avoid building any other closed manifolds, closed one manifolds. Okay, so here I'm really trying to say everything that I put down with its bluing rules doesn't give me just this. Its gluing rules doesn't give me just the circle back itself, so no degree one cover and no degree two cover. And what you can kind of see if you really study the gluing rules, I don't want to get super bogged down in that, is that I've made it unavoidable to skip the three piece entirely. You can't do one, two, back to one, or one, two, four, back to one. You have to go one, two, three, always. And that three piece being long enough tells you that you definitely gain a degree three cover at least. Cover at least. Okay, so that's how you avoid building all other closed one manifolds. So, first, we left out one piece. Why do I leave out the RB piece? Because if I do B, G, G, R and then put in the R B piece, I should just be able to glue in and get one, the circle, the degree one copy. And then the second part is what I just said, which is I choose the gluing rules carefully so that all closed manifolds built with M must contain the pink three piece. Okay, this is the toy example. This is the toy example. And again, I'm going to emphasize that we are not actually taking pieces and clicking them together, but this is going to give you the motivation for what the technical definition actually looks like. Okay. Questions about the example? No, good. This is just for fun. If you wanted to build all covers of degree bigger than or equal to four, you can use this Lego set. Notice I added in the Can use this Lego set. Notice I added in this brown piece. You can guess already that you're going to be doing like the 4K, 4K plus 1, 4K plus 2, 4K plus 3, and different combinations of these pieces. I didn't put down the gluing rules, but I can. And that would give me a way of building all covers of degree greater than or equal to 4 and building nothing else. Okay. Now I'm going to give the real definition for. Oh, that's like cut off. Let's see if I can move it. Okay. It's not like in present. Okay, it's not like in presentation mode, so I'm like, you can see my page numbers and stuff, but I'm hoping you can. Yeah, that should be good. Okay, so really what I want to do, the title of my talk is a local commentarial characterization, right? So instead of thinking about like global pieces and snapping them together, I really want to characterize local behavior around like vertices in a triangulation of my manifold. And so a local model is going to be a triangulation of a ball, okay, BN, where you are putting down a Where you are putting down a particular vertex as, like, you can think of it as the center, the anchor point of the ball. And if I take something like a finite set of these kind of pieces, right, that's going to be my actual construction kit. So the definition here is that a simplicial complex L. So here think a triangulated surface or a triangulated three-manifold is modeled on this kit if every time you look at a vertex in L, a little X in L, a little neighborhood of it is one of these pieces. Okay, so I put down all the local behavior that I'm allowed. And then I say something is modeled on these pieces if the local behavior is always looking like one of those pieces. Okay, so it feels reminiscent, but they're not exactly the same. So that homeomorphism. Yeah. That is supposed to be some political homeomorphism. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Any other questions? There's no gluing constraint. Yeah, no gluing constraint. It's just the local models, exactly. And the thing that's like kind of a little annoying is I'm going to give you this definition and tell you that it's not the one we actually use either. There's something that's more beautiful geometrically that we end up using. Okay, so take this as what it means. It's a local model. This is what it means to be modeled on M. And then one thing to just note really quickly is that if L is modeled. Is that if L is modeled on M, then any covering space of L is as well. Because if you're thinking about just local behavior around vertices, that's no different in a space or its covering, right? That's going to come up. Okay, so here's the definition of what it means to be locally combinatorially defined. It just goes back to like the first thing I said. You take a family of manifolds, it's locally combinatorially defined if, oh, that's why. There we go. Okay. That's why. There we go. Okay. If the things you can generate with this finite set of local models is exactly T. So all manifolds in T can be built with this construction kit and nothing else can be built. Sometimes they put an adjective there where like, again, remember I said sometimes you say all the compact manifolds that can be built. Sometimes we say all the closed manifolds that we can build. So that adjective is playing in there. But this is what it means to be locally defined. You take a like you're taking. Defined. You're taking a ton of information, usually in an infinite family. That's where it's interesting, right? You take an infinite family of manifolds and you're using finite local models to completely characterize them. And that's why we say locally combinatorially defined. Okay, so let me just give you some examples. We didn't just think of this out of nowhere. So we already saw that if we wanted to do covers of the circle of a certain degree or higher, that's fine. I'm sure you can imagine that if I didn't put the Imagine that if I didn't put the degree bigger than or equal to k restriction, it's easier, even. So, just covers of S1 is fine. Here is the motivation in two dimensions. If you take a disk formed by cyclically arranging n triangles around the vertex, if n is five, take that local model, if n is six, take that local model, n is seven, take that local model. Just one piece is going to build surfaces of type flat, elliptic, hyperbolic. Flat, elliptic, hyperbolic. So let me just write that down, or uncover it, I should say. Okay, so the set of compacts, so if you take this one local model, okay, and you look at the set of all compact surfaces that you can build with this local model, for n equals five, you get all of the positively curved ones. For n equals six, you get all the zero curvature ones. And for n equals seven, you get all the negative curvature ones. And this should sort of make sense to you when you're trying to jam more triangles into a disc, you get negative curvature. Triangles into a disc, you get negative curvature, right? You get, yeah. So, anyway, this is a theorem, and I should probably have put the reference for this, but it's not just like, okay, extremely trivial, but this is actually true. Later in the talk, I'm going to give you like our alternate definition and like maybe you can work on as like a little exercise, like in that alternate definition, how would you find the combinatorial characterization, right? For surfaces, for instance. Okay, on the other hand, if I take all three models together. And if I take all three models together and I say, what compact surfaces can you build with all three of the models? You just get all compact surfaces, right? The first one gives you the first set, second one, and so on. In this case, it's kind of nice because what do I want to say? Like. You do get all the surfaces, but you do not get all the triangulations, right? There's just a triangulation that is modeled on this. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So. Okay, so you get if you put all the three pieces together, this is how you build maybe bigger sets. Yeah, it should. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then the motivational, I'm obviously talking about three manifolds today. And the motivational result is like the fourth example, which I realize is like not exactly an L C D set because they only do one direction of the characterization. But Cooper and Thurston and independently Walker in 85. Independently, Walker in 85 show that there's a set of five local models, just five, and I could even like have put them up, but that's not the main point of the talk. Just a set of five local models so that every closed orientable three manifold, M is modeled on J. And to get such a small construction kit is pretty great. Now, they don't do the other way, where they say the only things that you can build with J are these. In fact, you can probably build non-orientable ones, but I'm like sure that if you wanted to edit this to Or that if you wanted to edit this to get a true L C D set, you could do it. Okay, so the set of all closed orientable three manifolds is an L C D set. I'll just say that. Okay, this is only half of the theorem here. And what we want to do is something like a refinement of that. Okay, so this is the refinement. Maybe actually, let me say one thing. So let's say I just wanted to build the hyperbolic ones and say, oh, the set of closed orientable hyperbolic. And say, oh, the set of closed-orientable hyperbolic three-manifolds is LCD as well. You could use this set J to construct all of those, but you'd accidentally construct a ton of other things. And that's why I say the second part is always hard to eliminate unwanted constructions is really difficult. Autumn? No. They really just take like, they show you like five simplicies constructed from like doing like suspensions and things on like an octopus. Like suspensions and things on, like, an octahedron, and I'll show it to you. Yeah, it's not that. It's literally just a geometric thing. They write them all down and then they prove it. It's like a three-page paper. It's kind of remarkable. Yeah. Rita? In the surface case, how would you require just the orientable surfaces? Because here this is something like Jeff. So good question. So I won't say that I have a good idea for that using this definition of L C D. But when I get to branch surfaces and I talk about that, I think we can probably come. Talk about that, I think we can probably come to a conclusion, which is what I was saying is a little fun exercise later on. Okay. So, maybe all I'm trying to say is that if you just want to take one geometric category of three manifolds, finding a construction kit and showing that their L C D is far harder because you have to eliminate all of the other ones that you don't want, right? And then, okay, so I'll go through the eight geometries and kind of tell you which ones are like the hardest to tell apart, right? So, this is our theorem. This is preliminary work. The last time I gave this talk, The last time I gave this talk, I got so many questions about a case that I hadn't really thought about that much. But this theorem is most certainly true. The set of closed orientable three manifolds that admit a particular Thurston geometry is L C D. So that's eight theorems in one, one for each geometry, right? We've constructed a construction kit for each geometry. Okay, what do we think is the hardest one to do? No, actually not. I'll show you the solo one at the end. Actually, not. I'll show you the soul one at the end. Yeah, hyperbolic is definitely the hardest, okay? But there's a reason, maybe I'll show you, and you might be like, okay, I can kind of see why. Okay, yeah, soul is not as mysterious as we think it is. So here is the alternate perspective. That was like basically what changed the entire project for us and it made things quite a lot easier. Okay, so my claim, and this is going back to the first example. Example and it'll motivate how we can use this alternate definition. So I'm going to claim that the set of closed one manifolds that immerses in this thing, which looks like a train track, right, is exactly the thing that we wanted before. It's exactly the set of covers of S1 of degree bigger than or equal to three. Okay, you can start to see them, right? If I want a degree six cover, I go here. Degree seven, degree. Degree seven, degree. Oh, sorry, I'm going the wrong numbers. Three, four, five. If I want to go six, I go two times around. If I want to go to seven, I go all the way. And then at the very end, I add in that piece. Okay, so you can start to see that first, if you're thinking about closed manifolds, right? Closed one manifold, you're looking for closed paths in this train track. And then, and no quotations there, it's a train track, but I'm going to replace that word with branch manifold in a little bit. That word with branch manifold in a little bit. Okay, so you really see here that this branch manifold train track construction actually replaces your little local kits that you're trying to, you know, when you're working really locally, it's not always obvious that you've eliminated bad behavior. The branch manifold perspective really allows us to eliminate bad behavior. One thing you can see is that there's a three piece on every path. This branching is all at three pieces. And so no matter what, if you start somewhere and you want to close. What, if you start somewhere and you want to close up, you're going to pick up a pink p, a pink piece, okay. And that's showing you much more easily that you've eliminated small covers, okay? Versus when I just give you pieces and gluing constructions, you just have to keep trying, right? And notice at some point, okay, anytime I want to close up, I'm introducing a pink piece. This makes it much easier. Okay. So what I'd have to show is not only that the covers that I want. The covers that I want immerse, but that no other things immerse. And that's when you see that pink piece that you always have to go over it in a close path. Okay, so this is the alternate definition. And we can actually prove this equivalence that a family T of N manifolds is L C D if and only if there exists a branched N manifold. Think of that as the train track here, such that M immerses into W if and only if M is in the family. And only if M is in the family. So now the new goal is going to be to construct a branch manifold that admits immersions of all the things I like and doesn't admit immersions of anything I don't want. Okay, just like a little bit of how you see this is like you can to find the local models, you look at the branch manifold and you look at the behavior around a vertex. That's how you find your local models. This way is much harder, but it's still doable. You take basically all your local models and piece them together. Local models and piece them together, and when you naturally piece them all in a to consider them all together, you end up getting a branch manifold. Because what you can see is, remember, that three piece can glue to a bunch of different things. So that's where you see the branching, right? At the end of the three piece, I can go here, here, or here, and that's will generalize to higher dimensions. Okay, so that's the goal. And most of the rest of the talk, I'm just going to talk about branch manifolds. So just in case you have never seen this before. Just in case you have never seen this before, a branch, this is such a cheap definition. A branch on manifold is basically a generalization of a train track and a branch surface. So here are my pictures. Okay. And like the idea here is like when you have a train track, what's going on? Like most of the time you just look like a one manifold, but there are branching locuses, right? Where like you have two sheets that are coming in tangentially and meet, or you can think about it as two sheets going out in like different directions. And then if you look at this picture in dimension two, that's about the same thing. Mentioned too, that's about the same thing. Where some places you just look like a surface, but then in some places you have this branch locus where there are sheets that come out of the same, like sort of piece, right? This one's a little bit more confusing, like what's going on here, but this is also a branch surface. I've taken like a torus and then like there's another torus and they've been glued along an edge. Okay. So this is what a branched manifold is. And when you're thinking in three dimensions, you just are doing the same thing where locally in like most. The same thing where locally, in like most places, it looks like a three-manifold, but then at some places, you're branching and you have different three sheets going around. Okay, I'm going to talk a little bit about the Thurston geometries, but does anybody have questions before? Yeah, like you imagine. Okay, like maybe not quite. I don't, I don't know. Maybe, I don't know what. I don't, I don't know. Maybe, I don't know what you mean by glued along half planes, but like, like they can, they can glue just along this like little piece and then separate again, right? So you can just take like some things, squish, like take, take a bunch of parallel sheets. Like even if you just like squish the middle region all along like right here, and then you have flaring on both sides, that's a perfectly fine branch manifold. Yeah. The second picture is going on along an edge, exactly. Right. So this is like, you don't like, this is not along a two space, right? So actually you could just. Along a two-space, right? So, actually, you could just take all those parallel copies of planes and just glue them along one common line that's branching as well. So, actually, yeah, the branch locus doesn't have to be the same dimension as the manifold, right? Okay, it's so hot. Like, I feel like my hair just keeps getting bigger too. Okay, here are the eight geometries. Okay. Yeah, I liked what somebody said. I don't know who it was. I think it was. Said, I don't know who it was. I think it was you, Jelly, where you said, Oh, like, I used to think, Oh, how could you do this homology on like group stuff? When I first learned about the eight geometries, I was like, This doesn't make any sense to me. But now that I've been working on it, actually, they're not that scary, which is like a little surprising. But okay, so we had some geometries that are like the constant curvature ones, the homogeneous, really homogeneous ones. So, spherical, Euclidean, and hyperbolic, which we expect. And then you have the product geometries. And then you have the product geometries S2 cross R, H2 cross R. Okay, this is a product geometry. And then you have like corresponding non-product geometries like nil and SL2 universal cover. And then you have these two weird ones. And that's why I fed on guessed that the sole one was the heart, one of the hardest ones. It's surprising. This ends up being really amenable to the branch surface constructions. Okay, so these are the eight geometries and six of them are easier to understand. So let me just section these. So, let me just section these off. So, these six are actually examples of ciphered fibrid spaces. So, they're generalizations of circle bundles over surfaces. They're just circle bundles over two-dimensional orbifolds. And that allows us to understand them far better. Though, yes, it's useful to know like what the geometry of each universal cover here is of each of the geometries, you can use a cipher-fibered structure to more easily, I think, understand. More easily, I think, understand what these manifolds look like. Okay, so what I'm going to focus on today, this never happens, but I'm actually going to focus on the spherical ones because it's tractable and I can show you things. I'll say a little bit about S2 cross R and SL2 at the end, maybe if I can just show you the pictures. Some of these are a little easier. Oh, sorry, H2 cross R and SL2, not S2 cross R. So there are only like six, I think. Like six, I think, or less Euclidean manifolds. There are very few S2 cross R manifolds. And remember, our goal is to take a huge family and construct a really small set that like generates it, right? So in some sense, the families that are really small are not difficult, right? Those are the ones that are really easy to understand. So I'm going to say like they're not even something to worry about. So these two cases, we don't worry about. Nil actually is as close to as good as those as possible in that there are finitely many. There are finitely many base orbifolds that you need to consider for nil geometry, and that makes our life very easy. The hard ones are like: so, when you have H2 cross R and the universal cover of SL2, you have a huge number of base orbifolds that don't fall into any neat families even. And then there are exceptional cases and general cases, and that's where things start to get really difficult because even the like showing that the set of base orbifolds is like an L C D set is difficult. Orbifolds is like an L C D set is difficult, right? Let alone the manifolds built from them. Okay, so that's kind of to show you where the levels of difficulty come from. Okay, so, but for now, I'm just going to focus on spherical manifolds. I'm going to tell you a little bit about how they break down nicely into cases and then show you the branch manifold and show you where each of the cases kind of lives in the branch manifold. Okay, so a spherical manifold is a quotient of S3. A quotient of S3 by a finite subgroup of the isometry group acting freely by rotations on that manifold. It turns out that all such manifolds are closed and orientable, but in everything we do, we're only thinking about closed and orientable manifolds. The non-orientable case, where you're trying to find an L C D set for just all manifolds of a certain type, is doable, but poses many more challenges. Okay, so we're writing our paper for the orientable case, and some brave soul later is going to do the non-orientable case. Soul later is going to do the non-orientable case. Maybe Leslie. Okay, so let me give you this like alternate way of viewing these geometries, not just by quotients of their universal covers, but by their ciphered fibrid structure. Okay, so a ciphered fibrid space, so a circle bundle over an orbifold, particular Thurston de, whether it admits a particular Thurston geometry, is determined by two things: its Euler number. Its Euler number, which is a rational number, and the orbifold Euler characteristic of that base in the bundle structure. Okay, the Euler number just measures the defect from M being a product. Okay, so when I'm talking about a product, I'm talking about like this, these geometries. So these are going to have Euler number zero. These are going to have, where am I going? These are going to have Euler number non-zero. So that can help you distinguish between different geometries if you know. Between different geometries, if you know things about the base orbifolds, Euler characteristic, and the Euler number. So here's the chart for that. I love this picture. Okay, so notice here, when Euler number is zero, you get the product geometries where this is just Euclidean. Okay. And then below, you get the three non-product geometries. So these are the six ciphered fiber geometries. And then which one you're in, once you know the Euler number, is determined by the Euler characteristic of the base. Euler characteristic of the base. Okay? So if I want to understand spherical manifolds, right? I want to understand those ciphered fibered spaces where the base orbifold has positive Euler characteristic and the Euler number is non-zero. Okay. That's what I have written there. Good. I'm going to show you the picture. I'm going to show you the picture now. So, this is, you're going to be like, what? It's not three-dimensional, obviously, because I'm not going to draw a three-dimensional picture. This is a representation of the branch manifold for spherical geometry. And it looks like this. Okay. It looks scary at first, but actually it's not super bad. It looks like a train track. Yeah, right. So some of these things are higher dimensional, but like a vertical. So let me just go through. So like first. Go through so, like, first, whatever I define to be the actual branch manifold, which I rigorously define at some point, it actually has a map to this thing. Notice that everywhere except here, actually like a graph, like a train track structure, right? Like a graphical one-dimensional structure. So I know where paths go and how they behave and ignore like all the labelings for now, but it's telling you how to glue things up, okay? So the first thing is every black point, okay, every point on an edge here. Okay, every point on an edge here, anything here is going to represent T2, okay, a torus. Okay, the blue dots represent solid tori. The purple dot represents a twisted eye bundle over a Klein bottle, which you don't need to worry about today. And this middle piece looks kind of random, but it's just a four-hold sphere cross S1 that we've just represented. I mean, you could just put a big dot there, right? Just like it's just representing. Right, just like it's just representing this three-manifold, okay? So, it's just like nonsense for now, right? You're like, where do I see anything? But I think we first need to understand like, what are the different types of spherical manifolds? And then I'll show you where they are within this diagram. Okay, but I think it is showing you at least like, okay, this is a huge class of three manifolds, and I have like a picture that just like encapsulates them all. Okay, so the claim is that a close, how do you? A close. How do you read it? Yeah, I'm going to teach you how to read it, but I need some time. Okay, if by the end you don't understand the picture, then we need to talk. Okay, so a closed-orientable three-manifold M immerses in the branch surface represented by this picture if and only if it's a spherical manifold. Okay, so first let me tell you the types of spherical manifolds. Some will be familiar to you, some might not. Okay, so the first class, it's maybe like. Maybe, like, this isn't Hatcher's algebraic topology book, so I can say this is algebraic topology. I don't know. So, when the we have the base orbifolds need to have positive Euler characteristic. So, in the case where you have the base orbifold, and this is like a standard notation for orbifolds, this is the sphere with two cone points of order two and a cone point of order n, where n is greater than, well, okay, n is greater than one there. It's two or bigger, because otherwise you don't actually get a cone point. Bigger because otherwise you don't actually get a cone point. The second one is RP2 with one cone point. It turns out that all of those, if you look at all of the circle bundles over those orbifolds, they're lens spaces. And I'll explain what lens space is. I'll recall the definition of a lens space again for you because that's the one we're going to focus on today. The second class of orbifolds is going to be a sphere with two cone points that's going to give you prism manifolds, which are actually quotients of lens spaces by an evolution. Of lens spaces by an evolution. And then the last one, I'll just say, like, is other. So it's a family of just three base orbifolds where you have a cone point of order two, a cone point of order three, and then the last cone point is of order three, four, or five. And like, okay, I'm not going to spoil it. I was going to show you where those are, but you have to guess about something in a second. So maybe the one thing I'll just kind of point out, the reason that I'm showing you the spherical case is because the orbifolds at least break up into four infinite families. Break up into four infinite families. So, like, if I can tackle each of those and then, like, build a branch manifold for each of those and then snap them together somehow, I get. I mean, a branch manifold doesn't have to be connected. So, I could have done each of these separately. It just so happened to fit together in a nice picture. So, when you have finitely many families, that at least makes the problem a little bit more tractable. Okay, so let's just make sure we're all on the same page since, like, maybe people are not as familiar with like data. As familiar with like Dane filling and things like that, but if I take a solid torus A, the curve alpha in the boundary of the torus that bounds the disk is called the meridian. Okay, so actually I drew pictures here. Okay, so this is like the standard solid torus where you make the meridian one of the two generators of homology that's the nicest. But you can have the meridian being really a lot, many, many, many different curves, right? A lot, many, many, many different curves, right? I just take this curve, which is the one, one curve, and I fill that in with a disk. And now I have another solid torus where the meridian is a different curve. Okay? So one way of defining lens spaces is you just take two solid tori, A and C, and you glue the boundaries together, subject to the condition that the meridian of one is not equal to the meridian of the other. Is not equal to the meridian of the other. So these two solid tori, I can glue together along their boundaries. And as long as these two meridians aren't the same, which they're not, I get a length space. Okay, this might not be the way you've seen lens spaces defined classically, but it's an equivalent definition. By the identity, homeomorphism. But you're not doing the nerve and a lot of the nervous system. No, no, you really don't want to do that. Okay, here's here's an exercise. Where's the chocolate? Well, this one is the disc is in one place and here the disc is in the other place. It is gluing two solitauri together, but I'm keeping track of where they are because I'm thinking about the base orbifold structure. If I take that disc and track where the fiber of this one, how many times it intersects that disk, that'll tell me the order of a cone point in one. And if I take the fiber direction, the S1 direction, so this is D2 cross S1. One direction. So, this is D2 cross S1. Well, that's what I'm trying to explain. Okay, so when you take D2 cross S1, there is a natural fiber direction. It's the S1 direction. Okay, so, and I'm not saying that the picture at this definition might not immediately give you that the base orbifold is S22N, the way I've drawn it, but you glue this one to this one. And so you track how many times. Okay, I'm going to change my picture just to make my life a little easier for this explanation. Easier for this explanation. Okay, let's take this curve. And I glue the disc in there. Okay, so what ends up happening is that here you have the disc direction and the natural fiber direction. Maybe my picture wasn't actually that good. Anyway, so the point is, you count, I wanted the other way. Wanted the other way. I hate this so much. This is like the bane of my existence, but let's go this way two times. Okay, like that. So the fiber direction here is this curve, right? And I count how many times does that fiber intersect the disk that I have here? The map down to the base orbifold collapses the fiber. So if I intersect twice and I collapse the fiber direction, I will quote. The fiber direction, I will quotient this disk out by an order to map. So, what you're describing is not a tree manifold. What you're describing is a tree manifold together with a map down to something. That's correct. Ah, that's correct. These curves are supposed to tell me what the map to the circle is. To the base orbifold is. Yes. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Yeah, thank you. Okay, okay. And what's the lens space? The lens space itself is just you take these two solid tori, as long as the meridian on one is not equal to the meridian on the other, if you glue those two along their boundary, you get a lens space. Sometimes you say even if you glue with the meridian matching the meridian, you still call it a lens space, but that's just the trivial lens space. That's S2 cross S1. And that's what you want to avoid because that's not spherical. So all any two lens spaces. So, all any two lens spaces that you get are homeomorphic. It's just that the maps just. Hitomorphic structure, yeah. Okay. Good. No, not homeomorphic. No, there's classes that are homeomorphic. How can that be? Because in all the different fundamental groups. The fundamental groups. Yeah, the fundamental groups are determined by how many times the fiber in one is. Okay, you can. Okay. Maybe, can we pause? Because I think this is like getting away from. I think this is like getting away from. I'm going to ask you to take this definition on faith. Okay. There are some that are equivalent that are actually diffeomorphic, but there are many lens spaces that are not all diffeomorphic. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So I want to try to understand a way of constructing a branch manifold that takes these two solid tori and lose them in all these. Two solid tori and lose them in all these different ways. But I see it in a very nice small picture altogether. Okay. So I'm going to fix this, the A to be the standard solid torus with basis 10101 for its first homology on the boundary. Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm going to fix the standard solid torus, which is this one. I'm going to take a basis 1, 0 and 0, 1 for the boundary of the other solid torus. And I'm going to let gamma be, well, any curve that's not the same as the meridian. Any curve that's not the same as the meridian on the other one, right? So gamma is any pq where p and q are co-prime, and p over q is not equal to the meridian on the other torus. So I'm choosing coordinates on both, and I'm just saying don't choose the same curve on both of them to be the meridian. Okay? Here is the question. Can you see where the lens space is possibly immersed? Now that you know this alternative definition. Alternative definition. Okay, reminder: black lines indicate like torus cross interval, or just black dot is a torus. Blue dots are solid tori. Purple dots are twisted eye bundles over a Klein bottle. Does anybody have a guess? I hate when people ask questions in talks, and then I become that person. Yeah, so here's a blue dot, and here's a blue dot. I don't want to go through this thing because that's like a four-hold sphere cross S1. That feels kind of bad, right? Hold sphere cross S1 that feels kind of bad, right? So these are the two blue dots with like torus cross interval in between that seem like they glue up, right? To be two solid tories glued together. Where is my note? Yeah, this is my note. Good. I put it right below. So one thing I'm just going to note, if you take a solid torus and then you add on a little torus cross interval, you still have a solid torus. Okay, so what I'm doing is I'm taking a solid torus. Any line here, forget about the labels, any line represents a torus. Labels, any line represents a Taurus cross interval. So I'm taking a bunch. If I just go straight across, let alone the loops, don't worry about them, right? If I just go straight across, ignoring this R that I have decorated here, I'm just doing solid torus glued to torus times interval glued to solid torus. As long as I've made sure that the meridians are not equal, I should get a lens space. And that's exactly what this R is supposed to do, is to ensure that you've not glued meridian to meridian. Okay, you take the standard curves on this. The standard curves on this solid torus C, you change them using this matrix R that I'll show you in a second, and then you glue them to this other standard solid torus. Okay, there are obviously many other, okay, that's one way of editing the first solid torus, but I need to do all the other ways, and that's why you're seeing all these loops. Yeah, the first one's not the other way. Like you're basically taking it as solid for us, so you need it, like transwisted, and then you take it again without twisting, and then you take it again. Very good. Yeah, so the matrices are going to represent transformations that you're applying to the tori as you go along. Okay, so I'm going to explain that in a second. But this R says, take this solid torus. At some point in this line, maybe the middle, you decide, I'm going to apply the transformation according to this matrix R, which happens to be an SL2Z. And then I keep going. And as I keep going, I'm just gluing torus cross interval, Taurus cross-invaluable, Taurus. Taurus cross interval, Taurus cross interval, Taurus cross interval, all the way until I glue in a standard solid Taurus. So, for a lot of it, nothing's happening. Okay, like as in you're just gluing stacking Taurus cross interval. Great observation. Okay. Oh, yes. Yeah, uh, sort of. We use the like the Euclidean algorithm. I'll show it to you. Yeah. Thank you. Scared me. Yeah, I'll tell you that. So that's unwanted immersions, and I'll get there eventually. Wait unwanted immersions and I'll get there eventually. Okay, so here's a thing that you should be considering this entire time. The worst thing I could possibly do is put an S2 cross S1 in this man in this branch manifold. So I need to eliminate all places where I could possibly put torus cross interval with the two sides glued together into this, because then I don't have just spherical manifolds. And again, the hard part is getting rid of all unwanted immersions. Okay, so that's where the twos are going to come in. I'll say something if I have time about that. Okay, so these are the matrices. Okay, 1, 1, 0. Okay, 11011011. Some people might find these very familiar. And what they, I just want you to see what they do to a vector. Okay, it's taking AB and it's mapping it to like A plus B B or A A plus B. So what you're doing is something related to your so forth. Yes, Carolyn's doing this, which is a Dane twist, correct. But also that's something about the Euclidean algorithm. You take the smaller one and then you add it to the larger one and replace that sum. And so what we can show. That sum, and so what we can show: well, okay, there's an example here, but let me just go down. Well, actually, no, let me do the example because now I'm just getting too excited, like way too excited, and I talk really fast. So please stop me if I'm so sorry. I'll repeat anything you want me to. Okay, let me just give you an example. Okay, so my claim is that these L and R matrices are going to get me to any PQ that I want. Okay, so if I'm trying to go from the standard meridian, like one, zero, and Meridian, like one zero, and transform it into one, two. My claim is that I can just apply the R matrix twice. So, what would I do? The path representing that lens space where I glue these two solid tori, the meridian on one is one, two, the meridian on the other is one, zero. I go over here. I go over here. I apply R once, ignore the two, I apply R twice. I'm going to go around this to just like, again, ignore, and then I close up. Okay, that doubling matters. That doubling matters, and the undoing of the doubling matters before you close up. Okay, but I'm not even going to worry about that. So, if I just deleted, like, let me cover this up. If this was just like an R instead of a 2R, you would just go R, R, close up. And that's that lens space. Okay. Obviously, things are a tiny bit more complicated because I'm trying to get rid of unwanted immersions. Okay, why did I choose this? Why do I always go over R first and then I have L's and R's after? It's because. It's because this regular language where I take all words starting in. Hey, I don't know what's going on there. Okay. Spooky. If I take all matrices that are in this regular language, what does that mean? They must start with the letter R, and then I'm allowed to do any L's and R's that I want. There are no inverses here, just L's and R's. Inverses here, just l's and r's. So, I can do like r r l r l l l l r. That's a perfectly fine word in this regular language, but every single one of them starts with r. And the point is that for any pq that I'm trying to get to, so any other meridian except the standard meridian that I started with, there is a matrix in this regular language that gets you to PQ, and that is the Euclidean algorithm. These matrices just happen to work the right way so that you can build up. Right way so that you can build up. I mean, it's the opposite of the Euclidean algorithm. Euclidean algorithm starts with PQ and it goes down to one, zero, and this is going the other way. The matrices are exactly what do that. Okay, so therefore, any lens space immerses in MS with immersion paths, with the immersion path having endpoints X2 and X5. So that's this part. Okay. So you choose your path, any path you go along here. Okay. And that's going to give me, if you tell me a P. And that's going to give me. If you tell me a PQ, I can use a computer, compute the R's and L's, and then I can draw the path for you. Okay, so that's where all the lens spaces are. You can ignore this. This is going to give the prism manifolds instead of the lens spaces. And then comes the hard part, which is what about the other direction of the proof, right? So I'm just going to say we've taken precautions to make sure that S2 cross S1 does not immerse in M. Does not immerse in M. So here's the bad thing. If I took this off, let's say I take that off, okay? And I just like consider a loop, okay? This is torus cross interval with the left glued to the right by the identity, let's say. That's S2 cross S1. That's very bad. I don't want that. Okay, so instead, what I'm going to do is label these with twos so that. With twos, so that when it's almost like just you're applying some doubling, so that when you come back around, if you tried to close up, you wouldn't get a manifold structure. You'd have a curve and another curve, and one would be doubling around the other, and you get a branch manifold and not a manifold. Okay, there's like a better picture I can draw for surfaces that might help. If I take like a cylinder and I glue an annulus onto here. Onto here. This isn't a dimension lower. Let's call this alpha. Let's call this beta. If I glue alpha to this curve gamma, okay, alpha glues to gamma using a degree one map. So using just a homeomorphism, right? Using degree one map. But then beta glues to gamma using a degree two map. What I end up doing as I go around this annulus that I've glued on is I like multiply. Glued on is I like multiply by two, right? If I come in this way, when I come out, I've gone twice around. And that's going to mean that this torus is not, is not immersed in here because it would be not a surface, right? If I try to take the torus and immerse it, it would end up being something where I've quotiented out a bunch of stuff and things get messed up. Okay, so that's the idea of the doubling. It's a little bit more complicated than that, but that is a way of getting rid of unwanted immersions. Of course, before you glue back on the other. Before you glue back on the other solid torus that you get to on this other side, you better undouble. Otherwise, the overall thing you don't get is not a manifold. And that's why we can go around this way. And that's undoing the doubling by applying the right covering map to the Taurus, right? To the Taurus direction. Two times the identity. Yeah, it really does. You can imagine it as you're taking, imagine like a covering map where you send like alpha to like go. Like alpha to like going around two times and beta going around two times, and the reverse of that. So just up and down. And you do that as many times as you want. And as long as you undo as many of the two I's as you need, right? The two two times with a, this is all, I call it a half. It's not a half, right? It's a covering map. But if you go around enough times, then you can slide out and just attach on your solid torus. And so you get your lens spaces and you've gotten rid of all of the unwanted immersions. So the order of events is you try. Order of events is you try to figure out a way to like algorithmically define your whole set of manifolds. You construct something that has all of these immersions, and then you're like, What can I do to get rid of what trick can I use to get rid of unwanted immersions? Okay, so there's more, though. I mean, that's just for the lens spaces. To show that nothing besides what we want glues into here, we basically show that, like, you know, any closed manifold. You know, any closed manifold that immerses in this branch manifold, the immersion path must have endpoints in this set. And then once you can show that, then you can say, what are all the paths between these points? And then you can make sure that they're the right kind of manifold. So the lens spaces are in here, as well as the prism manifolds. The only difference with prism manifolds is you glue a solid torus to a twisted eye bundle over a Klein bottle where the meridians are not being glued. Same, almost the same thing. That's why you basically just. Same almost the same thing. That's why you basically just end with one or the other. The other family, which is like the simplest family, causes the most problems in some sense because you have to make sure you're trying to allow all cone points of order two, three, three, four, and five. And so all of these matrices actually give you all your, so there's the cone point of order two, the cone point of order three, and then three, four, or five. And we use this to adjust up the Euler number. Okay, so that's for a talk for that's for another day, kind of. But yeah, this is what I was talking about. Um, but yeah, this is what I was talking about before. This sort of two times is getting rid of the unwanted immersions. Okay, we kind of talked through all this. So, I just want to quickly show you some pictures for the other geometries. Okay, I know it's like I could spend the whole time on the spherical stuff, but the other cases are interesting and then some of them are very delicate to tell apart. So, for Sol, this is a hand-drawn picture by Daryl. I'm not going to like tell you what all these matrices are. The L's are. Like, tell you what all these matrices are. The L's are actually the same matrix. S is something different, it's a combination of R's and L's. But remember, sole geometry, we're talking about torus bundles and semi-bundles. So you just need to, why is this a decent one for us is you're gluing torus cross interval left to right with some homeomorphism that you can put in this a regular language. So that's why Sol ends up not being as difficult. Okay, the semi-bundles are in there as well, and they have something to do with the red points. I won't dwell on that too much. These two, a little pains, telling H2 cross R and SL2 apart ends up being a little bit more difficult. They're both built out of the same basic fabric. You have the full set of base orbifolds. So these are the ones, if you remember the chart, that have negative base orbifold Euler characteristic. And that, of course, is just a huge family. That's part of the problem. Okay, so first you have to kind of think about like, how do I sort of Of think about like, how do I sort of make a branch surface that admits immersions of all of those? And then I like product with S1 and put on bundle attachments. And so both of these geometries are built from this. I want you to almost like ignore this part because those are just the exceptional cases for base orbifolds with negative Euler characteristic. It turns out that you can like sometimes you have to carefully count the order of the cone points and say. The order of the cone points and say, oh, it just is barely negative. And those are the hard cases. When the Euler characteristic of the base orbifold is really negative, you're kind of always in this very nice picture. Okay, so it's a little bit of a mystery, but basically they both are based off of this thing. And then you add on an attachment, either this thing, which should look familiar, or just this thing. Okay, you add that on. You add that on. And then I'm going to say something that maybe only people that think about these things will understand. You add one of these pieces on to either extend the structure of the horizontal surface or break it. So you either extend the product geometry to the full branch thing or you break the product structure to get SL2 universal cover manifolds. Okay. So those are the pictures I'll share and I'll stop. Yeah, exactly. So the black dots are Tori. The purple is still a twisted eye bundle of our Klein bottle. The orange, let me think for a second. That's Mobius Band. That's the those are going to be all of the okay, so you basically. Okay, so you basically take your base orbifold, you cut out the entire singular locus, so you get something called a scaffolding. And where you had comb points before will be encapsulated by this orange thing. Yeah, that's actually a what, one, two, three, four, five, six, six hold sphere across S1. It is what you think it is, yeah. And then all of these actually are just variations of that with less holes, right? You start off with a four-hold sphere and you glue on attachments that allow you to do cone points. You need to do cone points of a certain order. So this says seven or more, three or more, two or more, because if you did something besides that, you wouldn't end up with the negative base Euler characteristic for your orbifold. Okay. So these have restrictions, but all of those restrictions are just meant to convey that we've ensured that the base orbifold Euler characteristic is negative. But otherwise, it's almost like the other case. And again, this is together like the branch manifold, right? I attached this. Like the branch manifold, right? I attach this piece that I've attached to every single one of these pictures to get either the SL2 or the H2 cross R. And I just think of the whole thing together as the branch manifold, right? Yeah, so let me just talk about nil. Basically, you can like express, you could do kind of the same thing. You take the base, all the possible base orbifolds, you cut out their scaffolding. That should be like some hold sphere. That should be like some hold sphere. And then you apply the attachments according to what they should be. And often for nil, it's like you have full rein on the cone points, like you can make sure, okay, the order of the cone points and the Dane fillings you do affect the Euler number. So if I'm trying to make sure the Euler number is non-zero, I just basically ensure that I've done complicated enough Dane fillings and that they don't negate each other. Yeah. So we haven't actually written down the nil one because we want to do the harder ones first, but that's what it should be. Yeah. Yeah. In the what? Oh, in the hyperbolic case. So, yeah. So, the hyperbolic case is more complicated because hoping to write down a branch manifold like this is just like ridiculous. You're not going to be able to do it. What you can do instead is take the thick part of the manifold and use a nice triangulation. Like, you can, you can show that there are, there's like a compact set of triangle, like triangulation pieces you can use to do all the thick part. We can like. Do all the thick part. We can like put an edit on that construction to get a finite number. And then you build the thin part separately using things like this. And like, you have to play a little trick so you don't, you avoid getting into the problem of which Jane fillings actually give you hyperbolic things, right? There's like a little trick we play there, but you piece then the thick and the thin part together. We're only doing closed manifolds. Yeah. I'm sure you could do like. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's okay. So, like, the thin part for us will just be like tubes, right? Margulous tubes. Like, we don't think about manifolds with cusps. And so, yeah, it's the local picture again. Exactly. Right. Do you have any idea how big the graph would be? Oh, my God. I don't know. Probably, it would probably be pretty ugly. I mean, I don't, I think the hard part is like with the triangulation of the thick part, you just don't have much control over how many pieces you're going to use. Much control over how many pieces you're going to use. Like, it's definitely you can get down to a finite set using some argument where you play with like a compact set of pieces and you get them down to actually finite, but I don't know how many that is. And then I don't know how they fit together. Like, would it even be something I could visualize? Like, this is just ridiculous that you can get down to like a two to almost like a one-dimensional picture, right? Like, that seems completely unlikely in that case. Yeah. Maybe I'll you can. Maybe you can help us with that a lot. Well, I guess we can have time to pre-ham again. Thank you.
