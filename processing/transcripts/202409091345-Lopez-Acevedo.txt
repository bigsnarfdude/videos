Good afternoon, everybody. I'm going to talk about a method to improve kinetic functionals with the use of large-set methodology, which is a work we have done last years with Joko dectomachi. I would like to start by thanking the organizers. Start by thanking the organizers for this fantastic workshop, very much needed in the orbital-free community. And I would like to thank them for the opportunity to give this talk. So I will start by introducing myself a bit more. So I am a physicist. I study in Colombia in France. And I did my PhD on quantum information. On quantum information, then I moved to Finland as a postdoc to work on DFT simulation of clusters, materials. And at that moment, some mentioned this morning this problem that exists. My first work was to implement Meta GGA functionals in the GPO code. And indeed, it's a very big problem that the all setups use PV. Use PVE functions in reality. So I enter into this problem of looking at kinetic functionals motivated by this initial problem. But then I had a grant to have an independent group. So there I work on the more orbital-free work with the Yoko Lectomaki. Then Yoko Lectomaki and some of the members of the group I had back then. So since then, I went back to Colombia and professor at the University of Antioquia in Medell√≠n. And here is a view of the library and this is the weather all the year along. So I would like to thank all the collaborators for this time and the students I have in the This I have in the group here at the University of Teokia, but especially what I'm going to talk today is refer to the work of Joko as a PhD in Aalto University. So what I'm going to start with is talking about the quantum shell effects and the origin and the failure in orbital free and then the question of how to move from there, how to implement. There, how to implement how to bring them to the orbital-free model. So, we have as origin of the quantum shell effects, the indistinguishability of the particles, which is in reality a postulate that we force the particles to have permutation symmetry by exchange of two particles. So here I have a general physical ket which is built from the permutation of these kets which is on the right. So we do the same for the general measurement ket. Again, we have this permutation that has on two specific kets on and then the probability which is the product of this. The product of these two has this form, which is known, one is will be known as the direct term, and the other the indirect term. So I'm talking obviously here as fermions, which have this negative phase. So what happens when n equals n prime, so if the two fermions want to occupy the same state in the physical quantity, so the eigenvector of the physical quantity, this probability becomes zero. So despite it looks like So despite it looks like a repulsion or it intuitively would be looked as a repulsion, it has as an origin the symmetry or this anti-symmetry property. So the first consequence, if we look at the hydrogen atom, then we have just one electron. It starts to the solution of this one electron problem. The orbitals are separate. The orbitals are separated in shells. So, this is the first origin of this shell term. So, it's like if we were ranging them in shells, so by the quantum number n, which associated with the radial disposition of this probability. And if you look at the enforce by the orthogonality they have to have, these orbitals become very oscillatory. Become very oscillatory. And we call them, and it was mentioned in the talk just previously: these oscillations, we call them also quantum shell effects. So next, if we go beyond and we start to look at the bit more complex system, which is having many electrons, but non-interacting, so just with general considerations, we can recognize that the Recognize that not only the quantum number n, but also the quantum number L has an effect, and they will distribute this solution of the system in shells again, but now in a way that very much resembles the periodic table. And if we aggregate atoms in metals, not only aggregate. Metals, not only aggregated as metals in form of cluster, not only bare, but also protected with organic ligands, so stabilized by organic ligands. Again, we find this shell structure. So these clusters have the localized electronic structure where all the valence electrons of the metal contribute to form these shells. I have here an example of protected clusters which have shell closing at eight electrons. At eight electrons and 34, and this very big one, Gaul cluster, closing at 58 electrons. So this shell structure has a lot of consequences, physical consequence and measurable consequence. For instance, in the we will have the transitions that are very well predicted by this. Predicted by these electronic shells. So if we now include all the electrons and we look at a system with many electrons, but with all the coulombic area, all the electron-electron interaction, then we can follow. Then we can follow the energy as a function of Z. And there is semi-classical results of energy series, so expanded in Z, in powers of Z to the power of seven thirds, two, five thirds, which are very accurate and they follow the trend of how the energy grows. Of how the energy grows as a function of z. So, here it's an image showing the difference between the total energy. So, this was calculated with Consham energy, with this energy expansion in Z. And we see now the oscillation of the total atomic energy, which is again also known as a quantum oscillation, or is an effect of this quantum oscillation. Is an effect of these quantum oscillations or these quantum shells. And Thomas Fermi is exactly an exact limit. I have a problem connection. Okay, please let me know if you need, I send the slide directly. That was the we only had like a few seconds connection breakdown, but as we Connection breakdown, but so it's fine. Like, if it becomes bad, you just send us the slides and we can switch to voice to be faster. But for now, it looks okay. Okay, okay, great. So, we have these energy oscillations and these oscillations actually decay, and we have as limit the Thermas-Fermi model, which is actually the first term in this energy series. This was proved by. Series. This was proved by Liv and Simon. And the energy series is from, I have here the reference English and Schwinger. So the first term, as I mentioned, it comes from the thermothermic consideration. Second term is known as the Scott term, which is a correction from the strongly bound electrons. And the third term has a correction from the Thomas. From the Thomas Fermi and also the LDA exchange. So it's a mixture of terms. So in the language I'm going to use, this is going to be a semi-classical average, which is then perturbed by quantum oscillations. And it has a large set limit, which is in this case exactly the Thomas Fern. So not only Thomas Ferns. So, not only total energy has this type of quantum insulation, we have also the ionization potential. This was shown by Konstantin and collaborators in this reference. The interesting property of this ionization potential is that it does not decay with a large set limit, but it rather has one limit per column of the periodic table. And if we now look to an orbital-free model, the Thomas Fermi Bohemi-Sacker model in particular, it does not completely really recover this limit. So I have here in the left some values of how the orbital-free model The ionization potential of this orbital free model depends on lambda, has a different large set limit. So, if you see here z, it's on the power of minus one third. So, the smaller z would be to the right, and the infinite limit now is to the left. So, for all these lambda values, the limit is not the correct that I have shown previously. The only one that is having a good behavior is. One that is having a good behavior is the Engelsfinger model that I have not, I'm not going to discuss, but is a potential functional so an extension of DFT to include a potential as an ingredient and it has very good properties, which we think that is worth the community more attention try to develop it more. We did try with this English-Schunger model, but it has Model, but it has a lot of technical problems, and we couldn't go beyond Vicionatos. And I want to mention, as we have had already two mentions to the all-electron codes in orbital free. So here we use the Olectron implementation we did in GIPO with the PO method, but there are other all-electron methods, and we heard the And we heard the trim algorithm, which has very nice properties and would be much better suited for further studies with all electron methods. So, how to incorporate shoot effects? In orbital-free development, the Pauli principle is informed in semi-classical way. And in contrast, constant non-interacting electrons do obey Pauli principle. Do obey Pauli principle because the way the density or the orbitals of the complete wave function is constructed. As a semi-classical model, in the way is built, the orbital free, we do not expect orbital free to have shell effects, but it was an open question that Sam Trique presented this morning that is this, we do not expect, but is it true that it will never have, so theoretically it's not going to have. Theoretically, it's not going to have. What we have learned in this work is that the local pseudo-potential bring some shell effects. I'm going to show an image that can show better this idea. So I have here the ionization potential as a function of Z, but now Z is doesn't have a power, but the lower. And but it the lower z is to the left and high z is to the to the right. So this um we see the oscillations of the ionization potential and they depend on the column. For instance, the noble atoms, which are in blue, they have their own trend, is traversing their own trend, and the alkaline. Clearly, seeing their own trend, and the alkali atoms, which are now in orange, they have their own trend as well. And now, the orbital free models that are here, let me mention the Thomas-Fermi bond-based occurring in green, all electrons would have the expected orbital free semi-classical average or semi-classical trend. However, in violet, if you see this. Violet, if you see these dots, they start to follow the quantum oscillation. And these are the only locals of potential that were available at the moment in Professor so we couldn't explore further, but it is not only seen here, but also in other properties that these quantum oscillations are already brought by the local pseudo-potentials. So this is So, this is good for the model, but it brings a very difficult question, which is how we improve kinetic functionals if the local pseudo-potential are the same as kina failure, or they're improving so radically the results of the functionals. So, we are or I'm going to show the path of kinetic functional development following. Development following to reference work from Lee and colleagues and Constantine and colleagues on this direction, which we build open and extrapolate. So we are using a type of functional, which is called the Pauli functional, which is here Here in the top, I'm showing the expression, which is the sum of one Wesacker functional plus the rest will remain to be determined, would be the Pauli functional. And then this term that has to be approximated is multiplied by the Thomas-Fermi kinetic density by an enhancement factor. And this is very suitable for imposing exact constraints. For imposing exact constraints, I'm mentioning here four of these that are valid for all these GGA Pauli type functions. So we have the positivity of the Pauli term, the conjecture lip constraint, which was today some tricky words mentioning it could be one of those that could be removed. The decay of the Pauli energy density in the Pauli energy density in the limit where there is the region of the tail of the atom and we expect only one electron to or the one orbital to dominate and the small s expansion on the form of the gravity expansion. So the question is can we add a constraint to determine the second order coefficient? So we are going to show We are going to show three functionals. One is, or the performance of three functionals. One is the Luocuracif 3K functional. The other is the Gauss functional from Constantinal. And the other is rational P from our work, which is I'm adding here the reference. So these three functionals they have in common that they have. They have until second order expansion, they have exactly the same form, but they start to differ in the fourth order. The advantage of rational B is the form it has, it doesn't require special function, and then numerically it's very, very stable and easy to implement. So, how it works, the The procedure of using semi-classical average. So, first, one choose a semi-classical average. In this case, it's the atomic expansion, kinetic energy expansion in powers of z, which is obtained from the previous energy expansion, but through the virial theorem. And then we fit this expression, which I have here. Have here in the bottom of the slide, which contains the first term, which is going to be fixed to the Thomas-Fermi limit, because we do not expect the oscillations to decay so fat, so that we would need very high Z to be able to reproduce this term. So we fix it to let it fix it to the exact value. Fixes to the exact value. Second term, which is the scope term coming from the strongly bound electrons, we let it come from the fit. We don't ask it to be exact because we are planning to apply it into functions that will use local pseudo-potentials and where we expect to have no contribution actually from this kind of term. And then the important term here to obtain from the feeds, it's the A2 coefficient. A2 coefficient. So the procedure is as follows. We have, as you see here in the image, we have the kinetic energy minus the expression, which is then the term which would be zero. And we have the quantum oscillations in blue around. But we can have many classical average semi-classical average. Semi-classical average to describe these oscillations or the decay of these oscillations. So we could have, as in the case where we have noble atoms and alkali atoms in the extremes. Here we call one the lower envelope and the other the upper envelope and we choose the atoms that cross these envelopes. So now that we have chosen a certain number of atoms and we have the expression. We have the expression fitted. So, next we evaluate non-self-consistently and adjust the parameters to agree with this average. So, for example, I have here the Gauss and the L-Cate functionals. The reference is the last column. We have The last column we have as parameters one and point eighty five, and the this fitted procedure, this fitting procedure brings the values relatively close to them. And there are proposed functional, which is one rational p, which a value that will be very close to reproduce Gauss functional, has very similar coefficients and rational. Coefficients and rational p has also very similar coefficients. So, let me show you some results. So, as expected, the LCAT has the reference and Gauss reference has average small mean absolute error, both in metals and in semiconductors. Defeated functionals, they also have a small average error. In the case of LCAT, it's a bit above, and in the case of Gaussi, it's a bit below. So what is important here, the important message is that those functionals used a numerical exploration of these parameters, while here. While here we are managing to obtain this performance through exact limit constraint. And its constraints is on an atom, while the exploration there was done on, well, it's a mixture, but mainly bulk properties so that this is that was fitted to atom properties and now tested in solid. And now tested in solids for us is a very good property that indicates there would be some transferability. And then now, if we look only at rational p, the functional we proposed, again, the errors are similar to L-Cate and Gauss, so as expected. In this study of large-scale limits, we realized that there are also limits in the bulk system, which were not previously known. So here I'm showing this is lattice constant of FCC ComSham system in black with LD exchange. With LD exchange correlation functional, and we see the quantum oscillations expected, and the Thomas-Fermi-Bohm-Wisacher all-electron having this semi-classical trend around the oscillations. And as previously, we saw for the energy here again, or the initial potential, sorry, here again, the local pseudo-potential, and this is. Local pseudo-potential, and this is here is more striking. The effect really brings the functional to a place that it can describe these quantum oscillations. We look now at the, this is relatively low Z. Now we look at the large Z regime and we can see that again, this is the Z power minus third, so large Z is to the Large set is to the left, so the toward the zero value. So the conscium columns eight and seven in blue and red, they have a very clear limit of these, so they have a large limit. If they coincide, we cannot say, we think that indeed they seem to decay. Indeed, they seem to decay to some. They would decay to the same value. We didn't explore more pollens because the way the setup is constructed, it was easier to keep the S and P valence of the highest electrons. While the D electrons were already creating some difficulties, so they were. So we just maintain these two columns. But we think it's enough to, as a proof of concept, that the large sublimate exists. And the Thomas-Fermi-Wonville-Sacker does not has, seems not to have the right limit. I'm not showing the rational P or the other functions, but they don't have the largest limit here neither. The large limit here, neither. So, we think that this is going to be an opportunity to have more constraints, large set constraints to pursue this study of functions. And then as a conclusion, struggle bound errors should be corrected, but local pseudo-potentials are problematic for development, so it's very good for the model, but it then. So it's very good for the model, but then it masks kinetic failures. A way to go further is the large limit of atomic and solid properties. I showed the use of statistical atom model energy allows to determine the second-order parameter of Paulifunctional. And we think it's a good direction to explore new semi-classical average constraints, as for example, the lattice constant and next order in kinetic affordability. Next order in kinetic functional development. And with that, we'd like to thank you all for your attention.
