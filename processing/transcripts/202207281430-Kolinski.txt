Thank you. Short and sweet. All right. So I'm John Kalinsky. I'm a professor at the tenure track professor at EPFL in the mechanical engineering department. And I'm going to be talking about one topic in the context of cracks that we're looking at in the lab, where, as you'll see, we're trying to enhance the toughness of brittle materials by playing around with the features that form at the tip of the crack. But before I dive into that, I just want to give you a brief overview. Into that, I just want to give you a brief overview of some of our lab's activities. And this slide's a bit inspired by Stephen's talk the other night on art. Namely, because these are images that members of my group and myself submitted to the Swiss National Science Foundation image competition, which is sort of a National Science Foundation-sponsored competition that recognizes, as Stephen pointed out the other night, that many things in science are aesthetic and can get people interested in. Get people interested in science. So, this is an image of a crack propagating dynamically through a thin sheet of hydrogel. And there's a lot going on here. It's actually a multiple exposure image. The crack's moving at somewhere in the neighborhood of about five meters per second, which is about the Rayleigh velocity in the material. And you see all sorts of buckling that's happening in the thin sheet after the crack is passed. You also, if you look closely, you see the tip, which is like these little features here, sort of meandering, and that's actually a known instability. Of meandering, and that's actually a known instability where a crack will undergo sort of a wavy trajectory as it accelerates close to the Rayleigh velocity. This was an image of six different fracture surfaces that were broken in our tensile testing machine. These are brittle plastic, and from order left to right, we're applying a little bit more mode three, so out of plane shear, while also applying mode one tension. And you see that there are some beautiful patterns. That there are some beautiful patterns that emerge, and it's as a consequence quite an aesthetic image. This one down here was taken by a postdoc, Martin Kuch, and it's related to our lab's other research direction, which is contact line motion and wetting. And so this is the color image of the bunch. And what you see is a whole bunch of droplets on textured surfaces, which is one of the themes that we're looking at in the context of wetting. And the color is actually sort of like what happens when you have a diffraction grating. It emerges naturally from white light reflection. It emerges naturally from white light reflecting diffracting rather off of the pattern that we've embossed on the surface of the silicon wafer here. And there's a logo of EPFL. Yeah, so there's a little bit of shameless promotion going on in this one as well. And so these two were featured actually in the art gallery in Beale and were cited in some way at that gallery. So the group, of course, the work that I'm going to show is a group effort, namely carried out by graduate students. Carried out by graduate student Sinyu Wei, who started in the lab in September. So she's made rapid progress as a student in the lab and has already done some really nice things that I'll show in a moment. It's sponsored by the Swiss National Science Foundation. Of course, we have some collaborations with colleagues at the Hebrew University, Jay Feinberg, whose head is a little bit obscured by this image here, and Meng Wang, who's a postdoc with Jay, and Motar Adabedia, who's at ENS in Lyon. And I think he's skiing uphill here, if I'm not mistaken. I think he's skiing uphill here, if I'm not mistaken. So he's a little bit confused about the purpose of the skis, I guess. So, why are we interested in fracture mechanics? I mean, it's a very old problem, right? I think Galileo initially posed the question, what's the maximal load that a column can take if you just continue to add weight to it, right? And so, it's a very old question with significant engineering applicability. And so, this is one of the reasons the Navy got really interested in the last century in fracture mechanics. In the last century, in fracture mechanics. This is the USS Schenectady, which was embrittled, I think, at low temperature and then just broke in half, the whole just completely cracked. And of course, that's an example of a brittle failure. Over here, we have a stainless steel bar that's been pulled in tension. And this is a different example of failure that I'm not going to focus on here, where you have quite a bit of ductile plastic deformation before the failure occurs. And so if you look closely, you can see that there's And so, if you look closely, you can see that there's almost like a 45-degree angle between the planes that are formed on this feature where the crack is propagated through. And that's primarily because, you know, if you know Moore's circle, you have a rotation of your stress tensor, and that's where the dominant shear stress is acting. And that's how ductile failure occurs. And then this is maybe a more mundane example, but a more frustrating one. So if you have your cell phone and you accidentally drop it on a concrete floor, it can break and you can be disconnected from. And you can be disconnected from the web. So, we obviously want to, as engineers, we want to eliminate this. But before we dive into our approach, I want to just do something a bit didactic where we go through some of the fundamentals of fracture. So, how do things break? So this is basically the Griffith approach, which dates now to 100 years ago. And so, the idea from Griffith is that materials will break when there's enough elastic energy stored in the sample to drive the crack, right? And so, where Crack right, and so where what does that elastic energy go? Well, if you do a simple analysis of like, let's say the number of bonds that you have per unit area in some sort of a crystal material, which would be like 10 to the 20 per meter squared, and the energy of those bonds, which is 10 to the minus 19 joules, you end up with the fracture energy of 1 to 10 joules per meter squared. And so, that's basically the energy that you're required to provide in order for an area of surface to be generated. Area of surface to be generated, right? So Griffith's argument is really all about how do you generate that area as a crack propagates, right? And so the energy supply, of course, is more or less a strain energy. So what we're looking at there is if you have a material that's being loaded in tension, something like this, right? That's basically like stretching a spring. There's a work that I've done on the sample, and that's the energy then that can, if focused towards the crack tip. If focused towards the crack tip, can drive the crack to advance, right? And so that's where basically you end up with Griffith's argument, which is that fracture is fundamentally a matter of energy balance, where that strained energy is going to drive the crack and generate that new surface, which has an energetic cost associated with it, right? So that's Griffith, right? But it doesn't really, Griffith doesn't really tell us much about the configuration of the stress field around a crack tip, right? And so exact calculations of the stress field around a crack tip came a bit later. So this is essentially So, this is essentially a summary of linear elastic fracture mechanics, which is more or less the state of the art for our understanding of fracture these days. And from linear elastic fracture mechanics, namely stress analysis at the crack tip, we know that cracks create a singular stress at the tip of the crack, right? And so if you have, for example, polar coordinates around your crack tip, so r is the distance away from the crack tip, theta is the angle, angular orientation of the material point that you're looking at, you can write down a close. You're looking at, you can write down a closed form expression for the stress. And sigma ij, this is because stress is a tensor, so i and j basically call out different components of the stress. And this is more or less the fundamental form of the expression that you would derive from linear elastic fraction mechanics. And so if in particular we plot, for example, the component of the stress that's oriented along the loading direction, if we're loading in the plane, then effectively what we see is at the tip of this feature, this crack, that stress diverges to infinity. Stress diverges to infinity. And furthermore, we know the nature of that divergence. We know that the stress diverges to infinity as one over the square root of distance from the crack tip. This is a classical result in fracture. And there are two main features I want to call out here. Number one is K, which is the stress intensity factor. And from linear elastic fracture mechanics, we know how to relate that to the applied stress at infinity and the length of the feature, where the stress is going to concentrate at the tip. And this, and a crack will propagate when k exceeds a critical value, which is based. Exceeds a critical value, which is basically the value at which the strain energy associated with this stress field ahead of the crack is enough to feed the energy, energetic cost coming from generating that new area, right? And so there is a critical value of k at which the crack will propagate. And furthermore, I'm not going to talk about this very much, but you can also write down closed form analytical expressions for f here. So these are dimensionless functions of the angle and the velocity. The radial dependence. They the radial dependence is already taken care of here. These are only functions of the angle, and you can write down closed-form expressions for those as well. So you can look those up in a book. They're known. And so in the context of, sorry, Benny, go ahead. Sorry, and I understand this is an introductory slide before, but so my understanding of grid criterion was that you get a crack when the elastic energy is enough to feed the surface. Is enough to feed the surface energy. Yep. So you say that K needs to, but K does not depend on the surface energy. So well, so you can relate K to the amount of strain energy that's feeding the crack tip. So it turns out that G and K are related as G is equal to K squared divided by the modulus. What is G? G is the strain energy that's driving the crack. So if we go back one more slide to the Griffith slide, that's the elastic energy that's driving the crack. Okay. And so using the closed form expression from And so, using the closed form expression from the stress field, I can calculate the amount of elastic work that's stored ahead of the crack. And using Griffith, I can relate that to the energy generated as the crack. But eventually, it's a function only of this k. So, for a given load, it's really a function of the length of the car. Yes, yeah, right. So, the stress intensity factor depends on the length, as you see in this expression here. Yeah. Thanks for the question. For the question. So, in the context of linear elastic fraction mechanics, the last kind of by way of introduction thing that I want to comment on is that there are three known or three dominant modes of crack propagation that because we're looking at a linearly elastic theory, you can decouple these guys and just add them up. So if, for example, we have any of these three loading conditions. So just to enumerate them, mode one is in plane tension. That's like I'm loading the plane of the sample. Mode two is more like a frictional mode. So I'm shearing across the sample. So I'm shearing across the sample, but in the plane of the crack, right? And then mode three is out of plane, so almost like a torsional mode, right? Like what Arshad was talking about earlier with his sheets. And so these are the three modes. And because it's a linear theory, we can just sum up each contribution where alpha now is the index on which mode of the crack forcing that we're looking at. And the angular functions are again known, but they're different depending on which mode you're looking at. Looking at. Okay. And so because the stress is singular, there's no a priori path selected for a crack. And this is one of the main things that relates, or that I would say, makes fracture mechanics highly relevant in the context of pattern formation, because essentially crack stability is not guaranteed because you don't know a priori which path the crack will take, especially when you have mixed mode loading conditions. And so in our experiments, I'm going to talk about a lot of experimental work that we're doing where we're Experimental work that we're doing where our dominant application is mode one, but I want you to remember mode three because that actually has a great degree of relevance in generating crack tip complexity. So I wanted to introduce a brief comment on the implications of Griffith's analysis for cracks in the context of pattern formation. So the process of fracture is an open dissipative process, right? So you have this energy source, which is the elastic energy, the strain energy that's driving the crack, and then you have a dissipative. Energy that's driving the crack, and then you have a dissipation that occurs at the crack tip, which sounds a lot like other open dissipative systems that generate or that are typical in pattern formation. So, convection, turbulence, these types of things, right? And for brittle solids, the material response is linear, right? So, you have a Hookian solid in general, but the free boundary introduces a non-trivial geometry. So, this free boundary is what generates that non-linear scaling of the stress around the crack tip. And as an open dissident system, there are characters. Open dissident system, there are characteristic patterns that form on the crack surface, right? So, I just want to provide a couple of examples of those. And I'm going to comment on these in more detail in just a bit. So, this is an observation of the plane of a crack. So, now if this is our crack or this is our material, we're looking at the thickness of the sample in this image over here. Okay. And so these are dynamic fracture experiments conducted in brittle plastic. And what you see is that the fracture surface is quite modeled. That the fracture surface is quite modeled, it's almost cratered, right? And so now, if we take another view and we start looking at from the side, right, underneath this cracked surface, which is shown down here, you see that actually in the process of propagating through this brittle plastic at high speed, the crack has deviated from the dominant plane and gone underneath that cracked surface, right? So that's one example of a pattern that forms in the context of crack mechanics. Here's another example, which is um which emerges sort of organically. So this is a Sort of organically. So, this is a head-on view of a crack surface of a cylindrical sample that was loaded in mixed mode with tension and torsion. Okay. And so what you're looking at, you see these shadows. This is because the illumination is from the side. It's kind of oblique. And the shadows are generated by this incredible topography that emerges on the crack surface. Okay. So this, you know, if you're looking down at it, if we're looking at a contour map of this, this might look like some arbitrary location in the Alps someplace. It's very. Help someplace. It's very featured, we'll say, right? And so then a final example that I want to introduce, because this is the material system that we're going to be looking at in detail, is this example, which this is a prophylometry image. Again, we're looking at the fracture surface. So through the thickness of the sample, we're looking at the fracture surface after the crack is propagated through. And what you see is that there are all sorts of features that are highly localized, that have some characteristic shape that's associated to them, and that have clearly Um, have clearly caused the crack to deviate from the dominant plane on which it was propagating, right? And so, all of these things are emerging naturally, whether driven by dynamics, by loading conditions, or simply by an intrinsic instability that emerges even at relatively low velocities. Okay, and so these patterns have direct consequences for the effective fracture toughness, right? So, why do these patterns emerge on cracked surfaces? So, there's a hint if we look. So, there's a hint if we look at experiments and theoretical developments that are done in a highly controlled way for that mixed mode loading condition. So, this is a kind of an older experiment from Summer, where essentially this is exactly that mixed mode one, mode three loading condition that I just introduced in the middle image of the last slide. We have a cylindrical sample. This is just a glass cylinder that's subject to tension, okay, and then twisted. So, we're applying a torque while subjecting the rod to tension. While subjecting the rod to tension. And depending on how much torsion we apply and how much tension we apply, we can get a crack to propagate. And what we see is that the crack will propagate and make this sort of mirror-like finish. But then at a later stage, the thing that I'm highlighting here is all these lances that emerge, right? The crack is propagating this way, in fact, right? So we're looking at the fracture surface head on. And so this would be the plane of the crack. Yeah, so it would. Yeah, so it would have nucleated down here where the notch was introduced. Yes. And so it's propagated upward this way. And then as it's moved outward, because there's this torsion applied, you end up developing these lances. And these lances are 3D in character, right? So this is like a shadow graph. So the reason they look light and dark is that they're three-dimensional, really, right? And the crack front doesn't always or does not advance under mixed mode loading and remain continuous. Yeah, go ahead. Just to be sure. Yeah, go ahead. Just to be sure I understand what's going on. So, which part has cracked already here? Okay, so where's the initial notch? Well, maybe where's the initial notch? This is a fractured surface. Okay, that's after the crack. Yeah, so like if, for example, this was like the plane that we had put the notch on, we're looking at it like this afterward. Is that clear? So, like, this was a coherent sample, and then we've broken it, and we're looking at the surface head on. Is that clear? Is that clear? But the crack started from a notch that was localized on one side of the sample, which breaks the up-down symmetry of the image. Well, no, in fact, it propagated across the sample like this. So if this is the plane of the fracture surface and I want to orient it on this image, which is a side-on image of this sample at the beginning, I would have to rotate my hand 90 degrees. So that's the plane that the crack is propagated through. Okay? And so And so the crack front does not advance under mixed mode loading condition and remain continuous, and instead, corrugations and lances emerge on the crackfront. And so this was actually shown in silico with phase field calculations by Pons and Karma, where essentially they have a cube of material, a rectangular body of material, which is, you can see vaguely the outlines here. And then this surface, this surface is really, it's an iso-class. Surface is really an isocontour of their phase field, which you should basically consider that to be the fracture surface. Okay, so that's what we're looking at here. And so the crack is starting from the back end of the cube of material and propagating towards us. There's a three-dimensional image now along X, right? So that's the direction of propagation. And what you see is that it starts out initially flat and smooth, and then it goes into these sort of corrugations, these lances. And that's exactly what. These lances, and that's exactly what Somer saw on the edge of his sample, right? And so, what does that actually look like? Well, I mean, I made this inspired by the last talk, but basically, it would look a lot like this. And then what this experiment and these calculations show us is that this type of crack shape will not propagate stably forward. Instead, it'll like where you have highly where you have these sort of junctions here, those are gonna localize. Junctions here, those are going to localize into sort of discrete disruptions of the crack frame. Okay. And so on the theory side, all the way back in 1994, Zhou Bauer and Ortiz did a linear stability analysis for whether a crack front subject to some sinusoidal perturbation of its shape out of the plane. So in other words, something almost exactly like this. So if we're looking at, these would be the crack surfaces now. If we're looking at a crack front that's like sinusoidal, If we're looking at a crack front that's like sinusoidal and advancing through our sample, okay, what they were calculating is whether this thing would grow, would stay stable or grow, right? And what they're looking at is the critical mode 3 loading that you have to apply in the far field relative to the tensile loading that you're applying as a function of Poisson's ratio. And they calculate with linear stability analysis a curve that distinguishes between where the crack would remain stable and where the crack would become unstable. Okay, and what's interesting. Okay, and what's interesting is that if you look at data, they're very far away from the linear stability curve, which is actually an excellent question. Why is it that these things are really not in agreement with the linear stability analysis? And so, of course, I'm talking about toughness enhancement. So my main question is, what are the consequences for the effective fracture energy when you have a crack that won't remain stable and instead will generate three-dimensional structure, right? And so. Right, and so I'm going to go through a couple of examples of different scenarios where we observe the emergence of these three-dimensional features. Right, so the first is dynamic cracks. This is a famous image from Ravi Shandar. And essentially, in this scenario, we're going to basically explosively drive a part with a wedge of copper, the edge of a sample, and drive a crack that will accelerate through the sample, propagating in this direction. And what we see on this fraction. This direction, and what we see on this fracture surface, so now we're looking again at the fracture surface head-on, is that you have mere, mist, and hackle, right? And so, these verbal descriptions of the surface correspond more or less with how rough the surface is, okay? And what's interesting is that if you look, and Ravi was able independently to measure the stress intensity factor, or correspondingly, how much strain energy was driving the crack in each of these different regions for a number of different samples. And so, what you see is that the stress intensity. And so, what you see is that the stress intensity factor increases in proportion to whether you're generating more or less features on your crack surface, right? And so, this was again shown if we go back to this image by Sharon and Feinberg by actually very painstakingly accumulating a measurement of all the area per projected area of this crack. So, what they did is they basically integrated not just the plane that the crack had propagated through, but all these little Through, but all these little deviations that you have. And those, of course, increase the amount of area that you're generating as the crack propagates. And if you look at that relative surface area and you look at that as a function of the energy flux, which you control experimentally, you see that they agree almost exactly in a linear fashion, which is really pretty cool. What it means is that essentially these features that are highly three-dimensional that are caused by the crack deviating out of plane, they roughly They roughly increase the toughness of the sample, right? And so, crack tip complexity means you get more surface area, and more surface area means more energy dissipation. Can I ask you a question about the previous slide? Sure. The different curves on the left, is the only difference that the wedge was driven faster or slower? Yes, I believe that's correct. So essentially, I didn't talk about the details of the experiment, but I think Ravi had a degree of control over how fast he. Had a degree of control over how fast he would generate the crack initially. And that's why you get, for example, this crack, which was like relatively slow, and then these ones, which are driven much more rapidly. Is that clear? I think so, yeah. Okay. So, okay. So then I'm trying to address this question. Are complex cracks tougher? And so there's also evidence, of course, from brittle ceramics. So these are brittle ceramics that are subject to exactly the loading condition that we saw in the Somer experiment. Somer experiment, so tension and torsion. And what we see is that as a function of the tensile stress that we're applying, we get very different fracture surface configurations. In fact, if we go to a pure tension experiment, so there's no mode 3 applied, but only mode 1, pure tension, we see that the cracked surface is perfectly planar, right? Whereas if we go to the extreme case, this is the one you already saw, you get basically this alpine type of feature on the cracked surface. And that's all mode three. So that's pure torsion. There's no tension applied, right? Torsion, there's no tension applied, right? And these are very brittle materials, they're ceramics, right? And so that has consequences for how much strain energy you need to drive a crack when you're subjecting it to this mixed mode loading condition. So essentially, if you do all mode three, and this is like where K3 by K3C is equal to one, you see that you need an enormous amount of strain energy to drive that crack. Whereas if you do no mode three, you need much, much less by over a factor of four. Factor of four, right? So, there's for a pure tensile crack where you have a very smooth fracture surface, you don't need to put as much work into the sample to get the crack to propagate. That's the bottom line, right? So, more mode three corresponds to substantially increased complexity at the crack tip and an increase in effective tuck. Again, more area, more energy. And so, in hydrogel systems, we've seen a very similar thing. So, this is an experiment that we did, that I did as a postdoc in Jay's lab. And so, effectively, we have a crack that's propagating dynamically. Effectively, we have a crack that's propagating dynamically through a brittle hydrogel. And the feature that looks like the star here is a rigid inclusion. Okay, so the crack is propagating across the sample. It gets pretty close to this rigid inclusion, which modifies the stress field ahead of the crack, and then it stops. So you can completely arrest a crack, in fact, by getting in its way. And of course, that's basically a modification of the stress field. So for those of you who are familiar with fracture mechanisms, If for those of you who are familiar with fracture mechanics, if the crack had actually encountered the particle directly, then we'd be looking at a different fracture energy. Here, we haven't modified the fracture energy. It's only the gel that's breaking. And so similarly here, these features that emerge that I showed you earlier on this same gel system, but now we're looking at the plane, the plane of the crack, these features also correspond to increases, local increases of fracture energy. They'll pin the crack front. And finally, these are experiments that we did. Experiments that we did, or I did in collaboration with Meng, where we have a crack propagating across the sample. And we have two different types of features that are generated by the crack as it's propagating, one with more geometric complexity than another. And what we see is that when we compare it to the baseline fracture or the baseline critical strain energy density that we need to drive a crack that's perfectly smooth, we see an increase in the strain energy density when we have these steps. And we see a greater increase when we have these more. Greater increase when we have these more topographically complex features by a factor of three in this case, right? So, this means that we have to put three times more work into the sample to get the crack to propagate in the case that we have these micro branches, right? So, there are there are clear and direct, these are clear and direct evidence that you need to have more strain energy to drive a crack when it's more complex geometrically, right? So, cracks are 3D. I just want to summarize because there was a lot of background, okay? Um, so for brittle solids, crack surface area. So, for brittle solids, crack surface area is equal to the energetic cost to drive the crack, right? Generally, texture emerges even in a pure mode one loading configuration by intrinsic stabilities of the crack front. Again, it's like other pattern forming systems, it's an open dissipative system. So these patterns and texture tend to emerge naturally. And furthermore, cracks are unstable to mix mode one, mode three loading. And that basically breaks the planar symmetry. And what I mean by that is if this were, for example, The crack feature, and I'm just looking at the surface of the crack, right? And it's coming open. So this would be like the crack tip opening displacement, right? When I say it's planar symmetric, then we would look down it and there wouldn't be any three-dimensional character to it. Whereas what's happening when the crack deviates out of plane, you'd have features that, if you look at them from the side, would look something like that, right? Where you have significantly more surface area generated as the crack propagates. Can I interrupt with that? Sure. Can I interrupt? Sure, please. Just making sure I have the picture a little beyond the slide. Okay. So the Griffiths theory tells you when the crack's going to run. Yes. But it doesn't really predict quite what's going to happen. Well, it doesn't tell you the state of stress around the crack tip. And it doesn't tell you where it's going to go, what shape crack surface is going to be left. Exactly, exactly. And so, well, maybe we don't have a good theory. So, well, maybe we don't have a good theory of that, but in the experiments, you can control that on the one hand by changing the mode, the bar field stress, and on the other hand, by changing the state of stress in the vicinity of the crack through inclusions or whatever. And so, what we're seeing are sort of the effect of those, you know, lacking a theory of how it's supposed to look, right? We're at least. It's supposed to look, right? We're at least exploring what's the effect of these changes. Yes. I mean, you know, that's, and it's driven by experiment here precisely because we don't have a theory for how these textures emerge, right? I mean, and, you know, the state of stress ahead of these complex crack tips is very complex. But the dominant question in fraction mechanics is what path does a crack take? And once you have a fully 3D crack, it becomes enormously complex. So, yes, so that I think is a good subject. So, yes, so that I think is a good summary. Thank you. And so, then this gets us to our question where we get involved as experimentalists: can we characterize the fully 3D kinematics of the crack as it propagates? And what are the consequences of this 3D crack surface feature for the critical strain energy that we need to drive the crack? So, what we're going to do to characterize the crack tip is we're going to look at the crack tip opening displacement. And so, this is a known parameter that engineers explore when they're looking at fracture mechanics, right? And And so, effectively, why is the CTOD important? Well, from linear elastic fracture mechanics, we know the stress field goes as one over the square root of r, distance from the tip. And so that has consequences for the displacement field. In fact, it predicts that the displacement field should be parabolic. So we expect that the crack tip opening should be parabolic as you go backward along the cracks-free surface. And of course, we can write down an equation for that. And furthermore, the pre-factor of that parabola is directly related to the critical stress intensity factor, right? And from the critical stress intensity factor, this goes back to Benny's question, we can actually evaluate G, the strain energy that we're using to drive the crack. And because of energy balance, we go back to Griffith now, we know that G and gamma are perfectly equal to one another when the crack is propagating. Okay, so that's why we're interested in this crack tip opening displacement. And then this is the Opening displacement. And then, this is the, for those of you who are interested in the details, this is the expression of gamma and how it relates directly to A. Okay, so we measure A just by looking at the shape of the parabola behind the crack. And then mu is the shear modulus here. So it's a very direct expression to get to the fracture energy, right? And so the question is, can we measure the CTOD for fully 3D cracks, right? Everything I've written here, this is valid for a crack that's planar symmetric, right? But I'm interested in looking at cracks that through one mechanism or another become. Cracks that through one mechanism or another become more complex, and so that's a an open question, right? So, okay, so what's our experimental system? Well, we have a brittle hydrogel, we have our loading system, and we're going to have a confocal microscope that will allow us to get three-dimensional data, okay? So, I want to start off with our hydrogel system. So, our hydrogel is basically a polymer network embedded with a solvent, which is water. We add a fluorophore to that. So, we dye it, it's rhodamine. And then, once we have it dyed, this is what the sample looks like. So, it's basically a couple hundred. Sample looks like. So it's basically a couple hundred microns thick. It's very thin because we need it to be thin in order to see it in the microscope. And then we insert a notch with our scissors. And that gives us basically our starting point for our sample. We take that sample, we put it on our loading system. And so on the loading system, we just apply that tensile stress. And how do we do that? We have a couple of actuators that mount on the top of our microscope. On the top of our microscope. Our microscope is a confocal microscope, which you know you don't really need to know about the details here other than to know that what this microscope does is it blocks all the light that's not in the plane of focus of the microscope objective. So the only fluorescent light that we see is in a single plane in Z. That plane is usually about a micron thick. And so that allows us to measure the kinematics light directly. And you can actually scan the objective up and down in order to get full three-dimensional stacks of your images. Of your images. And so here's what a typical measurement looks like, right? So we're zooming in very, very strongly here to the tip of the crack. This is actually drawn to scale here. It's a 500 by 500 micron box that we're looking at. And so that's what a typical image looks like. So the bright region here is the fluorescently labeled part of the gel. And this is basically the gap that's left behind after the crack is propagated through. And so if we look at that in detail, we can actually watch a crack propagate. So this is a time series of images that we recorded, right? But of course, Recorded, right? But of course, the advantage of confocal microscopy is that it's actually a three-dimensional method. So, this is now a Z-stack that we've scanned. And you see that this is a crack that's almost perfectly planar. So, this would be not an example of the complex cracks that we're really interested in, but rather a baseline for comparison, right? And so here, the crack velocity is really slow. It's about two and a half microns per second, which is important because there's a time scale associated with how fast we can scan. So, as I said before, we can directly relate the crack. Said before, we can directly relate the crack tip opening displacement to fracture energy. And so, what we do is we take our crack tip opening displacement, we fit a parabola to it. Okay, and as I said, that pre-factor is directly related to gamma, the fracture energy, and it turns out to be 4.6 joules per meter squared, which is exactly in agreement with known other measurements that were carried out in a different way for the same material. So, we know basically that our experimental method is now working. And so, this value is in line with the slow cracks that have been measured in other systems. Cracks that have been measured in other systems. And so now the question is: can we use a similar analysis for more complex crack tips? Right? And so, here, what we're going to do is we're going to look at crack tips that have emergent complexity for one reason or another. Usually, what we do is we take advantage of that mixed mode one, mode three instability, apply a little bit of out of plane shear, and then mount the sample on our microscope and load it in your attention. And we end up with features on the cracked surface. So, if you look closely up here, you can see in the shadow that there's quite a bit of tortuosity. The shadow that there's quite a bit of tortuosity to this crack tip, and furthermore, it's bent. Right over here, we have a much more discrete sort of feature that's emerged. So, this is actually the junction of two crack tips that are open simultaneously. So, essentially, what that is, is you have one crack plane here and another crack plane here, and they run into each other. So, there are two crack planes there. And this is another example where we have two crack planes where sorry, the colors just so over here, ignore them. Over here, they designate sort of one crack. Over here, they designate sort of one crack front and a second crack front. And similarly, here, there's hidden underneath this eave here, there's a crack front over here in blue and a crack front up here in red. Yeah. So the colors basically allow us to see those two crack fronts distinctly. Well, they're running parallel to one another. Yeah. And so the heterogeneity at the crack tip can emerge spontaneously, and that inevitably breaks the planar symmetry of the crack, right? And so this is a known phenomenon. And so this is a known phenomenon from Beaumberger's experiments where you see basically a sketch of the topography of the crack front here. So you have essentially one crack that terminates into the free surface of a second crack that overlaps and sort of intersects the upper part of this surface, leaving a flap of material behind. And so some cracks appear to be these two crack fronts. So these two examples in particular, which have been uncovered in many different prior studies. But now we're directly observing a broad. Now we're directly observing a broader CTOD in the wake of these complex crack tips, and we're able to visualize it in C2 with the full thickness of the sample, right? And so here's where we basically define an apparent fracture energy, right? And so what I'm going to say is I'm going to take my eyeglasses off and I'm going to sort of use what is away from that complexity that's emerged at the crack tip. So for a simple crack, the analysis of the CTOD is straightforward. We simply fit a parabola all the way to the crack tip and use a constitutive All the way to the crack tip and use a constitutive model to recover the fracture energy, the shear modulus, right? For a complex crack, things are a bit more complex, right? So we have to basically use the nonce principle to ignore this red part where the complexity of the crack tip is located, and then fit the parabola to the trailing region that's highlighted here in green, right? And so here we're going to use a Hookie material model to recover an apparent fracture energy for the complex crack tip using this intermediate field, right? So we're going to ignore the stuff going on at the crack tip and only look at the trailing field. On with the crack tip, and only look at the trailing field. And even for complex crack tips, we can fit a parabola, right? So, this is one slice of a complex crack tip, which looks quite sharp here, but you can still fit a parabola to it. And if you plot it on a log-log scale where we're only looking at this trailing edge here, you can see that there's a reasonable agreement between the parabolic fit and the data, right? And so, if the question now is, is the apparent fracture energy, namely what we would get by using our Hookie and material model to By using our Hookie and material model to calculate gamma from this parabola, is that related to the complexity of the crack tip, right? In other words, is the CTOD dilated as responsible of this complexity as a consequence of this complexity? And furthermore, how might we measure the crack tip complexity, right? So we have to somehow have a metric here if we want to make a quantitative comparison. And so basically what we're going to do is simply use the linear distance of all the points that sit on the crack. Of all the points that sit on the crack at the leading edge of the crack, right? And so we're just going to integrate this distance along the crack's surface, right? And so the NC23D measurements allow us to directly measure the crack front length for arbitrary crack front complexity. So no matter what features are emerging, we can do this type of analysis where we integrate the length of the crack front, right? And so if you recall Griffith, this length is proportional to the area that's going to be generated when the crack advances in the next step. Be generated when the crack advances in the next step. Okay, so more or less, this should scale directly with the fracture energy as the crack propagates. And in fact, things line up reasonably well. So again, I'm going to plot the apparent fracture energy measured from the parabola and this line integral for crack tip complexity, namely just the length of the crack tip. And we have four complex crack tips so far, right? Again, Sinua started in September, so she's done actually really well here. And so the error bars here represent The error bars here represent deviation of the parabolic, the measured apparent fracture energy using the parabolic fit through Z, right? And so that apparent fracture energy is more or less directly related to the non-dimensional line integral for crack tip complexity. So the apparent fracture energy increases proportionally with the non-dimensional line integral for crack tip complexity. And these direct 3D measurements of an increased apparent fracture energy are measured. Fracture energy are measured in C2 with this 3D CTOD, right? So now the question is: can we relate this 3D CTOD to fracture energy rigorously? That's an open question, right? So you might imagine that if you have some complex crack tip, that the state of stress ahead of the crack could be oriented in a funny direction, right? If it's no longer plane or symmetric, you can imagine stress tensor eigenvectors that are not oriented in the plane of the sample, right? And so what that would mean is that it's hard to And so, what that would mean is that it's hard to interpret exactly what the CTOD represents in that case. And that's something where we have to do a little bit more analysis. It's furthermore beyond the 2D theory of LEFM. And this gets to Robert's point about how we need a 3D description of fracture mechanics, or fully 3D description of fracture mechanics in that case. And I want to point out that these measurements that we're making here, they're consistent with the recent measurements of Meng, which were very recently published. So, here, what Meng has done is he's plotted the apparent fracture energy in. Plotted the apparent fracture energy in his system as a function of the strain energy density that's driving the crack, where this gamma tilde here is measured by looking a posteriori at the crack surface. So you don't have the NC2 measurement necessarily. And what you need here is to have a characteristic crack feature that emerges when you have these two cracks intersecting one another. And so here we have these fully 3D data that facilitate a direct measure. 3D data that facilitated direct measurement of the crack front length for arbitrary crack tip confirmation and confirmed that if you have a more textured crack in a brittle material, it can effectively toughen the material, right? So I'll conclude with a couple of directions. So one is concerning possible control of cracks, right? So one strategy that we might pursue is manipulating the stress field ahead of the crack, whether with inclusions, as we saw in the dynamic fracture experiment. As we saw in the dynamic fracture experiments that we did, or exciting an unstable stress state with boundary excitation. So you could imagine if you have a crack propagating and you do something funny at the boundary so that it excites a strain or a stress wave that propagates towards the crack tip, you might even get it to a rest simply by exciting a mixed mode loading condition, right? And the overall engineering objective here, which is our longer-term goal, is to maximize the area generated by the advancement of the crack, forcing it to break that planar symmetry in a sustained fashion, right? Because ultimately you want this brittle material to be Ultimately, you want this brittle material to be toughened somehow, right? And so, outstanding questions, which I think are more physically based, are how many facets or textural features and how much complexity can we impose on a brittle crack and how much can it sustain? And can we enhance the surface area so much that the crack will no longer propagate? I've gone over time. I'll leave the acknowledgement slide up and I'm happy to take any questions.
