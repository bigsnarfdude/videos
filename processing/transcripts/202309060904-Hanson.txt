For organizing this really fascinating combination of subjects. I think it'd been great to talk to people in slightly different fields thinking about actually very similar things. So, yes, as Jeff said, I'm going to be talking about outstanding challenges in single-particle crarium for heterogeneity analysis. And I these days like to start out my talks with introducing what the Flatiron Institute is, because not everybody really knows. So, we are a computational science research institute entirely funded by the Simons Foundation. Entirely funded by the Simons Foundation in the heart of Manhattan, not in the Flatiron Building, which is right here, but this is our roof, so we have a nice view of it. And we consist of five different centers, the Center for Computational Biology, Mathematics, Astrophysics, Neuroscience, and Quantum Physics, of which I'm a member of the Biology and Mathematics Centers. And our particular group, Structural Molecular Biophysics, is divided between CCB. Between CCB and CCM Biology and Math, and co-run by myself and Pilar Cosio, whose work I'll talk about a bit at the very end of my talk. We mostly focus on a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and CrowEM methods development, most of which the latter I'll talk about today, but I'll bring in a bit of the molecular dynamics that we do. And so here we're interested in a lot of how we can obtain dynamic. Of how we can obtain dynamic information from both of these methods. And here I've just showed this snapshot of, or this piece of a simulation of the sodium channel here, where you can see the motions that we're looking at. And here you can see a bit of the atomistic detail, which really is what we're interested when we're looking at the volumes that we get from chiralien. So here you can maybe see, and we'll see this a bit better later, these like individual carbon rings and carbon kales that are actually sticking off of these whole proteins, which are really the key to understanding. The key to understanding the biological relevance of these structures that we can get. So, my personal motivation for using both of these methods is actually understanding biological temperature sensing. So, in the engineered world, we have thermometers like here, a mercury thermometer, where we understand kind of the very simple linear physical concepts. So, if you raise temperature, you have increase in volume here of whatever liquids in there. But our biological temperature centers. But our biological temperature sensors don't behave, or at least we don't understand the physical mechanisms that really allow them to have discrete conformational changes as a function of temperature. So this is my larger motivation. And the protein that kind of put me down this path is the TRIP channel, which is a mammalian or eukaryotic ion channel for which David Julius won the Nobel Prize in 2021 for his discovery. New one for his discovery of. And the main one of these is this Keat-sensitive, capsaicin-sensitive, so capsaicin in chili peppers, ion channel TRIP V1. And it looks like this, roughly. It has this tetrameric architecture. And since before we even had structures of them, we knew they look kind of like voltage-gated ion channels, but they don't have kind of these signature positive charges that voltage-gated channels have. Positive charges that voltage-gated channels have. And at first, we thought that maybe this voltage-like architecture was going to give us some clues to their temperature sensing, but it really hasn't. And so, for a long time, we were trying to figure out how these temperature sensors worked without any actual structures of them. But in 2014, with the resolution Revolution in Cray M, actually, the very first structure of any of these types of ion channels became available. Type of ion channels became available to us. And it coincided with this advance in hardware and software in Crier VM, which basically transformed this field into one that people called Bobology, to one where now we can get these atomic level details from prior electron microscopy images. And here is just a nice picture that I like. So from this Nature 2015 paper, this is actually the volume of the first trip V1 structure. Of the first trip V1 structure in this sort of fake graffiti article, the revolution will not be crystallized. But the fact is, is that now, despite having a plethora of these atomistic level, high resolution structures of these proteins, we still actually don't understand their temperature sensing mechanism. Most of us believe that part of that is because of the very nature of temperature sensing, where at high temperatures, it's just basically just. It's just basically just a measure of kinetic energy, so you have one lotion, and this makes it difficult to study with these methods where we're looking at static average structures basically for the post-mobile. And this leads to the fact that a key advantage of cryoelectron microscopy hasn't really been fully exploited at this point. So before the resolution revolution, X-ray crystallography was the main method for getting these high-resolution structures of primitives. But here we needed to always get a crystal structure, which kind of Get a crystal structure, which kind of meant you had to have a very monodisperse rock-solid protein and a single conformation. But now with CryoEM, what happens is we have a thin ice sheet of our protein, and we're actually getting different images of these proteins at different angles and potentially at different conformations, which is now what we're using to get these high-resolution structures. And as I think Alexander had said, getting the average structure actually doesn't. Getting the average structure actually doesn't tell you what you really want to know about the full distribution of these conformations. And so, this is a big part of what I'm talking about today: how we can actually start to get these full distributions and not just average structures from quite electronic cross-metal. And one thing I kind of want to emphasize is that this workflow for getting these structures and these volumes, I'll show some movies, but actually what happens, what we're actually going to see with these movies is not some. Going to see with these movies is not some sort of time-dependent conformational change, but rather we're looking at these static snapshots at equilibrium. So we're looking at the natural conformational variability of these molecules at equilibrium. And so I think one really nice example of how current methods in cryoelectron microscopy aren't really allowing us to get to some of the most interesting aspects of this conformational variability. Is this recently? Conformational variability is this recent paper from Johns Hunt's group at Columbia in the EMBO Journal. And so, here, in this project, they took this enzyme, this tetrameric enzyme, that they, actually most of this paper is about the crystal structure of this enzyme. And they were able to get, with cryoelectron microscopy, this same symmetrical tetramer here in red. But when they put this protein in cryo-M and image it with this method, instead they see a huge amount of. Instead, they see a huge amount of the population as actually these other kinds of conformations here in blue and in yellow. And actually, so from these 700,000 images that they take of these in group particles, only 100,000 of them would be used by many other methods to just get this single high-resolution confirmation. But in fact, these other confirmations are extremely biologically interesting and important. So here we have this open tetramer interface. We have this open tetramer interface. You see, this is actually maybe critical to the actual process of the enzyme catalysis. And in addition, these other asymmetrical tetramer states will also contribute to the biology of this molecule. Just have this one thing here. So you can see that if you look at local resolution, this symmetrical tetramer has very high resolution, which is maybe what we want for some proteins. But to actually understand some very important biological phenomena, these other states, Phenomena, these other states which are of lower resolution, but we actually can still get information from is very important. I think another thing to point out here is that by kind of focusing on these high-resolution structures, you lose here, you know, one seventh, like six-sevenths of the information that you have in these perfectly good images. And so, this is why we really want to understand these methods for analyzing heterogeneity inquiry in the letter. There's a wealth of information that we can use and extract and get. Use and extract and get more information. And so this leads to us with Miro, Polstack, and our group trying to understand and compare these various existing methods to extract continuous heterogeneity from CryoM data sets. And so here we're comparing three different methods, one of which is the 3D VA, and also actually the second method, 3D Flex, which are both implemented in Cryospark, which is a standard. In Quirespark, which is a standard query analysis package. And the first of these is a probabilistic PCA, so it really only picks up linear components of your conformational heterogeneity. The second is much more complicated, a flow generator that outputs 3D deformation field. I'm not going to go too much into detail of how it deflects work, but if you want, you can check out these papers and learn more. Another method that we're using is this method called Granite. Using is this method called CryoDragon, which is a variational autoencoder. It's an image encoder volume decoder, which a lot of people have started to use and was developed by Ellen Zong, who's now at Ensor at Princeton. And then the last one that we're using is this method called manifold embedding, which uses diffusion maps to construct a manifold of the state spaces. This is actually older of these methods from actually before the From actually before the resolution revolution. I'm going to go into a bit of detail here because it's not a machine learning-based method and a method that I myself used more in depth. So if you want to find out more information about these two top machine learning methods, I recommend looking them up. They're very interesting, so I don't have time to cover them in more detail today. But so the manifold embedding method was developed jointly in the group of Abbas, Urmas, in. Group of Abbas Urmaz in Wisconsin and Jakim Frank at Columbia University. And this first PNAS paper came out about the same time as the Resolution Revolution, which means they were working on it even before these high-resolution capabilities of Crimea were obvious. And so they took an existing data set of the APO ribosol and ran it through this method and were able to see these motions of the apol ribosole oscillating between various Oscillating between various states, calling it a Brownian nanomachine. You could even build these pseudo-free energy landscapes and watch how it traverses inside space. And more recently, the same team applied this now to the reandidin receptor protein, which actually the calcium guys talked about a bit earlier, and could see large conformational changes going from the Changes going from the ligand unbound to the ligand bound state, and also in this case, traversing it through the two relevant free energy landscapes. And here in this plot, it's nice to see that with this method, they were able to see that going from the ligand bound and the ligand unbound states, you see this sort of non-trivial conformational change through the 50 volumes that they found with this method, and not just see this linear interpolation. Just see this linear interpolation between the two. So there's really something happening in this method to analyze these images to find these conformational changes between these things. And here's just an example of a movie, the side view of what happens with this reand-didrceptor. You can see these large kind of rings flapping up and down as this conformation change happens. And so, again, just going through this kind of quickly, the manifold embedded. The manifold embedding method actually works on a per-projection direction basis. So all of the images over the orientation sphere are clustered into, well, so we're taking millions of images in these senses and going to about 300 projection directions. And then each of these projection directions are analyzed with first calculating Euclidean distance, then diffusion mapping, and then this NLSA. And then we have to go through and combine. Through and combine back all these individual projection directions together, which is kind of a non-trivial aspect of this algorithm. But a more recent tool from Subraj and Maji, also in the Army and Frank's group, developed this belief propagation method, which uses optical flow methods to kind of connect up all of these curve projection-direction analyses. And in this case, he showed it for the reanodin receptor data. Showed it for the reanodin receptor data, where it's a bit easier to see kind of these flapping motions of molecule, as I showed, and get these directions of motion from just analyzing these 2D images and then use those to kind of make sure that the directions of motion in each of your analyses kind of connect up together in a reasonable way. But this is kind of just repeating what the human is doing by doing this per-projection direction analysis. So actually, the two Direction analysis. So, actually, the two examples of the ribosome and the reanodin receptor analysis, I showed it's actually a person who actually went through all these 300 projection directions and made sure they aligned all of the senses of those analysis. And here, this is just an automated way to do what the person was doing. There's probably better ways to do this over the full 3D space. But this is what's currently being used in this method. And so, back to our trip channel data set. Our trip channel data set. So I was able to analyze this data set. The original, actually, April Trip V1 data set from 2014 or 2013 when I was in January Frank's group. We were able to see some 2D movies and build a kind of pseudo-free energy landscape of what kind of conformational changes are going on with this. But actually, this was only 80,000 images. 80,000 images that I was working on in Swiss. I wasn't able to build in full volumes and really understand what these conformational changes were. And then, so I wanted to try more recent, and actually I'll say that the Aquarium community is great in that there's a lot of publicly available data sets through this Empire database. So, this initial one is in this data set, and a second, more recent one is in a later data set. And so, But the newer data set that had more images actually had, in order to stabilize the membrane part of this protein, a lipid nanodisc around it, which actually ended up being what we picked up in these methods instead of the protein conformational heterogeneity, which is what we were really interested in. Yeah, sure. In the previous image, we also have the. This is the pilar arrow? So, yeah, so this is. So, yeah, so this is. So, in this first one, the data is collected in just a MyS cell, like a simple lipid that's used to solubilize the membrane protein. In this second one, so structural membrane protein structural biologists use a more fancy thing called a nanodisc now, which actually make this a protein, which is actually encapsulating more native lipids around the membrane portion of the protein, which is great because it allows them to. Protein, which is great because it allows them to get better high-resolution structures, but it also means that it comes out more clearly in these images for us and ends up masking a lot of the heterogeneity that we're interested in here. So it's kind of just a technicality, but it ends up being quite the point. And so while this method had been developed in 2014, the tools I had used were actually MATLAB tools. MATLAB tools. We're now, there is a Python GUI available at this GitHub repository, but it's a little unstable, so we're now making it more stable in a flat iron hosted version of the code. If you guys have any interest in helping us debug this code, we're more than interested in adding it as a collaborator. It's currently private, but hopefully will be public and ready to use by the end of the year. And so, yeah, so okay, back to kind of Murals project, which is To kind of Miro's project, which is comparing now all these different methods. So we kind of decided to go back to this because of this 3D flex result, which is in this paper by Pujani and Fleet, where they see this very interesting kind of squeezing of the, and now these are the cytozoic nominations, they're not inside the transmembrane region, and this kind of asymmetric wobbling of these regions that I hadn't seen in my analysis, maybe saw some evidence of. Maybe saw some evidence of, but this was really interesting to us, and this was actually exactly one of the data sets we had previously been analyzing. And so thus Miro went back to this data set and now is comparing these methods I talked about before, also now applying a mask around the nanodisc to mask out the information in this portion that we're all interested in. I will also mention that this data set here actually is a ligand-bound data set. So we also have this toxin-bound. Said. So we also have this toxin bound on top of this protein, which is good for getting high-resolution structures. But I'll talk a bit more about how that actually complicates things for us. It binds it into a single conformation, although I'll talk more about that a bit. And so Miro was able to, so, and then the various things we're looking at here now are these squishing of the cytozoic domains, which I should just show. Of the cytosolic domains, which I just showed you. Any twisting of the transmembrane regions, we can possibly see that it coordinates with that. Any pore rearrangements, so like opening and closing of the transmembrane pore, and also this toxin binding, unbinding here, this little pink block here. And so we were initially able to fairly well recapitulate these 3D flex results in Cryospark and see the same kind of wobbling of the cytosolic region. Although I will say that we were lucky to be at the Flatiron Institute where we. We're lucky to be at the Flatiron Institute where we have a lot of computational resources because it took a lot to even get this result again from 3D Flex. Lots of different parameter optimizations and it's a fairly heavy duty machine learning method. And so and additionally from the simpler three D V A method we're able to similarly see these kind of s cytozolic changes of this region here. Of this region. And even in manifold embedding, we saw something similar, though I will say we're still seeing signal from the nanodisc despite lots of different masking, which remains somewhat annoying and something we're still trying to find better ways around. And so here you can see that you kind of see some motion here of these kind of cytosolic regions of this drip channel. And similarly, you can actually see the opening and closing of this. Actually, see the opening and closing of this pore if you look carefully enough from these top view projection directions, which is interesting. Though you still see the nanodisc signal behind it. And then additionally, so we're actually very excited about using this cryo dragon method for this particular data set. But we ended up mostly just seeing the toxin binding and unbinding. You can see these volumes appear and disappear here, which was a bit disconcerting. Which was a bit disconcerting. We don't really see the other motions that we saw from the other methods. Although we are as looking into this more now as the CrowdRaggen folks are. Like, you sure you don't see it? Make sure you analyze it in this way. So we're kind of doing your due diligence there. But this has really showed us that there are different things that these different methods show us about these conformational heterogeneous data sets. And actually, I will say that. And actually, I will say that we were not really expecting this protein to have conformational heterogeneity in the beginning because this toxin should be stabilizing it into a single conformation. But what we actually think is happening here is that we do see some toxin unbound conformation that was not picked up in the original analysis of all this grid. And then, one, yeah, so lots of interesting things going on, especially in terms of like getting the different. Especially in terms of getting the different small conformational changes, which is what we're really interested in for many proteins. And especially, you can kind of see we're not necessarily able to get the side chain information of all of these different carbon rings, carbon chains that is what we're really interested in, to get this high-resolution information of this conformational dynamics of these. And so we still are left with this question of are these motions real? How much are maybe these machine learning? How much are maybe these machine learning methods hallucinating these things? How can we verify and validate what's happening? And so now we come back to what was actually Bureau's original project, which is running molecular dynamic simulations of these trip channels to try and understand their temperature sets properly. So here he can even see the open state channel ions passing through. He had to put in considerable effort to making sure different low resolution parts of the channel were well resolved. Channel will well resolve. And so now, with sort of Murrow's molecular dynamic simulations and other structures we have of this protein, we can go and take advantage of Pilar Coastal's work, which is doing Bayesian inference for comparing single-particle Cryo-M with atomic models. And so here what we can do is we can take these models, either get from whatever methods, some CryoM, X-ray crystallography, alpha fold, molecular dynamics, whatever you want. Dynamics, whatever you want, and you can generate fake query M data basically, applying noise and the point spread function and different imaging features that we know are going to be there, and then compare sort of our calculated image and the actual observed Cryo-M image and what is the probability that our model would be found in this actual Cryo-M image, which you can see actually these real images are incredibly noisy. And so, using this Bayesian inference method, we Bayesian inference method, we actually were able to see that we also do see some of this closed ABO toxic unbound state in these images with a non-zero probability, which was interesting. And so actually what we want to do is not just look for a single structure, but look for maybe a whole free energy landscape that we can get from molecular dynamics and see how all of those conformations are represented in our criteria. Are represented in our Craywee M images. And so here we can take all of neural simulations and use this new extension of this method, ensemble reading, using CrayOEM methods that Wei Chen Tang is the first software output of this technique. And just to go over that, what this method can do in a single slide, basically what we do here, and here this was done for a very small molecule, we take an initial free energy. We take an initial free energy landscape from like the dynamic simulation, and here we have a folded state down here, a misfolded state, and then a huge kind of cluster of completely unfolded states. And so this is our molecular dynamic simulation. But then we've also made a set of fake Crow Young data that has a different landscape. And so here we don't see any of this misfolded state. We see some differences here so that this population is downloaded. This population is downloaded. And what we can actually do is use this method to re-weight our MD simulations according to our images, and we see that now we see these down weighting of the states shifting. And so in this way, we can actually kind of oversample our protein landscape and see what is actually going to be in our images. And so this is a really fun tool, I think, that we're really excited to use in more realistic ways. We're really excited to use in more realistic systems like Neurosystem with this trip channel data set. And so we've definitely found that these different methods for analyzing heterogeneity give us slightly different results in this particular case. But this particular data set is not necessarily the most ideal one to look at this with. We have this problem with the nanodisc. We have kind of this toxin that keeps binding and unbinding. Ideally, we want a protein that we just have the constant. The conformational heterogeneity and not these other things that we need to worry about. And so, in addition to this, we also need to develop better methods to generally compare these methods to each other, and not just on simulated data, but on real experimental data sets. And so, one interesting thing is also that these many of these machine learning methods, of course, as has been nice. As has been nicely laid out here in this review, actually will be looking at solely simulated data sets, but they're using different ways of capturing all the different things the simulator needs to take into account. And I think we still haven't really been able to bridge this simultupial gap in IEM where we can really train on data sets where we know the ground truth landscapes. We know that these methods are giving us. That these methods are giving us what's really there. And part of really trying to figure that out is solving these problems in simulated data sets. And then we'll be able to really do a better job on experimental data sets. It's kind of a balance kind of going back and forth between real and simulated data sets, I think, is what we'll need to do in the future. And so, in this vein, we believe we found a molecule that's better than trip channels. To do this on with the help of the New York Structural Biology Center, I'm not showing the molecule. Biology Center. I'm not showing the molecule here, but feel free to go to the site and download the data set. And we have two data sets. We have provided image stacks from CrayReam, and we're asking participants in this challenge to give us back 80 volumes and a 1D distribution to see how people compare in giving us this confirmational heterogeneity from these images. And so the results upload portal is open. Results upload portal is open now and closes for Halloween if anyone wants to participate. And no winner will be declared because probably the real challenge is ours and how to compare AD volumes and distributions along those AD volumes to each other to actually figure out how to compare these methods in the first place. So, thank you very much for your attention, and of course to the organizers and all the people who really did the work, and of course the Simons Foundation for the funding. Assignments Foundation for fun. So just so I understood it correctly, you're not saying that a machine learning will actually get into the time scale. You're getting confirmations? Yeah. Then you are going to go with MD? Yeah, so we're not even really trying to get the time scale. So MD, we're basically The time scale. So MD, we're basically using to sample the conformational space in the first part. There are, like, we are also working on methods to bias molecular dynamics by priority M data. And there we may have more of access to time scales. You could do something like one of those state of the world and get those states and then find the kinetics. Yeah. Yeah, so that's definitely something we're thinking about, but not really what we're doing here. And at what temperature are these things for? So they are activated at 42 degrees Celsius. They open at At 42 degrees Celsius, they open at 42 degrees Celsius. That's not really the high-temperature sensing yet, or is that what you will call the high-temperature? Yeah, that's I guess there is one above the 42 degrees, but that's what's considered noxious heat. There was a slide with, I think, another disk that was moving, right? Moving, right? So and then you said you are doing some masking, right? To so how how do you deal with that? Like how do you mask something that's effectively move? Yeah, so so this is another thing we've actually been talking with Ellen about, like potentially masking, doing like conformational heterogeneity for the masked portion. Because you know, potentially you are also removing signal that you care about when you're making a static mask. Making a static mask. But in this case, you can do, like, I think both Lion and Cryospark have signal subtraction protocols that subtracts the signal and then adds noise back in. But it's very finicky, but it's something that is fairly standard protocol inquiry on. But it's like non-trivial, but like people have to learn to do it for lots of projects. Is the campusine one protein or example? So, a single protein, but obviously there's more than one that beasts expressed in the neuron. And so, this is something that, so for other temperature sensors, I'm thinking about, I'm trying to do these calculations of how many of these do we really need to get these very sharp signals as, right? So, but actually it is a signal single protein. So, one of the most interesting studies is So one of the most interesting studies is they take these proteins and put them in liposomes, and you can see that the current increases very sharply as opposed to the temperature, even in liposome, which tells us that it's the protein, and also you can change out the membrane composition, and it has the same property. So it's really the protein that has this temperature sensing property. Sorry, one of the questions. So is this called the novel reconstruction of a new structural value? Of a new structural body or a new RA can have a PDM structure. So, generally, what we have is we have data sets that have already been used to get a high-resolution structure, and then we actually use the angles that are obtained by solving that high-resolution structure, and then look at the conformational heterogeneity from that. So, we do have generally a starting volume. Volume. Although, so cryo-dragon, there's now ab initial cryo-dragon which can do everything without the angles from the beginning. Just give it the images because the general parliament will be to first dissect cast on which you think has doubled heavily bias. So there's inherent 2D, 3D generations. Yes. Yeah, and I think there's lots of interesting questions, especially when you go to more heterogeneity, where the angle really needs to be optimized at the same time as the combinations. Yeah, and I think there's some situations where the experimentalists know there's a protein there, you know it's pretty well behaved, but they can't even get the first. But they can't even get the first estimates of the angles. And so I think that's really where making these methods better will help us to get structured some of these proteins at all. Short question. Do people use alpha fold for the starting volume? Or is that a you can generally you don't need to, but you it kind of depends. It kind of depends on the protein, I think, because some algal models are very bad. Okay, let's thank our speaker.
