So I study step back to parent algebras and I first want to say what a step back to parent algebra is by giving the most popular example of a step-factor parent algebra, which is temporally leap. And so planar algebras, such as temporary leap, they contain algebras. So temporary leap contains the temporary leap algebras or TLK for integers greater than zero. And elements of these algebras are linear combinations of diagrams. Linear combinations of diagrams that look like this: those k points on the bottom, k points on the top, and non-intersecting strands connecting those k points and a distinct star. Our multiplication in our algebra is by stacking. So if I want to multiply this element by this element, I do so by stacking this one on the left on top of the one on the right. And then I squish it back into a square. And now I have this circle. And what I'm going to tell you to do in this technically cleaner algebra is to pop this bubble for five. is to pop this level for a factor of 2. So in this planar algebra, I have this relation that servo equals 2. And that's because I'm interested in index 4. So a factor of planar algebras, which will be the square of whatever the volume is. So we also have planar tangles, which are maps between these algebras. So for example, we have the multiplication planar tangible, which takes in something from Which takes in something from temporary duk, and another thing from temporary new k, which you would put into these boxes. And then once you put those diagrams in the boxes, you'll have something with k points at the bottom, k points at the top. So they'll give you something at temporary k. And then you'll have, we also have the tensor, which is placing two things side by side. And then we have the trace, which is closing everything off to the right. So it's something we talk about in zero. So, the simplerly planar algebra is the collection of the algebras along with a rule that associates a linear map to each planar tangle that satisfies certain natural criteria, like composing the planar tangles should work the same way as composing the linear maps. And it's a good thing I went over tempoid lead because not only is it the most popular example of the planar algebra, but it's really the building block for the rest of them because any subfactor algebra of index four or greater contains a copy of the tempo lead. And again, I'm interested. Templar leave. But again, I'm interested in the next four. So template leave is a special type of planar algebra called a subfactor planar algebra, and there's a lot of criteria for that, but one of them is that the zero box space must be one-dimensional. This is a great property because then any closed diagram evaluates. Any closed diagram attempt we leave is just going to be a collection of circles. So you can pop all of these circles, popping each circle for a factor of two, and eventually you'll get some scale. Of two, and eventually you'll get some scalar current CMT diagram. And once you have that, then you can put this inner product on each of these algebras. So the inner product is defined, if I want to take the inner product of these two, I take the adjoint of this diagram, which is the complex conjugate of the scalar, and then flipping along like an x-axis flip a diagram. I multiply them together, and then I take the trace of that, so I close everything to the right. And now this is a closed diagram, so it's going to be a This is a closed diagram, so it's going to be a number. And we have special elements in our planar algebra, so we have these projections, which are elements of squared themselves in our solvable joint. And we can create a tensor category for the projections with this special solvable object, which is just going to be our strand. And it tensor generates the category. Temporally leave is somewhat simple, and these Jones-Wenzel projections are minimal projections. And so if And so, in particular, every projection is a direct summer piece of John's Wenzel projections. So, principal graphs characterize the factor-panel algebra is using minimal projections. And in temporally leap, we have Wenzel's relation, which says if you take the k of Jones-Wenzel and you tend to write by a strand, that'll be the k plus first, Jones-Wenzel directs at the k minus first. So then you can put this information into a principal graph. So, for example, Jones-Wenzel II, a tensor, a strand, will be isomorphic. A tensor, a strand will be isomorphic to Jones Wenzel 3, Directs some Jones Wenzel 1, and those will be exactly the neighbors of Jones-Wenzel 2 and the Tensil R. So then my specific research goal is to try to come up with the planar algebra, the subfracture planar algebra of index 4, who when you find the minimal projection and the principal graph, you'll get this affine A2n-1 diagram. So what must happen? So, what must happen, if we just started this vertex here for the empty diagram, we can first think about empty diagram, tensor, as strand. Well, tensors just place things side by side, so that's just a strand. But on the other hand, it should be the direct sum of the neighbors of empty, which is P1 and Q1, like so. And then you can also find that P1 and Q1 are either going to be dual to each other or they're going to be dual to themselves. So, if they're dual to each other, dual is diagnosed. Dual is diagnosed rotating 180 degrees. So if they're dual to each other, I'm going to denote P1 by an up arrow and Q1 by a down arrow. And if they're dual to themselves, then I'm going to denote that as a red for P1 and a blue by Q2. Q1. And then you can go and get the rest of the vertices. So, like this vertex will be two up arrows, this one's two down arrows, and you can keep going until you get to this end vertex here, where you have up arrows, and from this direction. Arrows and from this direction and down arrows from this direction, so they must be isomorphic. So there must be two morphisms: one from n up arrows to n down arrows, and the other one from n down arrows to n up arrows. Then multiply in one way to be n down arrows, and multiplying the other way to be n up arrows. And it's known that these like morphisms have some click relation that's an invariant within your algebra. And so this morphism is still, this click is still. Them is still, this click is still from end up arrows to end down arrows, so it must be some scalar multiple of U. And there's a 2n strands around here, so this is going to be some 2n. So then that brings me to the theorem. So if we let omega be a 2nth root of unity, and then we let our planar algebra be the one where the pictures are made up of up arrows, down arrows, these u boxes, and these u start boxes, and we have these follow-ups. Boxes and we have these following relations. So, circle better equal to because I'm at the index four. I know that I can decompose a strand as that close down. Oppositely oriented vertical strands equals oppositely oriented horizontal strands. Multiplying oppositely oriented things equals zero. We have this click relation. We know how you start when you multiply. Then, if you find the minimal projections and find the principal graph, then it'll be the affine A2N minus 1 Dinkum diagram. Dinkum diagram. And remember, that wasn't the only way we could decompose a strand. We could have done it as a red plus blue. And we get a very similar presentation. V is a morphism from red, blue, red to blue, red, blue, alternating on the top and bottom. And V star is alternating from blue, red, blue to red, blue, red. And most of these relations look pretty, well, they all look pretty similar. The one that's maybe a little bit different is, first of all, to house just an end through. First of all, it's house just an nth root infinity now. And now, when I click a string around V, it now has this red on the top instead of a blue. So the click changes a V into a V star. And then again, you can find the minimal projections, which will be alternating red and blue strands, and it'll be the affine A2 minus V diagram. And so I've also found presentations for affine A infinity. Presentation is for affine A infinity, affine C infinity, affine B7. And it's known that these are all the graphs that could happen, and all of these are exactly have some planar algebra related to them. So for the rest, for my next year, my final year in grad school, I want to find the presentations for the remaining cases at 9 DN, F9 D6, and FYE8. Okay, thank you very much. So there are
