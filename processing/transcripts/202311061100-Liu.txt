So, Sabrina just introduced the local aspect theory for overarching meaning local fields. So, in my talk, we focus on non-communicate local fields. All right. So, first, let's introduce a notation here. So, F is a non-communicate local field, K to zero. So, the groups will focus on these quasi-blade classic groups. So, G N hat, that's the Langand 2 group. LG is the Langand L group. So, to parametrize the local component of automorphic representations in the display spectrum, so also introduce the localized package, which are finite multi-set of your inter representations. So, these are localized parameters. So, Pasi is a So, Pasai is a homomorphism from the we group. There are two copies of SO2 here. The first copy is called the Delin Sl2, the second copy is called the R SO2. So phi I here bounded and XI, this exponent less than half, and this S M I, S N I, you reduce the prendition of SL2C. And then this precise study fight is dimension formula. Precise satisfied dimension formula because the image lies in the do group. So, precisely generic if all ni are one is temporary for all ni1 and all xi1. xi are 0. Okay, that'll be temporary. So, for the for the, I mean, if xi, I mean, in general, we call this plus g n, this set. So, uh, if x i are all zero, then we call the local parameter that's using capital Possi Gn. That's using capital Psi g and the plus means that there was some extra. Okay, all right. So these are local other parameters. So given uh local other parameters, so there are some several ways to attach local L parameters. So one way is this phi pass I. So this is the way Dealing group. And this X on the second R2 does evaluate at this point. Okay. So also showed that this map from site This map from side fab side injective. And another way is through this diagonal embedding of SL2 XX. Okay. So on the construction logo package, Arthur originally defined this local package. Here is for the easy for the precise, not the plus, okay, using the characterizing relation. And he can extend to the plus parameter. Uh, a plus parameter using the power deduction, right? So, and this look at packet are finite multi-set of unit representations. And he proved that the L packet corresponding to fab psi is included in this local packet. So, um, so this uh also defined this, uh, but this is not explicitly. So, McGlan constructed local packet explicitly and shows that it indeed it is. And shows that indeed it is market-free. And then McGlenn, Shui's work, show that the corresponding author packet constructed indeed satisfy authors' character adding relation. Later, Shui gave the nomination criterion, LDN in certain cases, and also cardinality of other packets. So, sorry. Yeah. So, recently, Atobe gave a reformulation model construction for Morgan construction for these two sets of groups using the new derivatives introduced by himself and Wingus. So, this will make it relatively easier to compute L data. So, there are several problems we want to consider for local packet. The problem one is the reference set of representation in local packets. So, we know that the Shahidi conjecture says for any quasi-space data. For any participative data group, tempered L packet, tempered local packet have generic members. So the enhanced version is, so if you have a parameter in the plus or not, so the lookout species are generic, respectively tempered if and only they have a generic number. Okay, so later, the John. Later, Zhang extends Shahidi's conjecture, general Shahidi conjecture to a non-temporal local package, okay, or non-generic local package. So using the Wiefron sets. So these are invariants to measure, roughly speaking, the size of representations. Okay, this will be the first set of problem we're going to consider today. The second problem is related to the inception locus packets. Okay, so unlike the local Okay, so unlike the local L packets, the local asset packets could have non-trivial intersections. So the nature question is: so, given two local asset packets, when are they intersect or not? Do they intersect or not? So of course, one can ask this question, one can answer this question using McGlan construction. But the point is how to answer this question systematically. So McGlan showed that, so if the two artifacts are in So, if the two art packets intersect, then so they are this diagonal, this plus a one diagonal equal to plus a two diagonal, but these are not sufficient. Okay, so the point is how to find a systematic way to determine the intersection. So, namely, so given the local other parameter, how to systematically determine the set. So, the other local parameter such that intersect with this one, the package. Okay. So, it will be this will be the second set of problem one consider. This will be the second set of problems we're going to consider today. Sorry. Yeah. Okay. This is the third problem I want to consider today, namely patching up local packets. So also show that there is L packet inside other packet, right? So what about repetitions in the complement? Okay, more precisely, so which local L packet would have non-trivial intersection with a given local. Have not to intersection with a given local packet. So, these kind of problems, okay? So, of course, one really question is how to determine your prediction is in any local packet or not using this L data. This is some kind of algorithm. So, let's start from the first problem and introduce some notation away from that. So, by horizontal whole category expansion, so pi given pi equals. So, pi given pi u gives admittable partition, so and also a neighborhood of one, then for any function supported on u so it has this cat expansion, okay. So, here is the summation over all newpoint orbits and c o pi just some number and mu o f that's the um that's you definitely using this um integral, okay, open integral, and uh so f kilta is. So f tilde is f composed with exponent map, exponential map. So f tilde had as a free transform. So given pi, so if you consider all the orbits such that the c o pi non-zero, you put it at a set n pi. So this set is very hard to study. So easy equation is the maximal one inside. Okay, the max n pi and n pi that's. Max n pi and m pi, that's max morbids. So, this is usually called the wefron set of pi. So, because we have a functional classic group, so new pen orbits are parametrized by partitions plus some macro deforms. So, I mean, one can just consider the partitions to make things easier. So, p pi and correspondingly, the p m pi, the maximum partitions, and the dominance order. So, sometimes we call this we from partitions. Call this we from partitions for simplicity. All right, so uh let's recall the local other parameters. So for each local other parameters, one can naturally attach a packet, a partition. So if you let AI be key item MI, namely the side of this with the limb part, and BI is the side of this RSO2 part. Okay, if you restrict this to the RSO2, you roughly speak, you'll get the new penalties corresponding to this position. So B1 to the A. Into this partition, so b1 to the a1 to the ar, okay, and p is plus psi is a partition on two sides. So the John's conjecture says, So you have a look at the parameter, you have the packet, then the following hoods. There's three parts. The first one saying that for any partition which is not related to this DBVP, we are not supporting any representation in this packet. Any representation in this packet. This is DBV denotes the bubble organology from the partition of the group group to the partition of the group itself. Okay, so another related partition will not support the pandemic inside. And the second one is that the bigger partition will not support anyone inside. So this DBD people said give us an upper bound for we from side of representing the other package. The part three is saying that this upper bound. The part three saying that this upper bound indeed is non-trivial, namely, so there is at least one member would achieve this upper bound. Okay, so for example, for SP2 and ACDB, my boundary partition depends this way. They transpose, then you cut the smallest part by one, decrease the smallest part by one, then take the SP collapse. Okay. So, part one, part two imply that so any Implies that so any maximal partition of representing inside has to be smaller than equal that is upper bound. That's indeed upper bound. Okay, so we write this way because for technical reason and so we somehow we can only show part two. Okay, all right. So for each local other parameter, so naturally, so one can catch a recondition of the GL, the corresponding GAO and this pipe side. So joined with So, joined with Shahidi, we showed that for this pipe psi, the referral side partition is just a transported peak of psi. And then next, let's introduce some notation from this three stereoscopic. So, theta G, this transport inverse, and J tilde is this map, this matrix. Theta tilde is this composition. And then this is the disconnected. This is the disconnected group, okay? And this is the non-connected part, non-identity part, G2 the n. Okay, so other define a nature extension of pi plus 2 total to this pipe also, g2 the n. Okay, so by closer expansion of these kinetic groups, one can define similarly to all these sets for this type of set tutor. So By taking the category expansion, we take the cat expansion of this representation at these points, particularly. All right. So, all right. So, we have this map, there are conjectures. The first conjecture is in that for this partosal representation, the wave from partition has to be had to have. Has to be had to have this smaller than equal than this candidate. And the stronger version that exactly consists of the weef and partition, these partitions. For our purpose, we just need the weak one, but we expect the subject number one holds. So here, this is our result. This joint with Shahidi. So we assume the weak conjecture holds. Okay. And the Posai here is. Okay, and the plus I here is not the plus parameters, okay? So we believe it can be the reduction can be extended to the plus version. So the following holds. So just the conjecture part two valid. Namely, the bigger partition will not support repetitions. Part two is saying that the enhanced traiting conjecture is true. Okay? So namely, so it had a genetic member if and only if it's temperate packet. Part three is about the uh about the non-true. About the non-trivial achievements of the upper bound part. So, if you define P1 and this number, then John conjectured part three holds for the following cases. So, they have some equality condition, yanda for part three holds. Okay, in particular, these are density holds when BI of the same parity. The idea of the proof, so for the cheapness part, we construct the repetitive sigma following the work of John Surgery and myself and with John with Jason. And we construct sigma, we show that the root from partition of sigma achieved upper bound. Okay, and this is using the this is using the work of Gomez Grabi Sahi and also joined the work with John Seven. Also, John work is John 7. And we also use the character identity of answer, the matching method of Shahidi in his 1990 paper. So, and also we need the certain dimensional identity for new point orbits of different groups because you want to do the matching. And so, recently, Wazabaji computed the wavefront set of tempered and anti-tempered unit representations of SOR, okay, for Okay, for um, and the four conducted reductive period groups in the display recently, Alcada, Silvertaro, uh, Matt Brown, and Alcada. So, they have a sequence of papers computed the Wiefron set of irreducible unipotential potential with real even as well characters. Okay, so they all these results prove special case of jump conjecture. So, um, so recently joined with uh So recently, joined with Law and Shahidi, Law is our student. So we characterize the fibers of paportial cardiolity using partitions for CARTIC groups. And as an application of this characteristic of fiber, so we joined with law. So we proved the so-called weak local aspect conjecture of supernatural massive brain narcada. The conjecture is for general split classes, for split groups, but we can we prove them for Groups, but we can we prove them for split classic groups. So, independently recently, so this also proved by Alcada and Grebich. So, this will see this tomorrow on Alcada's talk. So, roughly speaking, the local speculation detector says, so define this set. So, you have possi, and you have the infinite character of poss. And if you consider all pi with this infinite character, and the Character and the width from set partition is smaller than this upper bound. Okay, then this will be a union of local packets. That's a conjecture. So in particular, this implies the unitarity of these representations. By the way, is uniparted representation. So one comment is that we call us the conjecture is closely related to the chance conjecture. Is close related to the junk conjecture for the cost packet because this is the upper bar. Okay, so roughly speaking, you just unit all the packet. I mean, the representation is smaller than this upper bar. That's why we need the fiber. Okay, the second problem I want to consider is the insection local package. The first, let's see this example. Just want to show the Just want to show the complication of the instruction local package. So let's the row be a trivial representation of GL1, and we consider this as parameters for SP10. Okay. So you can see the, I mean, all these intersection. So you see, these, this rectangular, that means L packet. Okay, so you can see that pi one, pi eight, pi nine, pi ten, they are in one L packet. 10 they are in one l packet, but uh just pipe one other time. Pi 8, pi 9, pi 10 are not. And pi 1, pi 4, pi 11, you see they are in for one packet, but pi four just other pi 11, not okay. And also this same color, meaning that so this pi three, for example, this is in the phi uh size one L package, okay. Similarly here, pi seven in the five plus size three, okay, but pi six here is But pi 6 here is not in this L packet of pi 3, but the full packet of here. Okay. And you see pi 1, pi 2, they lie in the three alpha packet. Okay, so we'll come back to this example and give show what's the meaning of this, representing the same color, all right? But you can see this is just implied a complication. All right, so one motivation of this insection problem is this non-tempered GDP. This non-tempered GDP conjecture. So, for example, if we take this GDP pair, so say plus one and plus two are relevant local parameters, and then gross process conjecture that, so if you consider the L packet corresponding to plus one and plus I two, they exist unique pair, such as this dimension non-zero. All right, however, if you move on to the Volga answer package, A package than the unique dispriner holds. So, in their paper, they provide examples. And this feeling of uniqueness is just exactly due to the non-trivial intersection of cospects. So, this is as a motivation. All right, so let's recall McLean construction. So, McLean reduced the general case to the good pirate case, just as in the winner's. Just as in the winner's talk, right? To reduce the comparative case. To recall, by the way, here should be general, like a row times some exponent. All right. So Poseidon is good parity if every summon is self-due and of the same type as Poseidon. Okay. So McGlan showed this theorem. Okay. Given any local. Okay, given any local ass packet, you have this decomposition. So, Pasai 1 and the Pasai 1 check. So, this kind of easy do to each other. And Pasai 0 is good parity. Yeah. So, and Posa 1, you can call it better parity. So, and then given repetition in the local expected corresponding to Pasa 0, if you do the induction, so Pasa 1 naturally gives you a repetition of GL. If you do this power of induction, so it's irreducible. Induction, so it's irreducible. And independent of choice, I and this induction will give you the whole packet for pipe size. So that, so hence, the construction of the general low-cost package reduces good parity case. So for good parity packets, so ASAR has sorry, Atubi had this reformulation recently. So that needs this data called extreme multi-segment. Called extend multi segment. So it contains this data. So AIBI row, this is a segment, and LI is some number. Ai is a plus minus one. So what's important here is for every data, you can assign a local as a parameter, so possi E here. So rho is just this rho, and little AI is capital AI plus capital BI plus. is capital AI plus capital BI plus one. And little BI is capital AI minus capital BI plus one. Okay, that's important. That's the most important thing here. So, and for every data E, so the psi E is a local other parameter of good parity. So, example, so say you have, so every data you can assign some pictograph. So, for example, this case, so um, So AI A2 are one. That's the easy rightmost column. And B1 is negative one, and B2 is two. Okay. And this triangle just so L, L is the number of triangle in each row. Okay. The pair of triangle, I should say. So eta, eta is the first sign of this circle in each row. Okay, so you see, this starts from negative one, then plus they alternate. And here, you see no circle, it is assigned to be one. There are no circles, it is assigned to be one, all right, and uh and then the capital psi e here is yeah, it is this as a parameter, so AIBI can put this way, okay? Just to get the example. Um, and then to be uh for each data extendment segment, he assigned a representation which is either irreducible or zero, and he also reformulated the Shui's Namanishinker theory. Okay, so this is the theorem. Okay, so this is the CRMR to be for these two sets of groups. Possibly is a good priority. Then this packet consists of this pi E for all the data related to Posai, namely, so Posai E is Possi. Okay. And so all non-vanishing representation consists of this packet of pipe side. Okay. So this is our result. The our result. So, this result is an independent work of Adobe. So, we have different set of algorithms. And also, this is joined with joint work with Haiserten and Low. They are our student co-workers with Shakiri. So, first, for these two side representations, they exist algorithms to determine whether the given representation is located. Uh, whether the given representation is a local packet or not, based on its L data. Okay, and excuse me, for every representation in this packet, there exists algorithm to determine all the local other packets containing this pi. Okay. So I just want to emphasize a bit on the features of our method. So we use the so-called unique canonic form. A unique canonic form, namely, so among all the E, all the data give you the same pi. So this form, this data carries the most derivative information on pi, roughly speaking. And they exist a complete set of operators on data, each of them preserved representations and can be used to exhaust this set. Okay. Hence, you exhaust all the all the packets contain one representation. So here. So, here I would like to thank Atobe for sharing with us his previous, I mean, so the early version of his code. So, by the way, Atobe's code for his algorithms, I've been online at GitHub. So, our algorithms, the code will be online within a couple of weeks. So the next, let me introduce these operators. So the row exchange. So in the example, you see a server rows. So this rule exchange. So should you show that row exchange preserve representations? And this is union intersection. So you see, you have two segments, and you can do this union and intersection, and also this case. So to be sure that the union intersection. So, Atobe showed that a union intersection predicted reputations. And then this do. So, this is the theorem. Autobiog shows that. So, if E gave the data for pi, then there exists another extendment segment called do E, which gave the do of pi, okay? Which is this overdue of pi. Okay, so and this pi e um yeah. Yeah. And then you can this do run on X on E on the data. So correspondingly on the other parameter, just switch AI and B as expected. Okay. And then you consider this operator, do UI do. Okay, because do preserve the, it's consented to do and UI pre-do representation. So you can see that this do UI do, you will come back to the original representation. So hence this operator pre-do representation. This operator trader representation, so this is another operator we use, okay. So, uh, operator on E, so we this is uh the partial do, okay. The partial do is roughly speaking in the half-inter case, okay. We need the partial do only so in that case, the error extend UI intersection and do UI do be enough, but the half-inter case, uh, we need this additional partial do. Push do so, roughly speaking, send. So, if you have this segment, you send a half to the negative half, and on the parameter side, it's just the exchange this kind of pieces. All right, so joined with hesitant law, we show that these operators are like the rule exchange unit stack change. I like the root exchange union section do you this uh do you are do and this partial do also prepared so um this pi e if pi e not uh pi e and pi e prime are equivalent if and only if e and e prime are related by computation of fact of these operators and part three saying that so there is a precise formula to compute this set so formula to compute this set. So all the data like give you the same reputation pi E. So hence, so you can have the formula to compute all the parameters contain the same repetition. So these are applications of our result. So this is joined with Hazelton law. So for any local outer parameter pi, Local author parameter psi, so we have a formula to count the precise number of tempered each local author packet. So, because easy a tempered positions could uh tempered apicet could intersect with the non-tempered ones. And so for the non-tempered, explained for the non-tempered localized packet, so the number of tempered between us. So, this will give a precise formula for that. We can describe the L data. The second application is so. The second application is so we prove the enhanced circuit conjecture for these two side groups. Okay. And the third one is we determine all the data such that the corresponding representation is in the L packet associated to this Pasai E. So the part four saying that so for every for every repetition is also type. conditions is also type. So for example, it doesn't lie in several local packets. So one nature question is which local packet is you can call the parameter Z local other parameter for pi. Okay, so we give a definition of this Z local other parameter for pi. I satisfy these properties. So first, so pi is in the L packet corresponding to sorry, I mean the second one. Sorry, I mean the second one. The first one just in that, so the pi lies in the packet. The second one saying that so pi actually lies in L packet corresponding to factor pi. And this is z look as a parameter roughly corresponding to you take a sequence all possible UI inverse and possible partial do inverse. Okay. And this is this percent MX has many Has many calculations we're gonna see in minutes now. Let's back to this example, all right. So you see the same color, right? You see here, you see pi two, pi five, right? It's blue. This means it is a packet of pi two, but pi one, pi four also in blue color. That means the pi one, pi four, except pi one. You see, pi one has three lookout parameters, right? So which one is the lookout for pi one? The look crosspin for power one that is uh preside two, okay. So among pi one, posite two, posite three, posite two is the most uh tempered one, okay. So that's the meaning of this color, and pi six is the pi six here. Uh, the local parameter is precise three, and pi four is also precise two, the local parameters. So this Posine max and the posite. And similarly, we can define Posa Min so we have repetition theoretical calculation as follows. Okay, so actually there are five ordering you can define on this set capital set pi. Namely, this is all the local other parameters such that the packet contains pi. Okay, there are five orderings such that this percent max, percent min unique max and min elements. Max and main elements under these order is okay. Um, in particular, so this person max is the most tempered one, as we see in the example. And also, uh, this Pac-Max, uh, this, yeah, this part one is joined with Hasiden law. The Pac-Max gives the least order of zeros for the other normalized internet operator. Uh, this is considered by Arthur McGlan because you see, uh, Arthur. Author, in his work, the normalization is using the local author parameter instead of a local L parameter. So McLand showed that this normalization could overkill the pole. Okay, so hence we'll provide zeros. However, so we show that among all the local parameters related to pi, this plus max pi give you least order zeros. And the last second part is. And the last second part is joined with Helsinki law and term. So we show that under the clue ordering, this is defined using the Vaughan variety. So for any possi in this capital Possibi pi, so we have this. So first one saying that, so under this ordering, there's a max, there's the man. The second part saying that, so phi pi is actually bigger than five percent max pi. So which means uh five pi is bigger than any uh Bigger than any pi for any pi related pi. Okay. So this is actually. So and based on this reposition theoretical calculation, so we believe that this percent max pi is entitled to be z local as a problem for pi. So the second part in the last page actually showed that. Last page actually showed that so for any uh for any possi related to pi, so we have this five pi bigger than this five possi, okay. And this is actually called the clue ordering conjecture, so mentioned in shoot paper, okay. This is uh believe true for any group if there is a look at local path theory, local packet theory. And so, joined with the Hazelton and Law and John, so we showed this for these two sets of groups, uh, you making use of our percent max. Use making use of our percent max pi. So, in particular, so recently, I mean, Clifton and his collaborators developed the theory of the ABE packet for periodic groups. So, and this correlation actually is relative easier to see in their setting. To see in their setting. So, and the Vulgan conjecture is saying that so if this phi is the L parameter corresponding to Psi, namely this Phi Psi, then the corresponding A B packet and the Lawless packet are expected to be equal. This is called Worgan conductor. So this theorem actually provides evidence that so local packet actually comes from the AB packet. So So now the question is: what are sufficient conditions for a local L parameters showing up in a local R packet? So this is unknown. Okay. This is namely how to patch up local packet. So we have an IL packet in the middle, right? And for the repetitions around surrounding, so which are called coronal repetitions. So how to patch them up into a local package? To a local package. So, additional problem is this non-containment of local packets. So, overarching many local fields, one local package can be fully contained in another one. So, examples are given by Baba Trappa and Maglan Rainer. So, oversee. C. All right, so in contrast over Nachmani local fields, as a publication of our result, we show that for these two sets of groups, these joint will hesitate and low and zhang. So there are non-containment low-class packet. So if one contains another one, then they have redo set. Okay, this is the this is related IMF file vendor type. This is related to unremember fire definition as a type. So, there are several conjectures here. The first conjecture is due to a close L saying that, so assume the pipe psi is Rifi, then the localized packet, the pipe psi, contains a unique RFI repetitions and it lies in this pi fiber psi. Okay, so the second conjecture is a reciprocal to a closure conjecture saying that any. Conjecture saying that anti-Arbor file presentation lies in a varsotepe lies in exactly a unique local packet. And this passai is anti-generic here because we consider the general plus version local parameters. If we consider the easy the null exponent of xi, then this should be anti-tempered. And it lies in this L packet of this corruption factor. This creatures. The third conjecture is due to closer and author. So if you have an orthomorphic representation with a global parameter psi, then for almost all finite places, then pi v is in the corresponding corresponding I packet of psi v. So this is implied by Is implied by the part one. So, joined with Hazelton and law, so we gave a characterization of amifer penitentiary other type. And as applications, we showed that these three conjectures, they're all true for these two set of groups. And now, let's see the global implication of these RMFR repetitions. Okay. So, and this one can be considered as application of the enhanced Heidi conjecture. So, in general, there is a conjecture like this. Say pi is in the discrete spectrum of G. So, suppose there is a finite place such that the local component pi v zero is generic, then it is, then, then pi is generic, pi v is gener for almost all places. Generic, have you generic for almost all places? Okay. So applying the enhanced Chidetic conjecture, we proved for these two set of groups, we proved this conjecture for them. Okay. So namely, with this assumption, so there is a place such that pipe b0 is generic. Then you see the for the global other parameter, the global other parameter is like a like mu i b, right? I said i b so this b should be one. ICB. So this B should be one. Okay. Mu I are cospidal venue general linear groups. Okay. And the second one seems that so for all place, Possib is generic. And pi V is generic almost all. Okay. This is Posai V is generic, namely so locally the second SL2, the RSL2 retrieval. And furthermore, for almost all places, so Posey V. All places so Pasai V had trivia trivia restriction to boost SO2. Okay, and this used our result on the classification of uh MRIFR definition of as a path. And the part of saying that if we if we further assume Ramanujan conjecture, then pi v is tempered for almost for all v okay. This this improved uh certain result of Shahidi. So we are local generic assume. Okay. Okay. So, another application, another global application of the classification or RMF is towards Clozio's conjecture. So, Clozio had these conjectures for understanding the local component of automorphic representations. So, he conjectured, he made this conjecture for the L2 automorphic representations. For simplicity, we just For simplicity, we just consider discrete parts. Say pi is a discrete in a discrete spectrum g, then for almost all places, the stadactic parameter of pi is of the form like this, corresponding to at least phi pose v. So this Possibi V is in this capital Possi G, right? So here is not the plus. That's the key point. That's the harder part. Okay. That's the harder part, okay? So it's not the plus, instead, it's just you see the xi at zero. That's a conjecture. The second conjecture of Claudio is, so if you take pi in a discrete spectrum, then if there is a finite place such that pi v zero is amplified and tempered, then pi v are all tempered for all places. Okay, they just need one place is unmified tempered. So, and the second part saying that for v uh finite, such that the pi v is ramified, then you write down the satellite parameter, the exponent are independent of v. So, you see, you have this global as a parameter, you have this mu i s b right. So, this second part, roughly speaking, for the army five places doesn't depend on mu iv. Okay, so. Okay, so this mu IV locally is a so it's like so like rho times SA, right? So we have to show that rho, the exponent, row, sorry, exponent xi and times SA. So this meaning that so this the the exponent should be trivial, should be zero, and also a should be trivial. So these are deep conjectures. Conjectures. And so UD. Sorry. So, as application of our resonanc classification, RMF potential isotype. So we show that if you assume Ramanujan, then this conjecture holds. So the Ramanujan just, for example, the conjecture conjecture, the first conjecture, so will reduce the parameter from plus to this capital psi. That's roughly speaking. Speaking. And okay, I think that's all I want to say. Thank you for your attention.
