form of clinical decision support. But in many conversations with clinicians we keep finding that predictions are not always the most useful ways to inform decisions and there are many different types of decisions that are made in regular clinical care that may require different types of support. So we wanted to do the study to understand different decision contexts in a very narrow setting. So I'm not going to claim that we've covered all different types of clinical decisions. All different types of clinical decisions, but some subset of them in order to identify what would be appropriate forms of clinical decision support given the context. So we specifically focused, and again, given the types of models Dave is working on, we specifically focused on Department of Endocrinology at our hospital. And we basically did a set of observations. So, the Department of Endocrinology, the clinicians who work with The clinicians you work with provide consulting services to a variety of different settings in the hospital. So they provide consulting service for, for example, insulin management for patients in different ICUs. They also see out patients for any endocrine-related issues that have been referred to them by That have been referred to them by their primary healthcare providers. So a lot of their I'm going to continue, so I'm not sure what the recording is in progress. That's right. It's a good time. 8-10 yards. Okay. So, and the idea again was that we wanted to try to see how well is there what can Well, is there what can be done? Like, we keep hearing this question. How can these models be helpful to clinicians? So, that essentially was the question of the study. And we did an observational study, which means that I and my students interviewed endocrinologists, including attending clinician physicians, and fellows. We kind of focused on a higher levels of clinicians. We haven't really talked to residents, although that would be another very interesting subpopulation to talk. Another very interesting subpopulation to talk to. We observed patient encounters, we're sitting there when clinicians were meeting with patients, we observed endocrine rounds. Some of them were Zoom rounds, some of them were in person. And then we did what's called participatory design sessions with endocrine fellows, where we basically sat down with them and talked about the kinds of patients that they see, the kind of models that we work with, and started sketching out some ideas for interfaces. Ideas for interfaces. And I'll show you what we came up with, but this is a very brief talk, so I'll talk about our main findings briefly. Basically, what we found is that there appear to be, particularly in this context, two very different types of decisions. Again, this is probably not an exhaustive list, but there are some types of patients and clinical cases that they see. For example, weight management. For example, weight management would be one of them, and actually, growth management also. So, a lot of Endocorean consults sees, particularly in pediatric settings, children with inhibited growth. Very similar findings there, but also weight management. The main question that they appear to be asking is how aggressively they need to intervene on patients based on the projected trajectory of weight. Of weight change over time. So, and it's not that there are many different types of treatments. It's the question is: how quickly do I need to intervene and how aggressive do I need to be? For a patient whose weight trajectory is projected to be relatively mild, the common treatment options could include lifestyle modification, diet, referral to dieticians, physical activities. To dieticians, physical activity, those kinds of things. If the weight, projected weight trajectory is steeper, then pharmaceutical treatments might be in order, so there is a set of drugs that could be used to suppress appetite and so forth. And in more severe cases, when it's a really upward-looking trajectory, something more aggressive, such as surgery, bariatric surgery, particularly here. Would be the again the desirable option. And it appears that the choices, how clinicians sort of navigate between those choices a lot, depends on their experience and their sort of ability to observe and predict based on their experience and expertise. So there were not any specific clinical guidelines to suggest which treatments to suggest in what case. Suggest in what case. Now, a very different context, and again I talked about this a little bit yesterday, is management of type 2 diabetes, where there is a variety of pharmaceutical options with very different mechanisms of action that are meant to treat different physiological disruptions, or how clinicians call it, types of physiologic insulin. So, for example, there is a class of drugs that deals Class of drugs that deals with insulin, producing insulin resistance. There is a different type of drugs that are meant to stimulate insulin production. And those are two examples, but there are other types of drugs that all treat different underlying disruptions of the blood glucose regulation system. And the real choice here is to decide, come up with a hypothesis. Come up with a hypothesis about what underlying disruption is happening, and then choose the right class of drugs to treat that option. The only problem is that there are really no diagnostic tests to differentiate between those available in normal clinical settings. It is possible to differentiate between those using metabolic chambers and invasive extensive procedures. Invasive, extensive procedures, but they're not typically used in clinical practice. So, because it is not possible typically for clinicians to identify the root cause, what they use instead is clinical protocols that prescribe a choice of treatment. Typically, those do not deal with underlying root causes, but rather with things like anticipated adherence to the medication or Suspected side effects and tolerance of different side effects and so forth. I can show you, I don't know if you can see it, but this is one of the protocols that is typically used. And a lot depends on the baseline hemoglobin A1C and the target hemoglobin A1C. But you can see here the questions clinicians have to ponder: is there a compelling need to minimize hypoglycemia? Is there a compelling need to minimize weight gain or promote weight loss? Whether cost is a major issue. So these questions have nothing to do whether there is a hypothesis about insulin resistance or insulin production. They have more to do with comorbidities, costs, and medication adherence and other things. So that seems to, there appears to be. seems to that there appears to be somewhat of a disconnect between what would really the sort of the logical choice of treatment based on the cause versus how these choices are made in clinical practice. So that's where we've transitioned into a participatory design trend to think about well how can we use these kinds of mechanistic models to support these decisions. These decisions. And in the first case, in the case of weight management and the growth, basically what they wanted to see is a projected weight or growth trajectory. So it's a curve that could tell them how aggressively they need to intervene. And I don't have the pictures here, but all of them invariably just drew curves. And that's it. So they're relatively, in terms of generating. Generating those from the models, it's relatively straightforward. I mean, it's still difficult to generate the accurate one, but representation is relatively straightforward. Where it got very interesting is again with type 2 diabetes, where we started looking into the model itself and how what aspects of the model can be useful. We've identified, and we've done this to be fair, with clinicians who actually understand our research and have some awareness and knowledge of mechanistic. Some awareness and knowledge of mechanistic models. Even though the comment that we received is that it's a very natural way for clinicians to think about physiological systems. Apparently, when you're a medical student, there are a lot of mechanistic diagrams. This is how you will learn different mechanical systems that involved in physiology. So they were very familiar with this idea of a mechanical diagram that represents physiological processes. Physiological processes. So, the three main things that they wanted out of this is first to understand the scope of the model and its representation of the system, what it includes and what it doesn't include. The second thing is estimating variables of interest. And the third thing is basically simulation, exploring treatment effects using the model. So, we took one of the models that you actually just seen or seen before, and we try to start sketching out. We try to start sketching out using PowerPoint and different kinds of things that you can draw with the interface. So, again, the first thing was to just look at the model and understand what connects to what and what the model represents and more importantly, what it does not represent. For example, some of these models include digestion as part of it, and it was important to know whether it's included or not included. And here again, look. And here again, looking at like they started drawing different sketches of graphs that they would want to see how the model actually could be the output of this model. For example, here, some of the outputs could include glucose trends during the day, and I'll actually get to this with drugs, and the graph of insulin resistance, so the insulin to glucose. So that was what, just understanding the scope of the model. The scope of the model. The second one, and this was specifically for type 2 diabetes, the three things, the three variables that they were interested in were insulin resistance, insulin suppression, and glucose absorption. And the biggest question for them was to what degree these three contribute to the disruption, to the lack of control in blood glucose. And what they again wanted is something like a percentage. Wanted is something like a percentage. So the insulin resistance has about 30% contribution to this clinical picture. And then comparison of how this patient, based on the hypothesis, basically, this is a hypothesis that the system made, that the model makes about the clinical state of a patient, how it then How it then produces, for example, different graphs and how patient compares to the population sort of averages. For example, this is their insulin resistance, the insulin secretion here, and the glucose absorption. So again, it's understanding how the model represents the different underlying physiological properties. Underlying physiological processes, and how, in this particular patient, the estimate of these processes compares to the population. And the third thing that they wanted to see is what happens if you intervene with different drugs. So, for example, in this particular case, the major contributor here was the suspected disruption in glucose absorption. So, this is 60% contribution, which means that that probably would be the first thing to treat. Would be the first thing to treat with the drug. And this is kind of: if I add this drug, what happens? To see how different things move, and also to see the projected impact on all the different outputs and outcomes based on this. So these were the kinds of things that clinicians wanted to see and be able to experiment with. Not to say that this is what they want for each patient, because in many cases, the choice. Because, in many cases, the choice is pretty straightforward. So, it's pretty clear how to address this. But there were many patients and many patients' cases that we've heard about where it's the mystery case, where the patient has cycled through the entire clinical protocol and have been on many different treatment options and on many different drugs and still uncontrolled. And nobody really knows what to do next and how to approach them. So, that's where we are with this project. We're writing a paper on this right now. We're writing a paper on this right now, and what we want to do next is to basically take a few cases where we have data collected for patients to be able to fit the model to those cases, where we're trying to select them where they represent actually different hypotheses about underlying disruptions, and have clinicians, not unlike the study I showed yesterday, look at the data, look at the representation of patients using the model, and think aloud and try to read. And think aloud and try to reason and see what treatment options they would choose in those cases. And then we would want to compare it with the gold standard. Except in this case, the gold standard was their guess. So in this kind of studies, in clinical settings, finding appropriate gold standard is challenging itself. That's it. And this is a work with Dave and Lauren Victor, who is George's. And she actually is an Endocrine Fellow. is an endocrine fellow and a bioinformatician and she's working on that work. I would love to have this stuff really consider the cancer cell, like maybe after because it's very very similar in shouts. But I would love to hear your thoughts about I I would love to hear your thoughts about them. We've seen many different models in this and I'm wondering whether you thought about whether these models would be applicable in clinical care to these kinds of decision support. I mean, I think one of the reasons why this is so important for this group is that we spend a lot of time modeling. If we want to make it useful for anyone, you can see what you have to do and you can see the complexity of it. So, you know, like for example. So, you know, like for example, you were looking at, but what you trend, what you have is raw output, which is not going to be useful for conflicts. You can see what the kind of thing you'd have to do to translate it to something that something that could have been used outside of the lab. Yeah, it would be interesting too to build in a hierarchy of models because in the case that you mentioned where you were patients who aren't responding to treatment are having Aren't responding to treatment are having more stuff done, right? And having more like glucoses and those kinds of things. And so, then, in that sense, you have more data to work with. And so, if you could leverage that somehow, that would be helpful. Yeah, great. It's a baseline model, but then it's like, oh, we have this extra information, how do they incorporate it? Absolutely. Yeah, and by the time they get to the point where they are declared officially to be the mystery case, they've gone through CGM, everything, and they've tried all sorts. everything and they've tried all sorts of different tests on them. So yes there would be a lot more data that would be typically available for a patient with time to date. All right, thank you. Awesome. So I mean everyone in the room has a lot of RD is up. Give me a second Dave to cycle the recorder.
