for the introduction and i thank the organizers for giving me an opportunity to speak and i'm happy to be here so i'm going to talk about the discrete branching load or as a branching load uh that commands derived function modules so the setting is that g is a real reductive root and g prime is a reductive subgroup in In G, this means that we can find a Carton involution theta of G, which fixes G prime. Then we have a maximum compact subgroups of G and G prime, which we denote by K and K prime. And then we want to consider the restriction. We want to consider the restriction of representation of G to the subgroup G prime. And in the algebraic setting, in the highest general module setting, we consider the restriction of GK module to G prime, K prime modules. And for this, Professor Kobayashi introduced a notion of discrete decomposability. So let V be a GK module. GK module and we can view we can regard V as a G prime K prime module and it is called discretely decomposable if there is some futuration of G prime K prime modules which is exhaustive so the union of all these Vi is equal to V and each Vi is of finite length as a G prime K prime module. So this is what's previously appeared in previous talks. So let us recall the summary of discrete decomposable restriction by Professor Kobashi. So we actually have to be, here we actually have to be the irreducible unitarizable GK modules. GK modules rather than the unitary representation of G. So for each such unitalizable GK module, by Hubert composition, we have an irreducible unitary representation of G. And then if this irreducible unitarizable GK module is discretely decomposable as a G prime K prime modules and And so, in this case, the restriction is by this unitarizability. This decomposes into a direct sum. So there is no extension, the direct sum of irreducible, unitarizable G prime, K prime modules. And then this implies, so we have the branching. We have the branching formula of this form. And then this implies the restriction of corresponding unitary representations. So this is Vy is a unitary representation of G and each W, by Qt composition, we have an irreducible unitary representation of G prime. And the branching law of GK modules and branching law of unitary representations are essentially the same. So this means So this means that we can, so the branching law of unitary representation, this is in general, contains continuous spectrum. So it has more analytic nature, but this is reduced to the more algebraic problem of restriction of GK module. And Professor Kobe discovered that there are There are many GK modules satisfying this discrete decomposability. For example, where B is a HU lambda, Darkamount derived functor modules, and G and G prime is a symmetric pair. And in this setting, he found some. So he found some criteria for discrete decomposability and also admissibility. And also admissibility. And in this setting, AT lambda and symmetric pair he found some nice criteria for discrete decomposability. So let us recall what is this A2 lambda briefly. So A2 lambda is defined from Q and lambda. And Q is a theta stable parvex of algebra of complex Sub-algebra of a complexified realgebra of G. So and then we write L for the normalizer of Q in G. So this is a Levy subgroup of G and so Q is a so we have a Levy decomposition Q is a direct sum of complexified real geographical L and near body near lamina U and let And lambda is a unitary character of L. So one-dimensional unitary representation of L. Then we can define ATU lambda as a cohomological induction from a representation of L. So we inflate this by trivially due to n, by trivial action of u, and then we define some kind of induction. Some kind of induction called cohomological induction, then we get some GK module. And for this cohomological induction, several constructions are known. So these are these give a representation which are isomorphic to each other, but the constructions are different. So one is a most algebraic derived functor for induction of GK module. Induction of GK module. So, in the category of GK module, we have some functor of induction, and then taking derived functor, you get some representation, I mean, GK modulus. And also, another construction is by using a dual bohomology. So, in the homogeneous space G over L, it has a complex structure, and from lambda. From lambda, we can define some complex line bundle, and then take a cohomology or double cohomology of this homomorphic line bundle, and then you get some representation of G, which is also the underlying GK module is isomorphic to H lambda. And then also we have some the third construction is by twisted D module on partial flux varieties. So we varieties so we we uh we will talk about this uh later in connection to uh branching loss you always get a complex structure from gmo or some yes in this uh theta stable parabolic uh theta stability implies that this this has a complex structure g overl has a complex structure okay so this is a uh basically g over l is uh openly embedded in gc over embedded in GC over Q. This, and yeah, so this is always a complex, not compact in general, but complex model. And then the Zachaman, Vogan, and Wallach proved some nice properties of ATU Lambda. For example, if lambda is good, so I did not explain the detail of the The detail of the property of parameters, but I'm just good means there is such infinitesimal characters in regular dominant column. And this implies that the AT lambda is irreducible and non-zero. And weak referee is a slightly milder condition, and this implies the AT lambda is unitary or unitarizable. And also, it is known that the And also, it is known that the following representations are isomorphic to Aq lambda for some Q and lambda. For example, discrete series representation of G, this is can be written as a Q lambda. So this corresponds to the case where Q is a Boyle sub-algebra and also the line condition which assures the existence of discrete C's. And also, And also a GK module with non-zero GK cohomology. So, this such representation proved to be isomorphic to ETU lambda by Zackaman and Vaughan. And so this contributes to the cohomology of locally symmetric spaces. And also, most of unitary highest weight modules are known to be isomorphic to AQ lambda for some equivalent lambda. For some material. Okay, so here's a criteria established by Professor Kobashi. So that G, G prime is a symmetric pair and Q is a stable parabolic subalgebra. And then we consider this triple G, G prime and Q. And the following condition are. The following condition of this triple equivalent. The first one is the restriction of A2Î» to G prime is discretely decomposable for any lambda in Vakrifair. The second one is A2 lambda is discretely decomposable and it is non-zero for some lambda in Vakrifa. So the equivalence of one and two implies that a discrete decomposability of Aq lambda does not depend on lambda. On lambda and also depends only on Q and G prime. And the third one is so this K C U intersection G C minus theta. So this is a sub variety of G theta, G C. So this is an associate variety of A to lambda. And then B by I J. By identification of G, C, and its dual. And then projection, we take a projection to G prime, then it is contained in the near potential count of G prime. So more generally, he proves that the projection of associated piety has to be in a neopotent form. If the restriction is discreetly decomposable, so this is a necessary condition in general, not only for AT Lambda. But in this setting, this is if and only if condition. Okay, and fourth one is for Q minus sigma compatible. So this is this condition appears in the yesterday's talk by Haya. So This means that to define Q, we take some positive system, and this is compatible with involution minus compatible with minus sigma. And we can always make this holes by taking conjugation of Q. So this does not restrict any cases. And then some routing here. uh some routing uh here u intersection g c minus c if we if we apply a sigma then it contains in the root of q so this is some uh condition on the root so this is uh uh relatively easy to check if we given some gg prime q and based on uh this these criteria such a triples such triples g prime q are classified by kobayashi and myself yeah so we call this equivalent condition uh by uh discrete decomposability condition okay so it is uh one can prove that uh if there is an inclusion of uh the stable parvix above gebrid Uh, she is a stable parvik sub-algebra, then if it satisfies for smaller public sub-algebra, then it also holds for large, larger sub-parveric sub-algebra. This means that if Aq1 lambda1 is discretely decomposable, then Aq2, lambda2 is also discretely decomposable. So, if q becomes larger, then the representation becomes larger. Presentation becomes smaller in some sense, and it is more likely to be discrete decomposable. And so, by the classification, we can divide the triples satisfying discrete decomposable decomposability condition by two types. One is we call discrete series type, and the second one we call isolated type. The discrete series type means that there is a built-up. There is a Boyle-sub-algebra such that this triple with B satisfies the discrete decomposability condition. So, this means that even the smallest parabolic sub-algebra satisfies the condition. So, this implies that all parabolic sub-algebra containing B satisfies discrete decomposable condition. So, this means that we have some family of triples which satisfy discrete decomposable condition. Discrete decomposable conditions. So, this includes the following case: AQ lambda is the highest weight module, and G and G prime is the symmetric pair is holomorphic. So, this means that the inclusion of corresponding Riemann and symmetric spaces are holomorphic. So, these two Riemannian symmetric spaces are Hermitian symmetric spaces and the natural. And the natural inclusion map is holomorphic. So, in this setting, it is relatively easy to show that this is discretely decomposer. And also the tensor product of two highest-weighted modules also in this case, discrete series type. So yeah, but these are in some sense holomorphic case, but there are also no holomorphic case in the discrete series type. And also there are some case we call isolated type, which is not of a discrete series type. And so, yeah, so. So yeah, so here's some list. Oh, so yeah, so this is a discrete series type with non-holomorphic discrete series type. So this is some classical case here and also some exceptional case here. So these are all discrete c types. So this is G and So this is G and G prime and some condition on Q. So there's some boil sub algebra for each symmetric pair and then for all Q which contains this boil satisfy the discrete decomposability condition. Okay, and also some this is the isolated type is there are some classical Some classical ACs and also some isolate exceptional groups. Okay, and then so we classified a discrete decomposable or discretely decomposable restrictions in this setting in the settings that In the setting that the representation is 80 lambda and g and g prime is a symmetric pair. And then the next question is: so, if this is the case, find explicit granting laws of the restriction. So, the theory of Kobayashi and also the singles out a nice framework for the branching loads. Branching loss for the more detailed studies, and this is a natural question to so. This plays a lot of stage B in the in terms of Professor Kobashba yesterday's talk. So, here is an answer. So, suppose that G and G prime is a symmetry. G and G prime is a symmetric pair and AQ lambda. The restriction is discretely decomposable. And then the restriction is decomposed as a direct sum of AQ prime lambda prime. So this is a Zacoma-derived functor module for G prime. And we have, in general, there are some multiplicities. And so this public sub-algebra, we have Have algebra. We have a finite in general, we have finitely many parallels of algebra, and then the parameters are all weakly fair. So if the original parameter is weakly fair, then we can always write in this way. Even if the original parameter is good, then but even if the original If the original parameter lambda is good, we cannot write as a direct sum of AQ prime, lambda prime with lambda prime all good. So in some sense, weakly fair, AQ lambda with weakly fair range is a natural class of representation. It is closed under this restriction procedure. And here is some example of exceptional groups. G is some real form of E6 and G prime is some real form of F4. And in this case, so we take Q to be the level is this SU24 plus U1. And then in this case, we have this decomposition. We have this decomposition. So there are two public sub-algebra and we have some in this case multiplicity free, multiplicity of one. And actually in this case, so this first one is most of them are tempered representations and this second one is non-tempered representations. So in general, it appears that the tempered representations, non-tempered representation appear at Representation appears at the same time. So, your theorem is constructed for the HTML existence? Yes, so in each case, we can write multiplicities. So, for every case, we have an explicit formula for these multiplicities, like a combinatorial description of multiplicities for compact groups. Multiplicities for compact groups. Sorry, I should have shredded before asking. No, no, it's okay. Thank you very much. So, yeah, so yeah, in each case, we have such a formula and the matrix is given in an explicit way, but this is given in a case-by-case way. So I do not have a uniform way to describe this multiplicity or multiplicity functions. Yeah, multiplicity functions. Yes, so in each case, we have some different type of computer formulas. How many cases? How many cases? Like 100. Yeah, I recently finished writing and yeah, it's like 400 pages. And also the proof is by case by case. And we use, but our key ingredient is the use of D module. Is there a pattern on how to get the parabolics that you are? Yes. So actually we can. So actually we can yeah for Q prime I actually we can write so so there is some corresponding elliptic orbit for AT lambda and then project this elliptic orbit to G prime then you get some a union this becomes a union of elliptic orbits of G prime and then this gives some Q prime I but I do not know so I expect know so i expect that multiple questions can be also related to this orbit picture but uh uh so far i have not done it okay so uh i'd like to speak a little bit about uh a proof using d module from the next slides uh okay so maybe so uh as uh so there are two cases discrete see So, there are two cases: discrete seeds type and isoactic type, as I said. And so, to consider the restriction for ATLAMA or more general representation, one way is to describe a general representation in terms of some sort of standard representations and then consider the restriction of standard representations. And then from this, we deduce the Use the granting of restriction of general representations, like write finite dimensional representation as alternating sum of vermin modules. But in some cases, it works. For example, some discrete C type case this works well, but this does not work for isolated type because for isolated type. For isolated type, if you want to study the restriction of A to Lambda, if you want to write this as alternating sum of standard modules, the restriction of standard modules are no longer discretely decomposable. And for example, we we or yeah, in s in some cases it it may happen that uh multiplicities are are infinite. Multiplicity is infinite. And then take if you take the alternative sum of this standard or big representations, and the multiplicity becomes infinity minus infinity, and this gives no information for the original representations. So we have to employ different methods, especially for these isolated types. Isolated types. So and then I used some demodule method for this program and write gc over q to be x. So this is a partial flat variety for g, a complex partial flat variety of g, and y is a partial flat variety of k. And then from lambda, we can form a holomorphic line by. A holomorphic line bundle on y, kc equivalent holomorphic line bundle y, and then consider the push forward of this line bundle by this inclusion map I. So this map is closed. So y is a closed KC orbit in X. And then you get some twisted D module on X and then take a global section, then you get the HU lambda. So this is So, this is the third construction I mentioned in the previous slide. And so, for locally, if we take a coordinate, so we take a coordinate x, so we divide the coordinate x and y, and then y is a coordinate for y, and x is a coordinate in the normal direction, and then at And then a typical section here is written as in this way. So this is a push forward of the line bundle. So HJ appeared in the last talk by Ochisen said. So this is like a direct delta distribution supported on y. So written in this way. And the Learchable of G acts. The Lear cheek of D acts on this section in a standard way. So we also trivialize this line bundle. And so locally we can write as so each layer gebral of G, it corresponds to some first order differential operator on X. And then, so this is some action to this distribution. Yeah, so yeah, for example, if you multiply the function to this distribution, then we take some GC take some commutation relation. And so if we change the order of g and this dx, then we have this. And also the sum mutation relation is about the partial differential of G appears here. And then we consider the K prime C orbit decomposition of this K C flag variety. So this becomes a finite decomposition. And we write the inclusion map by in this way. And then we have a line bundle on y, and we decompose this line bundle according to this orbit decomposition. So this is like, for example, if y is p1 and decompose into the c and point, we have this maps equation. Maps, equation maps, and then so this is closed and this is open, and then we have some distinguished distinguished triangle of the D modules. And by push forward of these maps of a structure of each strata. So, this in general, this is a twisted setting, but In general, this is a twisted setting, but the decomposition is similar. And this is a finite decomposition, so we iterate such triangles and distinguish triangle this decomposition. We get some decomposition of this line bundle into this according to this orbit decomposition. And we have some sign here for this by. But by coding engine, the parity of coding. And then, so we have this diagram. So this is, so we have this inclusion of groups. And then X is a variety of G C variety. Y is a Kc orbitiness. And G. So X prime J, this is a sorry. So this Y prime J. Sorry, so this y prime j, this is a k prime c orbit in y, and this is a g prime c orbit through y prime j. So we have such a diagram, and then we have a line boundary here, or y lambda, and this decomposes according to this orbit decomposition, k prime c orbit decomposition. And then by applying the functor to x, we have a decomposition of this push-while dimmed. Push forward dim so this i plus or y lambda is decomposite is the push forward over some line bundle here to here with some sign and then we have a yes so I think Yes, so I think it's so we have this diagram, y prime j, and we have some, we decompose i plus the line bundle into the pushword of here from here, and then we take some coordinates x so we choose coordinates such that the x double prime is zero on x prime j. So we divide the coordinate. So we divide the coordinate x into two coordinates. And then each element in the Lie algebra of G prime C. So this corresponds to this type of differential operators. So G prime C is stabilizing this X prime J. So this is so in the coefficient of this In the coefficient of this derivative in the direction of x double prime, it always be accompanied with this x double prime. And we define a filteration of so this is not so yeah. So the direct the push forward of this The push forward of this by this map, we define a filtration by the normal degree of the x double prime direction. And then by the description of this differential operator for corresponding to g prime, each filter. So this filtration is stable by the action of g prime. And the successive quotient is isomorphic to the line bundle, the push-board line bundle from here to here. And also, we have some normal bundle of x prime j to x. So combining them, we have a And combining them, we have some push forward of a line bundle by I. And then this, we decompose this according to this K-prime C orbit decomposition. And then we take some filtration here. And then in the Groton decline, this is a sum of successive quotients. And then each successive quotient are small. Each successive quotients are isomorphic to this. So, this is some shift from y prime j here to do to this map. So, this picture. And the last one, so this one is actually so yeah, so this one, so this one is actually in the homologically induced setting for G prime. So, this is a G prime. G prime C variety, and this is a K prime C variety. And we can write this right-hand side by some cohomological induction from some, not the one-dimensional, but some general, more general representation. So this is a sum of a finite dimensional representation, but not one-dimensional in general. One-dimensional in general. So, this is just some shift of character, some raw shift, and so this corresponds to the symmetric tensor of normal bundle. And so we want to rewrite this, so this is not irreducible, and we want to rewrite this by AQ prime lambda prime. KQ prime lambda prime. So for this part, we need a case-by-case calculation. And actually, under the admissibility condition or discrete decomposability condition, we can rewrite this term as a sum of, so this term as a sum of LP prime, lambda prime, and lambda prime in the weakly fair range. And we get this kind of formula. And for this step, we need some case. Step: We need some case-by-case calculations. And so it is like, so this sub-algebra QJ intersection G prime C. So this is in some sense close to the parabolic sub-algebra of G prime C. So like module, some compact, but this is actually isomorphic to some parabolic sub-algebra. And then Algebra and then this we can rewrite this as a cosmological induction for power x abalgeable G prime C and then we can rewrite this in terms of equipment lambda prime. But so by rewriting in this way, we have some lambda prime with some very bad parameters. And for this we have to study such AQ prime lambda prime with Hu prime lambda prime with lambda prime bad parameters and then we have to rewrite such bad parameters by good parameters, weak repair parameters, and we have such focus. And so, this is a method using D module. There is an alternative approach for discrete series type. So, recall that discrete series is a series. So recall that discrete series type is the case where V is a Boyle-sub-algebra. There is a Boyle-sub-algebra which satisfies discrete decomposability condition. And Q contains this Boyle-Saber algebra B. And AQ lambda, so this is homologically induced from a one-dimensional representation of Q. And then we can write this one-dimensional representation of Q or L. representation of Q or L by a standard module. So this is we call standard means that some induced representation from Boell, homologically induced from Boel. And then so this is induced from some representation from Boil so this is alternating sum and we have an induction from Boil and then by induction From Boyle. And then by induction, by stages, we have the AT lambda can be written as a cohomologically induced representation cohomologically induced from Boyel sub-algebra. And for chromologically induced module from Boyel sub-algebra, we can compute the restriction. So you have the chromologically induced? Yes. Landa is arbitrary, no assumption on weekly fair, good fair any kind. Here we should. Yeah, here we do not mutation. And then so you write a one-dimensional in terms of a combination of discrete series through the cylinder. What is the difference? Okay, so it is. Yeah, actually. Yeah, actually, so in this setting, so this is actually. So this is Hermitian in this setting. Yeah, we actually consider this setting. And then, and then in so the second is an index. So the second is an induce from B to Q and then from Q, then you owe to GC. Okay. Yes. Okay, okay, great. So this is like writing trivia representation. So this is a generalized VAMA module for L. And so, yeah, write one-dimensional representation as a sum, organizing sum of a generalized BAM module. Yes, no, no, no, thank you. Thank you. And then we can. Then we can, and we compute the restriction of this representation induced from BOIL. Then you get some formula. So for representation induced from BOIL, actually we can compute the restriction. And then, so if you remember that it's written as the restriction, it's written as some. The restriction is written as some alternating sum of representation homologically induced from Borel sub algebra of G prime. And but here we there appear some bad parameter lambda prime in general. But for some gg prime and q all lambda prime appearing in here is in the good range. Here we assume lambda. Here we assume lambda is weakly fair. And in this case, the restriction is a sum of discrete series because these are all good range. And we still have some minus sign, but this chances out eventually. And we get a direct sum of AB prime lambda prime with lambda prime with all lambda prime are in the good range. So this means that this is us. that this is a direct sum of discrete series for G prime and we and I talk about this example so G is SO2MN G prime is this subgroup and L is some levy subgroup and this is a case of discrete series type and this in this case if p prime if p plus q is less than or equal to n minus k then this is a q This is a case I mentioned. So, Lambda prime here are all in the good range. So, in general, if L is a small, if L becomes smaller and G prime also becomes smaller, then this is likely to be whole. So, even if the original representations are not a discrete case, the restriction it's happening. The restriction, it happens that the discretion is a sum of all, sum of discrete representations. So we combine this method and also the module method. And this, and I use some other methods like CISO, how zero pair, CISO, CISO pairs, argument, and then this covers all the cases. Cases. So I stop here. Thank you very much. Is there any question? So I'm just curious. So it was hundreds of calculations. How bad do the multiplicities get? How big do the multiplicities get? Yes, so. Yes, so in general, so like maybe it becomes biggest in the case of Q is for L. So in that case, this is so this is basically the similar to the written by the majority of the major So, written by in terms of a constant addition functions. Yeah. So, in some sense, it is like similar to the k-type formula of discrete series. So, this is a largest case. The third question would be: is there a set of them where, oh, it's multiplicity-free? Is there a favorite scenario where A favorite scenario where it would come up to be multiplicity-free, or is that a very rare occurrence? Yeah, there are many cases that there are multiplicity-free. One sufficient condition is talked by yesterday's talk by Tanaka. Yeah, so he proved some geometric. Geometric sufficient condition for multiplicity freeness. And I think it also happens that even if that not holds, I mean, for general lambda, it becomes not multiplicity free, but for some very particular lambda, it happens that this is multiplicity free. So, yeah, this also happens. And also, my formula is like in general, this is an alternating sum of some parts. This is an alternating sum of some partition functions, and it is not always not easy to get this is multiplicity free or not from this format. Yeah, I have just a small comment. You have a formula of restriction, and does it give something? uh does it give something uh new when you you are in the particular case that you are not interested in but when uh you every when the g are compact yes when you aq lambda it's just a representation of a compactly group yes you have still a decomposition in your formula and and it is a new decomposition or no in the compact because you should what you said Because what you said should work for the compact when everybody is compact. Yes. Yeah, I use a case-by-case argument, and I do not treat a compact group case, but some argument of D module, I think this works. And yeah, we have some formula for compact loops, but I do not know if this is a useful one.
