Thank you very much. And thanks for the organizers for the invitation. It's a pleasure for me being here with you. And thanks for the opportunity giving me this talk. And I'm sure it will be a great week with lots of nice mathematical discussions. Of nice mathematical discussions and talks. So, thanks, organizers, for organizing this conference. So, today I'm going to talk about this projective polytops. And this is joint work with Natalia Garcia-Colin and Luis Pedro Montejana. So, let me start with, I mentioned this problem, which is due to Machmoden, Pedro-Machmoden, which has to do with projective transformations. Projective transformations. So let me recall what a projective transformation is. It is just an application which is given there. There you go. Well, it's probably it's just a project transformation is given there. It's a very classical one. And then we say that this project transformation is permissible if the denominator is different than zero. That's what we are interested in. What we are interested in, and then Magnolian, a long time ago in the 70s, asked for the following question. I want to find the largest integer n, such that for any n points in general position in the space, we can always find one of these projective transformations that take your points to the vertices of a polyton. That's the question. In 72, Larman proved. Larman proved that for two is equal to five, for three is seven, and he gave he gave this a lower and upper bound. This is square of the I will explain why this is very easy actually to show it. I will tell you later on how to do it. And then a few years, oh, sorry, and Larman actually conjectured that the lower bound is the real. That the lower bound is the real value for the embunger. So it is known for two, three, and for four is known by a computer. You can check it. He claims that it's true for anything. And a few years later, Michelas Vernias improved the upper bound by roughly half of the square of the roughly. Okay, so here we will be interesting. So here we will be interesting not in this, but in a more general question. But let me going through this question. And for doing this, one way to attack this question is by using a combinatorial tool, which is Oriented Matter. So let me give you three slides about Oriented Matter, what you know, and then how to use it in order to investigate this question. Investigate this question. So there is no formalist at all unless you ask me, right? So you have, we're going to have a set of sets of a given set. We're going to take a subset. Each of these subsets, each element of the set has a sign, which is positive or negative. A negative. We have some set. And then we can define an oriented matter by using what we call the circuit. The circuit. So you have a fixed set E. So one to the end, you take a family of subsets for each subset you have a sign. And then all this family must satisfy certain actions that I won't mention here. You must just satisfy something. Okay, that's the way. Okay, that's a way to define audient matter. Now, one operation that we use in order to matter is the reorientation of elements, which is very simple. You take a subset A, a subset of E, and you have a look at your list of signed subsets, yes. And every time you see one element of this cell here, you exchange the sign. You just change the design, you reorientation, you reorient all design. So, if one appears, if it was plus, now it's minus. If it's minus, now it's plus everywhere. But that's given an orientation. And it turns out that given this reorientation, what you obtain is also an oriented metric. We can prove this. It also satisfies these axioms for the sequence. Okay, so that's one way to define oriented metric. To define oriented metrics. The second way is by using the basis. Now, a basis, you still have your set E. You take all the subsets of cardinality R, and for each subset, you assign a plus, a minus, with zero. I don't know three. That's what we call the curios of this set here. And of course, you assign it, and it must again satisfy. assign it and it must again satisfy certain certain conditions right and then we proved can be proved that definitions if they verify this then it's equivalent to the sort of circus the circles we can find the current of other base okay so now we can talk about the rank of the metric which is just the cardinality of one of the bases okay and one interesting class of oriented matter is a uniform class of oriented matter is a uniform one in which all the curators are plus or minus there are no zeros there are no zeros right so actually here you are signing giving signs to all our subsets of z c okay that's another way to define everything that matters right let me give you a third one we want to use which is a topological way A topological way. Now, here we are interesting in the arrangement of pseudospheres. So, a pseudosphere, you have a sphere, and then you have something which is homeomorphic to all right. So, you have your sphere, and then you will have another cis. Another cis collection of pseudospheres on this way. And you have another, another, another, and that'll give you an arrangement. And of course, this arrangement must satisfy some specific conditions, right? But again, I won't mention what I does here. And then for each of these arrangements, this is homeomorphic to a plane, then to the sphere. Then to the sphere, you can say which one is the left and the right for each for each sphere. So you have a positive side and negative side. And a big theorem in oriented metrics is the Feldman-Lorentz theorem that says that any oriented metric can be represented in this way. And any arrangement like this arises. Frenchman like this, arise on the internet. Big theorem. Beautiful. Right? So sometimes I may use this version here. I'm going to talk about arrangements out of this. Okay. Sometimes we are interesting instead of taking the sphere here, say if that is S2. Say if that is S2, then we can take the projective plane, right? And then for each sphere here, you just have a line there and another and another and so on. Right, so sometimes it's better to look at them this way, and we actually assume that the quotator is one of your elements. Elements. One of the spheres is the equator, like this. Okay, so that's just a matter of representation, but we use this. This is better. You will see why. Now, let me mention finally, that's the third slide for oriented metric. We know that given the configuration of points in dimension D, we can associate always. We can associate always an oriented metric. That's what we call an affine-oriented metric because we're going to look at the affine minimal dependencies of this set of points. And that give you the set of circuits or the kilocrop or whatever you like. We have to keep in mind is that then for points, we can have an oriented matrix which is an affine oriented matter. Another thing is that there are oriented matrix that we call acyclic. We call acyclic. These are very important. In your family of circuits, sine sets, all of them must have at least one positive and one negative element, at least one, right? If that is the case for all the sets of your family, then the oriental matter is a sequelic. Good. Now we know. We know that from points we can associate an oriented matter. If these points are in general position, that means that the oriented matter is uniform because you're going to have all the subsets of R, any R elements that are going to be a base, right? So general position translate as uniform for the integer. And this thing is a final thing that we have to know. It's what an integer L. What an interior element is, which is an element which I can find among the set of all my son sets, one of them in which has E as a positive or negative, as you wish, and the rest of them of the other side. So you have one positive and the others are negative, or one negative and the other are positives. In that case, the element is interior. Right, if we can find this, there's an interior element. Now, these interior elements are good for us because that will translate into points that belongs to the interior of a convex hole of points, right? So I will detect whether a point is inside, lies inside of a convex hole or outside. Just by looking at intermatrices, just by this definition here. This is also a very This is also a very nice, very nice result. All these are cyclic reorientations. So you have, once again, you have your family, you have a reorientation. So let's see. You take M from here, you have one reorientation with a note like this. I'm reorienting all the elements of A. Well, it turns out that each reorientation that is a That is acyclic. That is, when I change the sign, then I will have that all the circles have at least one positive, one negative. It is acyclic that corresponds to one of these cells. And for each cell, I can find an acyclic orientation. This is a bijection. Nice, huh? Nice, huh? And I can tell you more than this. I can tell you that when I make this acyclic orientation, I can tell you which ones, once I have done it, which elements are interior. Which are the elements? Well, they are all the elements that correspond to the pseudosphere that do not touch this cell, are the complement of them. Are the complement of them? We can prove this, right? So you see, I'm going through geometry, topology, to just combinatorics, right? So there is design bijection. In 85, Cordoville and Silvia, Silva, yeah, Silva, show that actually If you give me an affine oriented method that comes from configuration of points. Okay, let's see. You take your configuration of points, you take your oriented metric, your affine oriented metric. If there is one projected transformation here, give me another configuration points. Well, it turns out that the oriented metric of this value here is. Here is actually an acyclic orientation of this metric here. So I can take points to point by taking this projective transformation geometry, or I just have a look at the oriented metric and realize which acidly orientation the corresponding metric. That's a beautiful result. And it's not hard to prove it. It's just a matter of look at the dependencies of the corresponding points. Okay. Okay, with this enhance, then we can translate Mach modeling problem into oriented matrix. This is a question. Now, the question is, what is the largest integer, which are your number of points? Here are elements, because are elements of a metric, such that any given uniform, affine-oriented metric, affine means that comes from the conferential points, uniform means they are in general position. Means they are in general position. Of rank R, you will always have an acyclic orientation, a projective transformation, having no interior elements. So these projective transformations send all the points to the vertices of polytope. There are no interior elements. There you go. So that's just pure combinatorics, right? Real combinatorics. You may ask, well, You may ask, well, Jorge, what about the topological version? There you go. That's the topological version, the Macmoden problem. McModen says, well, again, determine the largest integer such that in the uniform within the network, we know that cyclic orientations means cells here. So I want to find if there is a cell. I want to know which arrangement has a complete cell. Because if it has a complete cell, I said that the complements of the elements here are the interior elements, but all the set touch this cell here because it's complete, right? It's rich. So there are no interior elements. So there are no interior points. So that's my modeling problem. That's what I want. Right? Okay. So, I translate this to combinatorics. By using oriented matrix, I was able to improve the upper bound and instead of giving V square, now it is linear in V. So, let me tell you how I did this, because we are going to use for the recent results we have. For these, I'm going to. For these, I'm going to use a class of matrix, oriented metrics, which are called Lottus-oriented metrics. Now, I could explain, right? But it's just the union of our uniform-oriented match for rank one. Boom. But they don't really care about that, right? Because we haven't defined what the union is. What is interesting here is that this Is that this class? I can keep all the information in one matrix. That's what is interesting. I'm going to show you a matrix in which all the information of this kind of matrix, I can have it just by looking at the matrix. No circuits, no curves, just a matrix. Right? That's what I'm saying here. If you give me the carrot top, the carrot top of this union here is because I can find a matrix. This matrix has. Matrix, this matrix has plus one and minus one. That's only what we have, and I'll tell you how to compute actually the car top of this union of things, right? So do not really, well, you cannot just understand if you like, but it doesn't really matter. What this matter is that we have a matrix that tells me what, how the oriented matrix. So I'll give you an example. Here, this is the matrix. This is the matrix plus and minus everywhere. The union is like I put together the rows. The rows are the carot of each of the rank one matrix. So you just put it together and that'll give you a matrix. The rank is the number of rows, the elements, the number of columns. And what I claim is that all that I need to know about this metric, I can read it from there. From there, nothing else. So let's do it. First, how the reorientations look like is a matter, right? So I have the orientations. How do they look? Well, very easy. The matrix? This example is in dimension three. What's on the slide right now? This is dimension three, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Run four dimension three. Yes. Say you want to reorient element six. Well, the only you have to do is take the column six and swap all the signs. Plus is minus, minus is plus. And that's it. You swap all the signs and you have your orientation in six. We can prove that this is real orientation. If I take the carotop of this with the formula I showed you before. With the formula I showed you before, well, like give me the character of this actually. Very easy. So, reorientation is just the same change design of each colour. Now, I know that the union of uniform matrix is uniform. Ordinary result. So all these matrices are uniform. I know that this matrix comes from a cooperation of points because they are realizable. So every time I give a matrix like this, So every time I give a matrix like this, it's because behind there is a configuration of points which are in general position, because it's uniform. Right? Okay. Now, given the matrix, I would like to know how I can detect two things, acyclic reorientations and interior elements. That's what I'm looking for, right? For studying this Maconi program. Restoring this MacBook program. Well, in order to do this, I need to define these two travels, which are very easy to define. The top travel, it's a travel that starts on the left upper corner, and it makes a movement horizontal and vertical. So this is the first movement. Say I take from the first, from the corner to the right, and if the sign is different, then I go down. Sign is different, then I go down. If the sign is the same, I stay in the same row and I start again and from here to here. So I move to left, signs are different, then I go down here to here, signs are the same. So I stay in the same row, the same row in the same row, same row. And that's it. That's a travel that I designed like this. It's a little chitty, but that's the way it works. And then for the button travel, And then for the button travel, I do the exactly the same, but instead of starting over there, I start here and I move over here, over here, and I go up whenever the signs change, then I go up. So I define two travels here. Well, with these two very naive travels, we can detect whether the matroid is acyclic. I put it over here. If my top travel, I'm going to have a look at the top travel and see if I can get the last column. And that's what I'm interested, getting with this rule, the last column. You may realize that I can make my travel and here it must. Oh, I cannot do it. But it must go down. Oh, I cannot do it. But it must go down actually, right? I may have, I may be in the last, in the last row, I make a change of signs and they go out. So I might not go all the way through to the last column. That's one thing. Another thing, I'm going to have a look. I fix the column C and have a look how the top and bottom trials look like. And what I say here is they look like this, like they're parallel. Like parallel in that column, either in this row on the second row, or in the row below, or in the same row, like this. That's it. With that, I can detect, and we can prove that this matrix is acyclic if and only if the travel arrives at the last column, which is amazing, right? Just playing with travels. And I can detect if one element is interior if and only. Interior, if and only if the corresponding column is parallel. So, in our example here, you see that our top triangle gets there, so it is acyclic. And here, this is parallel here, here, and here. So, these elements here are interior elements. So, now with this metrics and with this. And with these travels, we can play around and try to find a good matrix to get an upper bound for Mac model's problem. So I want to construct a matrix in which for every orientation, the path gets to the last column. To the last column, and when I take the bottom, the button travel, there are not least one interior element, right? Because it's an upper bound. Ask for when there is no signal orientation sending to the points of a complex potential. So, if I want an upper bound, I need to give an example in which we never get this. Whatever your projective transformation is, you always have one into. Is you always have one interior element. So let me give you the for this. This is the very last picture here. You have your table, your matrix, sorry. You're going to form a chessboard in which each corner is one of your signs. And then, I don't know if you can see, but there are some blacks and whites you cannot see for each square. You cannot see for each square. You look for the you multiply the sign, and if it is even, then it is black, if it is odd, then it is white. So you color your board. Yeah, it's a shame, I cannot see it. And then in order to give this upper bound, well, I need one of these matrix in which every orientation is a cyclin. There is at least one interior element in every orientation. The matrix that we need. And the matrix that we need comes from this. You see, you have two blacks here: three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three. That's the two-thirds more or less that appears here. So any matrix that gives this board here will work. There are not acyclic orientations there without interior elements. There is at least one interior. Good. Okay. Okay. So this notion of time is 10. No, no, but I have lots of things to say. So, okay, so this is one version, which is the naval version of this MacMullian problem. So we have a naval poly. So we have a neighborhood polytope. And now, instead of asking whether there is a projected transformation sending to any convex hole or to a polytope, we want to send these points to the vertices of a k-neighboring polytope. So now we need this D and this K, K is the K-neighboring, and I want to know whether I am allowed, I'm able to send, to find these predicted transformations to send to K-neighbor the polytons. To canabo hip polytons. Well, in 2014, Garcia Collins has proved this couple of this lower bound, this upper bound. This is another version that we actually may use. Okay, good. Now, in the recent last year, or last years, we've been interesting. We've been interesting in this function here, which is actually the reason of the title, right? So, what I want is you give me a set X of points. I'm going to apply all possible permissible predictive transformations. I take the convis hole here and I count the k-faces. And what I want is to take the minimum among all these Macs in which the minimum runs for all the configurations with exactly endpoints. Right? And we are interested in this here, this fellow. In order to study this, we may consider this generalization of Generalization of Machmullen, in which it's essentially the same as Machmullen, but now we are allowed to have a certain number of points in the theater of the complex hole, right? So you have your points, you apply your project transformation, and now you're allowed to have one or two up to T points in the interior of the compass hole here. Right? Magmolet, when T equals zero is Magmoleon, actually, right? Right? Well, there is not. But now you're allowed. So you're a little more flexibility. And it turns out that there is a connection between this definition and definition of H of zero. So it's the mean of the max for n given points, the number of vertices you can have after you predict the transformation. So actually, in order to study this, We may study this here. But then, if I want to study this, if I want to give upper bounds, I may use oriented matrix, right? Just as I did before. By using oriented matrix, I play around. It's exactly the same way. I take my Lorentz oriented matrix and take my matrix and then prove that orientations. But now I am allowed to have a certain number of interior elements. With this, we can. With this, we can give some upper bounds. Yes, these are all exactly the same proof as for my model, but at least it's a little more delicate. The counting is a little more like. Okay. You may ask why we were interested in zero here, why not in k? Well, first thing is that for this connection in That for this connection for Magmoleon, natural way to see is this zero. But it turns out that this zero, this H0, is very useful in order to study HK for any k because we can give an upper bound of HK if I know how what the value of H0 is, right? Because I have the H0s and I can take Break's transformation, I know that I have certain numbers. Transformation: I know that I have a certain number of points, then I know that this may have the cyclic polytop, and if this is a cyclic, that's the maximum number of k-faces, and that gives me this operator. So that's the fair reason why we study H0, because we can have more or less, not very good, but at least we have some operations. Are we going to use this? Okay. Okay, second thing is the connection with random partitions. Random partitions, projected transformations with random partitions. Take a set of points, X, you have a partition, A and B, and you define Rx of A and B as the number of deep positive elements such that the convex hole of the That the convex hole of the elements which are in A, the convex hole of the elements which are in B are not empty. That's a random partition, right? And it's minimal because it's D plus 2. Okay? Well. And I'm going to do exactly the same as before. Given the set X, I'm going to take the max among all possible partitions, A and B, and then I'm going to take the mean. And then I'm going to take the mean among all the confidential points with exactly n element. And that's our ND. So I would like to know the value for this fellow here. There you go. It's a little bit surprising, but in fact, compute this value here. Is actually compute the value of H. And you see his D prime minus one, and this is dimension D prime. So here we are counting the facets. When you take the projective transformation, instead of counting all k-faces, you take the facets. So counting the facets in the projective transformations comes down to counting the random partition this way. And this is a little bit. This is a little bit surprising. The way we did is by using Gale diagrams. Now, I can tell you more if you like me to say, I can tell you more. It's just Gale diagrams this year. So, if I want upper bounds for this fellow and the upper bounds for this fellow, but I know how to calculate upper bounds for this fellow because I know. Upper bounds for this fellow because I know H0, right? That's what we just mentioned before. There you go. That's some upper bounds that we were able to do for dimension two. There you go. It's not very good, not very nice. We don't know the exact value of this. Rn2. I don't know. I don't prevent it there. We try for D equals three. Well, for D tree, we Well, for DTRS3, we have a few resources, for instance, this. But even for this, right? Three dimensions, nine points, we don't know the exact value is. That's the question. We know it's 17 and 27, but we don't know exactly what it is. Okay, so that's another reason we still are studying this function of h. Now let me give you another reason. Another reason. And this is a question due to Pach and Stegeri in 2003. Actually, here we're asking whether we have points in the plane and you want to color it in order to maximize the number of random partitions. Essentially, that's what we are looking for, right? But the interesting fact for us is this here. You say, prove that whenever you have a situation in which you attain the maximum, then it's because the red and blue points are roughly the same. You cannot have lots of reds and few if you want to attain the maximum. Well, we were not able to prove this, but we have some positive results and prove that for dimension. Prove that for dimension two, if you have at least eight points, and you see here it says that the partitions attain them, the partition, this partition attains the maximum, our x, then the number of points is no more than our two plus two. It is not really, but it's not that bad, right? And again, it's scale diagrams. Another application, tolerance. This is a very classical question about random partitions, random partitions with tolerance, right? So you are looking for a number of points and would you have a partition A and B, but not only partition A and B, but subset P in such a way that In such a way that whenever you delete an element belonging to P, here, belongs to this set P that you find. You still have an intersection or not. So you know by random partition of certain number of elements, you also have the intersection is not empty, but now you're allowed to say, well, what about if I take one point of wow? Take one point of, well, you're allowed. If you take one point, you still have a partition. Another exactly the problem: whether we can find this subset P of this cardinality in order to be able to lift to delete points and still having random partitions. Well, we have a connection. We have this kind of result that says. have this kind of result that says that our function n which is the generalized math model problem can be put it in terms of this lambda there with these parameters and on the contrary on the yeah on the other direction this lambda depends on our function n right so this n at the beginning might might be probably salary Maybe it's probably a little bit artificial because why we want to know if it is one point or two points inside? No, it is not really artificial, it's because of all this, right? With t equals zero here, it's a result due to Larman. Larman has owned this. And that's why we pick up this idea and say, well, what about we put this t and we actually don't know, work with this t, no, only with t equals zero. Finally, what about sales in arrangements? You know, once you have arrangements, once you have your arrangements, people have been looking for the combinatorics of arrangements. So, for instance, if you take an arrangement here, We say that actually the arrangement is relizable. That means that actually the matter is relizable if these are not really pseudospheres, are really spheres, are really upper planes, right? So let me do once here. There you go. There you go. So I have five elements here, or plus this fellow here, that's five. And people looking for the size of these cells. For instance, a big question that we don't know, a very big question, it's a Rudnev conjecture that says that any arrangement of upper planes. of apoplex contain no more contains rich cells complete cells no more than the cyclic polytope that the arrangement that we obtained about the cyclic polytope you take the cyclic polytope you obtain about the duality you obtain a cyclic arrangement if you count the rich cells the complete cells this is the best you can do that's conjecture and we cannot prove it That's a conjecture, and we cannot prove it. Another conjecture is Michel Asverna's conjecture, says any arrangement has at least one simplex, at least one triangle or tetrahill, that depends on your dimension, right? But at least one. Beautiful conjecture, right? So here we have this. There you go. Michel says any arrangement will have one. Have one. So, people started studying this, right? So, here we are interested in this kind of question. What about simple arrangements? Now, simple means that actually the matter is uniform, in which the cell is at most certain size. Probably no complete cells, but at most something. Or what about arrangements that contains at least one cell of certain size? One cells of certain size. Well, playing around with this, with this connection between mattress and arrangement, we have this kind of results. The first is not that it's quite straightforward. The second needs a little bit more thought. Say that for any arrangement with seven lines. No, sorry, we are in dimension three. Any arrangement within Any arrangement with seven upper planes, uh, we can construct arrangements without such that every cell is a not seven. And it's not easy because you have to construct it. You say, well, one is here, another, another, but then you have to take care how you cut because you may create cells, and these cells might be bigger than seven, right? Well, larger than seven. So we don't want that. It is tricky, very, very tricky. Tricky, very, very tricky. Uh, so let me finish with this question that said, Well, is it true that any simple arrangement contains a list, sorry, any simple arrangement with this number of elements contains a cell so size at least 2d plus one. And is it true that on the contrary, if you give an arrangement with 2d plus one, then there is an arrangement that Arrangement that every cell is a size at most this number here. We believe that the answer is yes, right? And you may ask, why 2D plus 1? Why do we put 2D plus 1 there? Because that's Larman, right? Larman said that the minimum for the conjecture of Magmollian problem is 2D plus 1. Well, here's One. Well, here's how we believe it is the same. We believe it's the same. Okay. Thank you very much. Any questions for Morgan? So for the McMullen problem, if you use Lawrence-oriented microids, is the bound of QG plus sealing of the. 2G plus C L N of G over 2 the best possible, or assuming they are better or just in Laura By using Lorentz, I have never get lower than that. Yes, unfortunately, yes, yes, but that's a way to show that oriented matrix is good, right? Because these geometric problems related to combinatories are just in just oriented matrix, right? When you have this representation on this table by plus and the union of one average, yes. Is it about just to make a cyclic movement in one row? Now that's a very good question. If you recall, I put it here. It's an order to take in account. This, yes. Yes, yes. There is another, and this, if you make this movement, then you change your order. There you go. There's another here. Because when you take the union, this order is very important. If you change the order, say, well, now here you have one order, and then here you change the one is two, the two is one, then the union is going to give different things that if. Different things that if one is one and two is you have to you have to keep the same model yeah and the other has to be yes yes that's right yes so you said that all these Lorentz oriented matrix are realizable yes is there some geometric interpretation of when a point comes from a Lorentz orienter I don't know I don't know Uh that's a good question, right? Because it's interesting, right? Say, well, how do they do like? How do they look like? Yeah, that's very interesting. We know there is relaxable because the union of oriented matrix, the union of relaxable matrix, or the intent matrix is relaxable. That's it. But now if we want to interpret how they do, like we haven't. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's yeah. It's very difficult. Once we have Difficult once we had this table that gives you the upper bound, once I was asked how the points look like, which is more or less that you're asking there. I don't know. I don't know. I got a question What is the role of the rank in the Fortman and Lower Island? Well, the rank is, I put in there. Rank is, I put in there, is the dimension plus one. You have a metric, you have a rank, and then you are going to construct your representation, but you need to know where your sphere is living, right? The dimension of the sphere. So if you matter this rank, rank R here, the topological representation, it's, yeah, I put it on this way. Yeah, I put it on this way. This is D, and this is D plus occur. That's the connection.
