Hi, welcome to the next one. So much to learn from the other participants, so I'm very excited and happy to be here. So I'm going to talk about some work on PDEs, about the effects of repelling chemotaxes on propagation. So this is based on joint work with Quentin Griette and Chris Henderson. Quentin Griette and Chris Henderson. So I'm going to start by with an introduction. I'll show you this Fischer KPT equation with chemotaxis that forms, that's the PDE we work on and tell you about our goals. And we'll see that the effect of chemotoxis in this equation is determined by two regimes. One is a porous media, one yields a porous media tiny. One yields a porous media type equation, and the second regime yields a hyperbolic type equation. And so I hope to show you how these regimes are kinetically and how we get our results from them. Okay, so to say briefly, chemotaxis is when some when there's a chemical that individuals can sense and they move. Can sense and they move towards either higher or lower concentrations of the chemical. So I think this is a picture of bacteria that causes dysentery. So not something I want to encounter. But this is one species that exhibits chemotaxis. And in particular, repelling chemotaxis. So the individuals release. Individuals release some chemical that makes other individuals not want to be near them. And I suppose the intuition differs if individuals are dispersing, and also I like to think of them as maybe smelly, so other individuals don't want to be near them, then somehow the dispersion should be faster. So our goal is to study this using the following PDE model. Following PDE model. So, this is the Fisher-KPP equation with chemotaxis. And let me plan Y. So, u of XT represents the population, V of XT represents the chemical, and chi, which for this talk, I'll just, since the focus is on repelling hemotoxes, I'll just always, for this talk, have it be in a parameter in minus infinity to zero. That's the strength of the repelling hemotoxes. Of the repelling hemotoxes. So individuals don't like each other. And so we notice that if, okay, so sigma is the length scale of the king of taxes. And we notice that if chi is 0, this is exactly the Fisher-KPP equation. Great. Indeed, we have this. Indeed, we have this on the left-hand side. We have our UT minus UXX, our diffusion, and the logistic growth term on the right. And the second equation tells us how the chemical is related to the population. And zero instead of the logistic growth term, would give the Keller-Sequel equation in 1970, which was introduced model. Introduced to model chemotaxis in populations. And this particular equation, one, was introduced by Tello and Winkler in 2007 for a bounded domain, and Nadin, Fertam, and Rijik in 2008 for unbounded domains. And as I said, our goal is to study the effect of repelling hemotoxis on propagation. And in particular, what we want to do is we want to What we want to do is we want to take chi to be very, very negative. So very strong repelling chemotaxes. And we're going to do this in the context of traveling wave solutions to that equation. So suppose we have traveling wave solutions of speed c, in other words, guys solutions u of xt of the form u twiddle of x minus ct, similar for me, and that are 1 at minus infinity. are 1 and minus infinity, 0 plus infinity, and c is positive as a traveling wave speed. We want to know how is this c affected by coming. So for the Fisher-KVP equation, which corresponds to no chemotaxis, the minimal speed of traveling wave solutions is two. And as I said, the heuristic is that their negative chemotaxis should increase propagation speed. Propagation speed. And I just want to mention that there's been lots of work on propagation speed up by external advection, like turbulent combustion. But in our model, the model that we study, I should say, the advection depends non-locally on U itself. So let me say a bit about previous results towards our goal. So, Hamel and Henderson showed that. Henderson showed that one has traveling wave solutions, so the equation we're interested in. And moreover, any traveling wave solution has to have speed at least two. And so this was recently extended to all of chi and R by Henderson and Chris. But I put that in gray since that's, I think, the only time in the talk that I talk about chi not being negative. Not being negative. And also in 2022, Henderson showed that for chemotaxis negative but small, either there exists a traveling wave solution with speed 2, or there is a traveling wave solution with speed around 2. And that just depends on the relation between chi and the length, between the strength of the hemoptaxis and the length scale. The hemotoxis and the length scale. Mainly, the upshot is: so if the strength and the length scale are both small, the traveling wave speed is unchanged or approximately unchanged. And then also Henderson showed that there is a regime when chi is very negative and big, but the length scale is even bigger, then there's a traveling wave solution of speed c that can be very big. That can be very big. So that's the first instance of speed up for this model. So we want to complete the picture by studying large chi, I guess, outside of this regime. So let me show you. So as I mentioned in the introduction, we will see two regimes arise. And to see them, we do the following rescaling. Rescaling. So we now switch instead of using capital letters, we use little letters and we replace x by x radical absolute valuable time. And appropriately rescaling the speed and the length scale, which are now little c and mu, yield the following system. So minus cux. So minus Cux, then the chemotaxis term, then the diffusion term, minus Uxx. And now I notice that I can, now I have a guess what's going to happen when chi gets really big. I should expect that diffusion start to go away. But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. And again, I'm looking at traveling wave solutions. And similarly, like I'm And similarly, like I'm going to talk about stuff converging, like sub-sequences or whatever converging. So just to make it easy, I'm going to assume always u of 0 equals 1 half. So I don't have stuff shifting around too much. Okay, so let's look at this rescaled traveling wave equation again. So what are the two regimes that I expect? Well, first, if this coefficient 1 over absolute chi, 1 over absolute chi goes to 0, and mu goes to 0, so the length scale goes to 0 as well. That's one regime. But I expect that something different is going to happen if 1 over chi goes to 0, but mu in the second equation doesn't go to 0. So in other words, I'm just going to say in the second equation. I'm just gonna say in the second regime mu is just fixed. Okay? Although we just say mu goes to some mu bar that's positive, but we'll just say for this talk that mu is fixed. So let's see what we expect to happen in each of these regimes. Okay, so let's look at the first one where the rescale length scale mu is going to zero. So suppose that my So suppose that my u, v, and c go to some u bar, v bar, c bar. So the second equation suggests that u bar should equal v bar because mu is going to zero. So then what do I expect in the limit? Well, the uxx term disappears, and then the chemotoxis term, the vxu, becomes uxu. Becomes uxu, which by, I guess, doing differentiating, tells me that that chemotaxis term actually, in the limit, becomes a diffusion term, but a diffusion term of porous medium type. And indeed, we prove that solutions of the traveling wave equation converge in this regime to solutions. In this regime, to solutions of this porous media type equation. And the challenge is that solutions to the traveling wave equation, they lose, so where does regularity for traveling, for this top equation come from? Well, from the diffusion term, uxx, whose coefficient is going to 0, or from 0 Is going to zero, or from the second diffusion term, whose coefficient is also going to zero. So to get this convergence, we actually obtain an energy estimate for solutions of the top equation that's uniform in mu and in chi. And how, so I left a sketch it for you. I'd love to sketch it for you another time, but I'm not going to do that in this talk. In fact, the regularity comes from the chemotaxis term. And the main idea is that, well, in the limit, that chemotaxis term turns into a diffusion term. So somehow we should be able to capture that and use that. So let me say now how what we find about the traveling wave speeds in this regime one. So this is the porous medium type equation that we show solutions converge to. So Errolton in 1980 showed that this guy has traveling wave solutions if and only if C bar, so if the speed is greater than or equal to 1 over speed is greater than or equal to 1 over radical 2. And moreover, the minimal, so the thing labeled as B kind of looks like the Fisher-KPP traveling wave. And that's what traveling waves to P and E look like for speeds bigger than the minimal speed. However, the there's a unique minimal speed traveling wave and it's sharp. speed traveling wave and it's sharp. It looks like A. So it has compact support. So it's a cool thing that I'll mention again at the very end of the talk. So let's remember that. Okay, so what does this tell us in our, how does this help us with our goal? Well, let's recall that c was the traveling wave speed before we scaling. So what do we deduce? Well, 1 over radical 2 is less than or equal to c bar. Was less than or equal to C bar by this result of Aronson. And C bar, that was less than or equal to the limit of C's of all the rescale speeds in our regime. And to get the second equality, I just use the, I, you know, undo the rescaling to get back my original state. And this gives us a lower bound. A lower bound of sorts on the dependence of our original speed c on chi. So here quickly I'll say if chi is very, very negative, the propagation speed in the unscaled problem is about a size root chi. So this confirms our intuition that the repelling chemo. Repelling hemotoxes should enhance the propagation. And just to say, we also prove a matching asymptotic lower bound on the minimal speed. Okay, so now let me talk about regime two. So remember regime two, we're taking the one over chi to zero, and we're taking the new fixed. So in this case, let's say u, v, and c go to some u twiddle, u twiddle, and z twiddle. Well, this case it's maybe a bit easier even just to guess what to expect because we just, you know, forget about the uxx term. And we get this hyperbolic time problem, which is pretty new. So we again we show the solutions of the traveling wave problem. Solutions of the traveling wave problem, the original one, converged to this hyperbolic eye. And so in the regime one, it was all, you know, it converged, solutions converged to an equation that was already studied and the properties of traveling waves were known. Here we do that. So we show that there exists some C twiddle star that's positive. Positive such that solutions to this limiting problem exist only for speeds greater than or equal to c stop. Okay, so we show that there is some positive minimal speed. And so as before, we deduce that for chi very negative, so for very large repelling chemotaxes, the propagation speed in the unscale problem is. Speed in the unscale problem is about a root chi. And we also prove a matching asymptotic lower bound on the minimal speed. And the key to sort of both of those results is understanding the structure of solutions to the limiting problem. So for however much time I have left, I'm going to tell you about that. Three minutes left, okay. Three minutes left. Okay. So there is our limiting problem in regime two. And notice that if I do calculus, like if I do product rule to the chemotensis term, and then when I have a vxx, I plug in the second equation. I just write it all as one equation. And there it is. And when I look at it, what is it? When I look at it, what does that mean? Well, if this term here is non-zero, then u twiddle satisfies a nice OD. So the thing that I want to consider are the zeros of this quantity. And I call that, or we call that z twiddle, that's our bad set. And we And we show that if I have a solution of this problem and a non-constant solution with positive speed, oh sorry, and with, sorry, if I have a solution of this problem, then the speed is positive. And, and this is the key point, there's, I could tell you very well what Z looks like, the bad set. Well, one. Well, one possibility is that it's empty, in which case U solve this ODE on all R. Or the bound set has only one point. And U has a jump discontinuity at that point. I can tell you how big the jump is, and it jumps from some positive value to zero. So since I So since I have very, I don't have much time left, I think I'm not gonna tell you, so you can ask me later, about how we show that cool result. It's by looking very carefully at the relevant equation and various ODE type questions. So let me finish with the following. So you might have this natural question. So, you might have this natural question. There are these two regimes. One of them, so sorry, in the first line, I put the second equation minus nu vxx is u minus uv in the same line, but okay. So the first equation is the hyperbolic one, and the second one is the force medium one. And so formally, if I just take nu equals zero in the first one, I get the second one. So I wonder, do solutions. So I wonder, do solutions of the first one converge as mu goes to 0 to the second one? So we construct a family of solutions to the first equation, to the hyperbolic one, such that 0 is in the bad set of each of them. And hence, u has a jump discontinuity at 0. That was sort of the second alternative. That was sort of the second alternative in the structure of the bath set. Such that as mu goes to 0, as the length scale goes to 0, the speed goes to 1 over radical 2, and u goes to u bar locally uniformly, where u bar is the unique minimal speed traveling wave solution to the porous medium type equation. So, in other words, we don't So in other words, we don't say anything in general about this limit, but we do construct some solutions to the top equation that as mu go to 0 converge to the bottom one. And the cool thing is, I believe the reason that we know that c nu goes to 1 over radical 2 is that we can, is because u nu has is because u knu had to jump, we deduced that the limiting u looks like this. So this picture should look just like the one from a few slides ago when I showed the results errors. So I think that that nicely connects the results. And just to mention this, this yields one of those matching lower bounds that I told you about. Okay, that was all. Thank you. Nice part. Any questions? Tom? Yeah. So I love this kind of analysis, really nice. So a detailed question though. Do you have these convergences? So in which sense is the convergence? And part two, you would use the compactness results. So what compactness result do you use? So for the second regime? Both. Okay, so for the first one, we prove, so I mentioned. So I mentioned we proved some uniform estimate. It bounds the derivative of v uniformly. And that somehow gives us enough compactness to proceed. So for these sub-spaces, I guess? Yeah, so I don't, to tell you the truth, I now don't remember exactly what space the current is. Yes. And for the second one, The second one, I think we rely a lot on what I was saying about the structure of the limiting problem. I think that, for example, in the first regime, the limiting guy solves the nice OD on the whole domain. And I think we can say something about the original guys too. Um but I'd I'd have to refute that. So I approach you again later, maybe because Yes, please, I'd be happy to to tell you more. Happy to tell you more. Do you lose something in the limiting process? You lose some regularity. In the second regime, yes. So because in the first regime, you're again converging to you're converging to a porous medium type equation, which also has some nice regularity properties. Maybe you lose some, but you still have a diffusive equation. diffusive equation so I think so Vlançon and Rashidi I think both had both had their hands up so we're sort of veering into coffee territory so do you mind if I postpone you for coffee okay so let's do okay thank you very much really about monotonicity with respect to parameters of the speed you have in each side and in particular maybe the last piece of analysis If the mu is varying from uh positive to zero, can you say that the speed is uh is decreasing or increasing to uh one over root two? Or is there just no information about the I don't remember if we know that. Did you? I don't think so. I think we can't prove anything. The problem is that you have no sort of comparison or something, so things you might want to do with like, you know, take two traveling waves with the comparameter and touch them, blah blah blah, you can't do it all. You can't do it all. I don't know. Okay, so let's thank Holgo one more time. Enjoy some coffee.
