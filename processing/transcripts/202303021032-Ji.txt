So today I'm going to be talking about something which is definitely not over-the-compost summer, so very different from the previous talks. So most of this talk is going to be joint work with Sarah Fry, Somia Shankar, Bianca Vryn, Isvovo, which I'll denote FGSV. And then some of the results are going to be doing with my REU student or my undergraduate student from the summer, Maddie G. Okay, so this is sort of the plan for the talk. I'll start with the intro, then maybe review things about intermediate co-pans and rationality of conic bundles over algebraic and co-sponsors. Those over algebraic coast fields, then say something about what these intermediate Jacobian torsions are, and then give applications rationalities of these consequences over non-cos fields. And then maybe at the end, if there's time, I'll say some things about the proof. Okay, but so maybe just to start off, k is going to be a field. Whenever the conic bundles are mentioned, the characteristic is not equal to 2. So we just have any smooth projective variety. Over k, one question you can ask is: when is x k rational? So here, k rational means irrational to projective space over the ground field k. So it's a different sense of k rational than we talk earlier this week. And so when the field is understood, I'll drop the k and just say rational. So maybe. So first there. So, first there are two educatory conditions. So, the first one is that if x is rational over the grand field K, then it has to be geometrically rational, which means that its base change to the algebraic closure is rational over the algebraic closure. And then a second condition is the lane. The second condition is the Leynes-Germer lemma that says that if x is rational over k, then it has a k point. So then maybe the first question we can start off asking is if one plus two fold is xk rational. So, this question is completely understood in low dimensions. So, in the case of dimension of x equals 1, the answer is yes, because if x is geometrically rational, then you can embed it as a conic using the anti-canonical in your system. And if you have a rational point, then it gives you a rationality construction just by projecting from the point on the plane. So, in dimension one, this is completely understood. Understood. However, in dimension two, this stops being true, but still the picture is completely understood. And what happens is you need to consider the action of the Dalois group on the geometric Picard group. So you need to understand the action of GK on pick of XKR. So maybe a sample statement is, for example, if X is final, so if X is a dal Petro surface, so if the degree of X, so X minus KX squared is greater than or equal to 5, then Then conditions one and two imply rationality. But if degree of x is less than or equal to four, you basically have to understand delta equivariant blowdowns of geometric. Variant logons of geometric minus one curves. So the picture is more complicated, but it's still completely understood. And maybe the takeaway is that in higher dimensions, you need more conditions than just having a rational point. So today we're going to be interested in the case of dimension 3. And so maybe the first starting point is a theorem which is Due to hasset and jinkle over R. I think this is in 21. And this is due to Ben Juan Lutenberg over arbitrary fields. Oh, and at any point, if my handwriting is too small, feel free to tell me to write larger. A bit larger. And so. Okay. Okay, thank you. Okay, is this? Okay, well. Does this matter? Yes, I feel. Yes. Yeah, so their theorem is that if Z is a complete intersection of two projects inside P5 over any field, then Z is irrational if and only if Z contains a line. Align design over k. So the backward direction is sort of classical. As soon as you have a line, you can project from a line. That gives you rationality construction. And so the part that they proved is the forward direction, which I'll say a little bit more about later in the talk. And so maybe you can notice that this is a final threefold of geometric card rank one. Metric record rank one. And so, more generally, subsequently, Kuzusava and Kokurov answered this question for all final threefolds of geometric primary 1 in character C0 So they characterized rationality I think my hand writing is shrinking, so current reader with a card rate with geometric card rate one. And so maybe I'll just write, I won't write the complete statement, but just to give you an idea. So they showed that if in the case of the conviction petzo, then This is rational. They also show some if it's a if xk bar is p3, quadric, x12, or x22, then having a k point implies rationality. And maybe third case, they show that if x k bar is Kbar is, so this V4 is an intersection of two quadratics, x16 or x18, then x is rational over k if and only if it has a key point and some certain Hilbert scheme of rational curves on Of rational curves on the threefold paths of one. So maybe, yeah, so this is just on the list of the possibilities for what happens next to the base change of our K-bar. So this condition is sort of a generalization of this condition for containing a line. Okay, so. Is it profile or cook? Sorry? Profile. Everything is smooth and projected. The main top. Everything is smooth and projected. The main top is profof. Sorry, yes, thank you. Sorry. Sorry. Yes, sorry, thank you. Okay. So today the case that I want to focus on is the case of this is also not good. So I want to focus. So I want to focus on the case of higher carbon. And so I should also mention that they have a subsequent paper where they deal with the case of higher geometric recovery, where it still is recarding one over the black field. Today we'll focus on the case of row equals two. And so there's going to be a specific family. A specific family that we focus on. So on pornography, this is family 218. And so what this is, so this is going to, so every time I use this family, I'll use the letter Y instead of X. So this is going to be a double cover, bucky one cross P2, branch along activity divisor. And so this family is interesting because it has a lot of structure. So if you look at the first projection to P1, this is going to be a quadric surface bundle. And the second projection to P2 is going to be a Be a conqu bundle. Okay, and so then maybe one first thing to notice is that over an algebraically closed field, this is rational because by Sense theorem, this quadric surface language will emit a section and that gives you a rationality construction because a quadrat with the point is rational. So pi one has a section. But it turns out this section may or may not descend to non-closed field. Okay, and so I want to stay a theorem, so but first I'll have to introduce some notation. So maybe I'll just have an aside on conic bundles in general. So this conic bundle is, at least over a surface, is going to be a bundle of conics. So over a general point, you're going to have these nice smooth conics, and then there's going to be some divisor in the base. Be some divisor in the base where that parametrizes this medial conics. So, the notation that I'm going to use throughout the talk is that this discriminant curve is going to be denoted delta. And then also over each point in delta, as long as we assume delta is smooth, there's going to be two components of each fiber. And so there's going to be a double cover, which I'll denote delta tilde, which provides. I'll denote delta tilde, which parametrizes the components of the stingular filters. And then maybe just some technical assumptions. We're going to assume that all conic bundles, so today I'll just be talking about conic bundles over P2. We're going to assume that there's something which is geometrically standard, which means just that the total space is smooth and the geometric Picard rank is 1. So just this is just saying that it's minimal in some sense. And then we'll also assume that these curves, delta and delta tilde, are smooth and geometrically irreducible. Okay. So, with this notation, I want to also recall a sort of classical result of Zoefin. So then so um so it turns out that in this case, um y is a conic bundle with discriminant curve of degree four. So this is a cortic. So it's a classical result of Zuyman, I think from 1874, that there are six isotopy, real isotopy classes. Oh, smooth plane for it. Oh, smooth plain coin is. So what these are is so the possibilities are that either it can have no real points. If I'll use the color to, so this oval doesn't look like a zero. Or it can be sort of one oval. It can be two nested ovals, so one oval inside the other, two non-naves. Oval inside the other, two non-nested ovals, three ovals, or four ovals. And so, sorry, see, these are possibilities, and Klein actually showed that if you take the moduli space of smooth cortex, these correspond to the components. And so then. Yeah, sorry, yeah, the real connected components of the real locus. Yeah, the smooth board message. Thank you. Okay, so yeah. Okay, so the first thing I wanted to say is that if y is one of these over r, and we assume that this is not one oval, so in all cases except for the one oval case, then y is rational if and only if the quadric surface bundle has a section over r. Okay, so this theorem is due to, so first Maddie and I showed this for the isotopy classes, and then we showed this for the case of two nestling rules. So a section is some type of curve, so maybe the statement of this looks kind of similar to The statement of this looks kind of similar to the other two cases in the Parbreak 1 case on the other board. So maybe I want to give a different characterization of these. So it turns out, they show that this is rational if and only if this so-called intermediate Jacobian torso obstruction vanishes. So I'll say what this intermediate Jacobian torsions are later in the talk. And so Kunjasama Tropov showed that. So consistent program showed that in all cases it's rational if and only if and the IgT abstraction vanishes. But then in our case for this double cover of P1 cross P2, it turns out that in all cases we have rationality if and only if the IJT obstruction J2 obstruction vanishes. And you have this additional condition that the real points not only have to be non-empty, but this has to be connected. So this is another obstruction to rationality overall. In general, if you have a smooth projective rational variety over R, the real points have to be connected. So, yeah, and so sort of the upshot of this talk. Yeah, and so sort of the upshot of this talk is going to be that in the Picard break one case, this torso abstraction characterizes rationality, but this fails for these class of conduct levels. Okay, so that was my introduction. So I'll start racing. Okay, so next I'm going to um try to give some background about Trying to give some background about intermediate Jacobians and connoisseurs over algebraic fields. Okay. So second section, intermediate Jacobians and conduct fields. Okay, so here X is going to be a smooth projective threefold and assume that it's rationally connected. At least over k bar. So then there's the intermediate Jacobian of X is some parentsly polarized abelian variety parametrizing curved classes. In the following sense, that the Abu-Jacobi map from the codimension two cycles, so this upper zero So, this upper zero denotes algebraically trivial. This is isomorphic to the geometric points. And maybe most people are most familiar with this over C, but in fact, it exists in more generality. So this exists over perfect fields. So this was shown here by Clemens griffins over C by By Murr over algebraic glucose fields, and by Asher Casalina Martan and Diol over Irvin fields. And then recently, Benoit-Winberg showed that it exists over any field if the variety of the three field is geometrically rational. And so, this is an obstruction to rationality. I guess this was first noticed by Cummings and Duffets. So, maybe just to remind everybody of the obstruction. So the theorem is that if X is rational, then its intermediate Jacobian is isomorphic to a product of Jacobians. To a product of Jacobians of curves as Principal Debian values. And maybe sort of one heuristic idea why this is true is that there's this gold formula for child groups. So if you blow up a threefold along a curve, you introduce a copy of pick inside the child group of the blow up. And so then if you have a rational threefold, you can sort of factor this by rational map to p3. Okay. And so maybe first, right, so this was. So, this was maybe the first thing that was by Clemens and Griffiths for cubic three-folds. And so, the connection with conic bundles is that it turns out that the log of a cubic three-fold along a line, this is a conic bundle, with the degree of the discomfort is equal to five. And so then it turns out that intermediate Jacobians over algebraic Gucci's fields are very useful for. Fields are very useful for understanding rationality of conjugate models. So, this is you to Pisasti, Turin, sorry, just getting the names, Lassi Wiki, Connen, and Boville. So it turns out that over an algebraic E close field, if x2p2 is a standard conic bundle, then x is rational. Again, I'm just writing over k bar to emphasize it's over an algebraically closed field, if and only if the intermediate Jacobian torsor obstru or sorry, the intermediate Jacobian obstruction vanishes. Cobian instruction vanishes. And so, say this, and in fact, this is true over any minimal rational surface over C due to work of Chokarov. So, this is sort of the classical picture. And then, oh, wait, sorry, and then I should, okay, yeah, so I think, so there's actually a more concrete characterization of this. When this turns out to be true, if only if the degree of this. True, if only if the degree of the discriminant is less than or equal to 4, or degree is 5. And so this double cover comes from an even beta characteristic. Which turns out in the cubic pre-fold case, it comes from an odd beta characteristic. Okay, and so maybe I'll see here. And then, sort of, the other result I wanted to mention is that Bobil showed over algebraically closed fields that there's a very explicit way to understand what the intermediate Jacobian is. So, this is over in K bar. In the state notation, we show that the intermediate Jacobian is the prim variety of this double cover of the discriminant cover. Double cover of the discriminant cover. And so, what this is, this is if you take the kernel of the push forward of the Jacobians, and then you take the connected component of the identity. Okay, so these are just, so these are the statements over algebraically closed fields. So, we're interested in what happens over arbitrary fields. Okay, so maybe first, I'll note that if the degree of the discriminant curve is less than or equal to 3, and if the three-fold has a point, then x is rational. So this can be shown with a modification of Wiskowski's original arguments over Reagan-Cohesfield. So this case is understood. And it also turns out that if Understood, and it also turns out that if degree equals 4 and this discriminant double cover curve double tilde has a point, then x is rational. But in general, this discriminant general cover doesn't have a point. And so in order to study this, we sort of need a more refined obstruction, which is where this Obstruction, which is where this intermediate Euclidean force obstruction comes in. I'm going to erase this board and then say what this intermediate decoding towards our obstruction is. So, this is a fairly decent obstruction to rationality. So this is due to Haset and Schinkle over R and due to Ben Lauden Leinberg over arbitrary fields. Right, so okay, so recall that, um, okay. Recall that if x is rational, so again, this is going to be still threefold. And then this intermediate Jacobian is a product of Jacobians of curves. So roughly what this obstruction does is it generalizes it from the zero part to the torsor parts. Okay, so first I need to make some more definitions. So I guess. And so I guess in this section, I'll assume also that x is geometrically rational. And so what they noticed is that if you take any curve class, so Nancy Berry 2 is just going to denote curve classes, lot algebraically trivial curve classes. For trivial curve classes. So, what they noticed is that you can associate a torsor, which I'll denote Ij of x of upper gamma over the intermediate Jacobian. Okay, and so, right, so maybe on k-bar points, this is just going to be the coset inside the child group algebraically equivalent to this curve class. Curve class. And so, in fact, Benoit showed that you can put this together inside a group scheme, which they denote, which however 2x over k, whose components are just these torsors. And so then the obstruction to rationality, this is due to Hasachinko over R and Vinel-Wittenberg over K. Over k. Okay, so the classical obstruction says that if you're rational, then your Jacobian is a product of, Jacobian is a product of the Jacobians of the curves. So for simplicity, you can assume it's just one curve, or for the statement. So if x is rational, and the intermediate Jacobian is isomorphic, is just what, a single curve. Single curve, and just for the simplicity of the statement, we'll assume that the genus is at least two. There's also a statement for elliptic curves. Then not only do you get this isomorphism on zero parts, but they also showed that for any gauge invariant curve class gamma, there's going to be some I such that the intermediate covian torsor associated to gamma is isomorphic to Isomorphic to kick I on the same curve. And this isomorphism is as torsors over the intermediate curves. I'm not sure. Is this chair blocking? Okay. Okay. Okay, so hopefully, yeah, it's a lot of notation, but hopefully the statement is understandable. But hopefully the idea is there's this classical obstruction, which is just sort of about the zero part of the child group. And so they notice they can extend this to any curve class. Curve class. Okay, and so then their application was the I sort of predetermined. I mean, can you say what the I is? Which I? So in their theorem, they don't. I think in concrete examples, you can. But I don't think there's sort of like a general statement. So I think in. I think, yeah, I guess I think from my understanding for when in the cases where these intermediate Jacobian courses actually have some explicit map, so you can write it down. But I don't think there's a general signal. I mean, there is an Aval Jacobi map. So, and that should be, the image of the Aval Jacobi determines the component. Jacobi determines the component of the intermediate Jacobian, so to speak. If that makes sense, that's one way of saying. From the chow. So, whether or not you're rational, you can write down an obliging map that will descend. There can be different components of the intermediate. Of the intermediate Jacobian, so to speak. But maybe I'll just say something after. But I think you have to be able to explicitly say how that maps to the card scheme of this curve. Exactly. You don't know exactly which component you're going to add that. There could be different types of components. So maybe I'll just briefly say how they applied this. So this is the sort of the first year of the So, this is the sort of the first theorem that I wrote down on the board for threefolds. So, they applied this to intersections of two quadrants inside P5. So it turns out that this is sort of classically understood, that the intermediate Jacobian of this is the Jacobian of some genus II curve. And so, I guess genus II curves are nice because you don't have a lot of non-trivial torsors over paid. Tours is overpaid. In fact, you just have Jacobian Igna itself, which has a K-point, and then there's also Ignan. And so then in this case, it turns out that there's only one generator. So the linear answering group of curved classes, this is generated by the class of a line. And so they showed that there are sort of two, or there are four dimensions. Or there are four to meet the Jacobian torsors to consider. So there's just like the trivial one: class of a line, class of two times a line, and the class of three times a line. Okay, so Gary Wong showed that this is isomorphic to pick one of the curve, and this is the classical, this is just the trophy. This is just the Jacobian. So, the idea of the proof is that if the intermediate Jacobian torsor of structure vanishes, which I didn't say that, which just means that the conclusion of this theorem holds. So, which means that the conclusion holds. Then, I'll use to call it zero. This is how we remove it. Hopefully, it's legible. So, then, you know this torsor, it has to be some pig I. If it's pig zero, then it automatically has a point, and this will give you a line. And so, we can assume that this is not colorful, but so we may assume that This is a big one. But also, if you just add this to itself, the cost, like the torsor corresponding to one line, the sum is the one corresponding to two lines. So then this means that pick one plus pick one is equal to pick one. So pick one is equal to pick zero. And so actually, so this is how you they conclude that pick one has a one. But maybe I think I went through that kind of fast and didn't. I think I went through that kind of fast and didn't write it down, but maybe the takeaway is that in this case, there's only one generator, so the structure is relatively easy to understand. Okay. Oh, I think I should not have erased your upload, but okay, so So, next, I want to mention what happens to the intermediate Jacobian torsors in our case of interest. So, this is going to be a standard config bundle over P2, and then again, delta tilde to delta is the discriminant curve. And so first, I have to introduce some notation. Subnotation. So we define this variety which we call the polarized prime scheme. So this is, so maybe I'll just write in first and then say what it is. So this is going to be some generalization of the classical prim variety. So it's going to be the divisor classes on this top curve, Gamma Toga, whose push forward is some multiple. It's a multiple of O on the sorry, of O on O1 on the plane curve. So this is a lot of notation, but maybe just some way to think about this, is this is going to be some group scheme, and the identity component is going to be the usual print variety. Okay, so this is, yeah, this. Okay, so this is yeah, so this is just um yeah, so it's just some big group scheme um contained in the card scheme of of this discriminant double cover. And so then the theorem that we show, which is, I guess this is our main technical result, is that if so again, x is going to be a conic bundle over p2, so we show that x is geometrically rational, then there's a galaxy. There's a Dalois invariant surjective group homomorphism from this Chow Chun group scheme to this polarized primariety or polarized prime scheme, which induces an isomorphism on components. And so And so just sort of to explain what this notation is, again, this is this bold or underlined chow to the script scheme defined by Ben Huang Winberg, whose components are the intermediate Jacobian torsors. So roughly the slogan of what this says is that the IJA torsors are determined by the double color. By the double cover. Yeah, and so I erased the theorem of Boville that was up on the board earlier, but in the classical setting over in algebraically closed field, Boville showed that the intermediate Jacobian is just the usual curved variant, which is the identity component of this. So this result can be thought of as sort of generalizing Bobil's result to all curved classes, not just the algebraically trivial ones. And then I'll also mention that there's this assumption on geometrically rational, which is just to make this group scheme exist. This group scheme exists. In general, without geometric rationality assumptions, it still holds on the level of k-bar points. Does it state of hold something to P2 or hope for page? Oh, yeah, yeah, thank you. Yeah, so actually, I stated it for simplicity over P2, but this holds over any rational surface. Surface. So you have to assume that either K is perfect or that the surface has a rational point. And then you have to make some appropriate modification of this, but you basically have to polarize it by the entire card view of the surface. Good question. Okay. Great. Yeah. So this is sort of just the upshot. So this is sort of just the upshot of the technical, of our main technical result. Basically, you can just read curved classes off of the double cover. Okay, so next I want to give the application to rationality. And so And so, right. So, in the setting, we're going to first be interested in these conic bundles over P2. And we're going to assume that x is geometrically rational and that x has a ky. And so, recall that in the degree, in the case where the degree of the discriminant is less than or equal to 3, this condition of having rational point is enough to give. Condition of having rational point is enough to guarantee rationality. So we're going to focus on the case where the degree of the discriminant curve is equal to 4. And so then our question is that over an alpha vertically closed field, the intermediate Jacobian determines rationality. So you can ask, over a non-closed field, do the torsors determine rationality? And so for this, we are going to look at a particular model. At a particular model. So it turns out that if you have any at all double cover of a smooth plain cordic, then you can associate one of these final three folds and family two diagrams. Final three folds in family 219. So you can associate one of these double covers of P1 plus P2 branch along a 2-2 divisor. So there's a paper of Niels Bruin that allows you to do this very explicitly, like with very explicit equations. And so, sorry, so this says that if you're given any double cover, you can associate some product with a threefold. Oh, and maybe I'll just. Conic bundles we fold. Oh, and maybe I'll just remind people that, yeah, and so it turns out that this is a conic bundle, and this has the associated double cover, discerned double cover, which is exactly the same double cover required that you started off with. And so why this is useful is, so there's this purity exact sequence of barrel groups. So I'll maybe I'll just So maybe I'll just write down the sequence first and then sort of say what this is supposed to mean. Okay, so over any field you have the Bower group which ranchizes central simple algebras and so if you take the gene origin of a Barrow group of a field, it's going to contain like non-trivial conics of a field. So that's the index two elements. So this thing 12 elements. So this thing, this group in the middle, this is going to contain all the generic fibers of conic bundles or a P2. And then this H1 here, this basically is the data of the double cover here. Okay, so this, so even though this model of this double cover looks kinda specific, it turns out that over that for any degree four conic bundle, it's going to be birational to one of this form up to some Brouwer class. Up to some Brouwer class in the ground theory. So. Is it okay your delta is lower? So we have, yeah, so I guess there's a reasonable theory of print varieties. So yeah, we only studied the case where it's smooth. I think it seems like you can probably do it when it's noodle or it doesn't have bad singularities because there's still. Bad singularities because, like, there's still a reasonable theory of truths, but we didn't think about it yet. Thanks for the question. Okay. Oh, okay, so it might be dying, but I just wrote. Okay. And so So maybe okay, so for these double covers, Y, so again, Y is always going to, you know, this double cover of P1 cross P2. So what we showed is that this torsor structure, maybe Oh, maybe first I should say, before I say what happens to the torsors, I should just say what happens for the intermediate Jacobian. So for such Y, this is a double cover. And in fact, for any degree for conic bundle over P2, the intermediate Jacobian is isomorphic to the Jacobian of some genus 2 curve. So the classical intermediate Jacobian obstruction vanishes over. Mediated Jacobian obstruction vanishes over K. And so then it makes sense to ask about the torsors. So the first, this is my bigger. So the first result that we showed is that the torsor obstruction does not characterize fashionality for these double covers. For these double covers, y. And so, maybe more precisely, so there exists, so this is over the real numbers, there exists such a double cover of P1 cos P2 such that the intermediate Jacobian torsor obstruction vanishes. And this does have a rational point. And this does have a rational point, but the real locus is disconnected. So this threefold y, this is rational over c, but it's not rational over r. And in fact, it's not even stably rational over r. So that's the first example we constructed. However, there also exists There also exists y over r, where have this intermediate Jacobian torsor obstruction over all other obstructions that we know of Ganish. So all of their known obstructions in ish. So it has a rational point. So it has a rational point. As I just said above the intermediate Jacobian, the classical obstruction vanishes. It turns out that the Brouwer group of Y is the Brouwer group of R. And moreover, there's no ungramified cohomology construction. And with this example, we can show that the real locus of this threefold, this is. Locus of this threefold, this is homeomorphic to a three-sphere. So there's no topological obstruction to rationality. So there's, yeah, so this obstruction is sort of disgraced from these other obstructions to rationality. And so, yeah, so maybe one sort of moral reason for why this torso obstruction doesn't characterize rationality in the higher decard rate case is that sort of by our main technical Is that sort of by our main technical theorem, these torses only just pen in this double cover? But from this purity sequence from Brouwer groups, the data of this double cover only sort of lives in this place. But in order to determine the generic fiber of the conic bundle, you also need the information from the biogroup of the field. And so, in fact, so maybe I'll just say these. Reason for this is that the barth of r, so you can have a pointless connot over r. This is non-trivial. And so sort of, in contrast, we also show that if the Broward loop of K has two torsion, then for any standard For any standard, for any conic bundle, y x over p 2 with the degree of the discriminant curve equals 4, the intermediate to covident torsor's characterize rationality. And so, maybe as a corollary, if you if you're If you're over a finite field where Q is not a power of 2, then any such X is rational. So in particular, we can make these examples over R, which are rational over R, but they become rational mod all primes of reduction. Okay. And so So, yeah, so sort of continuing to play off this two-tortion of the Bar class of K, we can also sort of explain the situation of what happens over the real numbers. So, I just stand here. Dar here over R. So again, we let Y be one of these double covers. And so if we assume that the intermediate Jacobian torsor obstruction vanishes, so by our previous example, we know that this doesn't immediately imply that y is rational. That y is rational, but we have two possibilities. So either y is rational, so in fact, either the quadric surface bundle has a section, which implies that y is rational. Or, okay, so I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna go back to this diagram here. Again, here. And so, right, so for any double cover, we can construct a smooth plane quarter, we can construct this y. And so, this y is going to, the generic fiber is going to live inside the bar group of the function field of p2. And so then you can also consider what happens to the class when you add just the non-trivial conic over r into y. So this picture is over r. And so then the second possibility. And so then the second possibility is that if y is not rational, then this class of the generic fiber of y plus this other constant bar class, this has index 2. So it's realized by some conic. And that's over the function if you're lucky to. And it's realized by a rational threefold. And in fact, we can say what this is. So this three fold is the blow-up along a conic where C is some complete intersection of two quadrats inside P5. Yeah, so yeah, so Benwal. Yeah, so Benoit Lindbergh shows that, or in Hassan Cinkle shows that for just the intersection of quadratics, the intermediate Jacobian torsors characterize rationality. It turns out that it's true for the bull. So what this is, yeah, so what this theorem is saying is that this torsor obstruction, it doesn't always characterize rationality, but if you have some Y mapping word that's not rational, then sort of the other Brouwer class inside the fiber of this map, this one is. The fiber of this map, this one is rational. And yeah, so maybe I'll comment that if the discriminant curve, again, this is not over, this is over R, if it's in any case away from one oval, then exactly one of. of y or y plus bar class is rational. Okay, so I think sort of have five minutes left. So maybe in the remaining five minutes I want to say a little bit about like one ingredient. But at this point are there any questions so far? So one of the, yeah, so I guess the main idea of the proof is that we want to sort of apply our result about these torses in general to this very specific situation of these y, which are these double covers. Okay, so then it turns out, so recall that this map is a quadric surface bundle. So if you can look at the relative final variety of lines here, and it turns out that the sign factorization gives exactly the genus 2 curve, such that this intermediate Jacobian of y is the Jacobian of this specific genus 2 curve. Of the specific genus Q curve. So there's a very nice description. And so, the first thing we do is we give some very extremely explicit description of the integration and Kovi and torsors. So it turns out that in our case, there's four velvet torsors, but there's like a Zmod2 cross Zmod2 structure. So just the intermediate Jacobian, this is the double cover, which is the Jacobian, this genus 2 curve. We end this genus 2 curve. I'm just going to write down the names of these torsors. P1, and then there's a P1 tilde. So these both live inside the Jatobian of Delta tilde and were studied classically by Munker. And so it turns out this one is isomorphic to pig one of this curve, and these both. And these put inside for delta delta. Okay, so whatever this is, this is just to say that there's some extremely explicit description. And so what we show is that if so, if this last torsor has a k point, then Then there exists a Dalai invariant geometric section over some line inside P2. And this section mapping maps with odd degree to P1. P1 under the first projection. So, what this proposition is saying is that if we have some torsion being non-trivial, then we can have a Galois and geometric section, but the failure to descend is sort of exactly the data of the two torsion of the Brow group of K. Oh, and I should mention that this is one of the possibilities for when the torsion structure vanishes because you have in pig two. Have in pick two, or sorry, you have a genus two curves, so you only have pick zero or pick one. Okay, so maybe I'll just say this. So if if it descends, you get a rationality construction. This may or may not Descend if there's t-torsion in the bar group of the ground field. And maybe what I want to end with is I just want to draw sort of a picture of what happens over the real numbers because this is the name of the other standard function. Oh, sorry, this is non-zero. Thank you. And so sort of over the real numbers, you can draw very explicitly what this for our class is. So over R. So maybe I'll just do the case where this, so assume that these are the real points of the plane cortic. And so then I'm going to denote by the screen is going to denote the image of the real points. To denote the image of the real points of this threefold. Okay, so I'm just going to drain in two possibilities. So one possibility is that you might have points outside, the image of the real points might be outside the discriminant, or they might be inside the discriminant. It's also possible that it's all of the two, but in that case, you could show that it's rational. It's rational. And so, yeah, so from so from this proposition from the from a point on this towards a p1 tilde, you get some line inside p2. It turns out it doesn't pass through the real points of the discriminant curve transversely. And so then there's a theorem due to Witt in the 1920s. So this is a general theorem that if gamma If gamma is a smooth projective real curve over R and W to gamma is a quadric surface bundle, or sorry, is a quadric bundle of relative dimension at least one. Then maybe I'll denote sigma. The sigma has a section over r. R if and only if this the map is surjective on real points. So over any field in order to have a section you have to be surjective on real on points and so he showed that in the case over R, if you have a bundle of quadrats, this necessary condition is also sufficient. So sort of from the picture, you can see that if the image of the real points are inside here, in particular, there are no real points. Are inside here, in particular, there are no real points over this orange line, so you cannot possibly have a section. And then in this first case, you know that over this orange point, you have real points in your threefold. And do the wigs theorem, this actually allows you to construct a section. And so that's how we get a rationality construction. That's everything I want to say. Thank you very much for your attention. Questions? Yeah, so I'm I guess we haven't looked at it. So I think the the theory of Venom Wood where they only developed this intermediate Jacobian torsion machinery in the seal case. You'd think it was like Take the same money for the other standard. You're going to be quinted, but someone would. And you can make just roughly the same thing, but what is the base? The basis of some flow of P2? Or we do depending on the configuration. One singular point? No, no, one is one single point that's referred to as. I think we haven't I haven't thought about it, but I'm interested in talking about this. I think basically the well, basically the only case we've considered so far is degree 4 over P2 because sort of like, because we're trying to finish this picture first. Statement of your original theorem had some cases of how the ovals are arranged. Yeah. And where the disarming them? That's that. Oh, yeah. So I guess maybe I can just sort of draw like a very simple picture. Yeah, so I guess the argument in each of the cases is pretty different. It's a lot of cases, but sort of It's a lot of history, but sort of like the rough idea is like the, okay, I was, yeah, the original. Yeah, so we sort of, so we have an example where like sort of the real image of the real points is sort of the inside of one oval. And we think this probably is not rational, but we sort of can't show it because, like, I mean, in this situation with two ovals, somehow it's not possible for both of these to be rational because this. Possible for both of these to be rational because this one is disconnected. And sort of like in the other cases, you can use this topological obstruction to rationality to sort of force you to be in the good Brower class situation. I don't know if that answered your question. Yeah, so I mean, I guess like if there's, yeah, if there's, I mean, this is irrational by some topological. By some topological obstruction. And then you can't use that in this case. I guess maybe something else that's relevant, so I guess there's a relation between the number of ovals and the number of real bitangents of a cortic. And so I guess it actually turns out that if, in the case of four ovals, you can use the bitangents to argue that you always see a rationality. To argue that you always get rationality. The case of three ovals, connected vehicle lines, implies rationality. So, because the bitangents, the real bitangents do come in in some of the arguments, but yeah, that's sort of not applicable in this case. Is that so? Yeah, that's one old. Yeah. Yeah, I guess we have a case where wait, well I can draw the case sort of better. Yeah. So here is like the threefold is some like thing which looks like S3 and then there's a map to P2 and then there's this map to P1. So we and so then in this example the image is sort of the inside Example: The image is sort of inside of one oval, which means that you can't do this lifting, like this constructing a section business. And also, turns out it doesn't project onto Q1 at real points, so there's no section. We don't in this case. And also, in this case, we can construct an intersection of quadrats where that has the same discriminant double cover, but like the Broward class gets flipped, and we know that the other one is rational. But right now, we can't conclude that the first one is rational. Right now we can't conclude that the first one is not questionable. Any more questions? Thank you, Speaker.
