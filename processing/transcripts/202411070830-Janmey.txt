But let's proceed by talking a little bit about how tissues are constructed and where their mechanical properties might arise from. So I want to tell you three simple stories, short stories. One is that soft tissues and cells to some extent stiffen when they're compressed. That is, their shear modulus increases if you subject them to uniaxial compression. Not the stretch, but the compression. Not the stretch, but the compression. And we've been trying to understand where this comes from because biopolymer gels made out of the materials that the cell is made out of and the extracellular matrix is made out of, if you purify them and do the same thing, they soften instead of stiffen. And so we've been trying to understand how do you convert this gel-like biopolymer gel-like rheology to something more tissue-like. So that's the idea. So the work has been done largely initially. Has been done largely initiated by Ann Van Oosten, who is a graduate student in the lab, and carried on by Allison Patterson, who was a postdoc and is now a professor in physics at Syracuse, and Zhuichen Shi, who's a current postdoc. Okay, so that's kind of where I want to go. And the motivation for this comes from very, very old experiments, which maybe some of you know. So these are experiments that were reported. These are experiments that were reported almost 100 years ago, but are even older than this. And the experiment is this: if you take a small piece of tissue or the end of a severed nerve and place it either into culture medium, which at that time was diluted blood serum, or place it in a blood clot. If you put one little island like that of cells, something like an organoid, it grows out spherically symmetrically in the gene. Spherically symmetrically in the gel, or if it's on a plate, it grows out circularly symmetrically. But if you put two of them near each other, so these are two nerve endings, they're about a half a millimeter in diameter, and they're placed in a blood clot, in a diluted blood clot, a few millimeters away. And then the ends are cut just before the gel is polymerized around them, and rather than growing circular. And rather than growing circularly symmetrically, they begin to do that at the beginning, but then very soon the cells just start streaming towards the other island. And people studied how far can these islands be placed until the cell no longer recognizes its neighbors. And it turns out that that difference is several millimeters, many, many, many cell diameters. Many, many, many cell diameters. And it doesn't have to be nerves. In fact, probably from the nerve endings, it's mostly fibroblasts and not neurons that are growing. But if you take two little pieces of chicken heart and do the same thing, that very, very soon cells start streaming towards each other. So this was known 100 years ago. And people wondered where this comes from. And in one of the reviews from Paul Weiss, they say there are two, three. They say there are three logical explanations: chemical, electrical, or mechanical. So, the chemical viewpoint was that some molecule is emitted from the surface of these organoids, diffuses, and is picked up by the neighboring cell that reacts. They knew that was probably not the right answer because they already knew Fick's laws and how much the solute would be diluted and how long it would take it to diffuse these millions. Would take it to diffuse these millimeters to face the neighbors. And so they're pretty convinced it wasn't that. The next alternative, especially for the nerves, but for most injured tissues, it's electrical. There's a potential difference across almost all wounds made in the body. And they could rule that out by short-circuiting the electrical signal with little platinum wires. That had no effect on the ability of the cells to find each other. So they figured it must be mechanical. It must be mechanical in some way. One possibility is that the cells which are pulling on the matrix around them are restructuring the matrix to make tracks along which the cells move. But it could also be that they are sensing the mechanics of their environment in some way. And that now has exploded into mechanobiology, in which people have made many, many beautiful experiments to show how. Beautiful experiments to show how strongly cell biology depends on the viscoelastic stiffness of the substrate, not only the elastic modulus, but the dissipative part as well. We've seen some examples of that already. And what we've been sort of interested in is where does this stiffness arise from in the body or in vivo? Because in the actual cell, stiffnesses can change. Cells, stiffnesses can change pretty rapidly. And I'll show you some examples of that, how much the stiffness, and by stiffness, I typically mean the shear modulus, the low-strain shear modulus, which cells are responsive to, that will change when you compress or stretch a tissue, which happens to us all the time, for example, by sitting. And different tissues respond differently. And one of the ideas that we've been pursuing is perhaps the change. Pursuing is perhaps the changes in tissue stiffness that arise when you compress it the way they are compressed in vivo, might be useful in characterizing disease and possibly, if we understood where this came from, reversing something. Okay, so that's the idea. And so here's some examples, which most of you know, probably all of you know well, is that if you, the literature is full of beautiful measurements of the viscoelastic properties. Viscoelastic properties of different tissues under different conditions. And so, for example, if you take a piece of normal liver from a human, or in this case, it's from rats, and measure their shear modulus, they're typically a few hundred Pascal in shear modulus. But a fibrotic liver can be easily an order of magnitude stiffer. And this is also seen in human livers, serotic livers or heavily tumor. Or heavily tumor-infested serotic livers can be 20 times as stiff as in the normal liver. So, the stiffness, at least in hepatocellular carcinoma, is useful as a biomarker, not only of having the disease, but as a risk of getting the disease later. Okay, so that's for fibrosis. And of course, the Hallmark system, which has stimulated so much work, is look at Stimulated so much work is to look at malignancy in the breast. That the shear modulus of a breast tumor is again much, much stiffer than the normal tissue around it. And of course, that's why physical palpation works as a diagnostic method, that the tumor is noticeably stiffer. But the other example I want to show is this really nice experiment from Rick Associan's lab about 10 years ago, who looked at the stiffening of the aorta. Of the aorta that was caused by genetic deletion of APOE, a protein that has to do with making lipoprotein particles, but that has many other effects. And what they found was that if you knock this gene out in a mouse and then measure the shear modulus of its aorta, it's about three or four times, maybe five times stiffer than the aorta of its normal littermate. And this is true. Littermate. And this is true even early on, before there's any sign of atherosclerosis or any other abnormality. So these mice, lacking APOE, are doomed to get atherosclerosis and die from heart attacks. And what Associan showed was that you can pharmacologically reduce the stiffness to the normal level. And the animal which still has this mutation. Which still has this mutation now no longer gets atherosclerosis. It's the stiffening that is driving something. The other thing I want to note is how small these variances are. These are standard deviations of about 10 or so measurements of each class. The control of the elastic modulus seems to be something that nature wants to take very seriously. And changes in stiffness aren't always a sign of disease or abnormality, they're a normal part of development. Abnormality, they're a normal part of development. So the embryonic heart, the cardiac cushion in which the first cardiac myocyte appears, is 100 times softer than the adult heart in the same animal. And because cardiac myocytes don't divide very frequently, some of the cells that are beating in this embryonic heart have figured out how to adjust their strength and their morphology to function in this much stiffer environment. Function in this much stiffer environment. Okay, so that's the idea. So, where does the stiffness come from? The natural guess is that it comes from networks of semi-flexible polymers, because everything in these tissues seems to be dominated by these, at least visually. So here's an old electron micrograph from my colleague John Hartwig, which looks at the actin network by electron microscopy just underneath the cell membrane of a macrophage, a white blood. Of a macrophage, white blood cell. And underneath, there are these beautiful open mesh works. The mesh size here is a few hundred nanometers. These are all actin filaments. These are clathrin-coated pits. So this is a 100-nanometer or so little spherical object of something that's about to be endocytosed. So this is what the material on the outside of this, on the inside of the cell, looks like. The material on the outside of the cell basically. The outside of the cell basically looks the same. So, here, except on a different scale. So, here are fibroblasts crawling through a collagen matrix in a wounded eyelands model. And you see the same kind of structure, big open meshworks of filaments. The difference is that the mesh size here is a micron. The mesh size here is a few hundred nanometers. And these are collagen fibers rather than actin filaments, but it's the same kind of idea. Filaments, but it's the same kind of idea. And one hint of where I want to go soon is that the real tissue or a real wound site isn't just an open network of polymers. Those polymer networks are full of cells. These are fibroblasts that are crawling their way through the matrix. And the other beautiful example of this kind of architecture is in the blood clot. This is a diluted whole blood clot, otherwise, the cells would be almost... Otherwise, the cells would be almost close-packed and we wouldn't see much. But this is work from John Weisel's lab. It's a colorized scanning EM. The turquoise things are the fibrin strands. The red cells are red cells, which are about five or six microns big. So again, the mesh size of a blood clot is quite large. And the platelets are these little contractile units, which put internal stress on the network, which is also an important feature of the. An important feature of the real network. Okay, so that's kind of getting towards where the stiffness might come from. It must be dominated in some way by these networks of semi-flexible polymers. And over the last 20 or so years, theoretical physics people have done a fantastic job of figuring out what the stress-strain relations should be of networks that are made out of stuff like this. Stuff like this. So, two things to keep in mind. Here's a kind of a schematic of one of these generic networks. Here are two cross-link points, and they are bridged by a filament, which is almost straight, but not quite. So it has some slack you can pull out. And as you put a shear deformation, a volume-conserving shear deformation, some of the filaments that happen to be Of the filaments that happen to be aligned in the shear direction get pulled completely straight, and now they become very, very, very stiff. Whereas other filaments, which are aligned in the orthogonal direction, are kind of crumpled, so they don't contribute very much. And this asymmetry or this spatial difference between the direction in which the filament is facing is something that does not arise in rubber-like elasticity and is special for these. Elasticity, and especially for these semi-flexible, nearly straight polymers. Okay, and they're nice predictions of how the shear modulus should scale with the bending constant of the filament, but also with a mesh size, and this seems to work pretty well. The other implication of this model is that if you make networks of these things, like actin filaments or collagen networks or fiber networks or intermediate filament networks, if you make three-dimensional gels out of them, If you make three-dimensional gels out of them and then measure their shear modulus as a function of shear strain, the modulus will increase. It increases because the more shear strain you put on it, the more your recruit filaments into this stretched, taut condition, which will become stiffer and stiffer. Completely different from a flexible polymer shell like polyacrylamide, which just has beautiful linear elasticity as a constant. Linear elasticity as a constant shear modulus doesn't care about the shear strain. Okay, so that's been known for a while. And the natural thought is that, well, tissues ought to behave similarly since they're made out of these, and they don't. So here's one of the earliest measurements done actually by Kashya Pagoda and Penelope Georges a while ago in the lab, where they took a piece of brain, a disk-shaped piece of brain, and they did the same thing. They measured its shear modulus as a function of shear. Shear modulus as a function of shear strain. And rather than going up with increasing strain, it did very little, nothing, or maybe got a little bit weaker. And you might think, well, brain is a kind of an unusual tissue, but it works just as well with liver, which does have a three-dimensional matrix with cells embedded in the collagen gel. Here's the same kind of measurement done over and over again, and it's almost completely reversible. So this So, this soft softening, this weak softening with respect to increasing shear strain isn't because we're damaging anything. We can just repeat it over and over again. It's part of the architecture of these tissues. So, that's kind of unexpected or unhelpful. The polymer networks don't explain tissue rheology. So, we looked at a different kind of way of deforming a tissue or a piece of material, which is more like what you're doing by Which is more like what you're doing by sitting down on your soft tissues. You're putting uniaxial stress on them. And so we built a little apparatus where we can measure the shear modulus at low strain, but we can do it on a sample that is now subjected to an arbitrarily big but controllable normal strain or normal stress, either compressing or stretching the thing. And then something interesting happens. Interesting happens. Here's the same brain data I showed you before. The brain becomes slightly softer the more you deform it in pure shear. But if you now compress it, uniaxily compress it, it gets much, much stiffer. If you compress it and then increase the amplitude of the shear deformation, it still weakens, but in the compressed state, it's always stiffer than it is in the uncompressed state. Is in the uncompressed state. And this is even more apparent in liver or adipose tissue or almost anything else we've looked at. These tissues always get stiffer when you compress them uniaxially. Here we're looking at the small strain shear modulus just as a measure of stiffness. But as you compress it uniaxially, it gets stiffer. When you stretch it, it doesn't get stiffer. And this is true for many soft tissues. Issues. Particularly beautifully true for liver. Okay, so where does this come from? It's an important thing to think about because if this were liver or adipose tissue or something else, if you compress it by increasing the blood pressure by sitting down or by anything that squeezes on the tissue, the cells inside it, which are very sensitive to this shear modulus, in the resting state, they'll feel a soft environment. State, they'll feel a soft environment. In the compressed state, they'll feel a very stiff environment and begin to react accordingly. Okay, so that's the idea. So, where does this come from? And where does the stiffening and compression, again, the first guess is it must have something to do with the biopolymer networks that form it, and that doesn't seem to be true. If we do the same experiment with a collagen network or a fibrin network, or it could also Network, or it could also be a cross-linked actin network or a cross-linked microtubule network. If we compress it and then measure the shear modulus, both of these materials get softer. The tissue got stiffer. These guys get softer. They get softer because when we compress them uniaxially, filaments buckle. And when they buckle, they can no longer support a shear modulus. That's the idea. And it's worked out nicely from theories from Fred McIntosh's group and others. Okay, so. And others. Okay, so again, the networks are different from a tissue. They're also, we don't have time to discuss this, but they also beautifully stiffen when we stretch them. That's for another time. Okay, so why are tissues different from polymer networks? So the hint is where the word tissue comes from. It comes from the French word, which does derive from tissue, to weave. So a tissue is an onset. Tissue is an ensemble of some kind of extracellular matrix that, in which are interwoven cells, a certain number of cells that perform a certain function. And different tissues differ from each other because they have different kinds of filament networks in their matrix. They have different concentrations, they have different geometries, and they have different stiffness, they have different cells, big cells, small cells. Cells, big cells, small cells, stiffer cells, weaker cells, some that pull hard, some that don't pull hard. That's what differentiated tissue from another. And kind of an interesting exercise. I believe every European language, if they have the word for tissue, even if it's not at all related to the French word, still has in it the root to weave. This is not true for all languages, but somehow early pathologists or somebody realized that tissues have this woven characteristic. Have this woven characteristic in which a network contains objects. Okay, so we tried to do that in the simplest possible way, which is to take little beads and polymerize the network around them. And the first experiments that Ann did was to take little polysaccharide beads, about 50 or 100 microns big, and polymerize around them a cage of fibrin. The length scale is so big you can't see the individual chains, but they're fluorescent, so they make this. Chains, but they're fluorescent, so they make this kind of fuzz around them. Okay, and just to remind you: if we made the green network without these little particle inclusions, it would have this feature. It would become softer if we compressed it, stiffer if we stretched it. If we now put beads in them, even about 50% volume fraction beads, far below jamming, suppresses the stretching. Suppresses the stretching, and now it reverses the softening in compression to stiffening in compression. The compression, the resistance, the shear module still comes from the fibrin strands. The beads are just limiting how the fibrin stands can react. And so we're able to make from a fibrin gel, something that softens and compression, stiffens and stretch, we're able to make something that kind of looks like a liver just by putting particles. A liver just by putting particles in it. This also works. We put particles and collagen, as I'll show you now. The other way to do it is to contract, to put cells inside a network and sort of build an artificial tissue that way and see what happens. In this case, we take a collagen gel and seed it with a small number of cells. These happen to be glioblastoma cells, but they could be many other different cell types. Many other different cell types. When the cell density is very low, we feel more or less only the mechanics of the collagen network. If we compress the collagen network, it gets a little bit softer, but nothing dramatic happens. And then we let this system sit until the cells proliferate and probably remodel the matrix also, but retain the collagen fiber backbone. And suddenly they become beautifully compression-stiffening, just like. Compression stiffening, just like an actual tissue. So, where does this come from? There are several theories that predict where it comes from. The only one I have time to really tell you about is from my colleague, Vivek Shanoy at Penn and his student, Jing Yu Chen, who did this really nice, simple model, you know, conceptually simple model. They asked, what happens if I take a semi-flexible polymer network, fiber nerd? Polymer network, fibrin or collagen, and put little volume-conserving cells in them. So the feature of these cells is that they themselves are very soft. They have zero shear modulus, but they're perfectly volume-conserving. And then ask, what happens if I uniaxually compress that? If I compress it in the direction that I'm compressing, that the arrows show, yes, filaments that happen to be lined in that Z direction. In that Z direction, they will buckle and lose ability to resist deformation. So they will become softer. But because this little originally spherical object is now compressed in the Z direction, it expands bilaterally in the XY plane, and it drags the filaments with them. And for the same sort of reason that networks of semi-flexible polymers stiffen in pure shear, they stiffen much. Shear, they stiffen much, much more strongly in biaxial stretch. And it's this conversion of, or this forcing the fiber network to biaxily stretch because it has to accommodate the volume that's taken up by the cell. That's what leads to this beautiful compression stiffening. But there are other models as well. There's a nice model from Jordan Shivers and Fred McIntosh that asks the opposite question. The opposite question. What happens if I put infinitely rigid spherical particles inside a soft network? They also can lead to compression stiffening for quite different reasons, but experimentally, it's difficult to distinguish these two things. There's a third kind of model that will account for compression stiffening, but it requires the connectivity of the filaments to be much bigger than they are. Filaments to be much bigger than they are in vitro, I mean, in vivo. So for the moment, we'll set that aside. And of course, there's a trivial reason why things might stiffen when you compress them, because if you compress them and change the volume, you can increase the particle density until they do jam. And if the particles are rigid, then yes, the shear modulus goes up, but that doesn't seem what happens. Okay, so we're going to ask if there's anything useful we can. We can do with this information? And is there a kind of a signature of compression stiffening in a tissue that might be useful either diagnostically or for understanding where a disease comes from. And so, the example I want to show you here is some very recent work from David Lee, who is a postdoc in Rebecca Wells's lab, working on. Rebecca Wells' lab working on liver. So, in much of the developed world, development of fatty livers has become a huge health concern. And you can see how dramatic the tissue changes by this experiment. If you take a piece of tissue, kind of a millimeter-size piece of a normal liver from a wrapped, fed a lean diet, and stain it with a red dye for lip. And stain it with a red dye for lipid, yes, there's lipid in there, but not a whole lot. And if you take a hepatocyte out of this liver and stain it with, unfortunately, a red dye for actin, it's just folloidin, but with a green dye for lipid inside this hepatocyte, there isn't very much. But now the same kind of animal fed a high-fat diet develops these big 100-micron-ish big lesions or concentrations of lipid. Concentrations of lipid in the liver, and a hepatocyte now gets filled with these little droplets of fat that are crowding out the cytoskeleton. It's still there, but they also push on the nucleus. So, and this is not, you know, the animal is still alive and everything. This is not nowhere near, you know, totally unrealistic that this can happen. So, the question is: can we? This can happen. So, the question is: Can we distinguish this kind of liver from this kind of liver rheologically? And the answer kind of is yes. The surprising thing is, if we look at the shear modulus just from an excise tissue in the gentlest possible way, we just take it out and put it in a rheometer. There's statistically no difference between a wild-type liver and a liver from a fat animal. These pictures just show. These pictures just show that these fat animals don't become fibrotic either. It's just the presence of fat that's changing the rheology. But never mind that. We cannot really distinguish a fat from a normal liver in this traditional way of just taking the slice out and measuring linear eology. However, if we compress it, and I'm sorry, the legend has fallen off, this is axial compression. So the more to the right, the more compressed it is. The more compressed it is. And here we can tell the difference. The normal liver, as I showed you before, stiffens a lot when we compress it. The fatty liver, much less so. We don't know where this comes from, but we'd like to understand it. The other example I wanted to show you is an older experiment from Akasha Pogoda when she was a postdoc in the lab, who looked at whether there are rheological signatures of different kinds of brain tumors? Because unlike breast or colorectal cancers, Or colorectal cancers, brain tumors, especially gliomas, are not stiffer than the normal brain. If anything, they're somewhat softer. And so she took up, did the same kind of experiment, got from Shizeri Marchenkevich at Temple Medical School surgical samples from glioma patients or from normal brain. And they have indistinguishable apparent Young's moduli made by. Young's moduli made by indentation. But now, if we look at the apparent stiffness as a function of compression, then in uniaxial compression, the Young's modulus here, not the shear modulus, but the Young's modulus, doesn't change very much in compression in a normal brain, but it does change in a glioma. So there's a signature that we can probably distinguish disease from normal tissues. The very last example I want to show you. The very last example I want to show you in the last minute or so is that this can be done. You can see the signature of compression stiffening fully in vivo. It's a beautiful paper from the Van Beer's group in Paris, I think, several, a couple of years ago, in which they used magnetic resonance elastography to measure the stiffness, the shear modulus of hepatocellular carcinoma or Carcinoma or chalangiocarcinomas. And they have different stiffnesses to begin with. But in particular, if you measure the average elastic modulus of it as a function of how much you compress the tissue before doing while you're doing the magnetic resonance elastography, the elastic modulus is a very strong function of how much you compress it. Okay, so let me finish here. The tissues stiffen in compression, but don't in a Stiffen in compression but don't in extension. And semi-flexible polymers, which make up both the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton, they do exactly the opposite. And that the way you can convert one to the other is to take a fibrous network and embed it with volume-conserving objects. That's enough to flip them from compression softening to compression stiffening. And we're now exploring the idea that somehow the magnitude of stiffness. Somehow, the magnitude of stiffness or the way that it changes in compression might have some use at least in diagnostics. Okay, so here are the people that did the work. This is Allison Patterson. This is Anne Van Oosten, who started it. And this is Zhui Chen Chi, and here's our lab and funding sources. Okay, thank you very much for your attention.
