The invitation. It's really nice to be here and to talk about some of our recent work. This is actually still ongoing work, so it's on publishing. So this is actually the first time I'm talking about this method. So it would be great if you guys give me some feedback. So Vintage is essentially a method to try to extend the general framework of TWAS analysis. So as we all know, GWAS have identified many genetic elements that are associated with a lot of diseases and disease-related complex traits. And disease-related complex traits. But most of those genetic variants, they look like just uncoding regions, so make it very difficult to understand their functional mechanism. And certainly one possible mechanism, a lot of people have been working towards this direction, is that maybe the snake effects on training is related through gene expression. So perhaps they are through the gene regulation expression. So therefore, their parallel EQTL mapping studies are important and they have started to reveal many And they have started to reveal many SNPs associated with gene expression. So, the natural question was therefore how to integrate the GWAS with those EQGL pattern mapping studies in order to yield relatable insights to these methodology. So, the pioneering work from Eric and Hurkey and Heidelskin, as well as such, and TIWAS, they have developed these two very popular methods for integrated analysis. So, they integrated TIWAS as useful. So they integrated GWAS used by GPS studies. And those methods, they are basically very similar to each other, with really kind of differences between the two. And both approaches very long and they use a two-stage based regression or analytical procedure to perform such regression. So this two-stage procedure in Python scale 2 arguments described performance. So specifically in the first stage, the model focuses on eQTOSI. So the linear question. So we're learning a reflection model of call. So we know y1 is the gene explosion. X1 is a gene of x that is the cis region for the particular step. So we're looking at just one gene. So y1 is that gene in the QTL stack. And so the beta one are essentially the prediction rates are the gene expression. And in stage two, we're going to shift our focus to JOAS studies. So we're going to plug in the estimated data one, say SNP effect size IG. beta one. So you snip effects as an expression that I can do a GWAS model and try to test whether this X3 times beta one correct. So this is our construct predict the GWAX component, genetic regulatory component of the IT expression, whether it's associated with Y2, where Y2 is a complex trade of interest or disease trade of interest. So that's essentially the two-stage procedure we have. Now to understand this and TWAS procedure a little better, maybe the Procedure a little better, and maybe it helps to write it out from a model-based experiment. So, here we're writing out a sort of algorithm experiment, it's a two-stage estimation procedure. But if we think about this further, then we can actually build TWAS with this following model. And this following model are characterized by two distinct equations. Specifically, in the EQGA sample, we have our Russian model that's connecting our G expression, which Our G expression, which our SNP, which is X1 to G expression. And the connection is through the beta one, the SNP effect size and G expression. And in the GWAS sample, we can write it in another DVR regression, connecting against the SNPs in the GWAS data, which is X2, to the phenotype data of interest, which is Y2 there. And so then over there, the SNP effects are the trait of interest is our beta 2. So we have our beta one, the SNP effects are expression. 1, the SNP effects are transpression, or beta 2, the SNP effects are the outer contrainuum. So they are measured on the same set of SNPs, so the dimensionality for beta 1 and beta 2 are identical. So if you write out this way, you can clearly see that the modern assumption made in TWAS is effectively that beta 2 is a linear scaling factor times the beta 1. So as long as you estimate your beta 1, the same effects are G expression can just follow by a scaling factor. You can just multiply a scaling factor alpha on top to get your beta 2. So that is, the Q was assumed that similar effects on trivia scalar multiplication also effects on expression. I'm implying also that the QTL study is fully informative on your GWAS sample. So to get your estimates from QTL mainly studying, you can simply just use a normal human GWAS because they are just scaling on scale multiplication of the Multiplication of the non-level. And that assumption appears to be quite strong, given that only really 11% of the genetic effects are mediated in the switch, rather than 100%. So naturally, we're wondering whether we should try to extend this type of model assumption to make it more robust and more remote to prepare some things. Now to think a little bit deeper, so the T1s, the first um in practice they use PLAS and T1s they use PSL and then to P1 first couple. TSLM and 2PLA influence cover prediction models. And when you model the beta-1 models with the NMX model or TSLM and power levels, then effectively this assumption is also to say that for the SNP j, we have two things. One is beta 1j, which is its effect on gene expression, the other is beta 2j, which is its effect on the trade. So they basically follow some normal description with uh compute correlation. With correlation um between these two is said to be either one or minus one. Said to be either one or minus one. So, therefore, when GWAS effectively assumed that the two effect sizes are completely correlated with each other, this is the positive one or negative one correlation. And the focus of GWAS is certainly to test whether R5 equals 0 or not, which is the GRAS association with the trait. Or equivalently, in this particular setting, it's also equivalent to testing the beta, the sigma-beta 2-square, which is the variance component. The variance component for the bigger 2GO is genetic variance on the SNP effects on geometry, where the sigma squared 2 is equal to 0. So that's helpful for view because this view also directly connects another part of the model called a SCAD, which people generally use that for IPI vertical tests. But if you think about a SCAD and applied it to corner vertical tests, it essentially can also be coming into the same file. into the same function. So specifically, think about the SCAT, but you can also write the same two models. You have a QTL model, SNP2G expression. You have a GWAS model, you have a SNP2 trait. Now the model assumption on SCAD is very different from GWAS. And specifically, the SCADA model assumption, if you think about this if joint modeling framework, it's essentially assumed that the same sort of model, bivariate model distribution, has affected gene expression. In a gene expression, that is trait. And except that the correlation structure is completely independent. So you set the correlation value to be zero. So this is different from the TWAS. In the TWAS, we're setting the correlation to be exactly one or negative one. So that any information you have about the EQTL is completely informed by TWAS. Or over here, the scan is essentially setting the correlation to prevail, which says that, well, an EQTL sample is independent. Well, an EQTL sample is independent to us, so therefore, if you want to test the GWAS association outwards, you don't really need to use EQTL. And the focus of the SCAT is very similar, so the null hypothesis is trying to test very similar. So you can use the horror. So therefore, this framework seems to connect both between the TOS and the SCAD. And the only difference between the two is that the correlation parameters are set very differently. So we specifically, both TOA and SCADA focus on the genetic. Both two are scatter focus on the genetic association test customer than that variance component signal to spread detail. But they do so by making very distinct modern assumptions on this genetic correlation parameter R2 approaches. In particular, GWAS set R equal to plus 1 or negative 1 and effectively assume that the QTL study is fully informative for the genetic test of GWAS, or alternatively, and the sleep effects on their train is completely mediated through GS function. Completely immediately. Well, for the static, it makes a different model assumption, setting r equal to zero. And so it basically assumes that the stiff effects on the trait is not mediocre expression at all. And so therefore, scattering uses GWAS data, and in fact, you assume that the QTL study is not informative for the genetic testing change. So naturally, the power of these two tests certainly depends on whether their model assumptions matches two. Whether there are moral assumptions matches choose or not, which is unknown in practice, and very likely to vary across different genes and also across different traits. So, therefore, we decided to create this more general framework through the vintage, which is co-variant set as integrated TWAS for gene-based analysis. So, it's building upon the same framework here. You have two different limited equations for modeling the EQTL study and for modeling the GL study. And now for each slip change. But now for the G Slippetche, its effect size on the G expression and its effect size, I'm going to trade these more models through a more general correlation structure, where the R over here is a correlation point, and we are now going to ask that R to see in the real data, is R close to 0, or is R close to plus 1 or negative 1, or is it R different number for every different gene? And because by doing that, our model now becomes more flexible. So by directly modeling, I mean inferring the genetic Modeling and inferring the genetic correlation private R and the framework of integer factoring now include SCAT and the certain versions of SCAT, certain versions of TWAS as special cases. So if R goes to positive one or negative one, it goes to TWAS. If it goes to zero, it goes to SCAT. And certainly you are estimating this. So the hope is that you are going to get more power and more interpretable results. And so inverting R allows Vintage to estimate the outcome information containing a QTR method. In QGIN, and for the genetic association test. For the testing is going to be robust. And genetic correlation R is also closely related to the mediation proportion in high-dimensional mediation analysis. So the R there quantifies sub-functional R, quantifies the proportion of effects that are SNP effects on metrics that are inflation's huge expression. So the R is directly interpretable. And because R is related to mutation proportion, so in addition to that, you're Proportion. So, in addition to that genetic test, we can also perform another test, that genetic correlation test, and directly testing whether R equals zero or not. And if it's significant, it means that for that particular gene, the SNP effects are mediated smoother gene. And if not significant, then it means that maybe they don't have a sample size, or maybe the SNP effects are not mediated as much. And certainly, we have now two different tasks and processes that we can make use of. Post-tests can make use of some statistics. And in fact, getting the test statistics to the summary, post-test to work out, turns out to be very challenging tasks, simply because we have smaller sample sizes for expression teaching all these studies. So we spend a lot of time actually to figure out how to create a performance. We try to find six different versions of that, and only one works well. So I choose that one ten works well. So that's basically what we're looking. So it's vintage is connecting. So it's vintage connecting to us towards SCAD and there is more flexible framework to do this. Some simulations. So first it's just proof of concept simulations and moving all the methods works fine so they can just get a two as they all can do, calibrate the test statistics so they also have a directly. Now in the alternative, it shows the power versus the local genetic correlation. And the pattern almost Genetic correlation. And the pattern over here is really capturing why the model is a more general framework. So let's look at the bottom right corner of the figure there. So, what it shows here is the power for three different methods, where the black one is vintage, the green one is SCAT, and the red one is TMOS. So, for SCAT, you can see that across those different genetic correlations, because SCAT has not been used here in speech-temperance, starting to maturing its power stay the same. Is power state zero. So you can see a flat light of stat across each other collages. And the 4T was, because it makes the assumption that it's either polytable or negative ones, you can see it's the highest power when it's either negative one or polytop, but much lower than goes into the middle. So you see this double curvature. And while vintage, because it's actively inferred, this low parameter, the R parameter over there, so therefore it's power is really a model bus across those different energetic values of product. Those different genetic values with correct line can statistics on top of both of these methods, except in the spatial case, either plus one, minus one, where I think to us is going to be slightly more powerful, but in the middle as well, if it's there or it's dead, it's probably going to be more powerful. And that fits our intuition and fits our model assumption. And we can also check more sparse settings where only have, say, one SNP is a file using 2GL SNP, or maybe two SNPs, or maybe five SNPs are 2GL SNPs. Or maybe five slips like Q2 slips. So type 1 errors are still quite calibrated, and the behavior looks very similar, except in the extreme case where Q equals to 1. So in Q equals to 1, it's a very extreme case because we only have one step affecting T expression, one step affecting the train. So the correlation parameter is actually not defined. So in that case, for vintage, it automatically estimates the correlation to be plus one or minus one. So therefore it behaves very similar to the TOAS estimate. So, in addition to that genetic covariance test, we can also perform this correlation test. You can directly test whether for this gene, this gene whether it's significantly mediating the SNP effects of the trait. And so this test is also very well behaved under the null so we can, since it's a more general correlation framework, so we compare with some of this local correlation methods, such as virtual. So you can see that our methods, the back line, sits on the diagram. Black line sits on the diagonal line pretty well. Some of the methods use a huge inflation. And under the alternative, you can also see that the black line is more powerful than the other method, which supersede, which gives you a calibrated testing building. While the Lava certainly gives you inflated test statistics, so it's hard to compare power at a fixed achievement swashboard, but you can compare power at different forced status. At different first discovery rates, for example. So, this way you can see that integers are more powerful in testing this hypogenetic correlation compared with other methods. And in terms of estimation, estimating genetic correlations, it also gives you really well output estimates. But certainly because MQT American studies are so small, you can see the noise is quite big, so this red is quite big. So, we applied the vintage to the mukha bot rank. So, specifically, So, specifically in the UK Barbank, we focus on 360 white British samples, and then we integrate EQGL chain study, which has 31,000 samples. So, both are summary statistics. And we focus on 13,700 protein-coding genes. And then we stress systems, such as MNAS for standard TBAS and ALDAS-18 related complex traits. And we use the one-sound G European sample. Use that one sample, your pin sample and say, I want to fit on the sample expression venture. So the pattern looks quite interesting. So you can see that on the right-hand side, we're showing my whole idea patterns. So you can see the vintage looks very similar to SCAD, slightly better than SCAD, but both are much higher than TOS. So this results seem to indicate that perhaps more so with genes, maybe that genetic correlation is not really well connected. So perhaps this is something close to PZ or something. Something close to PZ or something right to Isaiah. And so, and certainly because vintage is sort of unifying framework. So for most, like 97% of genes identified by SCAD, they are also identified by vintage. For 95% of genes identified by TWAS, it's also included by Vintage. But the reverse is not true. So 90% of the genes identified in vintage is also identified by SCAD, but only a small part of genes. But only a small part of gene is identified in which also identified by T1. So it's also indicating maybe this correlation parameter there is really close to each other. So here actually shows the estimate genetic correlation across the different traits. So you can see that the genetic correlation looks like it's sort of peaks. But even though we hear in QGL style, we have 30 sort of samples, we're still going to have a lot of variability. So it's a noise estimate, but you can sort of see the patterns within the image. pattern so that's the yellow and the sort of depletion sort of nectar warm or warm sort of thing. So that's sort of a pattern you can see in the real data set. And now if you compare those genes that are identified specifically or preferentially by say vintage versus SCAD, you will also see that their genetic correlation actually shows the expected patterns specifically. So for say genes identify the most biological Identify the most by scale only. They tend to show a higher genetic correlation aspect. And for vintage UDP identifier, they tend to be sort of abdosa. That sort of fits the intuition of our data model. And so in terms of the genetic correlation test, because the sample size is low, right? Even though we can estimate generally across the genes, the power is still low on testing each. The power is still lower has the genes identifying genes that actually mediate effects. So it turns out that the power is low, but we were still able to identify 61 significant genes across all the traits versus zero identified other computing methods. And the mean proportion of potential mediation effects of gene expression is about 24% across all traits, and the media estimate is about 12%. So it means that it is a relatively small portion of snippet effects that expression is. Of slippery effects and inspiration is mediated to inspiration. And so, showing you a couple of examples over here. So, here is K1B. So, and the TG is a genetic test, it's very significant. TI is a correlation test, it's also very significant. So, it's indicating that the significant effects on this histonic blood pressure is important here to this care body. And the furing genes, same story, a small proportion of SNP. A small proportion of SNP effects on the treaties also. And certainly, in order to improve correlation power, we need to increase sample size here. If you increase sample to 100,000 samples in the QTL, maybe you can increase the power to about 10,000. But it's still very challenging task to do. So as a summary, Vintage is a general framework for integrative analysis, and it's increased guarantee was, I suppose, Who's guarantee what's as old 72 special cases? And by estimating the genetic correlation, we quantify the proportion of SNP effects on training leading to gene expression or house, as well as the amount of information contained in QTMA study that's informative for association with students. Finally, I just want to acknowledge that the most work which is really done by excellent PhD students actually on the medical side and also collaborate with Sam World who is now doing this. Who is now meeting the music? That's all I have to be happy to answer any questions. So we have time for one very short question. How do you estimate R? Oh, estimating R. Yeah, great question. I think we written that for R it's actually relatively simple compared with genetics. Genetics are trying to differ. For the R, it turns out I think you directly estimate it's a maximum likelihood of May this were maximum likelihood of Garland's dialogue as it could have filmed.
