Okay. Okay. So can I start? Yes, please, Takeshi. Okay. Thank you for the organizers for having me in this workshop. So today I will talk about our ongoing numerical work on the problem of free decay of turbulence. So today I will talk about Lavier Stokes and also the Sherman. So this is a collaboration with So, this is a collaboration with Yurio Frisch and Alexei Maribayev and Rauru Pandit and Deepankar Roy. So, we have been working on this problem for about two years now. So, yeah, we talk about the freely decaying turbulence in this talk. So, it's a decay of turbulence, but Of turbulence, but the decay is not brought about from the wall boundary. So then the problem we like to talk about is the following. So how the energy decreases as a function of time. So usually we assume the decay of the energy is parallel and we like to determine We like to determine the exponent alpha here. So, this is, as you know, this is a very old classical problem of turbulence. And the basic assumption on this freely decaying turbulence problem is a set of semidodity. So, namely, the energy spectrum as a function of wave number and time can be described as in the following way. So, we have some characteristic velocity u, capital U. velocity u, capital U, and some characteristic length scale, capital L. And we have some sort of similar function f. And this f has is in the argument, we have wave number times this characteristic length scale. So usually this characteristic length scale is thought of as a integral scale, the so-called integral. Integral scale, the so-called integral scale. So, this is the basic assumption of the serial similarity in the decaying problem. Okay, so more specifically, in a classical setting, we assume the energy spectrum has two parts. So, in the low wave number part, we have some constant A times wavenumber to the power n. times wavelength to the power n and this region extends from zero to one over l t and on the right hand on the on your right so we have column over spectrum so we have energy dissipation rate now this is dependent on time and we have k to the minus five third spectrum and this extends uh this in Extends this in the wave numbers larger than one over L. So this A and B are considered to be constant. It doesn't depend, they don't depend on time. And this N, for some technical reasons, so N is bounded from between 1 minus 1 and 4. And given this spectrum, so we have a nice phenomenological theory predicting the energy decays like t times. Decays like t times this exponent, and the integral scales grow with this power. So the exponent is given by this exponent n. And so the total energy is defined as in this way. So v is the volume of the fluid, and this is the integral of the energy spectrum. And the integral scale is defined in the isotropic setting. In the isotropic setting can be defined with the energy spectrum. Okay, so this kind of cell similar changes of the energy spectrum is the standard assumption of the decaying problem. Okay, so this is one example of the numerical simulation. So we start with initial energy spectrum. Initial energy spectrum, we prescribe the function of the energy spectrum. The phases of the Fourier modes are given by random numbers. So we set the parallel on your left is k to the square. And we put this initial data to the Navier-Stokes equation. But now please know that we are using hyper-viscosity. Know that we are using hyper-viscosity to uh yeah, it's a poor man's way of increasing the Reynolds number. So anyway, so we use the hyperviscosity and we put this initial data to the hyperviscous Nervous Stokes. Then the spectral evolution looks like this. So this k to this k squared part is more or less preserved during the decay. Decay and for the large wave numbers, the spectrum first grows and seems to develop some kind of inertia range. And this is somewhat similar to the classical picture of the decaying process. So, in this setting, so the energy decreases in this way. So, this is a log-log plot. So, this is a prediction of the classical phenomenology for the k-squared spectrum. And this is the integral scale defined in the same way as I showed in the previous slide. So, it first decreases and started to grow. And it's close to the very close to the classical prediction for the k-squared spectrum. So, this is all so far so good. So, this is a close. So far, so good. So, this is a classical picture of the free decay of the Navier-Sox, although we are using hyper-viscosity here. So, I talked about the basic assumption of the classical problem. And so, the question we like to address here is: can one break the serosimilarity? Can one break this pseudosimilarity I presented? sort of similarity I presented here and I should add yeah we can add an isotopy and or helicity to the initial data but it it seems they are not enough to break the serial similarity for example as discussed by Yoshimatsun Canada in a series of papers so how can we break Break this self-similarity by changing the initial condition to a somewhat non-standard manner. So that's a question we like to address. So here, so yeah, this is the first proposed by Deepankaroy. So yeah, let's start with some localized energy spectrum localized around some wavelength of Kc and C and some widths sigma equal to so it's just a simple Gaussian localized energy spectrum. The phases of the Fourier modes are given by a random number. So we put this initial condition to the Navier-Stokes equation. Again, we are using hyper-viscosity. So what we will get is this thing. So this is the initial localized energy spectrum. Localized energy spectrum. So as it evolves, so this localized energy spectrum start to, let's say, diffuse to higher wave number and also the lower wave numbers. And it soon develops some kind of straight line in the low wave number region, as you can see. So the earlier So the earliest time I plot here is time 0.05, so 0.5 still has some dimple here, but it has some developed part here. So it close to the k cubed, but on the large wave number part, yeah, we still, yeah, we have something and yeah, we basically we don't see the nice case. We don't see the nice K to the five thirds, but it develops the spectrum develops some peculiar manner. So let's say the energy spectrum in the low wave number part has some constant, depends on time, and the wave number dependence is k cubed, and this emerges first. Then yeah, we may have something different here. Something different here, but we are not sure this k to the one-half is really something definite. But let's say this k cubed part is something worth studying. So, the energy for this localized initial condition. So, the point here plotted. The point plotted here is the numerical data. So, here I fit this energy with this function. And yeah, you may say it's a log log plot. So it's just a straight line, but if you look at it closely, it's not really a straight line, as I show you in the next slide. So we take this so-called log. Take this so-called logarithmic local slope of this total energy as a function of time. So the data looks like this. So it's not, yeah, if it's a pure parlour, if the total energy is a pure parlour of time, then the logarithmic local slope gives you a plateau in this plot. But here we have some straight line degrees. Straight line, decreasing straight line. And here I plot with this part with this kind of linear function of log t. So this is just empirical. We still don't have a good understanding of this behavior, but its functional form is quite reminiscent of so-called Kedah law for the decaying burger disturbedness. So for the decaying So, for the decaying, for this Kidder law of the burgeon sturvidence, is gives you the constant B 1.0 and A to 1 half. But here, the value of these constants determined by the least square fitting gives you B around 1 and A is rather small. Okay, so for this local. For this localized initial spectrum, there are several parameters. So, maybe the most important parameter is the Kc, the wave number of the peak of the initial spectrum. So, I change this Kc in various ways and I change the resolution, and sometimes I use the pure Navistox, the Newtonian viscosity. And I showed you the time. And I showed you the time evolution of the energy spectrum. So they all show k-cubed spectrum. These straight lines are all k-cubed slope. So maybe the k-cubed energy spectrum is something robust. Okay, so now we like to argue this k-third spectrum can be handled. K-3 spectrum can be understood in the rather simple manner. So, the starting point is the evolution equation of the energy spectrum, sometimes called the lean equation. So, the time derivative of the energy spectrum is given by the nonlinear energy transfer function and viscosity. And yeah, if we go back to the old work of Proudvan and Reed. Proudman and Reed, and they considered your velocity is Gaussian and independent. And for this setting, they develop a closure. So it's kind of the first order moments of velocity can be described with a combination of the product of second order moments. So they developed the class. They developed the closure, and in particular, they considered the time derivative of the energy transfer. So, this quantity involves a fourth-order moments, and this time derivative of the energy transfer can be written in this way, under this assumption. So, let's put our initial localized energy spectrum for this expression. spectrum for this expression. So the time t goes zero, the energy spectrum is localized at Kc, then this is zero, zero. So we only need to consider the third integral here. And we only consider this k prime and k2 prime around kc. So this gives you e at E at kc squared, and just with some simple algebra, we have this kind of behavior at the leading order. So this time derivative of the energy transfer gives you the k cubed. And since we have this relation and we arrive at the energy spectrum at short time is proportional. Time is proportional to k cubed by using the closure of the Proudhon read. And by construction, this assumption is valid for our initial condition because we prescribe it as a Gaussian random Fourier MOS. Okay, so it's just a summary of how this calculation can be done. So this is an expression of the Bradley read, and this is. The Bradley read, and this is zero, zero. And the third part, we only consider the K prime and Kc, and here is Kc. And we put here is Kc, Kc, and we arrive at this one. So this Q is given by this formula. So in this manner, we have a K-cubed behavior. Okay, the K-cubed spectrum. The K-Q spectrum may be okay, but the problem is how can we understood, how can one understand this behavior? So in the previously, I showed you the evolution of the energy spectrum for different Kc, but and I showed you the robustness of the K cube of the spectrum. But here The evolution decay of the total energy looks rather different. Yeah, they depends very much on Kc. So this is a decay of the total energy in the log-log scale, and the different line corresponds to the different Kc. And if I take the logarithmic local slope of this graph, and we have this kind of graph. And we have this kind of behavior. So, this light blue curve is the one I showed you before, but sometimes this slope is positive for large Kc. And if I increase, yeah, if we increase the resolution, it seems that this positive slope probably is something Is something real, and this negative slope may be caused by a finite size effect. But in any case, it approaches to some constant. And this constant, in this case, it's minus four thirds. And actually, this minus four thirds is exponent determined by the classical phenomenology with k to the cube energy spectrum at. Energy spectrum at the low wave number region. Okay, so this is a yeah, let me go back to the basic assumption of the service similarity. So this is a classical setting with k squared part of the energy spectrum is prescribed initially. But for this localized initial condition, Initial condition, we didn't prescribe the low K part scaling law, but it spontaneously develops the K cube part. So with the self-similarity assumption, it looks like it's like this. So we can just fish out the self-similar function. Similar function in this manner from the numerical data. So, this energy spectrum and also the E of t and L of T, they are all given by the numerical simulation. And we plot this function as a function of k times L T. So, this purple curves is a classical setting. So, let's So let's look at this part: the energy containing range, the collapse. Yeah, this collapse just shows you the function f. The collapse for this k-squared initial condition is rather good, but for the localized initial energy spectrum, the collapse in the energy-containing region is, let's say, worse than the classical setting. So, this discrepancy. So, this discrepancy suggests the breakdown of self-similarity for the localized initial spectrum. You have 10 minutes. Okay. So I just quickly go with the Savro Shermodel. And this share model result is very is not connected to the Navier-Stokes case. I just warn you. So we consider the subrusser model given in this way. Russia model given in this way. So Un is a complex number, it's a model of Fourier MOs in a wave number shell, and Kn is a wave number given by the geometric series of lambda n. So here lambda is 2. And here we stick to the classical setting of the initial spectrum. We prescribe the power law, wavelength number to the power m initially. So, this is a k-squared prescribed initial spectrum, and the evolution from this k-squared prescribed initial condition looks like this. So, soon it develops, k to the five-third. It's very good. And yeah, let's look at this curve, this light blue curve. So, the light blue spectrum still have a k-squared part. squared part and k to the minus five third but here it has some deviation from the k squared and this part looks quite interesting for example if you know the so-called gervata phenomenon or angthomson phenomenology for the non-cell similar decay and this shell model results looks very Model results look very much the same, very looks similar to those Rubata phenomenon or Eyn-Thompson picture of the breakdown of self-similarity. So that's why we are interested in the decay of the shadow model in this setting. But if we look at the energy as a function of time or the integral scale as a function of time for the shadow model, the behavior is quite different from The behavior is quite different from the classical phenomenology. So, the integral scale for the shared model is defined in a similar manner for the Navier Stokes. So, since we prescribed k squared part here, if the phenomenology of Combello coarsing is correct, energy decreases as T to the minus 6 over 5. 6 over 5 and the integral scale grows as t to the 2/5. But here, very different behavior is observed. So, initially, energy decreases as t to the minus 0.75, and the integral scale grows as t to the 0.66. And this value determined by the fit with my native. By the fit with my naked eye. So the exponent is rather arbitrary here, but in this time from 0.01 to let's say 10,000 in this temporal region, we have basically this. Basically, this some intermediate part corresponds to this time region. Okay, so yeah, the remark is that this t minus two part is well known in the Shermodel study of the Luvov 2003. So I change the initial spectrum from k squared to k fourth. The result is The result is actually the same. It doesn't depend. Yeah, this part does not depend on this parlor in the low wave numbers that we prescribed. So far, yeah, we tried several things, but still we don't have a good explanation for this behavior. But yeah, for this intermediate. Yeah, for this intermediate part of the spectrum, it can be explained in a rather simple phenomenology, but I skip here. But just to summarize, for the shared model with a prescribed disk energy spectrum, the evolution of the energy spectrum takes this form for as a transient, actually. So, anyway, so this. So, anyway, so this part emerges spontaneously. Okay, but the total energy decreases as in this way, and this exponent does not depend on the exponent m here. And the integral scale grows in this manner, and the exponent does not depend on the exponent m again. So, this is the things we'd like to explain, but so far we don't have a good argument for this. Argument for this. Okay, so this is a summary of my talk. So I stop here. Thank you so much. Thank you, Takishi. Thank you very much. We do have time.
