The volume is very low. Can you make it louder? Just trying to get you my slides are hiding the control. I don't know. Uh, Jerome, can you hear me? Can you hear me now better? No, it's much better. Yes, yes. Yes, so now it's stopped. Now I'm now volume. It's back to low volume? Yes. What did it do? So now here. Now, here it's fine. Now it's good. So now let us hope that everything. Now you have sound and image. Yes, both. Thanks. Okay. Sorry for the. Thank you very much for this opportunity to understand here. No, Jean, now it's back to low volume. Something happens when you go to. What is happening here? It's not saved, or it doesn't keep time, yes. Try again. For the time, yes. So, thank you. Is it still okay? No, it doesn't work. Now first let us open this, check this. Now it's better for the sound. Now it's good. The problem is when when you go to the slab it's for sound. When you go to the slides, for some reason, yeah, for some reason that now it's again low now, it's again low, and now it's again high. Now it's high, yes. Okay, I'll try to keep an eye on this. So, let me. So, is it still okay for the volume? The moment, yes. The moment, yes, yes. Okay. So it's really, I just don't know it's bad. Now it's bad. Now it's bad again. Is it it's fine again now? No, it's fine. Yes. Okay. So let me try again. Let me try again. Let us go forward. So I was saying, so thank you for this indeed. I don't know how to help you with this. It's still low now. Do you have different options for microphones or headphones? Maybe there is a conflict between things if you try to discuss. Conflict between things if you try to disconnect. How can you hear me now? We can hear you, yes. No, we can, yes. I cannot hear you anymore, in fact. I cannot hear anything now. If you can hear me, it's perfect. It's fine. Okay, now what is happening with my sound? I would like to hear something because if you say to me that things Because if you say to me that things can you speak again so that I can check, yes, can you hear us? No, I don't hear okay. I'm writing to John in the chat that he can hear. We hear him at the moment. Okay, can you hear me now still? Yes. Okay. Can you hear us too? Yes. Yes. I can hear you somehow. Yes. I can just last check. Can you just speak a last line so that I can check? Yes, can you hear us? Yes, now I can hear you. And it seems to be. And we can hear you. And it's another microphone, so let us hope that the microphone. I'm going to see what happens when you open the slides. So did I share? No, I didn't share the slides. No, you're not sharing. Not sharing. So let me share now the screen. Okay, so can you still hear me? And can you see the slides? So far, so good. Okay, so I'm going to present you some joint work I did with Antonin Monté and Rémy Rodiac. So there's a Paris team, but in fact, we did this when they were postdoc at UC Luvaint. And then there's the work, very recent, so there's some recent work and some very recent work. Recent work and some very recent work with Benoit van Warenberg, who was a master's student last year and he was now beginning since a few days a PhD here in Nouven M. And so the problem I want to speak about today is a problem, the starting point, you can think that it's a prime of harmonic extension. And so harmonic extension in the Schalier case, that's a kind of easy problem. You're solving the Dirichlet problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions. With Erich boundary conditions, and you get, if you are working in good spaces, and there's a whole theory about knowing how you could do things in good spaces, is that your solution is going to be as regular as the boundary data allows it to be. And if you are asking the right questions in the right framework, that's the message of regularity theory. Man, what you get if you want to go to a similar process. To go to a similar problem of minimizing the Dirichlet energy, you can wonder what is going to happen when you are working with some bond or even some values restricting your map, you having its taking its value not in R anymore, but taking its value in a Riemannian manifold. And of course, minimizing the functional is a kind of easy problem to write. Problem to write, you're just adding a constraint. You still have something on the side of equations, but you're going to end up something, some equation related to the second fundamental form. And if you go there, so this is a kind of much more difficult problem, but you're still in 2D. And so there's something very nice in the two-dimensional case is that you recover if you have a solution, or essentially, if the set of functions in the subless spaces for which Subless spaces for which this energy is finite and this boundary condition is satisfied, it's not empty, then there exists a solution, and this solution will be kind of as regular as the boundary data allows it to be if you're asking the right questions, etc. in the right space. But you have something, if you have a smooth boundary data, you have a smooth harmonic MAP as an extension. But there's a great question here. So there's the fine print here that I put on bold on my slide. That I put on bold on my slides, you have this if. So you need to have this if two-dimensional. Okay, we can be happy with two-dimensional. But then there's this question that you have some kind of version here of the Weier-Spress theorem. And an easy mistake in stating this theorem in the beginner courses is to forget stating that the domain should be a non-empty set. And here, the fact that it's non-empty plays an important role. So there's a question, what has So, there's a question: what happens? So, in some sense, you can have failure here, not because you have some problems of functional analysis, regularity theory, calculus of variations or whatever. It's not related to your functional. It's related to the fact that you can have an empty domain and just working with the functional is just some elaborate nonsense on the empty set. This is something you just do not want. Something you just do not want to have. And so the fact is that this can happen. And so the one thing that you have in two dimensions is that having a continuous extension or having a smooth extension is going, having a the fact that you can have a smooth, a nice extension for any boundary data to a function which is in the right space happens if and only if your manifold is simply connected. So you can say I'm happy only with simply connected domains. Only with simply connected domains. The problem is that you have problems of finding minimizers of such energies that you would like to have in several settings. We had some setting of superconductivity in which you would take as the target manifold a unit circle. In liquid crystals, you would take a projective plane or a projective line. And you have situations also coming from geometrical problems in which you would take, so SO3 over. You would take so SO3 over O is the group. So you take a cube and you take all the possible configurations of your cubes up to its isometry. So if I take a cube and I rotate it 90 degrees around one of its faces, if I didn't put any numbers like on the dice, I cannot see any difference on my cube. And I say this is the same thing. So this is the idea of quotienting here. And this is something people in computer graphics and In computer graphics and meshing for numerical methods, they are interested in as a way of finding a continuous field that will prescribe how you can put some alignment of cubes and perform some nice mission. So, this is the motivation where it is coming from. And so, the problem there is that you have a problem without any solution. And then there are several ways of still, sometimes you would like to minimize this thing. You would like to minimize this thing, you just know that this just does not make sense. And so the strategy is to say, let us look at a problem that in some sense is slightly relaxed, in which there will exist a minimizer, and that minimizer will be close enough to something which would be or a limiting object. And so there are two strategies. So first strategy is kind of called Ginsburg Land or relaxation. You say, let us assume that the manifold disembed. Assume that the manifold is embedded into some ambient space. And let us say that we add a second term to our functional, and we require this second term to be to vanish on the manifold and to have a very high one over epsilon squared factor in front of it, which will make it blow up when epsilon is large enough. And so you typically think that when epsilon is small, you wouldn't want to go outside of your manifold. Go outside of your manifold unless you really need to do it, say, for topological reasons. And so that's one way of doing things. Another way is to say if I take w1p with p less than 2, then I have a space which is larger. And in fact, this space turns out to be large enough so that suddenly you have a non-empty, an even large sub-wave space is going to happen. And then you can wonder what happens to minimizers of this functional when Of this functional when p is going to 2. You can either think, let us change the gradient term with a different power, and so that we have a non-empty space, or let us say that we can move outside of the manifold, but say that this is going to cost to be very expensive. And so we penalize this kind of very high. And so what you expect is that when epsilon goes to zero or when p goes to two, you find something that should be the substance. That should be the substitute of a minimizer of the Dirichlet energy. So, this is probably the most natural kind of object you can have. And so, does it converge? How does it converge? Where are the singularities? So, those are the questions. And so, now I want to go through what is done. And so, first question is: what's happening to first thing you want to know is what is happening to this minimizing energy. And so, if you have the circle, And so, if you have the circle, what you're going to have is that you're going to have that minimizers of this energy. They are going to behave. So, this is going to, of course, one thing you expect is that when epsilon is going to zero, this should blow up. This should go to infinity because you know that the problem in the limit does not make any sense. So, if you just take formally the limit when epsilon goes to zero, the problem does not have any solution. So, the only way to get something reasonable is To get something reasonable, is to have it blowing up, and you can see how this is going to blow up the rates. You can see that this is the energy divided by log epsilon is going to converge to some quantity. So, that's the first order asymptotics. And you can say the same thing, the energy here with respect to P, this should blow up when P is going to two. And so, if you put a pre-factor two minus P, you get here the nice things that this result by Hardenland minus five and between Brasé Lan for Gesbo Plando. And between President Foucault's MoPlando, you get exactly the same factor at the first order. So it's pi times the degree, so that which measures the number of turns that the boundary condition is making. So this is what is happening. And so I just want to explain to you how you get this kind of asymptotic. So I'm not going to explain to you everything. So in such cases, what's this kind of easy to obtain once you know what you want to get is upper bound. And so the way to get upper bound is essentially bound is essentially taking a function that behaves like x over modulus of x around each singularity. So you have some fixed things and then you have this construction which is depending on epsilon. So if you perform this kind of construction, you will get some energy that behaves. So if you perform the integration of these things, you get exactly this factor pi ln 1 over epsilon. And if you think in terms of the And if you think in terms of the degree, so here I have a boundary datum with degree three, I should put three of them. So I will have three times pi times this logarithm of one over epsilon which comes from the integration. If you want to look at the p-energy, you have the same kind of computations you're making, except you're ending up here with a factor of 2 pi over 2 minus p. This is just some kind of exercise about integration that gives you the factor that you have here. The factor that you have here. Of course, the interesting thing is that there's another construction that gives you a lower bound and that the lower bound matches the upper bound. But once you have this construction, you can guess what you should have in the general case. Because if you have in a general case, what you're going to put here, of course, x over modus of x, it's an element of your unit circle. This does not necessarily make sense. But you could think that you have some maps, gamma one, gamma two, gamma three, etc., that go from those. that go from the circle into your manifold n. And if you make this kind of, you just make this pre this post-composition with your path, you get the same kind of computations that give you the same kind of upper bound. And you see that you have here factors. So when you see here, you have this kind of kinetic energy of map around here. If you want to minimize this, you would better take a GOD. This, you would better take a geodesic, and here on the right, for the p-energy, you want to let p go to two. And anyway, for any p, you will get a geodesic. And at the end, you will get what is the energy, the two energy of a geodesic when you let p go to two here on the right-hand side. And so, this is what the formal computations give you. And so now there is a quantity that you can construct. And so, I'm going to explain a little bit. To explain a little bit how this quantity is coming from the construction, the idea is that you're going to take your domain and then you're going to look whether you have an extension G outside of disks and you're going to take an energy. So you're going to connect some geodesics, some small disks to your boundary condition. So you're going to wonder, can I find some finite combination of disks and boundary conditions? And boundary conditions on those disks that are geodetics that I can connect, and then I will take the sum of the energy of those geodesics. And so, this is a problem in which you have lots of parameters. So, you have your geodetics, you have your disks, etc. But you can think about it. Essentially, you have, if you think about in terms of the energies that you have, you have basically you. Basically, you will have finitely many geodesics that you really need to take into account because if you have infinitely many of them, the energy is going to somehow blow up. So, you have some kind of obstruction problem from obstruction that you can rework as a combinatorial problem. And in the case of the circle, this is the condition that the sum of the degree is equal to the degree of the boundary. But in more general cases, you do not know this depends on the way that you can connect them to each other. Can connect them to each other together, and there is no one-to-one connection between the boundary data and the possible charges of the singularity. So, you have those kind of topological charges from the boundary singularities. And you have, if you have a minimizer for which the way to minimize, you can minimize it. If you consider some boundary data, and you will take exactly the same geodesic, or you just need one geodesic to put inside. This is a part. To put inside, this is a particularly simple case, which is the case atomic, which is the atomic case. So, those are the ones that the optimal configuration will be to take exactly always a single geodesic info. And so, if you do this, you get exactly the same results at the leading order as Vituel's resistional, something done by Giacomo Canevaria in 2015. And for the p-energy, you get the same kind of thing. P-energy, you get the same kind of thing. So you have your degree, which is replaced by some singular energy related to the way of filling. So you're putting some small disks in your domain and finding whether you can find an extension. So maybe one thing to say is that you can reformulate this in terms of algebraic topology. There's just a difficulty is that you need to work with free homotopic classes. And so free homotopic classes, they are related not to elements. They are related not to elements of your fundamental group, but to conjugacy classes of your fundamental group. And so, if you want to make any computations, you need to go through all those conjugacy relationships to find whether something is reasonable. But everything is, you end up with finite, say, combinatorial problems that are, you know, you have finitely many choices in many cases, but the number of choices grows fast and such problems. So for the So, for the circle, just to explain, I'm just going to give you to show you that this can be computed. For the circle, you get the degree, and then you have different cases. So, the case I mentioned, the hexagrad space, if you take the cube, you have atomic. So, you need to look at the fundamental group of this thing. And this is related to rotations that you can perform geodetically are related to rotations of your cube. Of your cube. And so those rotations, you will have among the atomic geodesics, you will have something which is a 90-degree rotation of a phase. But this was something that's not a surprise. You also have, if you can take a rotation around a diagonal, and this is also going to be a minimizer. So you can have a kind of atomic minimizer. So you can have a rich structure in which the singularities that can appear in the decomposition, you can have several of them, you have lots of combinations. you had lots of combinations related to combinatorics and then you can look at other platonic solids uh tetrahedron the decahedron interesting point is that you get something that the point carries here which is a well-known counterexample in enterprise topology and so this is the first thing that you get so the first order you can locate it you can see what is going to happen at the first order thanks to a kind of combinatorial problem but this does say essentially the number of singularities that you're going The number of singularities that you're going to have. So now, second question is: where are going to be the singularities? Where are the singularities going to be? So the singularities, they are going to be at places. So if you look at the word book by Bethuel Bris and Elain, so they say that the singularities, they minimize what is called a renormalized energy. And if you look at the renormalized energy, you have a formula here for the renormalized energy. Formula here for the renormalized energy. And don't need to go through the whole problem, but what I want to emphasize here is that at the end, you need to solve a Dirichlet problem with some Dirac deltas at some places. And thanks to the properties of these green functions, you can make some computations and also things related to your, which is also depending on your boundary data here, but thanks to all those things, you combine them. Thanks to all those things, you combine them together, and you get something that you can compute thanks to linear problems. And so this is a kind of, let's say, you can rewrite things in terms of green functions of linear problems. One thing that you cannot dream in general is to have this. So in the nonlinear case, I just want to say this is really related to the structure that S1, if you take the unit. One, if you take the universal covering of the circle, the circle, this is the line, the real line that you wind on itself several times. And you have this kind of scalar feature behind your problems here. And you're losing this kind of scalar feature when you're working with the non-linear problem. And so, what we have as a definition of the renormalized energy is we say essentially, let us take Say essentially, let us take the Dirichlet energy outside a small disk and let us look at what is going to happen when the radius is going to go to zero. When the radius is going to zero, what you have here in the instant is going to blow up. Let us correct this by something that we know about how this is going to blow up. So we know that this is going to blow up related to some constant rate of blow-up. So there's going to be some way. So, there's going to be some way it is going to blow up. And so, we make, we subtract this, and we get some finite limit, something that is, in fact, locally lipstick continuous on the dependence of the point here, and it has some coerciity, repulsivity properties, which means that you have some function which is bounded from below and has the properties that if you have several points converging to each other, there is some kind of repulsion properties in good cases, which makes that. In good cases, which makes that several singularities. If you want to minimize this kind of quantity, they're not going to like to converge to each other in many cases, not in all cases. There are some technicalities here. And so another thing that we have is that when you want to think about the minimizing geodesic, you can have several minimizers. We have this kind of torus, which has a smaller inner radius at two different places. And you have, if you want to look at minimizing geodesic, Want to look at minimizing geodesics that go through the whole of the torus, you have two of them, and they are not the same. So, there is some geometrical feature in the renormalized energy related to the fact that working on a geodesic here on the left side is not the same as working on the one here on the upper right side of my picture here. There is some cost of moving from one geodetic to the other geodetic to even To even if you try to do it very slowly in a kind of heteroclinic connection for harmonic math, this is going to cost you something. And this defines a metric about the way that defines that measures the way that you can connect together two different geodesics. And so once you have this, so there's also a notion of what we call renormalized maps. So we can say the same thing for the energy of points. We can say, can we say if we have a map that has a very singular behavior? Very singular behavior. Can we define some energy? Yes, we can define some energy if you're removing the singular region and subtract if one that is related to the way that it should go. So we have renormalized energies for configurations of points, renormalize energies for configurations of for mappings. And so what we get as an asymptotic result, we get as an asymptotic result is that if you look at the Ginsburg-Klando energy, Look at the Geiswalk land of energy, the minimizer should minimize or renormalize, and the configuration of points will minimize the renormalized energy. So then there is a small thing is that if you think about the Gibbs Rock-Landow energy, you have a second nonlinear term. So the term with the F of U here. And this is going to play also a role. So you have something which is depending on the topological charges. And so the choice of your charges and the choice. Choice of your charges and the choice of your points is going to minimize this quantity, and so you have an additional term, an additional correction, which is coming from the kind of small scale behavior of your minimizer. So this is the first thing. Another result we get, so the result you get is really parallel here, but the results are becoming too technical to put them on a single slide, both next to each other. So the other thing we get together with The other thing we get together with Benoit and Ballenbeck is the same thing if you take the p-energy, you get the same thing that you get the point which is minimizing the renormalized energy. So this means in particular, if you take the two different relaxations, in many cases, you should end up on the same limiting map. You know, it's a minimizer of some function from R2 to R, unless you have two different minimum points, and in which case you do not know which one you're doing. Which case you do not know which one you're going to choose. In a case where you have a single minimal point, they should converge to the same kind of to the same configuration of point. Same thing for the harmonic map. So that's maybe the next step. The next step you can look at what's going to... So this is the kind of way the configuration pointing is convert. A second thing we get is that if we have some sequence of maps that are not exactly minimized. That are not exactly minimizers, but they have some reasonably bonded energy. We get also that you get some weak type bonds on the sequence here, and we get the fact that QNK is going to converge to some U star, which is going to satisfy some lower semicontinuity information. So, we know something about the renormalized energy of the U star. In particular, if we have a sequence of minimizers, U star is going to be a minimizer, and so it's going to be some kind of Minimizer, it's just going to be some kind of harmonic map that has some singularities, and the singularities are chosen in an optimal way. This is what we're going to get here. And second thing you can get, so you get exactly a parallel result for minimizers of the p harmony. Sorry, there's a two here that should be a p here, but you get exactly the same kind of convergence. Same kind of convergence for your minimizers here or for your quasi-minimizers here. And there's a small technicality that you will have sequences which will be bounded in a weak space, but there's going to be small perturbation, which is going to convert. So I put here that it's bounded in LPN. This means that the LPN norm of the derivative of u n has going to be a part, sorry, the whole is not going to be bound, but there's a part of the derivative of u n. Of the derivative of u n, which is going to be, if you take its norm in L Pn, the quantity is going to remain bounded. So that's what I mean here by being bounded in L Pn here. And so a last thing we had is that, and so this was in fact the original question that of Matanot who Heimbridge is around the Ginsburg-Lander equation was if you take the unit circle and if you take the identity as a boundary condition, what can you Identity as a boundary condition, what can you say about the limit? And so, what we get, this is the last result we got with Antonin Monte-Rémy Rodiac, was the information that if you have a simply connected domain and if you have a nice boundary condition, so this is a minimum, if it's a minimizing geodesic, which is, if I call in the decomposition of singularities, it's an atomic that means that you have no interest of putting two singularities in. Of putting two singularities inside, then we can prove that you have exactly the same renormalized energy as the one for the Ginsburg-Klando energy. And so, this means that, in particular, in simple cases, if you have the circle, we have the situation which is renormalized energy is going to be this precise quantity, which means that solutions will concentrate, will have exactly a singularity at the center, and you expect to have minimizers that are going to be homogeneous functions. Going to be homogeneous functions of the form that depend on x over modulus of x inside the domain. So, this is what I wanted to tell you. So, I hope it wasn't over cramped because of the format here. And I said, sorry about the microphone problems at the beginning. Thank you. Thanks, Jan. Jan. Thank you for your talk. Thanks for your talk. Are there any questions or comments? I don't see any questions, so I would thank Jean again for his nice. Jean again for his nice meeting. Thank you very much. Thank you.
