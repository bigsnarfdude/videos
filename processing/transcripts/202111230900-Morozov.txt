That I can't participate in person because of this commit. Well, my talk is about applications of the moving frames, the technique based on the moving frames, to integrable systems of partial differential equations. Well, let me start with the picture. Is the picture okay? Can you see the picture? Well, or no, this is the post. Well, or no, this is the poster of the movie. No, we can't see. We can't see. We see all the scan. Okay, well, forget it. So, well, in my talk, what happens? In my talk, the integrable system will be systems that admit lex representations. There is a number. There is a number of different definitions of integrable systems. They are interrelated, but they are not equivalent. Well, in my story, integrable system or integrable PDE, partial differential equation, is equation that admits a Lax representation. Well, Lax representations are also known as Zerakarovich representations or Wolkistabruk structures. Volkist-Testerbrug structures or integrable extensions or differential coverings. They are the starting point for applying, for using such techniques as invert scattering transformations, B-Hamiltonian structures, recursion operators, Baclan transformations, Larou transformations, and so on. Therefore, the problem of finding Finding intrinsic conditions, conditions that are defined in terms of, in internal terms of equation, and that ensure existence of a Lux representation is of great importance in the theory of integrable PGs. Well, the PGE is considered as subject. Sub manifold in the bundle of infinite jets, jets of functions from n linear space to m linear space. And this system is defined by this sub-manifold is defined by this system of equations. Well, and a Lux representation is a novoiderminant system. An overdetermined system with new dependent variables v they perhaps there are finite number of these variables or infinite number. These variables are referred to as pseudopotentials of the Lux representation. And the requirement is the following: this system is compatible if. If and only if the equation is satisfied. If so, we say that this system, this over-determined system, defines Lux representation of our equation, perhaps the most general definition of the Lux representation. Well, Lux representations, this system can be obtained by setting equal to zero Equal to zero these forms, the so-called Walkest-Sterbrook forms of our Lex representation. Then the requirement, this requirement, this definition of Lux representation can be reformulated in the following manner. We say that exterior differentials of this volcanist-testabrogue forms should be equal, modular forms themselves. equal modular forms themselves with non-zero forms eta, the veg products with a collection of some non-zero forms eta and modular sum two forms, certain two forms, omega capital A, and the requirement is the following these two forms are equal to zero if and only if our equation is satisfied. Is satisfied well the starting point of the approach that I'm I'm well I will discuss is the following observation this equation this equation for the Maurer carton For the Maurer-Cartan, for the walk-systems, looks similar to the equation that defines twisted extensions of Lie algebras. Well, the main idea of the approach is to attack the problem, the problem of finding invariant intrinsic conditions, ensuring existence. Ensuring Luxembourg existence of Luxempresentation using the structure theory of Lie pseudo-groups and the theory of extensions of Lie algebras. Specifically, the idea is to search for the Walk with the Stabroup forms of the supposed Lux representation as a linear combination of the Maurer-Cartan forms of a certain extension of the symmetry algebra of the PDE under the. Symmetry algebra of the PDE under the study. Well, let me start from the perhaps the simplest situation. Let me discuss twisted extensions of Lie algebras. Well, suppose we have a Lie algebra, an abstract Lie algebra gene, Lie algebra over the field of real numbers, and it has a basis Vm. M is well. M is well, Lie algebra is infinite dimensional, and M runs from one to infinity. Okay. And sorry, sorry, some, some, some, okay, some, some message, okay. Well, commutators of these basic, basis elements produce structure constants. This structure Structure constants, these structure constants are skew symmetric with respect to row indexes and satisfy Jacob identity. Well, we consider linear mappings on our Lie algebra such that which are dual to the basis, such that this condition holds. And define differential by Cartan's formula, by this formula, the differential of one four. Differential of one form is a two form, and its value on the pair of vectors is minus value of the form itself on the commutator of these vectors. Then, this equation for commutators can be reformulated as the Maurer-Cartan structure equations for our Lie algebra in terms of these dual forms. They are referred to as. Forms, they are referred to as Maurer-Cartan forms for Lie algebra G. Well, now suppose there is one form, there is such a mapping such that its differential is equal to zero. Such forms generate the linear space of such forms is referred to the first homologic group of Auli algebra. Group of our real geometry. Then, for fixed real number C, we define new differentials, the so-called twisted differential G C alpha by the following formula. This new differential acts on some form omega in this manner, the usual differential, the differential defined above, minus this veg product. Minus this veg product. Then, from the fact that alpha, the differential of alpha is equal to zero, it follows that square of new differential, the twist differential, is equal to zero. So there arises differential complex. Well, and well, suppose we have a non-trivial twisted Tuca cycle. We have two form. We have two forms which satisfies the following requirement. Its differential is equal to this combination, this wedge product. Or that is to say that twisted differential of this omega is omega capital is equal to zero for some fixed value of constant c and moreover this Twisted cassycle is not a linear combination of twisted differentials of one form from our Leolog. There is no combination, no linear combination of thetas such that the twisted differential is equal to the form omega capital. Such forms generate the second twisted homology group, such omega capital, the second twisted Such omega capital, the second twist homology groups, group of our Lie algebra, and this group, this linear space actually is denoted by the following symbol. Well, if we have such a non-trivial caseycle, we can write this equation for unspecified form sigma, form sigma, and the same value of constant c then. Then we say this equation is automatically compatible with the structure equations of our algebra. So, and moreover, this sigma is linearly independent with all the Maurer-Cartan forms of our Lie algebra. Therefore, appending this equation, this appending this equation this equation named star to the structure equations of our Lie algebra yields new system of structure equations for some new Lie algebra which is called the twisted which is referred to the twisted extension of initial Lie algebra G and we'll name it a G tiller well this equation Well, this equation, equation star, looks similar to the equation for the Woke-System work forms. This equations. And actually this observation, this simple observation was the first observation in this in my attempts to construct this approach. Well, now let Now let me show how this definition of twisted extension of Fourier algebra works in attempts to construct Lax representations. I'll take the first example, the hyper-CR equation for Einstein Weil. Equation for Einstein while structures, this equation, then the Lie algebra of contact symmetries of this equation. It is not, it's more or less simple to compute all of them. This Lie algebra is generated by infinite prolongations of the following vector fields. The coefficients zeta, zeta1 to zeta four, have the following expression. Expressions, they depend on four. Expressions, they depend on four families of arbitrary functions of the variable t, these functions. Well, a0 to a3 and these coefficients, these zetas, depend on two constants, c0 and c1. Well, we consider the actually the sub-algebra of the Of the Lie algebra of contact symmetries when functions are analytic, really analytic, real analytic. Then we apply the technique based on the moving frames to find, to construct the structure equations and the modern carton forms for this Lie algebra. We replace in We replace independent variables t, x, y, and u by formal parameters h1, etc., h4. Formal parameters, this means that their differentials are equal to zero, while they are not constants. We can differentiate with respect to these parameters, but when we take Take the and the differentials of this form of parameters are equal to zero. We replace a coefficients of the series these coefficients we replace by one forms theta km and constants replace by forms alpha one and alpha zero and alpha one one forms One forms from the dual space to our L. Then the coefficients zeta are replaced by formal series of one forms. They are denoted mu of h. We consider the column of this constituted by this one form and the matrix of And the matrix of partial derivatives of this formal series with respect to parameters. Then the structure equations looks in this nice form detail. It is the technique based on the moving frames for constructing the structure equation in Maurer-Cartan forms. as it is explained in the following proposed in the following papers okay now we can write the structure equations in a bit simple form more simple form if we denote if we we consider the following Formal series, we add new formal variable H0 and consider the following series. This new formal variable is well meets the following condition. In the H0 in the degree K is equal to 0, when K is greater than 3, then the structure. Then the structure equations for our Lie algebra, for the Lie algebra of symmetries of our equation, requires the following form, the following simple form. Well, the Maurer-Cartan forms are known. Actually, this system is the normal prolongation in terminology of helicartan. terminology of helicartan of the equations for the so-called basic forms alpha zero alpha one set zero zero and so so on set three zero if we write explicitly the equation for this forms all other equations can be obtained by the standard procedure of normal prolonged Normal prolongation. Well, the forms emphasized by the colour are horizontal. They are not equal to zero on any solution to our equation. These forms are invariant and they govern the changes of independent variables t, y and x under the quantum transformations, under the action of the symmetry. Action of the symmetry to the group of our equation. Well, now from we will study twisted extensions of our Lie algebra, the symmetry Lie algebra of our equation. It is quite easy to check that the first cohomology group is generated by form alpha zero and the second twisted cohomology group. Twisted cohomology group is non-trivial if and only if the constant C, this constant that figurates here, well, is one. And the non-trivial casycle is alpha zero, which alpha one. In all other cases, the twist homologic group is trivial. Well, it is quite simple to check that this form. That this form is a non-trivial case cycle, while some work should be done to show that it is the only non-trivial casycle for our Lie algebra. Well, so we say we have this casycle, we have c equal to one, so we write down this equation. One is invisibly written here. Is invisibly written here before this alpha zero, and this is two casycle, this caseycle. Well, this equation, how it follows from the above theory, is compatible with the structure equations of our Lie algebra. And this equation defines a twisted extension of this Lie algebra. Forms alpha 0 and alpha 1 are known, so we can integrate. are known so we can integrate integrate this equation we obtain form sigma in well and in this form v this this v is a say integration constant the new actually the new parameter that appears during this integration now now we consider the following linear combination the linear The linear combination of the obtained form sigma, the form that constructs the twist extension, and the basic horizontal one forms of the symmetry algebra with arbitrary constants C0, C1, and C2. This form, by the very definition of the Kahamovoj group, is a twisted cycle. Twisted cycle as well. And moreover, non-trivial twisted cycle. So we take this linear combination and put it equal to zero. We obtain a novideterminate system for function v, this system. Well, then we analyze its compatibility. First, we say that without loss of generality, That without loss of generality, we can put C2 equal to one. Then, from the last equation, we say that Q is equal to the partial derivative of V with respect to S and R, this parameter, can be expressed in this manner. Who are this Q, R? This is Q, this is R, yes, and we express these parameters in terms of the partial. Of the partial derivatives of V with respect to independent variables. Further analysis of the obtained overdetermined system shows that there are two possibilities when this overdetermined system is compatible. The first possibility is when C0 and C1 are equal to zero. And in this case, we obtain the so-called Obtain the so-called is a spectral Lux representation for our equation. This Lux representation was independently found at least three times by Mihalov, Paolov and Dunysky. Well, and there is another possibility for the remaining system to be compatible when constants C0 and C1 are equal to one. Model assumption. One model of some well, some trivial rescaling in this situation, we obtain a new Lux representation, the so-called non-ispectral Lux representation for the same equation. Well, actually, this Lux representation is interesting because it is an example of generalization of Vinogrado's definition of. Grado's definition of the differential covering. While function v in this system depends on four variables, the resulting equation is three-dimensional. But well, let me skip this discussion. Well, so this example shows how twisted extensions of symmetry algebra. Extensions of symmetry algebras can be applied to recover known Lax representations as well as finding new Lax representations for equations, for partial differential equations. Now, in order to generalize this example, let's check the structure of the symmetry algebra of this algebra. It has the It has the following interesting structure. The two-dimensional Lie algebra, non-abelian Lie algebra, which is dual to forms alpha 0, alpha 1, acts on a big infinite-dimensional ideal, which in its term, in its term, this ideal is the tensor product of the commutative unit. Commutative unit algebra of truncated polynomials, this algebra, and Lie algebra of vector fields on a line, the one-sided width algebra, this Lie algebra. So looking at this construction, we say that it is possible to generalize it at least in three ways. First, Three ways. First, we can replace the truncated polynomials of degree three. Why is three? What is three? Three is the number of this number of these functions, a0 to a three, and three is this. And three is the last number. Well, we say, but let's consider instead of truncated polynomials of degree 3, let's consider the truncated polynomials of degree m. That is, replace the series, the sum from k to 3 by sum from k to m, to arbitrary n, and consider the same structure equations. Equations. Then the construction of twisted extension remains unchanged. The obtained Lie algebra has the same twist extension. We can recalculate Mauer-Cartan forms, and the result will be integrable hierarchies associated with With our equation. So, this generalization allows to reproduce integrable hierarchies related to our extension. Well, then we can deform the tensor product. The tensor product of Product of twisted polynomials and with algebra. As the vector field, it is generated by the following functions, and this vector field is equipped with the following bracket. And then for a constant epsilon, we consider new bracket, this bracket. And the resulting Lie algebra, well, let it be denoted by the following symbol, has the following structure equations. Equations. This Lie algebra actually is a proper sub-algebra for in the untwisted affin cat's Mudi algebra. The proof of this claim is similar to the considerations in this paper. Therefore, such Lie algebras are referred to as Lie algebras of Cass-Moody type. We can apply the We can apply the technique of twisted extensions to this Lie algebras of Kart's Moody type. And for some epsilon, for some values of epsilon, this deformation parameter obtain known as well as new integrable partial differential corrections. Well, this Lie algebra admits the natural grading, therefore, we can expect. Therefore, we can extend the structure equations, its structure equations by this equation and alpha define the following action on all other Mauric-Cartan forms. Well, this structure equation equations when n, the degree of truncated polynomials is equal to 3, and epsilon is minus 1 over 3, allows to recover the known lex. Allows to recover the known Lex representation for this Lex representation for the known Lazar-Volovska equation, or also known as Lie-Rays and Zian equation or dispersionless current-supported shield equation. Well, the sequence of Lie algebras Gn and epsilon equal to minus one over n provides the associated provides the associated integrable hierarchy, integrable hierarchy associated to this equation or also known as the DKP hierarchy. Details and further generalizations can be found in the papers that the reference will be at the last slide. But there is a number of further generalizations, further extensions of this legend. Further extensions of these lay algebras, and well, they allow to find new integrable extensions or will recover or recover the known Lux representations. Well, the third possible generalization is to replace DeWitt algebra, the Lie algebra of vector fields on a line by Lie algebras. On a line by the algebras of vector fields on a plane. For example, vector fields of this form produce a number of four-dimensional integral PDEs, as well as their integral hierarchies. Known PDEs as well as new PDEs. Or we can replace the wheat algebra by the Lie algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields. Have Hamiltonian vector fields, these vector fields, and the result will be so-called heavenly, for example, Lemansky's second heavenly equation from the theory of relativity, or some its degenerations, some new examples. Well, and so one we can replace Replace this Lie algebra of vector fields on a plane by more interesting, more complicated Lie algebras of vector fields on a plane, on a space, and so on. But in my opinion, the problem is not to generate some strange integrable systems, but the problem is Integrable systems, but the problem is to find the mechanism, the algebraic structures that underline integrability of PDs. Well, unfortunately, I should emphasize that this approach, based on twisted extensions of Lie algebras, is of limited scope. There are examples of integral V D's that can't be reproduced. Reproduced using this approach. Roughly speaking, when the symmetry algebras are big enough, this technique works. But when the symmetry algebras are not so big, we have some problems. Actually, careful analysis shows that in this situation, That in this situation, the problem is to overcome this difficulty, one has to consider to include invariance of real algebras, of the symmetry algebras, in the construction, the consideration. And moreover, to include differential invariance of symmetry algebras. Of symmetry algebras of the equation as well as invariance of the Lux representation. So the situation is a bit paradoxical. We have no Lux representation, but to find it, to construct it, we need to know invariance of Lux representation. Well, but in my opinion, it is possible to achieve this goal to Achieve this goal by considering Lee-Reinhart algebras. Well, the formal definition is the following. We have a commutative ring and a commutative algebra over this ring, and we have a Lie algebra denoted by this symbol over the ring. And this Lie algebra is equipped with two structures. The first one is the structures. The first one is the structures of left A model, that is the map from this standard product such that this condition is fulfilled. And the second map, this map is called anchor, the map from our Lie algebra to Lie algebra of derivations of the commutative algebra A. And this map. And this map should be a homomorphism of plea algebras and simultaneously a homomorphism of A modules. So these two conditions should satisfy. Then this Lie algebra is referred to as a Lie-Reinhert algebra over A, provided there holds the following requirements. The following requirements. This requirement. This is the formal definition. I'll show examples below. Well, for Lee-Reinhardt algebras, we define zero catches as just elements of algebra A itself, and define key cachins as. As K linear skew symmetric maps from Lie algebra G A to algebra A. Then we define differential by this formula. This formula is the same as the formula for Ehlenberg Scholar differential. Well, then the cohomology groups of this differential This differential are referred to as the homology groups of realgebraj with trivial coefficients. Well, for example, the example that will be used below, we consider situation when the ring is just the field of real numbers, the algebra A is the algebra of. Algebra of smooth or real analytic functions of variables vw1 wn they run through through some open subset of Rn and the algebra G A is a free model over this algebra A with basis V V one and so on V M. One and so on, Vm, and so on. Or, in other words, it is the space of sums of this form where only finite number of functions f are not equal to zero, differ from zero. Well, then commutators, all these vectors are expressed in terms of these vectors cells. Of these vectors cells, and the coefficients are referred to as structure functions. They are skew symmetric with respect to low indices. The anchor, the map psi, has the following form with some functions HQI. Then the Jacobi identity looks like this, and this formula and this formula for. And this formula for the anchor. Okay, okay, now consider linear mappings from our algebra to algebra A, such that they are dual to the basis. Then express their differentials in terms of set of themselves and differentials of variables W in W in terms of form status, we obtain the structure equation for this realgebra. Well, now the definition of twisted differential and the twisted cohomology group for the Lie-Rankhard algebra is the same as the definitions for Lie-Lge. The definitions for Lie algebras. If it turns out that the second twisted homology group for the Lie algebra G A is not equal to zero, is non-trivial for some value of C. And if we obtain the non-trivial twisted cycle, we again write down this equation with unspecified sigma, and this equation is compiled. And this equation is compatible with the structure equations of our Lie-Reinhardt algebra. Therefore, it defines new the extended Lie-Reinhardt algebra, which is referred to as the twisted extension of our Lie-Reinhardt algebra. Well, the following way, the following extension of our Learning. Our Lear-Reinhardt algebra is specific for Lear-Reinhardt algebras. We suppose that the first homology group is non-trivial, take a non-trivial Vanca cycle and then extend the underlying algebra A by and thus extending, we extend the algebra G A by considering new commutative. Commutative algebra algebra of functions that depend on n plus one independent variables w1 etc w n plus one where they the extend the anchor by the requirement that differential of new w, this w n plus one. This w n plus one is equal to alpha to this non-trivial one casey. Well, so in a sense, we killed this alpha as a non-trivial casey. We may make it be trivial in the extended algebra. When we extend the algebra A in U. In new Lie-Reinhardt algebra, this alpha becomes to be trivial. Such procedure will be called as appending an integral of this form alpha or this non-trivial cache. Well, then we for Lie algebras for Lie Reinhart algebras with non-trivial first homology group and first homology group and non-trivial second deforming homology group second twisted cohomology group we can combine this this procedure first we extend by appending by appending sigma by solving this equation and then we killed the first homology by appending integral of the non-trivial one form Non-trivial one form it should be emphasized that the resulting algebra we extend to g and then extend a is noted with an extension of initial algebra. This extension has two steps. Okay, now an example. Well Well, let's consider the following equation. It was introduced by Maxim Paulov in his study of integrable Igorov hydrodynamic chains. In this equation, F is a solution to Shazis ordinary differential equation, this equation. We apply the machinery of moving frame method and find the structure equations for the symmetriel. Structure equations for the symmetry algebra. In these structure equations, there is one invariant, this W. It is UXX, the second derivative of U with respect to X. Its differential is the form eta, and eta is the only place where this eta is presented is here. Well, theta capital is the form of series of some. series of some some well some form set a km well so studying these structure equations we find that the first cohomology group is one dimensional and is generated by alpha zero sorry alpha zero and then the second cohomology the second twisted cohomology group is three dimensional and is generated by the following non- By the following non-trivial twist to Ca cycles. Therefore, we say that this symmetry algebra admits three-dimensional twisted extension. We consider the first Ca cycle, this Ca cycle that corresponds to C equal to one and apply procedures of the combined extensions. First, we add this form sigma and then add the integral of Integral of this non-trivial Wanka cycle alpha zero. The Maurer-Cartan forms for the new extension are the following. Sigma, this sigma can be found by integration of this equation. Q, it was a parameter, now it is an invariant of newly. An invariant of new Leological ETA, the form eta is this form. Forms theta 0, 0, θ 1, 0 are horizontal, and we use them to we can see we consider the linear combination of the new form sigma and zeta 0, 0, zeta 1, 0, the horizontal forms. The horizontal forms, these coefficients, which now are not constants, now they are functions of invariance, of u, x, x and q. We put this form equal to zero and it gives us that q actually is the minus partial derivative of v of the pseudo potential with respect to x. Then we obtain Then we obtain the following or determined system for functions p1 and p2. We analyze, we check the cross-derivatives and obtain that again, obtain another determined system for these functions p1 and p2 whose compatibility condition coincide with the with the With the above Chazi equations for function f. So, in a sense, the structure equations for these structure equations contain the whole information about the equation, its Lux representation, and even about Shazi's equation. This Lux representation in implicit form was found by Maxim Paolov in this year. In this year, in implicit form, and by Clarie and Ferropontov in explicit form. Now, well, and this example shows the technique of extensions of Lie-Rein-Hert algebras allows one to reproduce this result. Okay, I suppose that the time is okay, so. Okay. So thank you for your attention. That's all. There is the list of the references. Okay. Is there like one short question? I have a question. This is Peter. Very nice. So if you start with an equation that has, say, a symmetry algebra of Katz-Moody type, Moody type, and then you apply the machinery, you don't necessarily recover the equation you start with, right? You recover some integrable equation. Not quite understand you. So, for instance, in the paper of Davin and Nikki and so on, Pavel, they make the claim that if you have a symmetry algebra of cats-movie type, Of Cap's movie type, then that's an indication of integrability. But you could take any function of the differential invariance of that symmetry algebra and you'd have a equation with that same symmetry, but almost certainly not integrable. So I'm trying to figure out how that would fit into your machinery. Okay. The paper by Winternitz, David, Cameron, and Cameron and Levy states the following: The Lie algebra of symmetries of Kp equation, the Kalams of Pedro equation, is a sub-algebra of the untwisted Finn Cat's Moody algebra, A, one, four, and all. And they have not shown how it's related. Not show how it's related to the Lux representation of the Cademian equation. All I say is the following: that sometimes, sometimes the Lie algebras of Katz Moody type, this is actually these deformations of the transer product of truncated polynomials and V algebra, sometimes they. Sometimes they extensions by technique of twisted extensions and by well the extensions by derivatives produce integrable new or non-integrable P D's. That's all that I say. Actually, I don't know how to use this fact that these algebras are sub-algebras. These algebras are sub-algebras of the Kartz-Moody algebras. I don't know any applications, just a fact, just to know the two names, just to explain the names, the Li algebras of Kazmubitikov. Well, thank you very much. Let's thank Oleg one more time. Thank Oleg one more time.
