So let's talk about Short title. You'll see why. It's about cyclic algebras and cyclic Galaxy. I want to thank the organizers for going through all the effort to do this and for being brave enough to do this one in person. And also to let me display this material. This is the result of all of that time I had during COVID. So I have to think about things. I also want to apologize. I also want to apologize. There's a lot of material and more slides than I'm comfortable with in a short period of time. And so you'll see basically ideas and not perhaps enough details. Okay, so all primes are odd. It's just too hard, and I'll get to that one day. And I want to recall something everybody knows, which is in characteristic peak fields, all the cyclic extensions. All the cyclic extensions of degree p, the cyclic Galois extensions, are given by Hart and Trier, x to the p minus x equals a. That polynomial, and that Galois action, sigma of x equals x plus one. I love it, right? It's less known, but this is actually true for any commutative ring of characteristic p. Any cyclic extension in characteristic p commutative rings actually has the same description, same polynomial. Description, same polynomial, same Gal action, too. And the other thing that's not known and should be, and I can't, I haven't said we don't have time for the simple proof, but the in characteristic P, every Galois extension with a P group has a normal basis theorem, meaning that the as a module over S, over S as a module over the group ring is isomorphic to RG. And that the Dalai The Galois additive Galois structure and we're going to be a big interplay here. All right. Now, what I was really interested in was a mixed characteristic. Yeah. I was just going to add. So by Galois here, you'd be over, right? You'd be atal Galois. A tall, Galois, yes. But then Athen hardly connected. Excuse me? Don't you need hard to reconnect? Or now. You need hard to reconnect, or no, no. I mean, it will, it won't matter actually. You'll see. I mean, what I mean, but see, it's a fixed group, so it doesn't need to be connected because the rank is the same on every component. Because the rank is the group, and it's one group. So it doesn't need to be connected. In the end, it won't matter because I'll actually be working generically and I'll have regular rings as my base. I just don't see everything being. I just don't see everything being oh I didn't define I didn't define it when when the base is not connected the Galois group is not the they're not the automorphism group it is a specified part of the automorphism group but yes but if I take k cross k cos k yeah then in characteristic p it is you take you take one zero zero zero you just do it all around um Now, for commutative rings, and it says for a while, actually, for the whole talk, every commutative ring will actually be an algebra over the cyclotomic ring over the primitive pth rooted unity. And then it turns out that you can define a polynomial x to the p plus g of x by that formula. Basically, when you take 1 plus x, eta is the power. Ata is the pi rho minus one, and when you take one one plus x eta to the p, all of the coefficients except for the first, all of the terms for the first one are divisible by eta to the p, and you get that polynomial. That polynomial is a characteristic zero Ardentroyer polynomial. And it is the Ardentroyer thing module. Obviously, theta goes to one. And basically, if I write down the extension given by that. The extension given by that polynomial, it's not Galois, but it becomes Galois very easily to verify. If one plus a to the p is a unit, then it's Galois. And this is why I put a box around it. This is my favorite part about this. The Galois action, which is actually easier to remember than the polynomial, is sigma of x equals rho x plus one. Okay, and obviously when rho goes to one mod eta, that becomes the art and tryer action. comes the art and try action. So what that means is that I can lift, and this is what I'm really interested in lifting, I can lift an extension from characteristic P to characteristic zero as long as certain elements are invertible. And basically, in order to be positive sure, it's everything of congruent to one mod eta. If those, they're all invertible, then you can lift Galois extension. Then you can lift Galois extensions from characteristic p, the characteristic zero without any other assumptions. So that's true of r is local, of course, but it's more true more generally. The point about this element is when I invert elements of the form one plus eta r, I don't change anything mod eta. I'm inverting things that go to one. So I'm totally general mod eta, and I'm not totally general mod mod uh. Uh, in and yeah, I can actually remove in the degree paint case, I can remove the assumption that I'm over zero algebras, but um it's very hard and not worth, I'm trying to do it in a better way because it won't generalize so easily. So in my thesis, this is 1976, in my thesis, I show that if R is a commutative ring with a characteristic P, Characteristic P, then the Brerower group of R, the P torsion part of the Brewer group is generated by algebras which are defined. I call them differential cross products. There were a special case of these differential cross products had been people have looked at over fields. And the basic xy minus yx equals one, x to the py under the p is central. The moral of this story. The moral of this story is that that makes one think about derivations and stuff like that, and that was wrong. That's not the right way to think about these things. But I didn't know that for a long, long time. But it is nice. First of all, the reason why this even makes any sense is that this algebra doesn't require anything of A and B. A and B can be zero, and this is still azimuth. All right. Now, this is the supreme observation. This is the The surprising observation. This is the embarrassing part. In all of this time, since 1976, I never noticed that xy, that element of the algebra, satisfied the arbitrage equation, x to the p minus x equals 1, is in the center. And was actually, it's not a cyclic in the full sense because the automorphism group is not given by a unit, but it still splits. So I call these. So, I call these almost cyclic algebras. And I want to point out, I'm going to have to use my finger. I want to point out what's going on here. The diagonal, of course, is the separable part of the algebra. Can you define precisely what is an almost cyclic algebra? No, not yet. I will in a minute. It's these algebra, this algebra. This algebra I'm talking about here, this xy minus yx equals one, think of it as having three generators, though it's sort of silly to say it. There's the x, there's the y, and then there's x times y. And so it's all as a third quote generator, unquote, is the max, the maximal cyclic. And the x is the super diagonal plus the a down here. The y is The y is the sub-diagonal plus the b up there. And their product, and then the fact that x times y is a separable element means, among other things, that it can only have one zero eigenvalue. It can't have two because they're all distinct. So x times y has rank n minus one, which implies that x has rank n minus one and y has rank n minus one because they're product or more. Or more. And that implies that whereas A and B can be zero, the subdiagonal and superdiagonal elements are all non-zero. And so what's going on, if this were a normal cyclic algebra, A would be invertible and the diagonal and the super diagonal plus A would generate. But even if A is zero and B is zero, the super diagonal and the subdiagonal and the diagonal generate because you know these guys mark. Because you know, these guys march up this way, and those guys march down that way, and so that's why you get an azimuthal algebra, basically. And that's, I think, what I said in the next thing. So, this is almost to myself. So, what was not important about this construction I made in 1976 before some of you were born, the differential cross-product characteristic P, none of that was important. Okay, what was important was that our important was that Rxy, the guy in the center, was a cyclic Galois extension, and XY was an element of rank n minus one or more. That was all that was important there. So here's the corresponding characteristic zero construction. Instead of you have your x and y, you have x to the p equals a, y to the p equals b. Those are the sub and the super diagonal. And xy minus rho yx. And xy minus rho yx equals one. Instead, again, when rho is one, it's the old one. This is not azimaya. This, by the way, if you're in the polynomial ring over x and y, this is always a maximal order, but it's not azimaya. But it becomes azimaya when you basically, as soon as you make the diagonal separable piece Galois, which is one plus ab a to the p being invertible. And you have all the relations. But what this You have all the relations. But what this means is that if I have this mixed characteristic case, whereas before I told you I could lift cyclics of degree P, now I can lift elements of order P and LeBron. It's surjective on elements of order P and LeBron, because I've lifted every algebra, therefore. And all I needed on R was this result. So in order to guarantee those algebras were azimaya, I needed all those units. needed all those units. Rho is the pth root of one and eta is rho minus one. So you're just, you know, it's the rho eta is the prime over p. And now, Uzi, by the way, what does almost cyclic mean? I will now tell you what's really another sense of what's going on. In this algebra, let's look at the characteristics. This algebra, let's look at the characteristic zero version. Let's look at P sigma, which is the set of all elements, not necessarily units, that anti-commute by a sigma with these diagonal guys, the separable one. And I will make the obvious point that it has two elements that are noteworthy. X by definition does that, but so does y to the p minus one. Since y was on the other side, Since y was on the other side, it induces sigma inverse and take the p minus one power, and it's also there. And the argument I gave you before with the matrices, with the super and the sub-diagonal, actually show that if I take the sub S module generated by X and Y to the P minus 1, and I take the corresponding thing for sigma inverse, which is generated by X to the P minus 1 and Y, and I multiply them together. Multiply them together, uh, that's a typo. I get all of our, I get the, you know, I some of you may remember that there's this theorem that you proved way back early in commutative algebra that an invertible ideal is necessarily projective. This is a sort of a non-commutative version. If I have that equation, p sigma is automatically projective over s here. I've given it. Here, I've given it as two generators. I have examples where you need it to. So, it is a Picard element of the Picard group, and that's how you make a definition. You basically get an element of the Picard group whose pth power is S, and you use that instead of the cyclic generator for your cross product, you use I, I squared all the way. And as long as I do the P is S and And the two examples I gave you are both almost cyclic in this case. But remember, what I'm trying to do is lift things from characteristic zero to characteristic P to characteristic zero. And that is actually very hard to lift the card group elements. I mean, you know, they're just crazy and you can't work with them. So, but before I get to that, I want to show, I want to say what's hidden in. To show, I want to say what's hidden in some of this stuff. I told you that the Galois structure of S, of our Galois extension. So if I have, again, a cyclic of order P, which is the interesting example, the group algebra is, of course, just R of T mod T to the P minus one. And as such, since R has a primitive pth root of unity, it Primitive pth root of unity, it factors. And that says that R of G is basically an iterated fiber product. But it does not matter. I don't have to iterate too much. What's important, as it turns out, is the first non-trivial thing, which is R T modulo P minus rho T minus one R T. That thing of rank two is an image of the group algebra, and that's the key. And that's sort of the key sort of ring to think about here. And so, for example, the following things are equivalent. S has a normal basis. S is R of G. G is still cyclic of order P. S1, by which I mean lot out by T minus rho and T minus 1, is isomorphic to the group algebra with the same thing. And that polynomial works, you know, the same polynomial. The reason is. The reason is because if I that equation, there's a lot of ways to think of that equation. I put it in the box. Oh, I was going the wrong way. That's not good. That equation in the box says that X generates that R s of one element. It's, it, I mean, the more general generator would be sigma minus. More general generator would be sigma minus rho of x is a unit, but what the hell? Once you get a unit, you make it work. So that's why that theorem, you know, that's one of the directions basically of that theorem. All right, now there we are. And now, to do this generally, I need some conditions. And I think I'm going to skip this and go. To skip this and go. So basically, if I have a general situation is I do not have I as a not principle, and then it has to have certain properties. And this is the key one that which I'm going to skip because it's impossible to define. But I want you to, there's a sort of a card group obstruction to it. Let's move on to, if I've shown that the bread group is onto or. The bra group is on L is onto on elements of order P, and I've shown I can lift cyclic extensions of degree p, I have to do the general case, p to the n, clearly, in both cases. And it's not so easy because there are no polynomials that I can find that would get me to even the p squared. I have to do it step by step basically. But but uh But uh right all right, so um how are we going to generalize this? Well, first of all, we're going to we're going to generalize our ground ring. It's going to be zero polynomials, and I'm going to only invert elements, not just who are one mod eta, but they're one mod eta and the ideal generated by the X's. The reason for that is technical. Zero has a large class group, which I have to control. Which I have to control or basically ignore. And by doing this, I basically say I only care about things which split when I'm mine out by m so that they are not trivial extensions of zero and I'm all set. Okay, so the next step. So the way to generalize from degree P to degree P to the N is, that's my notation of a sort of solution to the embeddings problem. A sort of solution to the embeddings problem. You start with an S that you've already constructed. You try to construct T, which is a degree one higher power. And then part two is to make it generic. That is, you might have done something fairly special. You want to now make it general. One is hard, and it's actually very easy to do two once you've generated some example. All the others differ from anything you generate by basically a degree. By basically a degree p extension of the base. So it's hard to, so we don't care about making it generic and we only worry about constructing an extension in the first place. In order to do that, I need an Albert criterion. So some of you may remember that there's a theorem of Albert. If the center of your field has a primitive row, primarily pth root of unity, then your Then your cyclic extensions of degree p to the r extends to p to the r plus one if and only if rho is a norm, which you want to think of as a Brown obstruction. The cyclic algebra is trivial. So what you want to do in this case is to do a version in the community ring case, which is a little more complicated. So you form an Azimaya algebra over the Hasimia algebra over the group rings. Okay? You look at S of C, so C is the cyclic subgroup of order P that I want to make the extension to work. And I look at S of C, R of C, sigma generates the Galois group, and tau is actually the generator of C, but in this case, it's in the center. And you look at that classic cyclic algebra and Algebra, and it's actually a twisted group brainer. But that was, I made that comment for a different audience. I actually only care about A of one. Remember when I looked at the whole group ring and I modded out by T minus rho, T minus one, I do the same thing for the Asimaya algebra, and that is the guy that I want. And then there's a theorem that this extends if and only if A of one. only if A of one is split, where P of one is the module that makes it split, where P0 is basically S, that's easy to arrange, and P rho to the G is this guy here, which I refuse to define. But what I really want to say about it is that it's a Picard group condition. R star sub P R is a final product of R with itself over R mod rhodo. Over R mod rho to the P R. It has, no matter what R is, it has a highly non-trivial part group, but because of all the units. But I need a certain element of its Picard group that you construct from P of one to be trivial. But the important point here is that there's one Browd group condition and one Picard group condition. And if I'm going to construct my T, I need to. I'm going to construct my T, I need to neutralize both. But I'm constructing it over, where's that ring? And yeah, that ring there. R z row blah blah blah one over S. Regular ring. So the way I'm going to deal with the Brouwer group obstruction is I'm going to just split it over the field. I don't have to worry about it so much. And then the Pakar group condition I'm going to manage by localizing, basically. Remember, I have to keep localizing anyway. All right. And so the idea and the proof of that is you do with that. And then it's very important that this is a special R. R mod eta is a polynomial ring. Therefore, it has a trivial Picard group. Better than that, it has units I know about. Whereas, you know, I spent some time. Whereas you know, I spent some time at cyclot studying cyclotomic units and then decided to avoid the whole question because they're complicated. And then we conjecture that these methods by splitting the embedding problem one at a time generates the T I wanted of the green P to the R. It's not a conjecture anymore. My life is weird. I had to submit these slides a month ago, and the conjecture is not a conjecture. Conjecture is not a conjecture. I can lift P to the end, cyclic Galois extensions. All right, now we want to deal with Azimaya algebras, which are degree P to the R almost cyclic Azimaya algebras. And they are the same thing. The real generalization is, you know, what I had before. J now is an element of pick S whose norm in R is trivial, and you have these conditions. Have these conditions. And the examples we had before are degree P almost cyclic. And once again, Picard group elements are tough to work with and hard to lift. But I will have a special case where I start with a normal B as a central simple algebra over the field extension. I take two elements X and Y and B, whose X and the N equals A, Y to the N equals B, and they. Integral B and they anti-commute in the opposite ways. And I assume alpha xy is in S. And I assume, and this is the basically Asimaya condition, that over S, A, alpha, its adjoint, which is the norm modulo, divided by alpha, and B all generate S. So I have an ideal generated by those four elements is the full thing. And if I have that, and I take the step out. And I take the sub-algebra generated by them, that those things are azimaya exactly when those four elements generate s. And it's the same proof I had before. If I write j to be the things generated by x and y to the n minus 1, and j sigma inverse, x to the n minus 1 and y, then the product of those two things is the thing that I care about. And once j j sigma inverse is s, j sigma. Inverse is S, J sigma is now automatically in the Picard group, and we're home free. Because once it's in the Picard group, you prove it's SMIA, obviously, by going to the local, you know, faithfully flat extensions. Okay. I will point out here is ignore B because obviously if four elements generate, three do it. Three do it. And think about what. And think about what it means for SA, S alpha, and S, the adjoint of alpha, give me all of S. Well, if I mine out by A, that means that alpha and the adjoint of alpha give me all of S, which means that they're never both simultaneously zero, which means that alpha has rank n minus one or more. That's the connection with the old computation. And that's so a split is an SO A split is in S over A split over R over A. And this allows me to construct these general almost cyclic algebras. All I care about is I have X and I have Y. They're both Humor-like elements, X to the N in the center, Y to the N, but XY has rank n minus one in the separable piece. And we can use these algebras. We can use these algebras to solve two problems. The first one is a problem that only I care about, perhaps, but way back then in my thesis, I proved that the Brouwer group of a commutative ring and characteristic P was divisible. What I didn't do is if I give you an algebra, for example, my A, B, I didn't find you the Pth root. I like algebras. Okay, I much prefer them to call homology classes. So I wanted to write down. So, I wanted to write down the algebra whose peak power was this one. And you can do it with these more general, almost cyclic algebras, by cheating something awful, right? I want to point out that when I defined it, it was A alpha B. But if R is regular, which is the case I care about, I'm still in this polynomial ring kind of situation. Homeo ring kind of situation. The Brouwer class of S over R, A, alpha B only depends on S over R and A. Because that's all that the Brouwer class at the function field only depends on those. And so I use that shamelessly to prove all the relations I need between these almost cyclic algebras by defining them generically over polynomial rings where I have all this thing. And then the And then the conjecture, I'm going to skip that because that was my idea for how I was going to prove the conjecture. That doesn't work, so you might as well skip it. But the conjecture is that the Brown group map is also onto on all P primary parts, all not just ordered P, but powers of P, ordered powers of P. That one I finally wrote up on the plane here. On the plane here, when there was a guy across the aisle who was really mad at me because I wouldn't switch seats with him. And so this is closer to a conjecture than the other one was. I think it's fine. But I was, you know, a little bit annoyed at him. And that is it. Thank you very much. Any questions? Yes. Do you have one? A couple. So what do you call the algebra almost cyclic algebra? So the traditional definition of a cyclic as a maya algebra was a cyclic Galois extension and an element u such that ux add u to the end in the center was a unit. That's a cyclic algebra. Unit. That's a cyclic algebra. If it's not a unit and you only put in those two elements, it's only an order, it's not azimaya. But my point being is if you then put in an element for the inverse and you're careful, you get an azimuthal element. It seems like what you're doing is you're taking a cyclic extension and then a cohomology class, UN, coefficients of UN with flat cohomology, and you're copying them together, which is exactly what cyclic algebra of the classical case. I could do that, but it's. I could do that, but is it exactly given by that formula? I mean, the formula given it is that that's perfectly reasonable as a way to think about it. But remember that. But I will point out to you that I have no evidence that, I mean, the only interesting ones I needed. I mean, the only interesting ones I needed were the ones which had two generators, one for the X and the Y. But the general construction just involved an element of the Picard group. It could certainly have more than two generators. So, and maybe they'll be useful in other circumstances. But yes, I meant almost by really almost. I mean, they're, you know, a hair away from being cyclic. No, the revelation is not that. That you know, these should be looked at. Now, what for me was disturbing was that I never noticed that these differential cross products had this cyclic structure. That was crazy, Mattel notes. Yeah. Asha is always good for me. So, this result about extending P to the N cyclic extensions. So, I mean, on the characteristic P side, you have a bit factor. I don't use it at all. And because you reformulate your successive embedding problems in terms of some type of like your mixed. Well, the reason why I don't do it is because what's in fact true in characteristic P, even in the abelian, in the commutative ring case, is that all impending problems are solvable. And it's because it's a It's because it's a the abstraction is an additive instead of multiplicative homology, and those are all trivial. So there's no reason to go to vit vectors. They certainly don't feel like this kind of thing will lift in characteristic zero in a way that I can't make vit vectors lift. And so I didn't see any reason to go to them. And also because it wants, you know. I want to look at other groups, but it's not cyclic groups eventually. Also, I want to get rid of that. You'll notice there's a root of unity. I am assuming my base ring has a primitive pth root of unity. I want to get rid of that too. That's going to be harder. That's going to take multiple airplane flights to that one. Okay, so. Okay, so we deserve copyright, yes. Thank you.
