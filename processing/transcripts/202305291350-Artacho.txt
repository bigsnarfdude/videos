Well, thank you. First of all, I wanted to thank the organizers for letting me talk. I'm very excited. I'm very nervous at the same time. I was trying hard to include or at least mention G2 and Spin 7 unsuccessfully. I have success, though, in mentioning the Octonians, which will appear briefly at some point. But I hope this is a nice introductory talk to something that I find very exciting. That I find very exciting. So, first of all, let's start with M unoriented Riemannian manifold. In some cases, we can associate to that manifold a spin structure. In some cases, we cannot. For example, even-dimensional complex projective spaces. We know those spaces are not spin. But in some cases, we can associate a spin structure. This gives us the notion of the spinner bundle. We associate a vector bundle to that. A vector bundle to that principal spin bundle that defines us the spin structure. And we can study the sections of those spinner bundles, and some of those sections will be nice and will give us special spinners, like you know, spinners parallelized by a connection. If it's a levita connection, for example, parallel spinners are very important, or killing spinners, generalized killing spinners, etc. Because these encode information, geometric information on our manifold. Information on our manifold. So the question is: what if M is not spin? So there's been a lot of work done in this direction. And yeah, we'll see about this in a minute. But the main idea is to associate, to equip every orientable manifold with spin-like structures, so to speak. And in particular, we will focus on these structures on homogeneous. On these structures on homogeneous spaces, what do these structures look like for homogeneous spaces? They have a particularly nice form that we can very easily study. And the reason for focusing on homogeneous faces is because they let us solve geometric problems with making use of representation theory. We reduce the if you're homogeneous, then you can basically study everything in one point and then translate by the action of the group. So you can reduce. So, you can reduce complex geometric problems into representation theory problems. And then, because homogeneous spaces let you build explicit spinners also reasonably easily. For example, there's this paper by Ilika Gricola, Jordan Hoffman, and Mariam Lilon, where they built invergent spinners on all the homogeneous realizations of the spheres. So, how do we generalize this concept of spin? So, it's very well known that the spin C group and the spin H group, the idea is to enlarge the spin group. If we make the Lie group bigger, then we might have new structures, right? So, the first idea is: okay, you take the spin n group and you allow for multiplication by unit complex numbers, that's u1, and then you quotient out that this is z02, z02. you quotient out that this z02 z02 is just the subgroup of spin n cross u1 generated by minus one comma minus one and then one can for example the even dimensional complex reactive spaces are not spin but they are spin c and therefore they have this notion of spinners and and so on and there are some spaces which are not spin not spin c but they are spin h so spin h the group spin h is you know we take the unit quaternions instead. We take the unit quaternions instead. Now comes the octonions, okay? So maybe one can say, okay, why don't we define spin O by allowing for products with unit octonions because they are not associative and then it's not a group and weird things happen. There go the octonions and goodbye. So the crucial observation is that U1 is spin 2 because U1 spin 2 is S1 and 221. 2 is S1, and it's a 2 to 1 covering of itself by the square map. And SP1 is spin 3. So, you know, spin C is spin n cross spin 2, spin n cross spin 3. Why stop here, right? So it's quite natural to define this group, which some people refer to as twisted spin groups, or spinorially twisted spin groups, because you twist the spin group by something, by another spin group. And these groups, let us define these. Let us define this concept of spinard structure. So, spinard structure is simply a reduction of the structure group of the positively oriented orthonormal frame bundle to this new B group along the natural homomorphism. So, you start with spin Rn. This map here is a 2-to-1 covering. To SON cross-SOR. Basically, you take AB and lambdaN is the normal 2-to-1 covering from spin N to SON. And then you forget about the second component. And if you admit such a reduction of the structure group, then You admit such a reduction of the structure group, then you are spinner. Okay. Sorry, can you address that? Yes. The frame bundle. I don't understand how you can do this because the frame bundle has an SON structure, right? Yes. So are you saying spinRN is a sub? You're not saying it's a sub-group. Sorry, reduction is a little structured group. Yeah, I was very badly brought up in Cambridge in my mother. Very badly brought up in Cambridge in my masters. They told us reduction of the structure group also means lift. So sorry about that. That's really fun. Thank you. So there's been, as I was saying, a lot of work in this direction. Espinoza and Herrera and then some other people studied these structures and the associated spinners with a very geometric approach. They introduced this notion of twisted special spinners. They compute some curvature estimates in analogy with what's very well known for spin. With what's very well known for spin and spin C. People like Andrei Morojanu have studied these things. They also define a twisted Dirac operator and they estimate the eigenvalues for these operators. There's another twisted version of the Shrediken-Nihirovich formula, which is also very nice. And then in 2021, Michael Albanese here present and Alexander Milivoyevich took a more topological approach in a nice paper where they studied. Approach in a nice paper where they study spin age structures, but then in the second part, they care about these structures. So they give a nice theorem of characterization of existence of these structures and they construct examples. Hopefully, he will talk a little bit more in his talk. Okay, now we focus on homogeneous spaces. So, suppose we have a Lie group acting smoothly on the manifold. We are supposing We are supposing that the manifold is, of course, Riemannian unoriented, and the Lie group acts by orientation-preserving isometries. So then G acts naturally on Fm, the frame bundle, by bundle isomorphisms in the natural way. Point, frame goes to G times the point, the differential of the action times the frame. And suppose that M has a spinner structure, which is a principal spinner bundle P, together with a P together with a bundle map to the frame bundle that preserves the natural properties. So we say that such a spinar structure is gene variant, if and only if the only possible thing that would be nice happens, which is that this action of the group on the frame bundle lifts to an action by bundle isomorphisms to the spinner bundle. In other words, this map phi, we are saying that it's G-invariant if P admits a G-invariant. P admits a G-action on the left and such that this map phi is equivariant. Okay. Very nice. Just a bit of notation on homogeneous spaces. Hopefully this will be well known. So if we fix a point, then we have that M is diffimorphic to this quotient, G mod H, where it is the stabilizer of the fixed point. And for every element of the isotropic subgroup, the differential of the action. The differential of the action goes from the tangent space of them at O to itself. So we get a representation that's called the isotropic representation, which is defined like this, from H to SON. As a matter of fact, the positively oriented orthonormal frame bundle of M is isomorphic to this associated bundle. You view G as a principal H bundle, and then you associate the bundle by the isomorphic. And then you associate the bundle via the isotropy, and you get this. And in a similar way, you can construct the frame of k-forms like this, taking the k text zero power of the isotropic representation. So how do we describe these Nar structures in terms of the isotropy? Well, first observation is suppose that this isotropy representation sigma lifts to spin Rn. Remember that this homomorphism Remember that this homomorphism that goes from spin Rn to SON is the one that goes first down to SON, cross SOR, and then forgets the second component. So if this lifts, then we can explicitly construct an invariant spinal structure, namely taking associated bundles by this sigma tilde, right? So first you reduce and then you associate. Easy. Now the the theorem, so what's what we proved is really an extension of something that was done for spin structures. Of something that was done for spin structures is that this is the only way that these structures appear. So if you have a dimensional ring-related homogeneous space, then it has a gene-invariant spinal structure if and only if this structure representation lifts and therefore it takes this form. So we can turn this problem of structures into something about representation theory, as we were saying before. Okay, as a corollary, Okay, as a corollary, and this is very nice, I think, which is that if you start with any oriented Riemannian homogeneous space, you can automatically associate a spin-orial object to it. More specifically, any in-dimensional oriented Riemannian homogeneous space comes equipped with a canonical gene variant spin n structure, right? The R before equals the dimension of the manifold now. In quite a trivial way, the proof is very easy. The proof is very easy. So the map from the isotropy, remember we need to lift the isotropy to spin our end, right? So what you do is take the diagonal map and then lift. Take an element little h of the isotropy, then you take just the paddle in, you take the image, right, in SON, lift it to spin n. That, you know, you have two choices. Just take one of them and then take the equivalence class of xh, xh. Xh, XH. And as you are quotienting it out by Z mod 2, this does not depend on your choice. So this is quite nice. So the philosophy is any range of Germanic homogeneous space comes with a sphinorial object. You can also take the micros of the second one, but that is a different. This one. Minus here. Yes, microservice is the same because this square brackets in only one of them. Anti-diagonal. Would that work? Would that work? Maybe not. No, because then you wouldn't have a legal homomorphism, right? Because one has to go to one. That's right, that's right. Yeah. Okay. So, another easy observation. If R and S are two natural numbers and R is strictly less than S, then we have this inclusion of Lie groups. In particular, if M admits a G invariance in R structure, then it admits a gene variance. Spin R structure, then it admits a gene variant spin S structure just by associating the bundle via this inclusion. So this motivates the following definition. If you have a homogeneous G space M with a node by sigma m, g, the lists are such that this happens, right? In particular, if m admits a g-invariant spin structure, then its spin type is one. And the previous scrollery says that every n-dimensional Homogeneous space is spin n. So this is well defined, right? In some cases, you would expect that in most cases you can do better, right, than this trivial construction that we built. But not always, as we see in a minute. So now, this is a scary table, okay? Let me walk you through it. So these are all the spheres. These are all the possible homogeneous realizations of the spheres, right? They were classified many years ago. This is the Lie group acting transitively. The Lie group acting transitively and effectively. So these are compact Lie groups acting transitively and effectively on the spheres. They bear suspicious resemblance to Berger's list, but this is another topic. So, and we compute the spin type for these spheres, right? So there's something to note. Some spheres do not admit, for example, S2N plus one does not admit a UN plus one invariant spin structure. Of course all the spheres are spin, right? But not in a G invariant way for all the groups G. Invariant way for all the groups G. The best you can do is a spin C structure. And the same down here. Then there's also this weird case of, you know, the best you can do is a spin H structure. Of course the 2 is spin C, right? When R equals 2. When R equals 3, that's spin H. But then the, I think, you know, kind of remarkable case is that what we did before, the trivial thing, is the best you can do, not for a weird space, but you know, for the sphere, with SON plus one. For the sphere with SON plus one. So the best invariant spinard structure that you can construct is a spin n structure, except for this weird dimension, n equals 4. This boils down to the fact that the Lie algebra SO4 is not simple. It's SO3 plus SO3. And yeah, someone told me a few weeks ago that why dimension 4 is weird is because Is weird is because 2 plus 2 equals 2 times 2. I don't know if this is an old joke, but I don't know what that means. It's true as a statement. It's true as a statement. I know what the statement means. I don't know about the implications of that statement. Because 4 minus 2 is 2. That's my special. Ah, okay. Well, anyway. So yeah, these are some references I used. I don't know if Some references I used. I don't know if, yeah, and thank you for listening.
