Today I will talk about a simple result on the weighted Alexandria function type inequalities. So my talk will consist of three parts. So first, I will talk about some background and the motivations. Let's begin with the well-known isoparametric inequality. It says that It says that the disk has the smallest boundary length among all the domains in the play with a given area. So this inequality is sharp in the sense that equality holds if and only if omega is a disk. And it's well known that this inequality holds for the arbitrary dimension. dimension. So here omega n minus 1 is the area of the unit sphere and omega n minus 1 minus n we know that is the volume of the unit ball. So this is also optimal that equality holds if and only if sigma is a round sphere. So next we have the classical meaning Next, we have the classical Minkowski inequality, which compares the total mean curvature and the area of the hyp surface. So, this is here the classical one is the actual condition that the surface is convex. So, it also holds for the actually a dimension. So, here the So here the M minus two over M minus one comes from the scale invariant. So the generalization of the isoperimetric inequality and the Mikauski inequality is the Alexandro-Fensher inequality, which was proved by Alexandro and Fensher independently in 1937. So this compares the K's mean curvature integral and the adjacent mean curvature integral. Here, HK is the normalized case mean curvature, where sigma k is just the case mean curvature that when k equals to 1, sigma 1 is the normal. Sigma 1 is the normal mean curvature. There are also some extension work to the non-convex hype surface that I've used in the flow method and optical transport and very beautiful work using the potential theory. Since our talk are focused on the flow approach, On the flow approach, so maybe I talk more details about when it's work. They show that the Alexandria visual inequality still holds for the hype surface to be a star shape and k-convex. Here, star shape, we mean that the support function u, which is the inner product of the potential position vector and the unit outer normal is the. and the unit of the normal is positive everywhere on the half surface. And sigma is called k-convex, means that all the j's mean curvature is the positive for all j from 1 to k. So 1 convex is usually called mean convex. So their method is to using the inverse The inverse curvature flow. So the flow, the normal speed is HK minus 1 over HK. So 1K equals 21. So it reduces to the usual inverse mean curvature flow. So they show that the higher order isoperometric ratio. isoparametric ratio IKJ have some monotonicity along the inverse curvature flow. So this IKJ the explicit expression that the HK the K-smean curvature integral over the J-smean curvature integral with some suitable power. So this follows from the valuation formula that we know that if the normal speed is If the normal speed is big F, so the case mean curvature integral flows like HK plus one times the flow, the normal speed of big F. So now here big F is HK minus one of HK. So by the Nord McLaurin inequality, so we have that this is less than the integral itself with some constant. integral itself with some constant. On the other side, if j is less than k, we get the opposite. Um yes, uh yeah, wait yeah, here we usually are supposed that the hyper surface to be a smooth, so at least C2, so we can. At least C2, so we can define the case mean curvature. So this kind of flow was studied by Gihat and Worbas independently in 1990. So that if the initial hypersurface is the star shape and the K convex, then the prob of The dense star shapedness and the k convexity is preserved along the flow. And the flow, we know that is an expanding flow, so it expands to the infinity. But after a suitable rescaling, it converges to a sphere. So by Gihat and the Wova's theorem, we can compare. Theorem, we can compare the initial value of IKJ and the limited value, which gives us the desired interference inequality for star shape and k-convex hype surfaces. So here I may talk a little bit more that the main steps that we use the flow approach to prove the geometric inequalities. We need to find some geometric quantity and to choose some suitable flow. So we want to show that the choosing geometric inequality have some monotonicity along the flow. And if we add some addition on the initial surface, so we want to show that the flow exists and converges to some model space. To some model space here is a rock sphere. So finally, if we analyze the limit value of the geometric quantity, so we can compare the initial value of the chosen geometric inequality and the limit value, so which may give us the desired quantity. I think it's the basic idea to use the flow method to flow the geometry. Ruz geometry inequality. As mentioned in this morning, so in 2015, Brander Hanwan established weighted Mikoski type inequality, provided the Hype surface in Starship and Mika wax. So we have some generalization work that for the general way time setting. Way times H2K plus one. So, as Professor Wang mentioned this morning, so these kinds of inequities has relation to the panel's inequality for the graphical asymmetrically hyperbolic manifolds. So, that is one of the motivation that we are interested in this kind of equalities. Here, the weight weight is coached. The weight V is called HR, so it comes from the static potential. In this sense, V equals one for Euclidean space. So we want to study some similar weighted F equalities in the Euclidean space. So this kind of inequality was first studied by Huang and Miao in 2015. So they So they compare the weighted R2 weighted mean curvature integral and the volume. So and this inequality is sharp, provided the hypersurface is star shape and the mean convex. They also use the inverse Minkowski flow and they find a nice geometrical quantity called Qt. Quantity called Qt, which has some monotonicity along the inverse mean curvature flow. So, this is a new one. If we can show that the limit value of Qt tends to zero if T comes to infinity, then we can get the result equality. But unfortunately, this is not true because this is not true because both the two terms in the in this square grows like exponential power n over n minus 1 times t. So this will blow up to infinity or minus infinity. So we come just from the monotonicity to get the desired inequality. So they take Quality. So they take another approach by using a Rayleigh's formula, like as follows. They apply Rayleigh's formula to the Euclidian domains omega. So and choose U to be R square. Then use the relation between the two Laplacian, the Laplacian for the Euclidean domains and the Laplacian on the surface. On the surface, then can show that the abound equality holds for convex type surface. Here, the condition convex comes from the last term. So they need to control this term. So after if we impose convex condition, so this term has a good sign. So for the equality, so sigma is centered at the origin. Sigma is centered at origin or not? Yes, at our original. So the choosing are from the point. So that is sigma is traditional to be a center origin. Yes, yes, yes. So we combine these two things together. We know that along the inverse mean curvature flow, a starship and the mean convex mean convex type surface deforms to a convex one. So combine these two things together. So they can show that the They can show that the inequality actually holds for starship and the mean convex type surface. Recall the isoparametric inequality. We know that there is an intermediate term, like the area. So the area, so one may ask, can we compare the activated mean curvature integral and the area sigma? The L real sigma. This is studied by Hira and Rodrigo in 2020. So by the isporometric inequality, we see that this is an improvement of previous inequality. And the condition is the same as before. So the proof is also used inverse. Use the inverse mean curvature flow. So they chose the geometric inequality ET. So it's natural to choose like this. So they calculate how this evolves along the flow. We can say that to get the monotonicity, so here appears that there is just the polymers inequality. So they are proof by using proving. By using previous results, so they can say that the derivative of ET is less than is now positive. And for weighted higher order mean curvature, also by this last is the also we can compare the initial value and the limit value together. Value and the limit value to get the desired inequality. So, by the higher order, weighted higher order case mean curvature integral is also studied by Pa and Meo in 2015. So, they can compare the R2HK integral and the HK minus one integral. And the condition is that to require the hypersurface to be star-shaped and k-convex. So, here the approach is to use a generalized Minkowski formula. So, we can also say that there is a gap. So, what about can we compare the R2HK integral and the integral of HK minus 1? So, this is this will. So this was studied by Wei and Joe. So this added the same condition. They also use the inverse curvature flow like this and chose the geometric inequality QT and want to show the monotonicity along the flow. Here also, the last equality, they also need to use Palmer's. Need to use Palmier's inequality. So it's natural to ask: can we give a direct proof to this equality and guarantee the Rodriguez equality? So without use previous inequalities. So this is yes, actually we can establish stronger, a little bit stronger. Stronger, a little bit stronger in quality, which three distinct quantum mass integrals. So that's our result. So if the hype surface is star-shaped and k-convex, so we can compare these three point mass integrals. So we can see that look at the second one and the right-hand side, we can say by the Alexandria. Can set as a Alexandria function inequalities. So, this gives us the revised inequality. So, this is the improvement of previous equality. We have some remarks. When k equals to n, we can see that the second, the coefficient in the second term vanishes. So, this reduced to the guerrilla and the red riggles result. And Paul and Wei have some similar results in 2023, and their result also relies on Pong L's result. So here, let me, how can we do this? So here, the point is that rather than to use the inverse curvature flow, we use the normal. Curvature flow, we use the normalized one. So, here by adding a minus u, here u is the support function. So, we know that along this flow, the pole mass integral of the integral of h k minus y is preserved. So, is preserving flow. And we know that the flow actually is not. The flow actually is not new, it's equivalent to the unnormalized one. But to prove the monotonicity, it's more convenient to use this one. So it's natural, we want to show that this geometrical quantity may have some monotonicity along the abound flow, the normalized. Normalized inverse curvature flow. So we need to see how this function evolves along the flow. So first recall the variation formula. So the first one is just standard one. So if the normal speed is a big F, then the HK minus one integral the y integral, the valuation of h k minus y integral is h k times the normal speed times some constant. And the second one is by computation so that they have three terms. So R square hk plus one and the u times h k and the minus h k minus one term times the normal speed. times the normal speed. So this is just a way of show our special F, normal speed F to be HK minus 1 over HK minus U. Here is a change that we divide the HK plus one part into two parts into HK of two K times UHK and two times U K and the two times UHK. This two paths to UHK with the third one minus two HK minus one. We can see that compared with the flow speed, it will give us a total square term. So this one has a good sign. So we need to estimate the first two. The first two terms. So the first term is so we may omit the coefficient. So the first term is to choose by no term acclaiming equality. So it's less than this one. So this one is So we want to estimate these two terms to have a good sign. So we recall a very simple lemma. The proof is very simple, but it will play an important role in our proof to establish the Establish the monotonicity. So here comes a simple fact that actually this is a conformal killing vector in the Euclidean space. So we get that a square is two times We can get a very brief formula, the second derivative of the function R square. So since here Tk is the Norton tensor, which is defined by the derivative of sigma k plus 1 with the shape operator H. shape operator HIJ so when we time the k minus 1 orders not intenser since it's differential free we can put it into the derivative term covariant derivative term so get this blue formula so we know that if we integrating this formula is just the well known Just the well-known Minkowski formula. So the first one is follows by multiply the both sides by the function R2 and the integration by path. And the second one is multiplied by U. And notice that the valuation, the formula of the covariant valuation of the support function u. So by this lemma, we can see that if the we can see that if the hyper surface is k convex so we know that the not tensor k t k minus one is uh a positive definite so we can get a good sign so but here when you if we use this lemma to get a get a good sign that this is uh non-negative you need we need that since the red That since the right-hand side is there is a term TK, so the K is not a tensor. So we need to control this. We need to pass the K plus one convex condition. And the second one, if we want to have a set, we need to control this. We hope that the second term in the second formula, in the right-hand side, has. second formula in the right-hand side has a good size. So we need to we need that the hypersurface need to be convex. So convex. But our condition, we only know that the hypersurface is to be k-convex. So we count just from this lemma to get our desired sign. So here the point is that we count Can't estimate them separately. We need to deal with them together. So we can't just throw it out. So here, so first is a check that we divide into two parts to get a total square term, so which has a good sign. So here we need to use the previous lemma. To use the previous lemma, so to previous as the second term, the t k minus one times the covariative of r square term. So this red term. So we use previous lemma to express as the red term. Then use well-known integration. Well know integration of the notion tensor, so it's equals to minus t k times sigma k term. We then use the previous lemma again to express this term t k times covariate tr square term into this again. So fortunately, so these two terms, we can see that the integral integrant. The integral integrand is just the same, and the coefficient is just cancel each other. So we get our result inequality. So the monotonicity follows from that we know that the k-square mass integral is preserved along the flow. flow so the the term in the bracket uh decreasing and the uh hk minus one uh preserved so the compare them together so get that so we get qkt uh is monotone decreasing along the floor the rest left the rest part is just uh the same as before so we we may uh scap it so uh here So here, we may ask: can we get some general for general alpha such kind of inequality is still hold. So we can get the weighted Alexandria function inequality in the Euclidean space. So is that for general arc? Is that for general alpha? Alpha is a real number. So we need that is larger or equal than one. So we can compare the general R to alpha HK integral and the point mass integral HJ. So this I think this inequality is very brief. There's no other terms. So the condition is also to require. The condition is also to repel the star shapes and the k convexity. Intermediate consequence of this theorem is the isoprometric type result that in this in the class of star-shaped and k-con maps type surface, if we fix the j mean curvature integral, then the minimum of the the minimum of the uh the general R to alpha H K integral uh so it's achieved by and only by the wrong spheres so uh and another uh consequence of this result is that we can uh reformulate it is this one so we put all the uh the power on uh we move it to the left hand side To the left-hand side. Since our formula holds for all alpha from one to infinity, so we can let the alpha go to infinity. And the left-hand side gives us the outer radius. So we can get a low amount of outer radius by the J mean curvature integral. So, also this inequality can be also seen as the upper bound of the curvature integral. And if j equals to zero, so the right-hand side is the area. So, this is actually proved by Shua and Char Charsia in twenty nineteen in more ambient space with non-positive ratio curvature. Positive ratio curvature. And this inequality actually is not a trivial. Maybe for convex is no. And for the case, if we choose J to be K minus 1, so the strongest one by the Electronic French inequality. So if J chose to be K minus 1. So, the equality is equivalent to this one. So, if we write under this form, so we need the hyper surface to be star-shaped and k plus 1 convex. So, compare with the previous Alexandria fashion inequality, we may ask, can we weaken this condition to be k convex? Contribution to be K covex have surface and a star shape. The approach is as before, we scale use the normalized inverse curvature flow as before. And we want to show this Q alpha T like this to maybe have some monotonicity along the flow. So, if we get this, then we can compare the initial value of Q alpha and the limited value to give us the desired equality. Here, the difficult part is to show the monotonicity. So, first we need to calculate the valuation formula of the R to alpha times HK term. H k integral. So by a straight word computation, we can say that now the evolution formula have four terms. So times the normal speed f. So to to we uh we set phi to be uh one half r square for brief. One half are square for brief. Here, this variation formula holds for general real number alpha. We can see that the red term is the actual term. So, when alpha equals to one, this term vanishes, since the coefficient vanishes. So, this term is a little bit comf complicated. Complicated. So, in general, it's hard to control to give us a design, a good sign. So, next we will choose the F to be our HK minus one over HK minus U. So we substitute the previous formula. To choose the previous formula like this. So this is just choose our special F. So this has two terms. So the first trick is as before, we need to We need to we need to uh the second term so with co with this with this fifth coefficient we need to uh divide into two parts h alpha k times alpha and the minus uh alpha k we similarly uh deal with it so to uh do this as before so this after term with uh the the phi the the phi alpha minus one uh the the big phi with power alpha minus one times uhk and this upper term uh with uh big alpha with power big phi with power alpha minus one times hp minus one also combined combined with our chosen uh normal speed uh gives us a total square term so is uh this term So it's this term, one, two, three, the fourth term, the third term, sorry, the third term, which have a good design, a good sign. So we need to estimate the last part. We divide it into five terms. So the third term is a good one. So, the third term is a good one. We can just throw it out. So, we need to deal with the last one. So, the first one is also choosing to by using note-macrolling quality. So, the second one is to using previous lemma again and again. So, and also we use. We use again the no integration of the noted tensor. So I use it again and we use many times about this. So, we use many times this lemma to deal with those terms by carefully calculation. So the second term, so we can still divide it to three terms. So 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, and 2, 3 terms. And use again the previous lemma and the divergence free property of the non- divergence free property of the note tensor. So the two, three terms can be calculated like this. So we can see that the term one and the two, three terms cancel each other to give us a wood sign. And also two one term and the fifth term, so just a combination. So the fifth term, we still need to deal with it to Deal with it to using the previous lemma and the divergence-free property of the noted tensor. So we finally arrive at this kind of inequality. Fortunately, the term in the bracket has a nice expression. So we observe that it can be expressed as this. Expressed as this, like the blue formula. So we know that under the condition that the type of surface is k convex, so this HK over HK minus one is monotonous increasing by the shape operator. So this one is non-negative. So So we get the design monotonicity of the phi alpha HK. So here, in the last inequality, we need to use that the alpha is larger or equal than one condition. So on the other hand, we know that the G's mean curvature. That the G's mean curvature integral, so under the first one follows from the variation formula, and then we use the notor Macron inequality and the Mikovsky formula, we know that it's a monotonic increasing. So, combine these two things together. So, Q alpha T. So, the first one is increasing. So, the second one. So the second one is non-increasing. So this is non-increasing along the chosen flow. The rest part is the same as before. So the difficult part is to show that this the monopoly tonicity of this geometric inequality. So I will recall our theorem again. And we may ask what about the case for alpha between 0 to 1? 0 to 1. We have some evidence that if alpha equals to 0, so it follows by it holds by the electronic function equalities. It's just the normal elementary function inequality. And when alpha equal to the half, the above equality also follows from the Mikauski equality. So when we ask what about the case alpha belongs the integral zero to integral zero to one and second we are interested that what about such kind of weighted inequality for general alpha that's uh do they hold still for the hypersurface in the in the uh hyperbolic space so not just in the euclidean space so let me stop So let me stop here. Thank you for your attention.
