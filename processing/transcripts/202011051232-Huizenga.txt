Welcome Jack Uzinga from Penn State, who's going to tell us about cohomology of general tensor products of vector bundles on the projective plane. Jack? Okay. Well, thank you very much for the invitation. It's great to be here. I hope to see most of you in person soon. And thank you to the organizers for organizing this great conference. So this is joint work with Iset Kuskin and Jay Copper. So I think everything I tell you about today is going to be joint with that. Everything I tell you about today is going to be joint with them. So, our starting point is: we start with the set of numerical invariants of a vector bundle on P2. So, you can record this as a rank, as a first churn class, and as the second churn character. For most of today, I'm going to, instead, as Izz mentioned on Tuesday, I'm going to choose to record this by the slope, which is C1 over the rank. This is just a number because we're on P2, and the discriminant, which is one half the slope squared plus CH2 over the rank. plus cha2 over the rank. And this discriminant, this is the number that shows up in the Begummel of inequality. So you know if you have a stable bundle, then delta is bigger than or equal to zero. So this should be familiar to people working with vector bundles. So for today, I'll just say a vector bundle is stable if every sub-bundle or every sub-sheaf has smaller slope. So if you know about Giesecker stability, that's totally fine. That's actually what I'm going to be dealing with, but we're not going to get detailed. With, but we're not going to get detailed enough to worry about the difference too much. And then, given a set of numerical invariants, we can form a moduli space of semi-stable sheaves with those numerical invariants. And for the purpose of today, it's important that on P2, these modulized spaces are all irreducible projective varieties. So as Isit was saying on Tuesday, you can think about what does the general sheaf look like? What does the general thing in the space look like? And once you've got an irreducible space, then there's no ambiguity. Space, then there's no ambiguity as to what you mean about that. So, the question I want to think about today: well, is it on Tuesday asked, What's the cohomology of a general sheaf? And I want to soup this up. I want to talk about the cohomology of a general tensor product. So we take two modulized spaces, M of V and M of W. And if you want to think, you can think about like pairing them together by the tensor product. So we take a V in M of V and a W in M of W. We take their tensor product, and we want to. Tensor product, and we want to know what the cohomology of the general thing is there. Now, this sounds quite a bit like what Is it was talking about, where he has an irreducible moduli space and he wants to know what's the cohomology of a general sheaf in that space. You might think that you could try to like reduce this problem to that problem. So, for instance, it's often the case that if you have a stable V and a stable W, then the tensor product is also stable. This isn't always true, but this is. Is also stable. This isn't always true, but this happens often enough. So you could say, well, this comes from some other moduli space, and what does its cohomology look like? But the problem is that tensor products are very special. This won't be a general thing in kind of the target moduli space. So this is a legitimately different problem. And it's quite a bit more challenging than what IzIT was talking about on Tuesday. Of course, I'm a co-author with IzIt on one of those papers, so I'm not criticizing ISIT here. I'm not criticizing, is it here? But yeah, so this is a really interesting question. What's the cohomology of a general tensor product? So there's some applications of this. So this is kind of the starting point for higher rank Brill Noza theory. So you want to describe loci by like jumping of cohomology and things like this. And this is one of the first problems that you'll encounter if you try to do this on surfaces, especially. I think we know a lot more about the story for curves. A lot more about the story for curves than we do for surfaces. And even on P2, there's lots and lots of open questions here. The special case where the Euler characteristic of the tensor product is zero, this is particularly important for LaPotier's strange duality conjectures. And kind of in LaPotier's strange duality, you want to talk about sections of some line bundles on some moduli space. And you take two moduli spaces and pair them together, and the kind of admissible pairs are the ones where. The kind of admissible pairs are the ones where the Euler characteristic is zero. But also, you need to know that the cohomology of the general tensor product is actually kind of no cohomology. So, if we have V tensor W has Euler characteristic zero, then you might expect that a general tensor product like this has no cohomology in any degree. And if you want to do strange duality stuff, then you need to actually know that that holds for the general pair of bundles. And also, you can. You can use these various jumping loci and the knowledge of kind of special cohomology and the loci where that happens to think about special loci in moduli spaces or in Hilbert schemes of points. So like as a simple example, like for instance, you can, on a Hilbert scheme of three points in P2, for instance, you can make a divisor where the three points all lie in a line. And that kind of divisor can be explained as Be explained as something like this. You can define those kinds of loci with these kinds of tensor product problems. Are there any questions? So let me tell you just what we might hope that the cohomology would be. And this is similar to Is it on Tuesday mentioned the dream cohomology? So on Tuesday, he mentioned that if. So on Tuesday, he mentioned that if you've got just one sheaf, you might hope that the cohomology can be determined just by the Euler characteristic of that sheaf. And you can kind of hope that the same thing is still true if we're talking about a tensor product. So let's start with stable bundles V and W. And then there's a standard fact about stable bundles that if the slope of V is higher than the slope of W, then there's no Homs from V to W. And then we typically expect that the cohomology of the tensor product V tensor W is The tensor product V tensor W is determined by the slope and the Euler characteristic of this sheaf. Let me go into a little bit more detail about what I mean by that. Well, if you use stability and seraduality, and you know that the slope of the tensor product is at least minus 3, then that always means that there's no H2. And so the remaining possibilities are that there's H0 and H1. Well, you expect one of them is zero. And now you've got two vanishings. You can figure out what the other columnology is. You can figure out what the other columnology group is. It's just going to be given by the absolute value of the Euler characteristic. Similarly, if you assume that the slope is less than zero, then stability says you don't have any sections. And so again, you expect that the colomology is H1 and H2. You expect one of them is zero, and the other one is the absolute value of the either characteristic. And finally, in the intermediate range, if the slope is between minus three and zero, Between minus three and zero, then by what we've said already, there can't be H0 or H2. You only have H1, it's minus two other characteristics. So this is the easiest case. In this case, there's nothing to do. We're already done with the problem. Up to ser duality, we can always focus on the case where the slope is bigger than or equal to zero. So for the rest of today, we might as well assume this. And our job is to compute H0 and H1. Okay. Okay. And I don't want to spoil the main theorem just yet, but let me tell you that we say this is the expected cohomology. That doesn't mean that this is the answer. That doesn't mean that this is always what actually happens. With Izzett's talk, we saw that like on a K3 surface, for instance, there can be all kinds of different answers. Although Izet's question on P2 had the dream answer, right? He said that if, well, actually, previous results, the dream answer for P2. Previous results, the dream answer for P2, right? So Gutscha and Herschowitz in 94, they say that if you take W to be O, okay, then tensoring by O doesn't do anything. So we're really talking about a general bundle in the moduli space. And a general bundle in one moduli space always has the expected cohomology. So this was Is it's dream answer from from Tuesday, and this is the kind of the nicest possible, the nicest possible answer for what the cohomology could be. Kind of in the other direction, we want to think about okay, actual tensor products. And Jose in 86 showed that if we have two exceptional bundles, then the tensor product has the expected cohomology, where I mean in the sense of the in the sense of back up here. You figure out what the slope is and what the other characteristic is, and then you're able to tell what your cohomology should be. So this case, So this case, E tensor F, this is not gonna be something general in moduli. This will have deformations. And so this is an actual kind of tensor product theorem. Here, this is really an honest tensor product. You can't just say that this is just a general sheaf and then it follows from Getscher-Hirschwitz. This is something quite different. Okay, and I probably don't need to define with all the experts here what an exceptional. With all the experts here, what an exceptional bundle is, but we'll say a bundle E and P2 is exceptional if it's stable and it's rigid. So X1EE is zero. Now, more recently, Is that myself and Matthew Wolf have a result which kind of does an extremal computation of this sort. So, what we show is that if you start from a V, then you can find a certain churn character, U plus. churn character u plus which is orthogonal to v so the eulogeristic of v tensor u plus is zero and now again the expected cohomology if the eulogistic is zero is that there's no cohomology in any degree right and we show that if you take a general bundle of character v and a general bundle of character u plus then in fact there is no cohomology for that for that general tensor product but to tie this in with with kind of To tie this in with kind of this workshop, well, this vanishing, it's really an extremal vanishing, and it arises from the minimal model program for the moduli space. So this is kind of a new result that I think it would have been hard to conceive of by Dreze and Gosha Hershowitz 20 years ago. This is really depending on some of the new machinery and our new knowledge about the minimal model program for the moduli space. Model program for the moduli space. Is this U plus primitive? So, actually, what we show is you find this character, and then you take a sufficiently high multiple of this character, and then the vanishing holes. So, it's almost exactly not primitive. And taking multiplicity is really important, is it? We don't know. So, I'll talk a little bit more about this later. Later. So there's a somewhat rare case where U plus is actually the character of an exceptional bundle. And in that case, you don't have to take a multiple. But in most cases, this is the character of some stable bundle. And as far as we know, you have to take a multiple. But I expect you don't really have to. I don't have any examples where you don't need the multiple. It's kind of a remnant of the proof. Actually, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. For U plus, you do not have to take a multiple. For u plus, you do not have to take a multiple. Um, so that's a that's a new result. Um, you do not need you do not for this particular u plus, but but but in the in the main theorem that I'm going to state later, you have to take multiples again. So so um but for this for this one particular extremal character, you do not have to take multiples. Very good. So you can always you can always pick it to be primitive if you want. Yeah. Are there any other questions? So then, in this case where the Euler characteristic is zero, you can form real nether divisors. So, we can form a divisor du plus. This is all those sheaves V where you have a section of the tensor product. And this is actually an extremely effective divisor on the moduli space. That's kind of what I mean by this arises from the MMP. And another, again, to say that this is kind of. Again, to say that this is kind of an extremal vanishing, that this cohomology vanishing is an extremal statement. If I perturb u plus a little bit in one direction, then actually we can get unexpected cohomology. And that'll be part of the content of the main theorem today. But so there are examples of W's where V tensor W has cohomology different from the expected cohomology. Any questions? Okay, so to explain our main theorem and to tell you more about this story, I need to tell you kind of this MMP picture a little bit. And so I want to tell you about a particular vibration of the moduli space. So I'll call this the Kronecker vibration. And what this is, is it's a dominant rational map from a moduli space of sheaves on P2 to a space I'll call Kerr of V. This is Kerr of V. This is some moduli space of two-term complexes. I'm going to tell you how to figure out what moduli space of two-term complexes this is. Another way to think of it is it's a moduli space of representations of a Kronecker quiver. So that's the quiver with two vertices and a bunch of arrows between the two vertices. And I guess if you throw out a bad locus from this map, then you can see that the general fiber of this map is birational to a Grasmanian. So, this map is essentially a birational modification of the Maury vibration if you run the MMP. And this also corresponds to extremal edge of the effective cone of the moduli space in that sense. Okay, so I want to tell you what this map is and how you actually get this map. So, the key data that you need to understand what this map is, is the concept of a primary corresponding. Is the concept of a primary corresponding exceptional bundle? So I'm going to start with some character v. I'm going to start with some character v. I'm going to determine some exceptional bundle on P2. And here's how I'm going to do it. So what are the exceptional bundles on P2? Well, you have like, for instance, you have line bundles, but you also have like tangent bundles and twists of tangent bundles, and you've got all kinds of other stuff. But notice that if you twist by like a really high If you twist by like a really high line bundle, then of course the other characteristic of that twist will be positive. Right, if I twist by a really negative line bundle, also the other characteristic will be positive. But if I twist by something in the middle, it's going to be possible to get a negative Euler characteristic. And the definition of E plus is simply that it's the exceptional bundle of smallest slope, such that if I take anyone of higher slope, then the Of higher slope, then the Euler characteristic becomes positive. So as I run through all the exceptional bundles kind of slope by slope, for really negative slopes, the Euler characters will be positive. For slopes in the middle, the Euler characteristic will be negative. And then for slopes that are really positive, the Euler characteristics will be positive again. So I'm looking for this turning point, kind of where the slope or where the Euler characteristic goes from negative to positive. It's not really clear at this point that such a thing. Really clear at this point that such a thing actually exists and is uniquely defined, but that's true. I'll give you a picture later that'll maybe convince you of that. But so, again, we're looking for kind of the exceptional bundle where if I increase the slope of my exceptional bundle a little bit, then the Euler characteristic becomes positive. However, it's possible, I'm not saying anything about the Euler characteristic of V tensor, this particular exceptional bundle. Bundle. Okay, so if the Euler characteristic of V tensor this particular exceptional bundle, it can either be positive or zero or negative. Okay, and the construction of the Kronecker vibration is actually going to depend on, it's going to depend on this sign. Okay, but so let me slow down a bit and give you some details now as to how we actually construct this thing. So we've found this exceptional bundle E plus, where Exceptional bundle E plus, where again, if I increase the slope a little bit, the Euler characteristic is going to be positive, but I don't know the sign of this particular Euler characteristic. And now let's, just for simplicity today, let's assume that we're in the case where the Euler characteristic of V tensor E plus is positive. And in this case, for V, For V in M of V general, it's actually the case that HOM from E plus dual to V, this is a vector space of the expected dimension. We know what the expected dimension is, the expected dimension is the Euler characteristic, but the point is that it is of the expected dimension. Expected dimension, which is the other characteristic from E plus dual to V, which is the same as the other characteristic of E plus tensor V, which let me just call this chi. So this was the number here, which we don't know the sign, except here we're assuming that this is positive. Okay, now let me consider. This is going to sound familiar if you're at Nick's talk. So let's take the canonical evaluation. Let's take the canonical evaluation E plus dual. Tensored with hom from E plus dual to V mapping to V now such maps they're you might hope that like they're surjective or something or injective but in general they're neither right so if we want to study this thing then we can study just the mapping cone of this thing Can study just the mapping cone of this thing. So let me write the mapping cone as E plus dual tensor hom E plus dual V to V to the mapping column. And now I want to study what does this mapping cone look like a little bit. So what does this thing look like? And the trick here is to write down a spectral sequence. Let's say which computes E computes V using an exceptional collection. And the collection that I choose, I want it. And the collection that I choose, I want it to end with this exceptional bundle. So it's going to be three exceptional bundles, let's say FG and E plus tool. And there's a particular way in which we can canonically write down an exceptional collection like this. You can see the paper if you want to know exactly which collection we do. Whoops. And this And this spectral sequence looks like the following. So it looks like f, some number of copies of f going to some number of copies of g. That's one row. And another row is 0 to 0 to some number of copies of this e plus dual. And the number of copies is chi. And then you can actually show that this complex, this complex K is really just this complex. It's this map between these two exceptional bundles. So you can show that this object in the derived category is isomorphic to the two-term complex F M1 to GM2. Does it call for any choice of F and G? For any choice of F and G, yeah, so we choose them specially. So if you know about exceptional bundles on P2, then there's kind of a hierarchy of exceptional bundles on P2, where some are more complicated and some are less complicated. So like you can start from line bundles and then you can mutate them together to get like tangent bundles and you can mutate those to get then rank five bundles and so on. And the way we want to do this is we want to make sure that This is what we want to make sure that e plus dual is the most complicated out of the three exceptional bundles here. If you do that, then that will tell you what f and g have to be. Okay. Okay. But so, yeah, E plus dual can be built up by mutations from simpler exceptional bundles. And in some sense, these are the simpler exceptional bundles that show up when you do that. Okay, so this probably means that the rank of E plus is bigger than the rank of F and the rank of G, right? Yes, yes. So now how do I record such a thing? Well, something like this, such complexes can be encoded. Encoded by a representation of the Kronecker quiver with two vertices and n arrows, where n is the number of homs from f to g. And the dimension vector of my representation is just m1, m2. These numbers m1 and m2, you can also determine them from the character v that we started with. They're just some other characteristics of v paired with various exceptional bundles. And an important And an important fact is that this representation is stable. This essentially corresponds to well, this is because we chose that first exceptional bundle. That first exceptional bundle, E, let's say E plus the way we did. So a lot of this you can do more generally, just starting from some exceptional bundle. The shape of the spectral sequence might change a little bit, but if you do it in the right way, then kind of if you do it the way we did it here, then this complex that we get out of this is a stable complex. If you do it in some other way, you're not going to get. If you do it in some other way, you're not going to get a stable complex. So, if we want to associate to our V some representation of the Kronik equivalence, let's call it K, but really I'm thinking of it as being this two-term complex. This is a good way to do it where you still get stability after the fact. Sorry, this stability does it hold for a general V or for any V? Yes, this is for a general V. Yes, this is for a general V. This is for a general V. And if you have, if you have a, so I'm only actually describing kind of how to associate a complex for a general V, because this canonical evaluation, for instance, it could have the wrong dimension if V is not general. And also the spectral sequence here, it could look different if V was not general. And another question, so probably you can define something like E minus in a similar form. In a similar fashion, will it give you F more or less maybe up to duality? So I think the natural definition of E minus will actually give you the. Okay, so the Picard group of the moduli space is rank two. So the effective cone has two edges, right? And this E plus corresponds to one edge of the effective cone. If you simply define a If you similarly define an E minus, then you'll actually be getting the other edge of the effective cone. So let me just say what the Kronecker vibration is. I mean, you can probably already guess what it is, but then let me say what would happen if we did this for an E minus instead. So the Kronecker vibration M of V to Kerr V, it's just the map which sends V to K dot. But then in order to get a point in this space, you might associate this with the complex F M1 to GM2. Okay, so if you start. Okay, so if you started from E minus, so what would E minus be? E minus would be the exceptional bundle of largest possible slope so that anyone of smaller slope has a positive Euler characteristic. And if you define that bundle E minus, you can still go through a lot of this procedure, basically in the same way. And you will get a vibration to Get a vibration to a different space of Kronecker modules, a different, sorry, to a different space of representations of a Kronecker equivalent. The complexes can have different shape or different numerical invariants, and also the number of arrows can change. So kind of the moduli space M of V has two interesting vibrations to different to different spaces of Kronecker representations of the Kronecker equipment. Okay. Are there any other questions? Are there any other questions? Okay, so now I'm about ready to tell you the main theorem. Just a couple quick remarks before we do that. So of course, this character K, by which I mean the character of the complex K, that only depends on V. So that's just V minus the Euler characteristic times Euler characteristic, many copies of this exceptional bundle E plus tool. Exceptional bundle E plus dual. So this is something you can easily determine just straight from V. And also the rank of this complex has a simple interpretation. So if you look at the canonical evaluation map, if you want to know if this is generically surjective, you just have to know if the rank of k is less than or equal to zero. So if the rank of k is less than or equal to zero, then this is generically surjective. This is much as in Nick's talk just a little while ago. Nick's talk just a little while ago. The co-kernel then will either be torsion or zero. In fact, this thing is often actually surjective, not just generically surjective. And then the kernel will sit here, right? On the other hand, if the rank of k is positive, then this thing will actually be injective, and the co-kernel will sit here. Okay? So what's our theorem? So just to state the theorem, we need to know about all this stuff. We need to know about all this stuff. So let's let v and w be churn characters of stable bundles on p2. And let me assume that m of v is positive dimensional. If m of v wasn't positive dimensional, then we're in the Dreze case. We're talking about exceptional bundles. And we already know that if we tensor exceptional bundles, we get the expected cohomology. Here's this slightly annoying assumption that w is sufficiently divisible. So whatever w was. So, whatever w was, you might have to take a large multiple of it for the theorem to become true. And this was our simplifying assumption from the beginning of the talk. We said that we were going to assume the slope of the tensor product was bigger than or equal to zero. And now let me take two general bundles, a general V and general W, and I want to know about the cohomology of V tensor W. Let me let E plus and K be the things we've just been constructing for the last. Just been constructing for the last 15 minutes or whatever. So they're going to be for V, right? They're the ones associated to V. You can kind of similarly do this whole process to W. Of course, the problem is symmetric in V and W. So you can either treat V as the one that you're making this data for, or W as the one you're making this data for. I'm going to make this data for V. It is not quite symmetric since you assume that W is sufficiently divisible, right? True, true, true. True, true. Yes. Although again, we expect that the assumption that W is sufficiently divisible is not actually necessary, but we don't have evidence either way for that. So let me tell you what the answer is. So in many cases, we're in the dream case. So if chi of V tensor E plus is less than or equal to zero, Is less than or equal to zero. Then let me just say V tensor W has expected cohomology. Okay, so in this case, which happens quite often, we just win. There's nothing that can go wrong. The next case. Next case, okay, well, we've dealt with this, so let's assume the opposite. If chi of v tensor e plus is higher than zero, and by the way, this was not a condition on w, right? So we're saying if v is a bundle where chi of v tensor e plus is less than or equal to zero, then no matter what w is, so long as it's sufficiently divisible, I guess, then we then we win. The cohomology is as expected. So next, if chi. So next, if chi of e tensor e plus is bigger than zero, and I need another assumption here, and the rank of that complex k is less than or equal to zero. And remember, that could be interpreted as saying that the canonical evaluation was generically surjective. So this is another good case. Then v tensor w. As expected cohomology. Okay, and now let's so we're still in this case, but let's negate this. Right, so if chi of V tensor E plus is bigger than zero and the And the rank of k is also bigger than zero, then we have two cases to consider here. So the first case, and this case is more complicated. So also in case two, it didn't depend on w at all. Here we're going to start depending on w. So if chi of k tensor w is W is bigger than or equal to zero, or chi of w tensor e plus dual is less than or equal to zero. In this case, we win again. So v tensor w has the expected cohomology. And finally, case 3b, this is going to be the case that. 3b, this is going to be the case that breaks. This is going to be where we get unexpected cohomology. Otherwise, let me tell you what the cohomology is. Otherwise, H naught of V tensor W, I guess this is going to be a number. This is chi of V tensor E plus times chi of times chi of W tensor E plus dual and H1 of V tensor W is minus chi of K tensor W and in this case V tensor W always has unexpected cohomology. Expected cohomology. Right, so here, chi of V tensor E plus, we are assuming that is positive. Chi of W tensor E plus dual, we are assuming that is positive, so we're not in case 3A. And chi of K tensor W, we're not in case 3A, so this is negative. So both of the commons. So, both of the cohomology groups are positive in these cases. Are there any questions before I try to tell you how to interpret this huge mess of inequality? So I can give you a nice clear picture to tell you what case you're in and where you have the unexpected cohomology. Can you deduce easily from this the theorem about The theorem for about the homology of a single stable bundle. So probably just take W to be the structure sheet. I mean, I think that's basically an input. So the proof of this relies on all the previous results in the area, I would say. But yes, you can take W to be O, and you can see actually that if W is O, That if W is O, then you can't be in case 3B. So this does include the Gottscha-Hershowitz result as a special case. It doesn't technically include the Dreze result as a special case because we assumed M of V was positive dimensional. But again, the way the proof goes, you reproved the Dreze result along the way, essentially. So it's, yeah. Any other questions? Any other questions? Okay, so let me give you some pictures to tell you how you actually see what the theorem is saying. So Jess and Lepotier, they classified positive dimensional moduli spaces on P2. So what they say is if you have an exceptional bundle, E, and a stable bundle, V, and the slopes are sandwiched like this. So the slope of V is higher than the slope of E minus 3. Higher than the slope of e minus 3 and smaller than the slope of e, then kind of by what we were saying earlier, that means there's no h0 and there's no h2 of the tensor product. So then there can only be h1, and that means the other characteristic of the tensor product is less than or equal to zero. Now, if you take all the exceptional bundles, sorry, so you should view this as requirements on numerical invariance of v. If v is a stable bundle, then this has to be satisfied. And I guess by the Riemann Rock, And I guess by the Riemann-Rock formula, this is some numerical condition on the numerical invariance of V. So, if you take this into account for all your exceptional bundles, then you get this kind of picture. So, down here I have my exceptional bundles. I have O, I have O of 1, I have the tangent bundle twisted by minus 1. Here is some rank five bundle. The invariants on this plane are the slope and the discriminant. So, this is kind of this kind of projective. kind of this kind of projectivizing the k-group we are we are kind of scaling by by one over the rank i guess um now if you are above this curve if you're above this curve in this shaded region then you have positive positive dimensional moduli spaces and below this curve the only way you have stable bundles if is if you have an exceptional bundle so the most interesting stuff about stable bundles all happens above above or on Happens above above or on this curve. Now, this is happening in the slope and discriminant plane. And the curve is really fractal, right? Yeah, I mean, locally near these kinds of points, right? So this is, it's, I don't know if locally near here, it's not a fractal. Locally near here, it's totally straight. But locally near here, there's in there's infinitely much stuff happening. Yeah, so it's. Yeah, so it's and similarly, there's actually infinitely many exceptional bundles all clustered in this little region here. You can get these by mutating these kinds of things together over and over again. Okay, now let me take a character V, and then I can think about the orthogonal complement to V, just given by the pairing given by the other characteristic of the tensor product. So I look at all things W orthogonal to V under tensor product. To V under tensor product and Euler characteristic. Now, in the slope-discriminate plane, that becomes some kind of parabola. And here's an example. So I take a character V, and here is V perp. Now, a character lies above this parabola if the other characteristic of the tensor product is less than zero, and it would lie below if the other characteristic was positive. Now, the Now, the main thing we needed to do to understand this theorem was we needed to figure out what E plus actually means. And here's how you get E plus. You intersect your orthogonal parabola, V perp, with the Dreza-Lapodia curve. With this curve at the boundary of the shaded region here. And you look for the intersection point. So you look for this point. Now, this point lies on kind of this branch of the Dresden-Lapodia curve. And this branch lies over this exceptional bundle. And this exceptional bundle, this is E plus. Okay, so to rectify this with the definition of E plus that I gave, there's a little bit of work involved, but this at least makes it seem relatively clear that such a thing exists. Relatively clear that such a thing exists. So you intersect V perp with this Dress-Lepodier curve, and you look at the branch where it intersects, and then that branch is given by some exceptional bundle. Earlier, we talked about what U minus would be. My picture does not go all the way back up to the left, but if my parabola looked like this, whoops, that's not a great parabola. If my parabola looked like this, then like here would be E plus. Like here would be E plus, and here would be E minus. But to actually find this, do you need to consider some continuous fraction for something? Yeah, so you need to worry that V perp, V perp could potentially intersect this graph near the fractal parts. And so the delicate part of the argument is making sure that it actually passes through one of these. That it actually passes through one of these branches and doesn't. I mean, so if you intersect this curve with the line, this is the line delta equals one half. If you intersect this curve with the line delta equals one half, you actually get like a cantor set along that line delta equals one half. And you need to make sure that this parabola doesn't pass through the cantor set. And so we do that in earlier work by considering continued fractions. And it's fairly complicated. But now it's a theorem. So now we can use that it passes through the curve here. Any other questions? Okay, so that's how we get E plus. And now we just want to consider the possible cases that showed up in the theorem. And these all have interpretations in terms of how does V perp interact with the Drizzle-Lepotier curve. With the Dresden-Lepodiac curve. So, case one was where chi of V tensor E plus was less than or equal to zero. Now, if I look at the part of the Dreza-Lapodier curve lying over E plus, then a negative Euler characteristic means that this has to lie above the orthogonal parabola. So, V perp has to intersect this curve, but it has to pass below E plus. Pass below E plus here. So here is V perp. So if you intersect V perp with the Dresdenopodia curve and the schematic looks like this, in this case, V tensor W always had expected cohomology. Again, assuming that we scale W to get a sufficiently high multiple of W. Okay, the next case is only slightly more complicated. The next case is only slightly more complicated. In this case, so this assumption means that V perp passes above E plus. This assumption turns out to mean that V perp meets the left branch of the Dresden-Lapodia curve over E plus. Over E plus. So by that, I mean it passes somewhere through here. So our picture looks like this. So we are above E plus. And then we are meeting the left branch of this curve here. And in this case, again, V tensor W has the expected cohomology. Any questions? Maybe can you go back to your first picture with parabola? This one? Yeah, so you explained what is E plus on this picture. Can you also explain what is F and G? The other two exceptionals? They will be two exceptionals to the left, which would help make E plus a. Which would help make E plus's mutation. So in this picture, they would be O or E plus would be O, the other two would be O minus one and O minus two. So in the case where E plus is a line bundle, then it's particularly easy to say what that exceptional collection is. If E plus was the tangent but was a shift twist of the tangent bundle because V perp passed through one of these smaller peaks, then it would be Then it would be the two line bundles that can appear with the tangent bundle in that exceptional collection. So I think minus one and minus three, maybe. Or yeah, I think minus one and minus three. Okay. Any other questions? Okay, so now case three becomes the interesting case. So we know what these two things mean. These two things mean that that V perp passes above it passes above E plus but it intersects the right branch of DLP and this assumption says that E plus is below V perp again right so here we look like this and now And now we have to say, okay, well, in case three, the cohomology of V tensor W, here it depended on W. Okay, and so now I want to think about, okay, where can W lie and what effect will that have on the cohomology? And you get this picture, actually. So here, let me think of. Of, let me think of W as a bundle of invariance mu delta. And so in this picture, I mean, this is a mu delta plane. So I'm going to plot W somewhere on this plane. So here I can think of W as being a point here with coordinates mu delta. And then I And then I can ask: okay, what's the cohomology of V tensor W given that W is a point in that region, right? So this is kind of a parameter space for the invariance of W. Now, the possibilities where I actually get cohomology, these two inequalities, these two inequalities made V tensor W has unexpected cohomology. Unexpected cohomology. It turns out that, okay, so if we want chi of w tensor e plus dual to be higher than zero, then we want this point to be below e plus dual. And e plus dual perp is this parabola. And if we want this, chi of w tensor k to be less than zero, then we want mu delta to be above the parabola k. mu delta to be above the parabola k perp. And the parabola k perp turns out to be the one that passes through e plus and the character u plus from from previous work. But so how can you get this picture? Well, this is one of the curves from the Jesuit-lipodier curve, and this was V perp. So if I want to get this point, I intersect V perp with E plus W perp. With E plus W perp. So it's this intersection point. And then K perp is the parabola that passes between E plus and U plus. So the upshot is in this shaded region, we have non-special cohomology. Sorry, we have unexpected cohomology. We have H0 and H1 are both not zero. And everywhere else in this plane, everywhere else in this plane, you don't have. Everywhere else in this plane, you don't have unexpected cohomology. Cohenology is the expected value. Okay, I'm just about out of time, but let me give you one very clean corollary that skips these pictures. I mean, we completely understand this cohomology now, at least if we're willing to scale W. But let me point out a very clean corollary. So if V has discriminated at least three and W has discriminated at least. And w has discriminate at least 3, then the tensor product has the expected cohomology. Nothing can go wrong under this assumption. And this kind of fits in with results of O'Grady that say that for high discriminant, the moduli space is well-behaved. So everything that happens with unexpected cohomology is a kind of a low discriminant phenomenon. And also 3 in this corollary is optimal. If you replace 3 with 2.9999, then you can cook up examples where there is unexpected cohomology. Okay, I apologize for going. Okay. I apologize for going a couple of minutes over. Um I'll stop there. Thank you. Other questions? In this corollary, do you need W to be sufficiently divisible? Yeah, sorry, we do. And can you explain how do you use this divisibility in the proof? Yeah, so. The proof, yeah. So, um, so I never get to the aspects of the proof part of the talk. Um, one of the main ways is this: so, if V tensor W only has H1, then you can use this to get further vanishings of cohomology. You can increase the discriminant W and still only get H1. So, right, if I can do this by taking an elementary modification, if I if I look at W goes to OP. at w goes to op and then w prime is the kernel so if v if v tensor w only has h1 so it's it's not locally free right w prime is not locally free that's correct but that's fine um then v tensor w prime will still only have h1 this allows you to increase the discriminant of w by like one over the rank of w this doesn't allow you to increase it by any number that you want but if you scale w first But if you scale W first, then you can increase the discriminant by one over whatever your new rank is. And so any discriminant that you want, you can achieve in this way. And so that's one way in which divisibility is needed. My opinion is that maybe this case is not so necessary, but we weren't able to work it out. Another reason that the divisibility of W is needed is: okay, so the case of Euler characteristic of the test. The case of Euler characteristic of the tensor product being zero is particularly interesting. And I already, because you brought it up, I already talked about u minus and u plus. We have these two different extremal, these two different extremal characters coming from the MMP. And so V tensor U minus and V tensor U plus, they both have no cohomology. So if I want to make new bundles with no cohomology, I can just try to make exact sequences that look like this. If U minus and U plus have no cohomology, U minus and u plus have no call male when I tensor with v, then also w has no call male when I tensor with v. But the problem is that, okay, if I look at the orthogonal complement to v in the k group, then that's spanned, or that's a z2, but that z2 might not have basis u minus and u plus. These may span some parallelogram with area higher than one or something. So not every orthogonal character is going to arise in this way. But if you scale the character w, But if you scale the character w, then you can always write it down kind of in this way. So, those are the two main ways, the two main reasons that we need this scaling. Again, my expectation is at least if you have scaled things so that things are bundles. So, you don't want to allow rank one characters unless you're careful for the reason that is it said. Like if you look at IP of 3 or IP of minus 3, then this has both H1 and H2. So you want to be a little bit careful to make sure that you have bundles in the moduli spaces that you're looking at. But my expectation is once you have bundles, then nothing can go wrong. But yeah, the methods we used benefited from having this extra freedom. Any other questions? All right. If not, let's thank Jack again. Thank you, everyone.
