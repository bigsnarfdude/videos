Very good. So let's continue. It's my great pleasure to introduce my neighbor, Carsten Schultz, who will tell us about the convex pool of random points on the boundary and simple point. Well, let me thank the organizers for having me here. And I'm going to talk about a joint paper with Matthias Leipzner and Elizabeth Werner. So it's the convex hull of random points on the boundary of a simple polytope. So what does it really mean? Well, there are a lot of literature about choosing Choosing random points from a convex body and considering the convex hull, and then you ask your question: what is the volume, what is the number of vertices, what is the number of facets, and so on. And so there are satisfactory answers in the case when the boundary is smooth. The boundary is smooth, so when you have curvature. And also, there are a lot of answers known here in the case when you have polytopes, you choose the points from the inside of the polytope. But then there are also the questions of what happens if you choose the points from the boundary. So there are again the two cases, your smooth case, you have curvature, and then the case when you have a polytope. You have a polytope, and this is actually what we studied here in our paper. And so, we are choosing the points from the boundary of a polytope. In this case, a simple polytope. Allow me to make this joke. I mean, we can choose simple polytopes because the proofs are simple then, or simpler than. And of course, we have some idea what what's happening in the case of What's happening in the case of an arbitrary volume hole, but this is more involved. Alright, let me just start with the basics. So let K be a convex body in Rn, as usual. And then we choose capital N random points. So we choose capital N random points here in K, and then usually we denote And then usually we denote the convex hull Kn of these points by just the brackets x1 up to xn and then we say that kn is the random molecule. So we are interested in, as I said before, we are interested here in the expected number of vertices of such a random polytope. The expected number of facets of such random polytope and also the expected volume differences. So we take the volume of K and we compute the volume of the random polytope and consider the difference. Of course it tends to zero, this is obvious, but we would like to know what the rate is. So this is a This is a general disclaimer here. Since explicit results for fixed n cannot be expected, we investigate the asymptotes for n tending towards infinity. Well, let me show you some results here to get you so that you get a feeling here for what is going on. So for all convex bodies K and Rn, K in Rn, we have here the following formula. So you take here the volume of K and you subtract here the expected volume of a random polytope and then you divide here by the volume of K divided by the number of points raised to the power 2 over n plus 1 and then you take the limit here and the limit exists and the limit here is just the integral of Here is just the integral of the boundary of k, and kappa of x is the Gauss curvature, or rather the generalized Gauss curvature, at the point x, at the boundary of k, raised to the power 1 over n plus 1. Okay, so yes, I wrote here also the kappa x denotes a generalized Gauss Kronecker curvature, generalized because well in general Well, in general, if you have a convex body, the classical Gauss curvature may not exist at any point, but we know by Alexandrov that the generalized Gauss curvature exists almost everywhere and makes sense. Alright, so no, that's the wrong direction. No, that's the wrong direction again. So, for a let me mention this here. So, for a polytope P, the formula gives zero here. So, yes? So, if you look at this here, then the curvature is almost everywhere zero. So, then you get zero here, and of course, you know, this formula also holds for polytopes. So, it simply means that this formula is not very meaningful for polytopes. So, it means that this number down here. This number down here is the wrong one. This will come back to this a little later. So this formula was first shown by Rainy and Solanko in dimension 2 and for C2 boundary. Then in higher dimension, Biaker showed the formula for the Euclidean ball. Barani showed this formula for convex bodies. Showed this formula for convex bodies with C3 boundary and everywhere positive curvature, so classical Gauss curvature. Then I showed this formula for in full generality. I have to admit that Porchki and Hooke corrected a mistake in the program. So the integral, the integral here that That we have seen before is called the affine surface area. And well, okay, so this was the smooth case, and we're choosing the points from the inside. Now, if we consider here, if we consider here a polytope, what's the result for the polytope? If we choose points from the inside. Then we have to come up with some definitions here. So, if P is a polytope, then such an n-tuple, F0P, F1P, and so on, up to Fn minus 1 of P of K-dimensional facets. So, FK of P is a k-dimensional facet. And we have these inclusions. We have these inclusions so that actually F0 of P is contained in F1 of P and so on. This is called a flag. It's a flag of a polytope. And the number of flags of P is denoted by, well, a flag of P simply. Sometimes, I mean, a flag is also called a tower of P, you know, if you have seen that, I mean, and you prefer that. Well, in any case, In any case, so for polytropes, for polytropes, we have here for polytope P we have the following. We have if you consider the volume here, the volume of P, and you subtract the expected volume of a random polytope in P, you divide by 1 over n times log n, n, capital N, the number of chosen points raised to the power n minus 1. And this actually has this. Actually, has this limit exists, and this is just the flag number of p times the volume of p and then divided by this number where n the small n is in this dimension. So you see here that this number this sorry this number here this number here is in fact much smaller than what we have seen. Smaller than what we have seen before, right? Let me just, okay. Okay, here you see this. So here in this case, we have this number here, so the power is 2 over n plus 1 of 1 over n. And then compared here to, in the case of a polytope, in the case of a polytope, this is just, it's 1 over n. Polytope, this is just this one over n, basically this one over n, right? And then times some logarithmic factor, which usually appears in this context. Okay, so this formula was shown in dimension two by Rainy and Sulanka, and Barani and Buchta showed it in arbitrary dimension. And I would like to point out here that this phenomenon, this phenomenon that This phenomenon that flag P shows up in such a formula was shown by me in connection with a floating body. So let me just explain what I mean by that. So the floating body, if you have a convex body K and then the floating body you And then the floating body you you uh say the convex floating body you get in the following way. You chop off here a a set of of uh volume delta and you do it in all directions and you're left then with such an inner part and uh so this is uh just called k delta, the floating body here with index delta. Some people call this Some people call this part also the wet part because if you imagine that your convex body is floating in a liquid, so this part is just that part is always below sea level. Okay, so this is what you have to know for this. And now what you need here is the following results. Here is the following result of Barani and Laman. So they showed that the volume minus the expected volume of a random polytope and points, K, is proportional to this expression here. So this is the volume of K minus. Now this is the volume of the floating body with index one over n basically. Volume volume K is just a normalization. Volume k is just a normalization here. But it's just 1 over k. This is the crucial number. So if delta here, if delta is here is 1 over, basically 1 over n, delta equals 1 over n, then what it says is actually that instead of considering this volume difference, you could. you could consider this volume difference. Now, and for these, actually, for these volume differences here, the difference of volume and the floating body, for this, I showed the previous formula. So I showed this type of formula here. So instead of having here the expected volume of a random polytope, I had here the volume of the Volume of the floating body, and for this I showed this type of equality here. And then, if you know that, and you have this result, you would guess the other result. Okay, so this is just what the history of this is about. Well, now I would like to turn. I would like to turn to the case when you choose points on the boundary of a convex body. Okay, so it's getting just a tiny bit more technical. So let k be a convex body in our n. Let f be a continuous positive function, which is just the density of a probability measure here. Because the integral over f over the boundary of this is mu delta k is just delta k is just the back measure on the boundary of k. And so this is the integral of one, so this is the probability, so this is the density of a probability measure, and the probability measure we denote by pf. Alright, so then we have the following. Yeah, we choose, okay, we choose again kn is just, you know, the convex halo of x1 up to xn. Xn. And then here we have the following result. So let kappa be the generalized Gauss chronecker curvature and EFN is the expected volume of a convex Hall of N points. So this is just the expected volume of a random polytope with respect to the probability measure whose density is F. And then you get here this formula. So the volume of k minus the expected volume of a random polytope divided by 1 over n to the power 2 over n minus 1. So this limit exists. And this is just the integral over the Gauss curvature here, but now raised to the power 1 over n minus 1 when we chose points from the inside. When we chose points from the inside, we had here 1 over n plus 1. And then you have to divide here by the density raised to the power 2 over n minus 1. So you have this limit here. Okay, so this is in the case we are choosing the points from the boundary of a convex body. Okay, so. Okay, so now this was the wrong direction here. Okay, okay. So this formula was shown by Elisabeth Rana and myself for convex bodies in which a small Euclidean ball rolls freely and which rolls freely in a big Euclidean ball. So what do I mean by that? So you have your convex body and we say that a small Euclidean ball We say that a small Euclidean ball rolls freely inside here if this Euclidean ball with this given radius touches here the boundary from the inside and is contained. So this means that this little ball rolls freely inside here. So for some radius we have this here and this ball, the convex body here rolls. the the convex body here rolls in in a large convex in a large Euclidean ball if the same holds uh in just with interchange roles. So that actually the convex body here touches here the Euclidean ball from the inside is contained. So this is this condition here and it's possible that actually such a convex body here Convex body here has no classical curvature, Gauss curvature anywhere, but still satisfies here this condition. So well at the same time, Matthias Eitzner showed this formula for convex bodies with C2 plus boundary, gave a different proof of that. And the general results The the general results for the number of L-dimensional spaces of the UK of the random polytope are due to Liaker, Barani, and Buchta and Reichsner. If K is a smooth convex body and then we get here for the expected number of L-dimensional passives of Kn, we get that this is equal to some number depending on N and L, but then here you have But then here you have the affine surface area of k, and then here you get the number of chosen points raised to the power n minus 1 or n plus 1. And you have a similar formula here for the polytope. Then you get here the flag number. And here, instead of having here n to this power, you get here the logarithmic expression, logarithmic to the power n minus 1. So well, so in Well, so in in our so this was a long introduction, I guess, and then in our paper here, so we are actually studying the case if you choose points from the boundary of a polytope. And the result here is the following. Again, oops. Oh, I'm very painful. Ah, can't do it myself here, bro. So we choose capital endpoints uniform in the boundary of a simple polytope, P. So for the expected number of facets of this random polytope, we have that this is simply This is simply asymptotically equal to the number of vertices times log n, number of chosen points to the power n minus 2. And this is, of course, nothing surprising in some sense, because if we are choosing from the boundary here of a polytope, then we are going. Then we are one dimension less. So, and if in dimension n we choose points from inside of a polytope, then we got here the same result with n minus 1, but because here we are one dimension less. So this shows up rather naturally. Although I must say the proof is rather tedious. It's a lot of nitty-gritty stuff here. And it's much more involved than you would think here from when you see this result. Okay, so this is one result we got, and so our proof here shows that the crucial contribution to the number of phases of actually dimension n minus 1 comes from the phases that are not contained in the boundary of P, whose vertices are from exactly. Whose vertices are from exactly two facets. Okay, let me just show you what I mean by that. So the typical situation is this of a vertex of a cube. Why? Because this is the situation when you have a simple polytope, because you know n faces meet here at one vertex. And actually, this is we usually reduce it to the case of a cube. So this is one step. So you choose here. Step. So you choose here some points. So some points in this facet, then some points in this facet, and of course more. And so here, up here, your random polytope looks like this. Down here, it looks like this. And then you And then you get those facets that are not contained in a facet of P. And these are the important ones, of course. So you might get here, for example, this facet. And you might get this facet here, say? And then you might get this facet. This facet here. Okay, so what's written here? What's written here is that, well, the number of facets comes from those facets that are not contained in the boundary of P and whose vertices are from exactly two facets of P. So this means that if we have here this facet, This would be one of those facets that actually give rise to the number of facets here because we have one and two. They come from one facet of P, and this from another. But this situation here, if you have this point, this point, and this point, this is a typical facet that actually would not give a significant contribution to the number of overall tacits. Contribution to the number of oval gases. This is what I always mean. Alright, so let me just finish quickly here. So we also have a formula here for the number of volume difference. And then what happens here is you get here the number n to the minus to the power minus n to the divided by n minus 1. And this was quite some surprise for us that because usually when you have polytopes you would expect some logarithmic factor here and this doesn't show up. Overall the you know the proofs are quite involved, quite tedious and my time is no no no no it was somebody's computer. You have almost six minutes. It was high into Christmas. Please continue. You have over six minutes for sure. It was ringing something. I was rushing now. I was rushing. I'm sorry. It was you? Elizabeth, it was you? I thought it was Glavina. No, just some prettiest, I'm saying. Well, okay. Well, okay. Um no just a joke. Okay, so yeah, so this was this was some surprise here. Okay, well, in any case, what we can what yeah, so what we expect we expect for arbitrary arbitrary polytopes this here that we have here. That we have here the MAC number showing up again. We have decent estimates, but not an asymptotic estimate for this. So basically if, okay, so put it like this, if we have such an asymptotic estimate here for an intergeneral case, then the flag of P has to show up. Okay, so we believe. So and we believe that we are good natured, so we believe that there is such a asymptotic formula. And then so we are pretty sure that this fact shows up. All right, okay, so those okay, let me see. Yeah, okay, now, yeah, I started here with with approve. Well, I may, maybe I I uh Well, I may maybe I I uh think a little bit about it. Um so okay, maybe I just make a drawing once again so so what what's happening here is the following. So we we we can the if We can, if we have such a volume difference here, so actually the volume diff the volume difference we can localize here at the vertices. So and the higher the number of points you choose, the smaller you or the closer you can come here to the vertex and just work here with the, well, basically. With well, basically with the corner of the cube. And then here, so what we so what how we start all this is we so we have here this and then we have here some facets, so say we so say this is a facet, and then say this is another facet. And then we take here the convex hull of this facet and this point. So you get here such a simplex. Yes? And you take the convex hull with all the facets here around that area. And then you have to develop some formula how to estimate. how to um how well to estimate these things and um then uh you uh well then this this gives you the yeah this gives you the result but I mean it's just a hint on how this is done so I think I finish here. Thanks. Any questions? Suggestions? Um so these constants that depend on the dimension that show up, do you know anything about them? that show up. Do you know anything about that? Yes, yes. Uh it's uh some uh or most of them I think we know. Explicit, yes. Yes, explicit, yes, yes, yes, yes. It's you know they're unpleasant sort of or I mean if if you're in for complicated constants then you're happy about them. Do you know the sharp? Do you know the sharp ones? Sorry, sharp ones. Sharp dimensional constants? I mean yes, this yeah yeah exactly. Any other questions, suggestions? If not, let's thank the cards again.
