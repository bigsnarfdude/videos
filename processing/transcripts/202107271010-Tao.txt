UCLA, who I think many of you know, has made great contributions in many fields of math for which he's been awarded more awards than I could possibly list, all of which very well deserve. So we're very happy to have him speak here, and he'll be talking about universality and possible global include equations. So I thought without further ado, take it away. Okay, thanks, Jacob. It's great to be here virtually. And I've always loved being in BAF. It's not quite as It's not quite as pleasant just being there virtually, but still, it's nice to be back. Yeah, so I'll be reporting on sort of the state of this long-term program that I've been pushing for a few years to try to establish blow-up influene equations through trying to establish universality properties of various PDEs. So we don't actually, the program is not complete. We don't actually have a blob result for an actual physical equation. An actual physical equation, yet we have blocked four kinds of models, but I just wanted to tell you where the program is at right now. Okay, so the motivation is the regularity problem for the Nabius-Toksen Euler equations. So I'll just remind you, as you've seen in many talks already, what these equations are. So they're normally phrased in R3, you have a velocity field U and a pressure field P, and you have two equations. Equations, Newton's first law basically for the fluid, with the viscosity term and the incompressibility. And you have viscosity nu, which is positive for Navier-Stokes, and it is when nu is zero, that's the Euler equations. So these equations you can phrase, they're phrased on R3, but you can phrase them on other domains as well. In fact, any Riemannian manifold, let's say without boundary to avoid some technicalities, you can write an Can you write an analog for all of these terms, like for example, passing becomes the passport Trami, or Hodgel Passin, really? And you use the Levite-Juda connection and so forth. And you can get, so there's a natural generalization of these equations to any manifold. And this will become relevant later. Okay. Now, in this talk, we are only going to be worried about smooth solutions, classical solutions. So we're not going to study weak solutions. Uh we're not uh going to study weak solutions or solutions. Spectre fields, and you can you can project out the pressure. Um and oh, my internet is a little unstable, unfortunately. Um, and what you And what you get when you project out the pressure is that you get a semilinear heat equation. So you can rewrite the Navier-Shooks equations equivalently as a heat equation, the plus U, dTU equals nu of the plus U, plus a bilinear operator, which is this funny non-local operator, u dot grad V plus V dot gradu. Take the average, and then you take the projection P onto divergence revector fields. So this is some bilinear operator. Okay, so this is one way to view. This is one way to view the Navier-Stokes equation. Now, this nonlinearity is what causes all the trouble. It obeys one nice property, which is that it has this cancellation condition that when you apply B of U U for any reasonable vector view U, it's always orthogonal to U itself. And as a consequence, if you integrate by parts, this tells you that the Navier-Sooks equations obeys. which lasts up to some time t star, which is some positive time, which is either finite or infinite. And so if so, there's always a maximal A maximal time of existence solution, which either is global, you either have global regularity, it's smooth for all time, or it's your finite time blow-up, that the maximum time of existence is finite, and you can actually see that something's going wrong at the blow-up time. For example, the L-infinity norm goes to infinity. In fact, many other norms diverge as well. Okay, so this is what happens in R3, and there's a similar local result pretty much for any manifold in any dimension. And of course, any dimension and of course the uh literally the the million dollar question is is whether is um is the second scenario finite heim blow up uh does it actually occur uh so um so for Navier Stokes the general belief is that global regularity should occur for Euler I think the more people believe global exists all right so these are the questions all right so All right, so heuristically, the Navier-Stokes equation is what we call a supercritical equation, and as such, we don't really have a clear prediction as to which way it's going to go. So let me just sort of give a heuristic analysis of the Nevis-Looks equations to see what we should expect. Okay, so let's normalize viscosity to be one for simplicity. And let's make an Arnsatz. So let's say that at any given time, the velocity That at any given time, the velocity field oscillates at a certain frequency, n of t, so that its natural frequency is n of t, or equivalently, its natural wavelength is one over n of t. These are not very well-defined concepts. You can maybe imagine the Fourier transform of U being supported in roughly an annulus of size n of t maybe. And let's say that it has amplitude about a of t on the region where it is non-trivial. Okay, so it has some amplitude, so that's sort of the average speed. The average speed of the fluid or where it is actually excited and some average frequency or wavelength. Once you actually make this answer, you can predict what the sizes of various terms in the Navy-Sox equations are. So for example, the viscosity term, nu, we've normalized to one, u is of amplitude a of t, and then Laplacian has two derivatives. That's like multiplying by the frequency twice. So we expect the strength of the viscosity term to be like n squared a. A whereas the non-linear term, which is the LeRay projection of u graduation, u is of size A, so there's two U's here. So you've got A squared, you've got one derivative, so that's an N, and the LeRay projection is of order one. So heuristically, you expect the nonlinear term to be of size n A squared, and the viscosity term to be size n squared A. And the Navier's equation is all about the competition between viscosity and nonlinearity. So we see from this analysis that there's two regimes. That if the frequency is larger than the amplitude, then the viscosity effects will dominate. Because if n is bigger than a, then n squared a is going to be bigger than n a squared. So viscosity dominates nonlinearity. So viscosity effects should dominate when the amplitude is small. And nonlinear effects, you know, transport and convection. You know, transport and convection and incompressibility should dominate when the amplitude is large. I think there's a typo here. I want amplitude to be larger than n. Okay, so if you want blow-up, so if this costity effects dominate, then we expect some behavior like the heat equation, so we should expect no blow-up. So the only way that you expect blow-up is if the non-linear effects dominate, where the amplitude is larger than frequency. So let's assume a power law. Let's assume the amplitude is. Assume a power law. Let's assume the amplitude is of the order of n to the theta, where theta is bigger than one, and at the blow-up time, n is going to go to infinity, and a is going to go to infinity. And so if you take this Ansatz and then you plug it into the Navy-Stokes equations, so the derivative of the amplitude should be the size of the donor. This should suggest finite time blower. Okay, so that's the heuristics, but it's not a proof of anything because this big O could go either way. Now we can, and there's some limitations. There's some limitations as to what this power index theta can be. So, if we make an additional assumption that we assume that there's some intermittency, that any given time the solution is concentrated in some alpha-dimensional set, there's an alpha between zero and three, we're in three dimensions. So, because we are assuming our wavelength is one over n, then that means that at any given time t, the solution be concentrated. time t the solution be concentrated in a so in a in about n to the alpha balls of size n to the one over n so the total volume where you're concentrated should be about n to the minus three plus alpha okay three from the ambient dimension so that tells you what the energy should look like so remember the kinetic energy is integral of u squared or sometimes people put it one half integral of u squared so that's roughly a squared heuristically times the volume n to the minus two plus alpha which in terms of n is n to the minus three plus alpha plus terms of n is n to the minus three plus alpha plus two theta. Now the energy should stay bounded for all time. So this exponent should not be positive. And so that gives you a limitation on the amplitude growth. The exponent of the amplitude is limited by 3 halves minus the intermittency over 2. Okay, so that's the heuristic. So that's what conservation energy tells you. It tells you that the rate of growth of the amplitude is Of growth of the amplitude is controlled by the intermittency. On the other hand, if you want the non-leaning effects to dominate, to beat the viscosity, we need theta to be bigger than one. So these facts are only consistent when the intermittency is high. So we need this intermittency to be bigger than one or equal to one in order to have a chance for nonlinear effects to dominate. And this, of course, is very consistent with the famous partial regularity result of Caffrey Kohler Nuremberg that says that the only way you can have a single Says that the only way you can have a singularity for Nabi-Stokes is if the singularity set has dimension one or less. And in case of dimension one, has households measure zero. Okay, so the enemy is low intermittency. Sorry, maybe I've got high and low, well, low alpha, which I guess means high intermittency. I haven't had these the wrong way around. Okay, so the most extreme case, sort of the most non-linear blob scenario, would be when the intermediate. Non-linear blow-up scenario would be when the intimidancy is all the way down to zero, when alpha is zero and theta is three-halves. So the most dramatic blow-up that you could imagine for Navier-Stokes is if at any given time t, the solution is concentrated in a zero-dimensional set, like a point. So basically all its energy concentrates in a single ball of size one over the frequency. And the amplitude would then be, sorry, n to the plus three halves, that's a typo. If you want to conserve energy, the amplitude should grow like. To conserve energy, the amps should grow like into the three halves. And this is the most extreme block scenario, and our current local theory is not good enough to exclude this scenario. So the scenario is concentration at a point where as your time approaches t star, the frequency goes to infinity, the wavelength goes to zero, and the amplitude, which is n plus three halves, goes to plus infinity. So this is the most extreme scenario which we would like. The most extreme scenario, which we would like to, okay, so sort of the first step to trying to understand the regularity problem would be to see whether this scenario is actually possible. Okay, so one way you can model this extreme blow-up scenario is with dadic shell models. So the full Navier-Stokes equation is too complicated. There's too many degrees of freedom. But one can make a simplified model where at any given frequency scale n, Where at any given frequency scale n, there is just one mode. So you assume that at frequency scale n, the nth frequency component of your solution looks like a scalar module of a single wavelet, basically, concentrated at scale, at some frequency scale. And so if you okay, so if you follow these sort of heuristics, you can model this sort of singularity formation. Singularity formation scenario by what's called a dyadic shell model, where at any given n, you measure how much energy there is at time n, at frequency n, and you call it x n, that's a function of time. And if you heuristically write down what the Nebuchadnezzar-Hicks equation should look like, you get an equation, you let an equation look something like this. So you have an infinite system, there's an infinite dimensional ODE. So for every scale parameter. So, for every scale parameter n, you have a number xn of t, which you should think of as measuring the total energy at time t. Actually, total energy is xn squared. And the rate of change of this amplitude, so there's a dissipation factor which depends on the frequency. So the higher frequencies dissipate faster. Lambda is just some scaling parameter. It's actually bigger than one, which is bigger than zero. And then the bilinear term you can simplify, at least as a heuristic. At least as heuristically, to just interchange between adjacent frequencies. So there's going to be a term here. So energy at scale n minus one can influence energy at scale n, but also, I'm sorry, there's so many typos. This should be n n plus one. But there's also a term where the frequency at scale n plus one influences the scale. So there's this transfer of energy both from lower frequency modes to high frequency modes and vice versa from high. Frequency modes and vice versa from high back to low. You need both in order to have energy conservation. So, okay, so these are these dyadic shell models, which were, I guess, first introduced back in the 70s by Desenchowski and Novikov, but then popularized in the 2000s by Katsin Pavlovich. So this is a simplified model of Navier-Stokes, very simplified. And so you can ask, so there's a parallel local theory for the system for nice smooth data. System for nice smooth data, where smooth now means that xn is rapidly decreasing. And then you have a local solution which exists up to some time. And if the time is finite, there's blow-up. And you can ask, do you have finite time blow-up or do you have global existence? Now, the blow-up scenario, I'll draw a picture. Let's see, can I? Oops. Okay, I think this works. All right. So, um, All right. So the way I think about the frequencies are discrete here. They're indexed by images. So at any given time, there's an energy profile. Okay, so at a given n, xn of t sort of measures how much energy there is. Maybe xn squared. Okay, the square of xn measures how much energy. Of xn, which is how much energy there is at any given time. And the extreme blob scenario is one where at any given time, the energy is concentrated mostly in one mode and not much in other modes. But then as time increases, the energy keeps moving into higher and higher scales. So you have this kind of like traveling wave in frequency space where the energy is moving from medium frequencies to high frequencies to even higher frequencies. Higher frequencies. And the transitions get faster and faster. And so there's a convergent geometric series. And in finite time, you're going to have to be a little bit more detailed. This blow scenario actually happens. So, in three dimensions, so in five and higher dimensions. So, this model, okay, so I should say this funny exponent four-fifths. This four-fifths comes from the three-dimensionality of the problem. I won't explain exactly why. If you go to higher dimensions, this exponent This exponent increases, I think, which so you get you get, sorry, it decreases, you get less dissipation in higher dimensions. And so it's easier to outrun the viscosity. And so it turns out that the analogous model for five and higher dimensions, it was shown back in 2008 by Cheshkharov, that in five and higher dimensions, the exponent of four-thirds becomes two-thirds or less. And there you can actually. Or less, and there you can actually show finite time blow-up for this model. However, in three-dimensions, this model doesn't actually blow up. So, there is a nice little barrier argument that shows that for the three-dimensional model, this toy equation actually has global solutions, which actually decay for all time. So, for every n, the solution decayed exponentially in n. And the problem is that the solutions do not outrun the viscosity. Do not outrun the viscosity. So, morally, what happens is that even if you start with frequency-localized data at some initial time, the solution will spread out a little bit to higher and higher frequencies, but it will become delocalized. The energy will get spread out, shared among many different frequency modes. And no single frequency mode actually carries a lot of energy. And so the amplitude goes down to the point where. To the point where viscosity can take over. And actually, the viscosity actually damps out the solution before it has a chance to escape infinity. So it's because the frequency profile somehow decoheres that you don't actually get final time blow-up. That, yeah, this frequency support becomes broader and broader. So if you take this toy bottle, you don't actually get blowout. But this is an artifact of the model rather than of the actual dynamics, I believe. So, what I was able to show is that if you modify the Diexel model, you make it more complicated. So, instead of having one mode at every frequency scale, I put four modes at every frequency scale. And you make the bilinear interaction between these four modes, you design it in a certain way. You design it in a certain way, you can basically program essentially a time delay into the dynamics. What you can out of the dynamics so that at any given time, so at a given time, the frequency is mostly concentrated, the energy is mostly concentrated in one mode. And what will happen is it will stay there for a while. There are actually four modes in here. The energy will slowly transfer among the four different modes at a certain frequency scale. Different modes at a certain frequency scale. So there'll be this sort of punctuated equilibrium where there'll be a period of time where it looks like nothing is happening. And then very suddenly, all the energy will drain out from one mode into the next mode, into the next set of modes. And so there'll be a very abrupt transition from one mode to the next. And then the dynamics sort of stops for a little bit there. So there'll be a pause where the dynamics sort of stays at that mode. At that mode, until all the energy here is drained, and you wait until the transfer of energy between mode n and mode n plus one is complete before you start the transfer from n plus one to n plus two. So it's like you create these sort of airlocks where you don't open up the channel of energy from n plus one to n plus two until the energy has completely transferred from n to n plus one. And so if you do that, you can actually move all the energy. You can actually move all the energy off to frequency infinity while keeping the solution coherent in frequency. And because of that, the viscosity effects become negligible, and you can still create blow-up. If you convert this back into the language of fluid equations, what this tells you is that after a bit of work, that you can get Fan-Han blow-up, not for Navier-Stokes, which is DTU plus BUU equals viscosity, but if you replace a BUU with a If you replace a BUU with a smaller nonlinearity, what I call an averaged nonlinearity, where you only keep some of the frequency interactions of the nonlinear and you damp out the others. Then you can create a blow-up scenario which is arbitrarily close to this intermittency zero exponent three-halves scenario I talked about. Actually, I lose an epsilon of energy at each scale. So it's actually three halves minus epsilon. But basically, But basically, it is blowing up at almost the maximum rate, but for this fake equation. But this is still a non-linearity that obeys the energy cancellation law. So you still have the energy identity, but it's not actually Navier-Stokes. The actual equation is quite complicated. I won't actually go through it, but okay. Oops. Okay, I mean, this is actually what this looks like. There's lots of This looks like it is there's there's lots of um bilinear terms with various coefficients, um yeah. And as I said, uh, at every given mode, frequency, um, there's actually four different modes, and the energy sort of hangs around these three modes for a long time, and then suddenly it sort of dumps into the next layer. But I think I will skip the actual description of this, all right. So, of course, this is a very artificial. So, of course, this is a very artificial model. This doesn't tell you anything directly about the true Navi-Sox equation. So, but it does kind of show you what should happen in principle. So, it says that this blow-up scenario where you're blowing up an exponent three halves or close to three halves and you're concentrating at a point, it is in principle possible. So, there are Navi-Sooks-like equations, which obey the energy identity, which have this blow up. So, you can't. Had this blow up. So you can't hope to just use function space estimates and clever integration parts or whatever to exclude the scenario. You have to somehow use some special feature of Navier-Stokes that is not shared by this average equation. Now, once you have this blow-up scenario, it turns out viscosity effects are basically lower order. So when I demonstrated the blow-up, the When I demonstrated the blow-up, the viscosity was just a perturbative term. And really, what's going on is that you're really exhibiting a blow-up for the Euler equations. That if you turn off viscosity, if you can create a blow-up with this exponent and this intermittency, as long as it's somehow stable in a certain technical sense, you should be able to adapt it to also give you a blow for Navier Stokes. That somehow the blob is fast enough that you outrun the viscosity. Viscosity is a lower-order term. Is a lower order term. And the solution I constructed, it's not quite a self-similar solution. It's approximately discretely self-similar. So this approach in the blog time, where those solution looks like a rescaled copy of itself with a little bit of error. So the solution at one of these times is constantly on some scale, it's like a blob of vorticity, and it stays. And it stays like that for a long time, and then suddenly it contracts into a ball about half the size and moving somewhat faster. But it sheds a little bit. There's a tiny bit of energy left behind, but most of the energy gets squashed into a smaller ball. And then the energy there stays still for a certain time, and then it gets squashed into a smaller ball. So this is discreetly self-similar dynamics, except that you leave a little bit of mass of energy behind at each time. Time. You have to actually, because there don't exist perfectly self-similar solutions with strong decay. For example, this is a result of SQA against Sergeant Spherach that says that there are no regular solutions that blow up where the L3 norm stays bounded for over time. And if you had a discretely self-similar solution in L3, then the L3 norm would stay bounded, and that would not be possible. Be possible. So you do have to have some leakage. You can't have perfect discrete self-similarity. In particular, in this model, the L3 norm is going to go to infinity as you approach the goal of time, as it must. Okay, so this is the scenario which could still happen. But if you want to make this happen, you need to somehow create a initial data of the fluid, which has the property that it sort of stays almost constant. Property that it sort of stays almost constant for a long period of time, and then suddenly it waits, and then it contracts all its energy, or most of its energy, into a smaller ball in such a way that it becomes that the new state of the velocity is like a rescaled version of your initial state. So it's like creating a machine whose sole purpose is to build a smaller copy of itself. These things are called von Neumann machines. These things are called von Neumann machines in science fiction literature. Yeah, but it is important that you have this time delay because if you have to wait, so there has to be this period where you sort of don't do anything and then you very suddenly push all your energy into this smaller region, or most of the energy. If you don't do that, then the energy is going to leak out and you're going to spread out and you won't get this optimal three-halves growth. Okay. Now, of course, this would require extremely precise choice of initial data. So, even if this was possible, this would only mean that there was some extremely pathological initial data where there would be blow-up for Navier Stokes and probably still for most initial data, you would still have global existence. Okay, so the lesson we learned then is that we should now look at the Euler equation and try to see if there are solutions to the Euler equation. See if there are solutions to the Euler equation that have the sort of discretely self-similar ansats that you start with some initial data, which will eventually become evolve to some smaller rescaled version of itself, plus a small error. Okay, now we need smooth solutions throughout. It doesn't as far as I can tell, knowing blow up solutions for rough data doesn't help us with the global regularity problem. us with the global regularity problem. So you know so even though we now have some progress constructing pathological weak solutions to earlier equations such as LGBT construction of C1 alpha blow-up solutions and we also have complex integration type solutions or SQT patch solutions. I wasn't able to figure out how to use any of those to create smooth blow-up constructions. Yeah, so we sorry, there's a question. Yeah, so we um sorry, there's a question. Um okay, aren't they classical? Okay, yeah, okay, by classical I mean C infinity. Okay, yeah, I guess they're classical in the sense that you can use classical derivatives, but they're not C infinity, which is which is what I need. Okay, all right. All right, now we talked about energy conservation, which is conservation law for the Navy Saux. Conservation law for the Navier-Soaks equations. The Euler equations have a few more conservation laws which cause some problems if you wanted to produce blob. So most of them are not too serious. There's conservation of momentum and angular momentum and helicity, but those are signed conservation laws. They don't seem to really restrict the dynamics too much, especially since if you assume enough symmetry assumptions, you can make them vanish. But there is this law of conservation of circulation. Law of conservation of circulation, which is potentially a problem. That if you integrate your velocity over a loop, or equivalently, if you integrate the curl, which is the vorticity, over a disk, some sort of surface, and then you flow the loop by the flow, the circulation stays conserved. And that's because the vorticity actually gets transported by the flow, but transported not as a scalar, but actually as a two-form. If you write the Euler, That if you write the Euler equations in the language of differential geometry, the vorticity gets transported by the Lie derivative along the velocity field, which means that the vorticity is advected as a two-form, not as a scalar, but that's enough to get conservation circulation. Now, as it turns out, that's still not enough to prevent a blow-up. So, I was able to show that there is a modification. That there is a modification of the Euler equations. So you can write the Euler equations in vorticity stream form, where you have two unknowns: velocity and vorticity. Vorticity gets transported by velocity, and velocity can be recovered from vorticity by the Bausaval law, which is some fractional integral of the vorticity. Now, what I showed is that if you cheat by changing the Bausaval law, okay, so if you change the law of physics in a rather In a rather artificial way by replacing the Parson model with another fractional integral of the same order, but still so that U is divergence-free and you still keep the transport equation. This model will still obey conservation of circulation. The way it's set up, it will still obey conservation of energy. But I can create an Euler-like equation that has finite time blower from smooth data. And the solution, well, I constructed several such examples, but one such example generates what's called a vortex neck pinch. So with these Euler-like equations, vortex lines are transported by the flow. And the particular solution I constructed has vortex lines that are initially parallel, but they get pinched into a bottleneck. Into a bottleneck. So as you approach a blow-time T star, the vortices get pinched into a ring of a small radius where the velocity goes to infinity and the vorticity also goes to infinity. And it's a blob scenario which has the wrong exponent, unfortunately. The exponent is of size about one. And this turns out one is somehow the largest exponent you can have that's consistent with circulation. With circulation conservation, unless you make the vortex lines really have a very complicated topology. If they start winding in some sort of fractal way. But if you want very simple vortex lines, you can't make the vorticity, the exponent of growth bigger than one. Otherwise, you will violate circlation conservation, which is a problem because we need an exponent bigger than one in order to outgrow the viscosity. Outrun the first galaxy. But anyway, yeah, so this is what the solution kind of looks like as you push the flow of time. The vortex lines get pinched into a narrower region. And the dynamics becomes faster and faster. Okay, so again, this is an artificial equation. This does not directly tell us anything about the actual Euler dynamics. Although I will mention that there are some interesting numerics. I will mention that there are some interesting numerics done by this group of authors, Macau and Osteo, Moniko, Himo Brenner, and Rubenstein, where they took two vortex filaments, two vortex tubes of the Euler equations, and they evolved them over time. And they were only able to carry the numerics for about to see about two, three iterations of this dynamics. But what they found was that with specific choice. What they found was that with a specific choice of vortices, I think one is going one direction, one is going in the other, the vortices will start curling in on each other and become thinner. And it's definitely not self-similar, but as you zoom in, you get pictures, you get vortex tubes that are narrower, but still somehow at roughly the same rescale distance from each other. And of course, it becomes more and more turbulent. But it does seem at least, so this is about as far as the numericals were able to go. They could see about two or three iterations where these two nearby tubes interacted and became thinner tubes, much more tangled, but at a closer distance. And one could imagine that this pattern might continue indefinitely and create fine-time flow. So this is a much more So, this is a much more complicated version of this sort of neck pinch type of Einsatz, but it is somehow a tiny bit of evidence that this type of dynamics might actually occur. Here, of course, they have a pair of vortex cubes rather than a single vortex cube. Okay. All right, so these are results where you have these very artificial equations, which have the same strength as Navier-Suggs or Euler, that create fine-time blow-up. That create finite blow-up. But of course, we would like a less artificial equation where one can do this. So, what I've been looking at in recent years is trying to find models of blow-up where the way you modify the Euler equations is that you keep the equation, but you just change the domain. So, you replace the flat domain R3 by some manifold. And so, what I believe, I still can't prove, but what I believe is that there should be some nice smooth manifold. Smooth manifold, let's say without boundary. It probably helps. Well, maybe it would be easier to prove this conjecture with a boundary, but okay, so there is some smooth manifold with or without boundary of some high dimension and some smooth initial smooth solution to Euler equations, which actually blows up at a finite time. So blow-up for R3 might be too difficult, but I think blow-up for some manifold, especially if your dimension is high enough, I believe this is actually achievable. This is actually achievable. And somehow, the idea is that you get to pick your manifold. In particular, you're going to pick the metric G. And so the hope is to somehow use this metric to somehow hardwire to program certain behavior for your solution. In particular, I want to program the type of behavior where the solution stays still for a while and then contracts to a smaller version of itself. To a smaller version of itself, and then it stays still for a while, and so forth. And I see no way how to do this for a flat manifold, but maybe if you pick your metric cleverly enough, and you create enough sort of bottlenecks and funny geometry in your manifold, you can actually enforce this behavior. And so, the philosophy here is that once you allow the freedom to set the metric, these equations become very These equations become very general. They should become in some sense universal, that they should model pretty much any other dynamics that you care about. So we're already familiar with the idea that the Euler equations can model other dynamics. For example, if you take 3D Euler and you assume axisymmetry, you can model a two-dimensional equation, which is like a Brucines type equation. You can model it in terms of 3D Euler. In terms of 3D Euler. So, you know, by using various change of variables, you can model other equations using the Euler equation. But it's a very limited number of things of ways you can do this because there's only a limited number of symmetries that the Euclidean geometry has. But it allows you to choose your metric, G, you have many more symmetries, many more potential symmetries, and you could potentially model many other dynamics within Euler. Dynamics within Euler. And the idea is: hopefully, you can model something that actually blows up, or at least has enough sort of Turing completeness in it that you can program this type of behavior where a solution is contracting to a smaller version of itself. Okay, so there is some progress. So, we can't get blow-up yet for all the equations, but we can actually at least, there's lots of evidence now that there is this universality. So, there's been a lot of work recently on. Recently, on showing various types of universal behavior of Euler equations of manifolds. So, for example, a few years ago, what I showed is that if you take any quadratic ODE, so if you take the equation dtu equals some bilinear form of u, but in some finite dimensional vector space. Okay, so if you take a finite dimensional ODE, but your bilinear form has to obey this conservation law, that always has to be orthogonal to u. So this is an equation that doesn't blow up because it's going to preserve. Equation that doesn't blow up because it's going to preserve energy. The magnitude of u is always going to be preserved. The spheres around the origin are invariant under this flow. But anyway, any such ODE can be linearly embedded into an Euler flow. So for any such ODE, there is a manifold, and there is some way to embed this vector space into smooth, actually, it should be smooth vector fields on this manifold, not smooth scalar functions. Such that solutions to its ODE will get mapped to solutions to Euler equations. So if you like, maybe I'll draw a little picture. Okay, so the Euler equations you can think of as a, so this is infinite-dimensional space of smooth vector fields. And the Euler equation is just some infinite dimensional flow on the space. And then we also have this tiny flow on this little vector space. On this little vector space, we have this little ODE. And what I'm saying is that this ODE actually embeds into, so this V gets embedded into an invariant subspace of the Euler flow. And if you restrict the Euler flow to the subspace, you get an isomorphic copy of this flow here. So you can embed this tiny little ODE into this big PDE, much like you can embed a two-dimensional PDE into three-dimensional Euler by doing the axisymmetric reduction. Okay. Symmetric reduction. Okay, so the all equations contain these quadratic ODEs, and B is arbitrary except for this cancellation condition. Okay, now if okay, so if I could find a solution to this ODE that blew up in finite time, that would imply that I would get a solution to Euler that blew up in finite time. But unfortunately, as I said, because of this conservation law, all these ODEs, they don't actually blow up. Don't actually blow up. So this does not by itself, this result does not actually create any blow-up. It does show that, so in my artificial example of Navi-Sooks blow-up, I had this really complicated system of ODEs that exhibited this discretely self-almost discretely self-similar blow-up. What this construction shows is that if I take any finite segment, If I take any finite segment of that dynamics, like if I take, say, 10 different scales and I just truncate the ODE, I can get a dynamics which starts at the biggest scale and it contracts 10 scales down to create a solution which is at a much higher frequency. That portion of the dynamics I can embed into an Euler equation. But unfortunately, the dimension of the manifold that I embed into depends on the number of steps. So I don't have a single manifold. So, I don't have a single manifold which can encode the entire global dynamics, but any finite portion of the dynamics can be described by some Euler flow, which is not a particularly strong result, but it is a little bit of evidence towards universality. I won't say much about the proof of this construction. It's an explicit construction, and I use a very symmetric manifold. It's the product of a Lie group and a torus, but there's a lot of dependent geometry calculation. Okay. Okay, another universal result is the following: that if you take a flow on the torus, okay, so if I take a torus and I take some vector field from the torus, then I can, there's a large set of flows. There's a somewhere dense set of flows in the smooth topology. So there's a lot of flows which are what are called Eulerizable, or at least lifted, which can be lifted to an Eulerizable flow. Which can be lifted to an oilizable flow, that you can lift this torus to a bigger torus, actually, and you can lift this flow to effective fuel on a bigger torus, which in such a way that this flow is actually the Euler is equivalent to can be embedded into it's isomorphic to To the Euler flow on some manifold. It can be embedded in just the same way that the ODEs from these quadratic ODEs can be embedded. So in fact, any ODE on a torus can be embedded into some Euler flow as long as you perturb it and you have to lift it. You have to add some dummied dimensions. Much like if you take a two-dimensional axisymmetric Euler, you can lift it back to a 3D. 3D Euler flow by sort of adding this additional angular variable. So with this cheetah perturbation and adding some dimensions, pretty much any flow can be encoded somewhere within the some oil flow. All right, so maybe I will skip the proof of that. There's also been some work on stationary oil flow. So instead of looking at time-dependent, Oil flow. So instead of looking at time-dependent dynamics, you can look at the code of the city of the city. They can model pretty much any other flow, but with one condition. So, what these authors showed is that if you take any compact manifold and you take any flow, which is what's called geodesic, which means that there is some metric he can put on this manifold so that this flow is actually geodesic flow. So, there is some flow on this manifold such that, so any geodesic flow can be embedded. Any geodesbook flow can be embedded as an invariant sub-manifold of an orderizable flow. So there'll be some orderizable flow on a bigger manifold and some sub-manifold here which is isomorphic to n, such that if you restrict this or the revisible flow to the sub-manifold, you get back your original flow. So basically any vector, any flow can be, which is which obeys this geodisability constraint can be modeled by Can be modeled by a stationary oil flow. So, in fact, what they do is that they construct a special type of stationary flow called a Bautrami flow. These are eigenfunctions of the curl. And then they use actually techniques from contact geometry. There's actually a correspondence between Bautrami flows and something called a revector field. And then there are ways to construct revector fields. Ways to construct revector fields that do certain things, and so they use this machinery from contact geometry. One consequence of this is actually that, as a corollary, you can find a stationary flow on some manifold, which is quite complicated, that there exists a stationary Euler flow on some manifold, which is a universal Turing machine. So, what that means is that there is some, there are two regions here, which one is maybe called HOLT and not HOLT. Halt and not hold. And if you have any Turing machine and you want to know whether the Turing machine holds or not, every Turing machine corresponds actually to a point on this manifold. And if you flow, if you then follow the flow along this manifold, it will either hit eventually the halt or the not halt region. And sorry, there is no not halt. It will either hit the halting region. It will either hit the holding region or it will continue on forever. And it will hit the holding region if and only if the Turing machine actually holds infinite time. So you can actually encode any Turing machine into a single Botrami flow. And in particular, actually, there are initial conditions where the halting problem is undecidable, where you cannot actually prove or disprove whether the flow ever reaches this halting region or not. So this is just evidence that stationary oil flows can be extremely complicated. Extremely complicated. This isn't exactly what we need to create a funtime blow-up because these are stationary flows, but it is another type of universality. Okay, this was first done in higher dimensions. Recently, they were able to construct the same construction in three dimensions. There's also a topological universality result that That, yeah, okay. So, it was shown recently also that on any all-dimensional manifold, any vector field might not be Eulerizable, it might not be a stationary Euler flow, but it's always at least homotopic to an oralizable flow. So, in every homotopy class of vector fields, which you assume are non-vanishing, every homotopy class contains an orderizable flow. So, for example, there are homotopy classes of vector fields where every flow is chaotic in the sense that there are Chaotic in the sense that there are invariant sets of positive entropy. And so this shows, for example, there are those world flows which are chaotic. Okay. Now, so those are for stationary flows. If you go back to time-dependent flows, there was a nice result just proven this year that basically says that almost every flow can be perturbed into an Euler flow. So, okay, so the picture is again if you have. Okay, so the picture is again: if you have any compact manifold, n, and any vector field x, then you can perturb x by an epsilon. There's an epsilon perturbation of x in the smooth topology. So if you perturb any vector field, there's a perturbation of this vector field which embeds into the Euler flow of a manifold. So we take any manifold, M, you look at the Euler flow, which is an infinite flow. Euler flow is some infinite dimensional flow on this on this big space here. But every finite dimensional dynamics can be embedded into an Euler flow, but the caveat is that you have to perturb the dynamics by an epsilon. But what this means is that any But what this means is that any dynamical feature which is stable under perturbations can actually occur in an Euler flow. There are Euler dynamics that work with that behavior. So for example, you can construct vector fields on a manifold, which are chaotic in the sense that you have positive entropy and you have these things called homoclinic transverse intersections and horseshoes. You have these things like Lorentz butterflies and so forth. And so you can create You can create chaotic flows which are stable under small perturbations, and hence, by this theorem, there must exist Euler flows that are also similarly chaotic. So, you can exhibit a lot of behavior in the dynamics of an Euler equation on an arbitrary manifold. Yeah, so the way they prove this actually is that. The way they prove this actually is that they use a version of the Stone-Weierfrast theorem. They can approximate any flow by one of these quadratic flows that I mentioned earlier. And we have already known how to embed quadratic flows into Euler equations. So this is how they prove this theorem. Okay. And then finally, this was about two months ago. This group of authors, Cardinala Miranda, and Protasalas, they were able to show that there are dynamics of Euler equations that are true incomplete. So there is some manifold of high dimension, and inside the space of divergent vector fields, there is some halting region. And if you want to ask whether a Turing machine halts or not, every Turing machine corresponds to some initial condition of this Euler flow. Condition of this Euler flow. And if you flow this equations, this flow will enter this halting region of phase space if and only if the Turing machine halts. So basically what this says is that the Euler dynamics on a sufficiently high-dimensional manifold are as complicated as a Turing machine. They're like a giant computer. You can actually program. Computer, you can actually program, you know, you could have a machine that enumerates primes or tries to see whether ZFC is consistent or whatever. So it is possible to encode a Turing machine into the Euler dynamics. And yeah, they proceed by first encoding a Turing machine as a vector field on a sphere, and then they embed this vector field on the sphere into an Euler flow using some of these previous. Flow using some of these previous embedding theorems. As a consequence, by the way, they actually disproved a conjecture about decidability. It was conjectured that actually analytic flows on a compact manifold were always decidable. They can't be too incomplete, but actually they can be. That the dynamics can actually get undecidable, for instance. Okay, so we now have the ability to do computations on a high-dimensional manifolds. On a high-dimensional manifolds. So, I can, in principle, I can now create initial data which I can program to do anything that a computer can do. So, maybe I can create a self-replicating sort of initial data, which starts with some initial condition and replicates to some smaller version of itself. Now, I would like to iterate this and then get final time blow-up, but there's unfortunately one giant obstacle remaining. Remaining. So, in order to iterate, so once you have a solution that evolves to a smaller version of itself, and you have to iterate, you want to use the scaling symmetry of your Euler equations to iterate this and get some sort of self-similar blow-up. But the problem is that because we've cheated by working with manifolds, we no longer have scaling symmetry. Most manifolds do not have a scaling symmetry. Forwards do not have a scaling symmetry. And so, unfortunately, now, even though we do have ways to sort of execute one step or 10 steps, so any finite number of steps of this self-similar Ansatz, we still can't get an infinite sequence of these discrete self-similar dynamics. So, we can't get a solution that contracts all the way down to a point because we've lost the scale. Because we've lost the scale invariance. So I'm still trying to see if there's some loophole around this. I'm experimenting with warp products of... So what I'm hoping is that if you take some sort of product of Euclidean space and these manifolds, and so you have some partial scaling symmetry, maybe you can still make things work. Hasn't quite worked yet, but I'm still working on it. But anyway, this is the state of the art. We have been able to show some universality properties. We have been able to show some universality properties of these Euler flows on arbitrary manifolds, but not yet enough to actually get blow-up. But we've got some other interesting results along the way. Okay, so I will stop here. Thank you very much.
