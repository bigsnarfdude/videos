Go ahead. Hello. Thank you for that introduction. So, hello, my name is Marco Hammonds-Partlance. I'm a fifth-year PhD candidate at North Carolina State University in the biomathematics program, and I work with David Rasmussen on developing phylogenetic. Rasmussen on developing phylogenetic techniques. And so today I want to talk to you all about the continuous type birth death model that we're developing, an extension of the multi-type birth death model that we just heard Paul speak about. So you all are likely familiar with the multi-type death model. So here on the left, we have a phylogeny forward simulated with two types. And the goal is to perform inference and really quantify some of these. Really quantify some of these transmission rates within and between these types, as well as migration rates between and among them. And so how do we do that? Well, we solve these differential equations backwards in time along the phylogeny, all the way back to the root, get a likelihood, and perform whatever flavor of likelihood inference you want to do, maximum likelihood or some sort of MCMC approach. So this is the multi-type. So, this is the multi-type birth death model. Now, most of this is often applied to some sort of discrete state. So, we're mapping maybe to like location, gender of the host, or something along those lines. However, our question was, what if instead we want to look at a continuous trait of interest? So, what if the continuous trait is set point viral load or distance from consensus sequence, something along those lines, something that's continuous in nature? Something along those lines, something that's continuous in nature. And so, what if we have a phylogeny where we actually can map sequences to one of these continuous traits? And so, our goal was to really be able to quantify the selection pressures at the within-host scale and the between-host scale on this continuous trait of interest. And so, we're able to derive a system of partial differential equations that we can solve backwards in time along the branches all the way back to the root and once again perform whatever flavor of. Again, perform whatever flavor of inference scheme you would like to use. And so we're going to use MCMC. And as you'll see on the bottom here, we're actually splitting this up into kind of we have this lambda parameter, and we, which is that transmission rates, and we have these transition rates or migration rates. So at the within host scale, we're able to kind of really split up this into a multi-scale scheme where A scheme where at the within-host scale we're able to have diffusion and selection driving our evolution of our continuous trait. And so we're trying to really quantify the amount of diffusivity or selection that is occurring at the within-host scale. And then at the between-host scale, we really want to quantify some sort of fitness function that is going to be mapping our continuous state to some sort of transmissibility. And so our goal is to try to. And so, our goal is to try to really estimate this arbitrary function f of x that's going to map us in that way. And so, here is an example of how that would be done. So, this is a forward simulation where we have sampled individuals of some continuous trait in some frequency. And this was a forward simulated with some arbitrary function. This is a linear function in the dashed red line. And what we see is that we're able to actually estimate. What we see is that we're able to actually estimate this fitness effect where we have data approximately well, and then we're able to obtain our prior estimates in regions where we do not have any data, say between 0 and 0.2 and 0.8 and 1. And so this is kind of like the general scheme that we are implementing to try to quantify the selection pressures at multiple scales using this continuous type growth death model. And I would love to hear any and all thoughts or questions about this model. Or questions about this model. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you, Marco. And again, any quick questions? Otherwise, we can just... Okay, there's a quick question from Art who says, how does your model relate to Burrido, Sultani, and Stadler? So that it's, I believe it's related in the way that we just derived this. Just derived this partial differential equations, taking the types to infinity and kind of making some assumptions about these transmission matrices and migration matrices. And we were able to kind of derive this PDE. Excellent. Thank you.
