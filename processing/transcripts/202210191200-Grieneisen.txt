So yeah, let me see now. Okay, so I just wanted to say that I'm extremely happy to be at this conference and I was extremely inspired by all the discussions we had in the meeting, but also over the lovely lunches. And because of that, I completely altered my talk from what I had intended to give, which was about nutrient transport. Intended to give it was about nutrient transport boron in Sowell. So, excuse me for that. So, this is more of my personal journey through multi-scale modeling. And learning from you guys, I introduced some things and tried some things out. So, it's very experimental talk. I hope. Well, we'll see how far we get. So, this is a picture that actually I think I saw this painting in Norwich, in fact. She's a British Mexican painter. So, here we have these beautiful shaped, heart-shaped leaves, but also we have a true heart. But also, we have a true heart. So, he mixes a bit the plant and animal world, and this is what my talk is. So, bear with me, I'm going to start about some models on animal morphogenesis, and I want to really think about how we can evolve them to plant morphogenesis, because I think there are more micro-scale phenomena happening in the plants that we can overlook as we could on the animal scale. So, my whole life in biology started looking at hydra. So, I made these aggregates and after. Hydra. So I made these aggregates, and after some time they turn into these animals. So this is a really powerful morphogenetic event. Part of it you can explain the surface tension, so things round up. You know, these cell types, they segregate like fluids, etc. But we can't really look at this in a continuum perspective as one would like to, because in the end of the day, inside there's a granularity and there are these cells which are moving around. So this is another thing I just wanted to address, depending on what you're looking at. It's cool to do continuous, it could be possible. It's cool to do continuous. It could be possible to do cell modeling, but it's really, really important to ask the question: what phenomena and what scale are you looking at? Okay, so the building units of my talk will be the cell, right? This is my choice, and this is because of the type of problems I'm looking at. To understand things like the hydra or how these animal cells can self-organize and form these structures of engulfment, someone proposed Steinberg in 1963 that it all has to do with the affinities between the cells. Affinities between the cells, the local adhesions, right? So there's nothing global telling them to go into the middle going out. And that could be actually physically measured, so surface tension of whole aggregates. So this is a line tension. And indeed, behold, you get the highest surface tension will always end up in the middle and the tissue with the lowest will engross. And this is hierarchical. So you can actually bring organs together, embryonic organs that never had, you know, never evolved or see each other, but you could predict the outcome of this phenomenon. Um, of this phenomenon. So, um, modeling that was very difficult because people were using CAs and they were using different types of modeling techniques, which didn't allow you to have a cell shape. So, it was actually Fran√ßois Gernet, which teamed up with James Grainer. Glacier, no, James Glacier. So, they seemingly met up in Japan, and what they started to think about is: well, maybe we can. To think about is well, maybe we can simulate this using the Potts model. They call it the cellular PUTS model. So, the cellular POTS model is something which anyone here which is working with plant mechanics, which uses vertex model, is using the same mechanics. Because basically, what we're saying here, we have an energy term, which is in the case like an adhesion proportional to the perimeter. So, this is the interaction energy. Then we have the Lagrange multiplier. So, we have some type of constraint. Glad to Grenade, they just said it was an eric. Later Grenade, they just said it was an area constraint, so you would have a pressure in your cell. Think about turbo pressure if you're thinking about plant cells. And then there's this other term you can include if you want to, which is the cortical tension. Basically means that a cell has a desired perimeter. There's something else which is encasing it either from outside or from within. Okay, so this is this energy function. So the only things which are changing will be the perimeter, the area, and these are the parameters that you give to the model. So the solar pucks model works through Monte Carlo minimization. Works through multicardinal minimization. So basically, we have these little wobbling effects at the pixels of the edge. And if there is a decrease in energy, it's going to be accepted. And if it goes up, you have a Boltzmann distribution probability of accepting. So people sometimes they say, hey, I don't really think this is realistic because there's all this crazy ruffling and there are these pixels here. But actually, you have to put on your statistical glasses and average a bit these fluctuations. And what you're going to see is that if you are above a certain temperature in your simulation, there's absolutely no endosotropy happening. There's absolutely no anisotropy happening, and you're going to get perfectly measured angles as you would expect if this were just like a surface mechanics happening in a continuous setting. Okay, so this is nothing special. These cells are not polar, they are just adhering, and they make these beautiful, you know, what you get as an emergent property, so to say, would be these beautiful shapes, right? Which you expect. So we can go so far as going back to these experiments and we have a grasp, we understand how we can take these. Grasp, we understand how we can take these values, surface tension, which is for tissue, gummets, and how we can translate them back into those J coupling energies. And so, what we can do is that we can just put all of those cells together. And this is experimentally not so amenable. But what you can see is you'll have the same hierarchy happening here. So, you'll have those tissues with the highest surface tensions in the middle, then the less ones engulfing, and so forth. So, you can get, if you wait long enough, you'll get a very nice cell sorting process. Now, someone here will say, Process. Now, some of you will say, well, this is a multi-carbon simulation. You cannot say that the dynamics that we observe here is the true dynamics of what happens experimentally. And no, there's no theory that can back this up. However, if you look at the rate at which these aggregates and simulations come together, it is logarithmically very similar to what we see in the simulation. So this is something which, yeah, I don't know how to explain, but we are using these simulations not just for steady-state configurations, but we're actually using them for the dynamics. Okay, so shoot me here. Dynamics. Okay, so shoot me here. Just one thing I want to point out: nothing would happen without temperature, right? So a simulation, exactly the same parameters with temperature zero. You just grow and then you get trapped in a local minima. So temperature is really your friend here for being able to panic. So nowadays we're using these things for like modeling organoids. And the reason I'm just showing you this is because this is what I consider multi-level. So we put things like salvages, diffusion of nutrients, mitosis, and death. And just changing a little bit these parameters, you can get like a whole Changing a little bit these parameters, you can get like a whole set of different types of outputs. But okay, we're here to look at plants, right? And so we want to look at these shapes, for example, of leaves. But we are interested also because we know that the polarity here of the pavement cells, the rocks, the oxen, everything is working together to possibly make, you know, this leaf into a hard shape. So how do we start evolving our models to become more interesting? So some questions I have in between that is, so how do you bridge between models to actual tissue? To actual tissue. How can we go from experiment back to the model? How can we compare different model formalisms also? So it's not that I'm advocating that one should use CPM, it's not the case, but I would at least like to know how I translate my parameters to someone else who's using a different model, right? And how can we now use imaging also to maybe help infer better parameters for these mechanistic models? So the first step that we did with this, I'm sorry about this, so this is just your energy equation, was to Energy equation was to start doing some analysis, right? We could then analytically calculate. So we have lots of parameters here, but actually you can aggregate them up in two parameters only. And that describes all the type of behavior that you could get, right? So people can complain a lot about using a negative this or that, but it doesn't really matter. So there are two parameters here, which for an isolated cell in 2D will explain you if you're going to be wobbly, if you're going to be circular, and there's a bi-stability here that you might collapse to zero if you're. That you might collapse to zero if you're smaller than a critical size, or you totally collapse to zero. Okay, we can do this analysis for one cell in isolation or for one cell in 3D in isolation, but we can also do this analysis assuming that the cell is hexagonal, right? So that would be like a tissue packing configuration. We also have these two parameters, so this would be our bifurcation. And what we see here is that it fits with a model which was. It fits with a model which was simulated within Vla Hardifeier's lab where he used a vertex model to get these lines. And actually, he missed one line which we were able to analytically show. But our CPM simulations are exactly on top of his vertex model simulations, because now that we understand how our models work, we can make a beautiful mapping between these things. Okay, so at least within the modeling world, we can start talking the same language, right? But now let's go to the real stuff with experiments. So before we go. Stuff with experiments. So, before we go to the biology, let's look at soap and water. So, I will say now that I'm extremely fascinated by the work in faux physics, what Swagner has been doing, for example. So, he talked about this thing called the texture tensor, and I think it's super important to the community here, experimental plant biology. So, basically, you don't just look at the shape of the cell, but you look at also at its distances from its neighbors. So, if some type of strain is applied on If some type of strain is applied on the tissue, or the tissue grows in a certain way, you're going to get this ellipse will be distorted in that direction. Okay, so it captures both shape and the texture, the neighborhood. The nice thing about this, you don't only have to do it between like neighboring cells, but you can do it over a region of the tissue. So you can get different core scrainings here. This experiment, again, foam, this basically, these are bubbles which are being, they're moved over a surface around an obstruction. A surface around an obstruction. Okay, so you have these, you can see that you can get these fields. Other really important measurements would be the velocity that you're having, either in a tissue or in a foam, and the shape change, right? Now, there is this one thing we talked about yesterday. This is a T1, so this is a neighborhood swapping. We can forget about that as plant biologists. This will never happen. Maybe just on lateral roots, you will have the neighborhood swapping, but you won't get that. But what you would be able to get is you might get a cell. You might get a cell shrinking to zero at poptosis, or a cell going underneath the plane, and you would get cell division. So, those are topological transitions, which will be calculated and will be shown as tensors. Now, why is this so nice? If you're doing an imaging over time and you miss some of the divisions, you can calculate them back because these things have to sum up. So, you will know, oh, there was so much division happening in this direction. Okay, so you can keep your bookkeeping. Okay, so you can keep your bookkeeping in a very nice way. So, this is like my OSHA model. So, this is what I did after discussing with you guys. I thought, okay, so what's the problem with CPM here? So, what I'm doing here is I'm putting, I'm stretching and I'm pulling on these cells in the middle, okay? But because these cells are able to rearrange, we don't see any strain. So, this is the texture tensor in these different regions of the tissue, okay? So, what you can do now, you can make the CTM. Can do now, you can make the CPM and you can say, I prohibit T1s from happening. Each time that these cells would want to change neighborhoods, it's not allowed. Okay, so in this case, we have a plant-like tissue, so all the neighborhoods are always being preserved. We squish it and now we pull it, right? And we can see that we can now measure this difference in the texture tensor for this region. I went to absurd forces here, right? Just to see how it goes. But the nice thing with this is now we can get from moving tissue or from plant-like tissue, which doesn't have the T1. Or for plant-like tissue, which doesn't have the T1, we can actually plot things and get things like the young modulus and for souls ratio. Now, how exactly I interpret this, I would like to discuss with you guys, but I checked it. It should be pretty okay. So, in the last moments, I now want to go a little bit more into the biology. So, these cells, our units, they're not apolar. And I really strongly believe that it's actually quite incorrect to think about organization, thinking about cells being Thinking about cells being isotropic. Because they have intrinsic tendency to polarize. I'm not going to go through this whole story, but this is both in animals and plants. So we'll have regions where you will have a high, for example, GDPAs and regions where you have these low GDPAs. So some time ago, together with Rico in Urich and Katie Ably, we proposed actually a simplification of all these many, many models which are out there of biochemical reactions of small G proteins, which Of small G proteins, which basically boils it down to something saying, well, if you have at least two forms, an A and a B, you have an active in the membrane and an inactive, which is cytosolic, you have some type of antiballistic interaction between them, you would be able to polarize a cell spontaneously. Okay, so this work, we are working a lot with it. The last few years I've been in part in with Fahad, who is now in Omar, and Alan Shafni's. So we're looking at Katie Abney's model, some other models of the fruit, Al Pavement side. Models of the fruit pavement cell polarity models, and we're actually looking at PDE analysis. So now we can see not only for very different diffusion, but for any type of diffusion differences, where you can get your states which allow for polarity, right? So, and the states where you don't get polarity. I would really love to discuss this a little bit more with you. But what's really interesting here is that we don't only see a back and front polarity arising in these PDVs. We can get very different polarities. We can get multi- Polarities, we can get multi-polar polarities, which is actually quite nice for plants because we do need sometimes different polarities happening. In fact, the same set of biochemical equations which describe a polarity in the cell could give you, for example, this cherry instabilities. It could also give you wave pitting, which is like a front and a back. And it can give you this other thing which I found was super cool, homoclinic snaking, which basically will have patches of activity and inside micro patches. Okay, so these are all things that can come from exactly the same. Can come from exactly the same set of small GPAs, but just changing a little bit on either diffusion, some of the kinetic parameters, or even just the total amounts. So, transcription could do the job to bring you from these different things. So, for the pavement cell, for example, we can show that ROP2 and ROP6, they can interact in a way that throughout Turing stability will give you different types of emergences of points. But the very important thing I want to get to towards my end is that shape is super important. Is that shape is super important? It interacts directly back into these intracellular patterns. And that's because things don't just leak out of a cell, at least not in small G proteins. So we have a no-flex boundary condition, and that will interact with the type of patterns you'll get in the cell. So the same set of equations here on a pavement cell shape or in a round shape will, if you let it run long enough, give you totally different outcomes. So here you're going to trap your ROP2 to the tips where here, so now we're just forwarding time, you're going to get one point. Just forwarding time, you're going to get one front and one back. Okay. So, now, what does this mean? Well, we know that these 1G proteins are probably doing things which downstream will do things with the cell wall, with the excretion of expansions, whatnot. I don't know how that works. But what I can say is once you have the shape, the shape is also going to have an impact on your intracellular habitat. So, cells can break symmetry. This can be triggerable or spontaneous. Can be triggerable or spontaneous. Triggerable means sometimes you have to give some activation. It seems to be something quite generic in living systems. And my last two things now is, I can't believe I haven't been taken off stage yet, is the Orchaka hypothesis. So now we had this discussion before that, look, you know, stress is being sensed and that's redirecting pins and so forth. So this is more like a Keduncan experiment. I'm not saying that this is true, but I'm saying, okay, guys, let's. True, but I'm saying, okay, guys, let's say now we're going to have some cells. Every cell will have the PDE running in it of the small G protein, so they will spontaneously break symmetry, but there's no interaction between them. So they're invisible to one another. They don't interact. And I will, in the center here, I will apply a force and start distorting them. So that's the only type of thing that will happen. Okay. So the problem with the simulation is because every cell has a PDE running in it, it took like a long time while we were having dinner. A long time while we were having dinner. So, what you will see here is we start getting a small distortion here ready with our texture tensor. So, I'm compressing these cells and well, what you can statistically see is that these cells, they start orientating themselves more towards their own axis. So, we start getting some type of alignment. The problem is the alignment we get can be flipped, it can be up or down. So, there's no way for them to coordinate. And so, the last thing, so, luckily enough, right? So, luckily enough, right in 2013 with Rico and Adam, we also had proposed that there is a way for cells to communicate, and that's through the cell wall. So, cell wall is super important here because these small GTPAs, if they were to excrete, for example, oxen, and oxygen is sent by both sides, there will be in this model a tendency for cells to avoid pointing to the same site. So, here what we have now is a different scenario. So, I take a confoco actually image of a In focal image of tissue which is already stretched, there is no oxygen sink or oxygen source or anything, right? So oxygen is being produced everywhere. There's only shape. And what will happen in this case, yeah, this is the last slide, is that what you will see in this simulation is that this green thing is thin, right? So this is Sao wall in between. It starts orientating upwards. It could have gone downwards, but it is finding the axiality of. Finally, the axiality of its own shape, and because of the interaction through the subwall, it is able to align itself. Okay, so now you can imagine that this type of structure could happen if there was a growing strain or stress on your system, and you would have that alignment with that axiality. So, those are my conclusions. Tissue polarity can be a result of simple geometry. It can also be directed for local, non-local signals for oxidants. Local, non-local signals, for oxygen transport. So, transport is very important for this. And I would just say that, at least with the building blocks and information that we have, I don't think it's yet necessary in this case to evoke the need to send stress to be able to get coordination because you can get coordination with the things you know it is. So that was it. So thank you very much. And this is my university and Hardiff. And it'd be very nice to welcome you guys to our talk. Thank you, Veronica. We have time for. Thank you, Veronica. We have time for one question. Let me go to the pyramids. So, go ahead. Maybe you want was a very nice spot. Thank you very much, Derek. Is this system giving us information about the way we interpret the pins, for instance, in the merry state? Because you say that. Because you say that the polarity could come from the change of shape or from the particular shape that some region would have. How could this be translated to the sun? Yeah, so the polarity, the nice thing here is that it can pick up also, like what Miotis was saying, if you have a production of oxygen somewhere, it's also going to point towards it or point away, right? So you can also organize it through, you know. It through genetic centers of activity. I'm just sort of like bringing you to the. So I think in a Meristem, it's probably not going to be just shape, because shape is also something very tenuous, right, to pick up. But it is something that already shape could pick up. And then the interaction with the neighbors is very strong. They really want to repel each other. So they will really try to align. So if the only thing here in the simulation that they could pick up was the axiality of their shape, this is what they're going to align to. Shape, this is what they're going to align to. I can very well imagine that if you gave some type of gradient to the side, they might even be able to turn them, right? But the important thing is that there is this, like you should look at cells almost like magnets, right? They have a little spin in them. And the question is just if very little interaction, they will try to align in certain ways. So I'm not sure. I'm not sure what's... I'm not saying that this is what's happening in the marist. I'm just opening a different avenue of thinking that. You are thinking that it's very difficult to decouple the force on something and the resultant shape. And everything we're seeing here is that shape by itself has such an important impact on the internal polarity that, you know, that should also be looked at as a potential morphogenetic guidance. All right. Unfortunately, that's the only time for questions we have. That's the only time for questions we have. So, thank you very much.
