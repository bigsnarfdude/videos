Okay, thank you. So I would like to thank organizers for inviting me to this conference. And I want to say that I was trying to be as close to complex fluids as possible, but the result is that I will speak about the decay of solutions to integral differential equations. So I will speak about this equation. The unknown function u is from r plus times omega. Omega is bounded domain in Rn. We consider this Laplace operator here with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. And yes, so if f is zero. if if f is zero k is zero and g is zero then then we have a wave equation the wave equation here which produces some some oscillations so some some periodic solutions if f the non-linearity f here is non-zero there are still some oscillations and it turns out that this integral term here term here has a damping effect on this on this equation, on the solutions. And the aim of this talk is to study the strength of this damping somehow to estimate the speed of convergence to equilibrium for this equation. And of course, we will assume that this right-hand side somehow tends to side somehow tends to zero also. Yeah, and moreover we assume that the integral of k is less than one which means somehow that this integral term is dominated by this this Laplacian here. So I will first I will say what are the results. So in the in the results So, in the results, there will be a coefficient theta. So, I want to say now that it is a Loeshevich exponent, and I will come back to this later. So, now just to say what is the meaning of theta. So, there is a result by Hassan Yassin from 2017, which says that if the kernel That if the kernel k decays exponentially, then we have exponential decay of solutions if theta is one half and if g decays exponentially. So, to obtain exponential decay of solutions, we need exponential decay of the kernel of the right-hand side, and we need that theta is one-half of. Theta is one half. For example, if f is zero, then this is the case. Somehow, this is the best possible case. And the second result is that if theta is less than one half and g decays polynomially, then we still have polynomial decay of solutions to an equilibrium. And we have an explicit. And we have an explicit, well, yeah, explicit estimates on the decay. So this exponent ψ here somehow depends in this way, it depends on theta, on the Leushevich exponent, and on A, which represents the decay of the right-hand side function. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so this is one more result to this. So if the first one was if K decays exponentially, this next result says what happens if the convolution can here decays polynomially. And in this case, we still have polynomial decay of solutions. Of solutions. And yeah, again, we have an explicit estimate for the exponent here. And we can see that this estimate is the same as before, but here is this new number here, which somehow corresponds to the decay of the kernel. Excuse me, I have a question, please. Excuse me, I have a question, please. Yes. I mean, this result is regardless of the structure of the non-linearity F, what if this blow out? I will come to death. Okay. Because you state the results without any conditions on F. But so, anyways, continue, please. Yeah. Because maybe the equation even blows up, you don't have to global existence, maybe. Okay, so these are the results. Okay, so these are the results, and now I will speak, I will be more precise about the assumptions and the situation in which we are. But in general, we assume that we have a global solution and we study whether this particular solution converges to an equilibrium. Okay? So, uh So, yeah, so this is again our equation. If we want to say something about the decay of solution, and yeah, I say once more, so we assume that we have a global solution, okay? So, if we want to say something about decay of this solution, we usually need or we usually do it. Or we usually do it by finding a Lyapunov functional H, which satisfies not only that the derivative, this derivative is positive or negative, but we need that it satisfies an estimate of this kind, okay? From this, we can obtain some estimates on decay of age and then. H and then consequently on U. And if we want to have this H on the right-hand side of the inequality, it is often of use the Leirsvich inequality, which I am going to define here. Okay, so usually this usually I mean if there is no integer. Usually, I mean, if there is no integral term here, but there is another dumping, for example, in the form of c times ut or something like that, then we can look at these two terms here and write them as the derivative of a potential E, where the potential E is defined as one half of the L2 norm of the gradient squared plus integer. plus integral over omega from capital F, where capital F is primitive function to our non-linearity f and if this potential E satisfies the Loeweshevich inequality which is this inequality here then it helps us to obtain such an estimate for a Lyapunov functional so So, what is the Luyashevich inequality? It means that it is a gradient inequality, it is an inequality between the distance of Eu and E phi and derivative of E. And we want that there exists a theta in this interval and positive constants, c and epsilon, such that Such that this distance to the power of one minus theta is estimated by the gradient of derivative of e, and this should hold for all u in a small neighborhood of some phi. Phi is usually an equilibrium, otherwise, it is somehow triple. Okay, so usually we want this potential to satisfy the Loyashevich inequality. In our case, with the integral term here, we want that this modified potential Eμ satisfies the Loyashevich inequality. Okay? The difference is that Is that there is 1 minus mu over 2 here, where μ is the integral of k. So somehow we incorporate this integral term into our potential. Yeah, and if this potential satisfies the Roosevich inequality, then we can obtain such an estimate for quite a complicated Lyapunov functional. Lyapunov functional. So, what are our assumptions? So, we assume that the non-linearity f is a C2 function which is analytic in the second variable and which satisfies some estimates on derivative with respect to u. Derivative with respect to u, some polynomial estimate of this kind, where alpha is less than 2 over n minus 2, where n, this capital N, is the dimension of omega. And in fact, these first three assumptions here imply that the potential Eμ satisfies the Laura-Shevich inequality. And moreover, And moreover, we assume that we have a global solution such that Ut is bounded in H10 times L2. And we assume that the set Ut T greater or equal to 0 is relatively compact in H01. So, in fact, this last assumption implies that the omega limit set. That the omega limit set is non-empty. And from this, we can get that, in fact, the whole solution has a single limit point and obtain some convergence, some estimates of speed of the convergence. Yeah, okay. We can, in fact, we can re-write. We can, in fact, we can rewrite this equation in an abstract way. So it is not. Yeah, the important thing is the Laura Schoich inequality there. So it is not important that we have the Dirichlet Laplacian with the non-linearity F here. We can replace this by any other derivative of by the derivative of any other potential somehow and also. And also, here the Laplacian can be replaced by a linear operator. And yeah, it is enough to assume that this potential is of class C2 from a Hilbert space V to R, that this operator A is linear, self-adjoint, positive definite, satisfying this inclusion that this space V is subset of. Is subset of the domain of a to the power of one half. Of course, in this case, we do not need to assume that the integral of k is less than one, but we need it to be finite. And we need to assume that the potential defined by this satisfies the Loyashevich inequality. And again, the assumptions on boundedness or relative compactness of u. And under these general assumptions, one can get the same results. So exponential decay if g and k decay exponentially and theta equal to one half and polynomial decay in other cases. Yeah, so Okay, there is this assumption that some potential satisfies Leashevich inequality. So I will give you some examples of other potentials which satisfy the Leyasvich inequality. These results can be found in these two papers. So the first one, Ben Hassen and Arrow from twenty eleven, the second by Ralph Chill from two thousand three. From 2003. And so we can apply this also to Neumann-Laplacian with non-linearity F or Dirichlet or Neumann-Laplacian with non-analytic non-linearities. Or we can apply it to a fourth-order operator. This is Laplacian. operator this is laplacian squared this lambda one is the first eigenvalue of this operator here we can see that u plus u minus are positive part of u negative part of u so this is definitely not analytic function and also uh also the potential corresponding to this term satisfies the lawyership inequality. Schivich inequality. So these three examples can be found in the first paper. In the paper by Ralph Chilf, we can find such an example. Here A is a billinar form which is positive definite and M is any C2 function. And it can be also applied to equations looking like this appropriate. On with appropriate assumptions on the function A and C. And yeah, and in these papers, one can find explicit estimates on the Loyashevich exponent theta. So then we can get explicit results because we Explicit results because we know what is theta, we know the decay of g and k, and therefore we can estimate the decay of solutions. Okay, the last thing I want to say is, yeah, concerning these last two assumptions, so yeah, some Yeah, somehow, yeah, Hassan Yassin proved that in his case there exists global solutions and under some additional assumptions on F, these solutions satisfy the first equation, so they are bounded in this case. In many problems, where the damping is given not by the integral term but by some more friendly term, one can show that from boundedness there follows the relative compactness of the solutions. However, I do not know how to do it in this case. So now I cannot. Yeah, so so now I cannot, yeah, due to non-linearity, non-non-locality of this term, somehow the usual methods to prove relative compactness are not possible to apply. So, I don't know whether there is a large class of problems satisfying this last assumption. Assumption, so this is a topic for further research, I think. So, and yes, so Thomas, how much time do you still need? Because the time is almost over? Yes, yes, yes. That's all I wanted to say, in effect. So, thank you for your attention. I just want to give you a chance to finish. So, are you done? Yeah, that's all. Okay, well, thank you very much. Are there any questions? Are there any questions?
