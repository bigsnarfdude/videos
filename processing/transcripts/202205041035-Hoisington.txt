For the chance to be part of this workshop. So, several people have talked about the isoparametric inequality in the background of their talk. So, just to briefly recap, the classical version of the classical isoparametric inequality is the statement that in Euclidean space, among all the domains that have the same some given fixed perimeter, the ball is the unique domain with the largest volume enclosed. So, this is usually. So, this is usually expressed as an inequality between perimeter and volume. So, in the plane, it says that the length squared of the boundary of some region is greater than or equal to 4 pi times the area that encloses. There's the inequality in higher dimensional Euclidean space where, again, we formulate it in terms of the nth power of the perimeter and the n minus first power of the volume so that the two sides scale correctly scale the same way. Way. Are you? Did you start your slides already? And we just don't see it? Oh, I yes, I did. And apparently, I've paused my screen sharing and I don't know how to unpause it. Resume share. How about that? I'm trying to resume the share and it's not working. I'm sorry, give me a moment. Okay, are you guys seeing a slide about the isoparametric inequality in Euclidean space? And also in spaces of constant curvature, in spheres and hyperbolic spaces of constant curvature, the corresponding statement is true that the unique domain with the largest volume for some fixed perimeter is a geodesic ball. So, one of the ways that the isoparametric inequality can be generalized is to, in place of the boundary of a domain, allow a general closed hypersurface, not necessarily embedded, or in the plane, allow any closed curve, not necessarily a simple closed curve. And first of all, one of the oldest, and I think one of the best known proofs of the plane isoparametric inequality actually really naturally addresses this case. It really naturally addresses this case. So there's a proof of the isoparametric inequality in the plane based on Wierdinger's inequality for periodic functions, found by Hurwitz. What it really proves, what really follows from that proof, is that you have any closed curve in the plane, not necessarily a simple closed curve, then the length squared is greater than or equal to 4 pi times the sum of the areas of the bounded regions that. Regions that it encloses, but then each one multiplied by its winding number about the region. And so, if it's a simple closed curve and you orient it as the boundary of its bounded component of its complement, that's the isoparametric inequality. So, Radeau showed that you could take the absolute value of the winding numbers, and this inequality is still true. And the sharp, the optimal inequality for this situation was found by Banshoff and Pohl. So, what Banshoff and Pohl showed. So, what Banshoff and Pohl showed is that for any closed curve in the plane, the length squared is greater than or equal to 4π times the sum of the areas or the bounded regions that encloses, but then each one weighted by the square of the winding number. And equality holds precisely if m is a circle, possibly with some multiplicity. It'll be helpful for later reference just to note that we can also write this in a We can also write this inequality by saying that the length squared is greater than or equal to the integral over the plane of this locally constant function, the square of the winding number of our curve about a point. Questions or comments so far? So, Banshoff and Polserzel covers closed manifolds in Euclidean space in all dimensions and in all co-dimensions. So, what there is So, what their result says in general is that if we have a closed-oriented manifold immersed in Euclidean space, we'll let r be the extrinsic distance on the manifold. And we can consider the linking number of our manifold about affine-oriented affine planes that have one less than the complementary dimension to our submanifold. And then there's a measure, is a unique measure up to scaling on the space of all of these sub-manifolds. On the space of all of these such affine planes. And what Van Schoffen-Pohl showed in general is that the integral of the square of the linking number of our manifold about affine planes is bounded above by this integral over m cross m of one over the appropriate power of this extrinsic distance function. And equality holds precisely if our submanifold, the immersed submanifold, is actually. Submanifold is actually a round sphere in an affine space one dimension higher, and again possibly with multiplicity. So for hypersurfaces, the term that's bounded above in the Banshoff-Pole inequality and Banshoff and Pole's results, again, is the integral of the square of the winding number of our hypersurface points in the ambient space. So if our hypersurface is embedded, if it's the boundary of some domain, then this is the volume of the domain that it encloses. Is the volume of the domain that it encloses? And they mention in the introduction of their paper the upper bound and their inequality for surfaces in three-dimensional space, one over the extrinsic distance. We can think of that as like the gravitational self-potential of our surface. So, one of the biggest open questions related to the isoparametric inequality is whether it's true in complete, simply connected. In complete, simply connected Riemannian manifolds with non-positive sectional curvature. So I think that's what I originally did intend the title for my talk to be. But those spaces are called Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. This conjecture is sometimes called the Cartan-Hadamard conjecture. This is the conjecture that domains in n-dimensional Cartan-Hadamard manifolds satisfy the n-dimensional Euclidean isoparametric inequality. So right now, So, right now, the conjecture is known to be true in dimensions two, three, and four. So, the two-dimensional case was proven independently by Andre Vey and by Becken, Bach and Radeau. And then chronologically, the next case that was proven was the four-dimensional case by Croke, and then the three-dimensional case by Kleiner. So, the first main result in this talk is for an immersion of a closed-oriented hyperservation. An immersion of a closed-oriented hypersurface in a Cartan-Hadamarg manifold. And again, we'll let R be the extrinsic distance between a pair of points in the submanifold and consider the winding number for hypersurface about points in the ambient space. And the statement is that the integral of the square of the winding number of hypersurface about points in the ambient space is again bounded above by this integral of one over the appropriate power of the distance. One over the appropriate power of the distance function. And again, equality holds precisely if the submanifold is the boundary, possibly with multiplicity, of a flat ball, the domain that's isometric to a ball in Euclidean space. Questions or comments so far? Yeah, can you say what Kn star is? Yeah, it's the constant from Euclidean space. Constant from Euclidean space. It's the constant for which this equality holds for a ball in Euclidean space. For two dimensions, for the dimension of the ambient Cartan-Adam space two, it's four pi. So in particular, if m is a closed curve of length L on a Cartan-Adamard surface, then this gives the statement that the length squared is greater than or equal to 4π times the sum of the areas. Times the sum of the areas, the regions it encloses, each one weighted by the square of the winding number with equality only for curves that bound flat disks. And the two-dimensional case of this result, this inequality for curves of carton surfaces, has also been proven by Howard. And with as much time as we have at the end of the talk, we'll talk a little about how Howard's proof and then this proof of the results in these slides are related to each other. In some ways, the two proofs are convergent. Other. In some ways, the two proofs are converses of each other. Questions or comments? Other questions or comments so far? So just briefly sketch some of the things that go into the proof. So the first fact is that the set of oriented geodesics in a Cartan-Hadamard manifold and a complete simply connected Riemannian manifold with non-positive curvature is canonically a simple. Is canonically a symplectic manifold. So we can define this space of geodesics as the quotient of the unit tangent bundle by the geodesic flow. There's a canonical symplectic form on the tangent bundle for Riemannian manifold. It's invariant under the geodesic flow, so it descends to the quotient. And you can show that it's diffeomorphic to the tangent bundle of the unit n minus one sphere. And whenever we have a manifold immersed in our car. A manifold immersed in our Carton Hadamard manifold, when we have a sub-manifold of our Carton-Hadamer manifold, we have in general and almost everywhere defined mapping called the secant mapping from the product of our sub-manifold to itself, where for a pair of points that have different images in the ambient space, we map them to the unique geodesic from the image of the first point to the image of the second point. So, this term that we're interested in bounding above the That we're interested in bounding above this term that we're going to bound above the integral of the square of the winding number of our hypersurface about points in the ambient space using using sort of an integral geometric argument, using a calculation using the double vibration of the unit tangent bundle on the one hand over the ambient space, on the other hand over the space of geodesics. You can show that this integral of the square of the winding number is. Number is given by the integral over m by m of the top power of this pull-back symplectic form by the secant mapping, then multiplied by this extrinsic distance function. So you have this integral geometric formula for the integral of the square of the winding number. And then the differential of this secant mapping is governed by Jacobi fields along geodesic segments in the ambient space between pairs of points. Space between pairs of points in the submanifold. You can use that, and you can use the upper curvature bound to show that this integral in terms of the top power of the secant pullback of the symplectic form is bounded above by one over this appropriate power of the distance function with equality only if the hypersurface is actually the boundary of a domain that's isometric to a ball. So, this last statement, this So, this last statement, this inequality between the top power of the pullback symplectic form times the distance, you can make sense of this inequality for a sub-manifold in a Cartan-Hadamard manifold of any co-dimension, any dimension in any codimension where you take the top power, whatever will be the top power on m by m of this pullback symplectic form, and you take the appropriate power of one over the extra. One over the extrinsic distance on the left-hand side. And this inequality is true for sub-manifolds and Cartan-Hadamard manifolds in all dimensions and all codimensions. So we still have the secant mapping of the space of geodesics. In general, for sub-manifolds of higher codimension, its image will be some higher codimensional sub-variety, but we can still pull back the symplectic form, take the power of it, which is top. form take the power of it which is top dimensional on m by m multiply by the extrinsic distance and we still have this upper bound for it and in the higher co-dimension case equality holds if and only if our submanifold is the boundary of a totally geodesic embedded disk that's isometric to a disk in Euclidean space um and so in a general And so, in a general and for a sub-manifold of a Cartan-Hadamard manifold, in general dimension and codimension, there's no natural family of geometric things in the ambient space for it to link with. So for a four-dimensional sub-manifold of a 13-dimensional Cartan-Hadamar manifold, there's no natural canonical family of eight-dimensional subspaces for a four-manifold to link with. But when the ambient Carton-Hadamard manifold is actually you Carton-Hadamard manifold is actually Euclidean space, the right-hand side of this inequality, the top power of the pullback symplectic form times the extrinsic distance, actually gives this inequality of the square of the linking number of our manifold about affine planes that's bounded above in Banshoff and Pohl's inequality. So, in this sense, this inequality for sub-manifolds of Carton-Hadamard manifolds gives Gives a generalization, a statement that on the one hand gives Benchoff and Pohl's inequality in Euclidean space with this additional fact and is also true in all Cartan-Hedenmark manifolds and for all sub-manifolds. So, questions or comments so far? So, one setting where there is a question. Is a question you can ask about linking about subspaces as in Banshoff and Poles inequality is for codimension two sub-manifolds of Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, they have a linking number about geodesics in the ambient space. And the space of geodesics in a Cartan-Hadamard manifold has a canonical measure. It comes from the top power of the canonical symplectic form. So you can ask whether the integral of the square of the linking number about Of the square, the linking number about geodesics of a codimension two submanifold and the Cartan-Hadamard manifold is bounded above again by one over the appropriate power of the extrinsic distance function. And Teufel has proven this result for when the ambient Cartan-Hadamart space is three-dimensional. In that case, the upper bound is again the length squared. So, there's a stronger, an extended version of the Carton-Hadamard conjecture, which in addition says that non-positive curvature implies the Euclidean isoparametric inequality. If you have some negative upper bound on the sectional curvature of your Cartan-Hadamard space, you should satisfy the isoparametric inequality from the hyperbolic space with that sectional curvature, which is stronger than the Euclidean isoparametric inequality. So, this is known to be true in dimensions two and three, in dimension two by work of Boll, and in dimension three by work of Kleiner. In the same set of results, as he established the Cartan-Hadamark conjecture, in dimension three established the generalized Cartan-Hadamar conjecture. And there's a version of the Banshoff-Pole inequality for submanifolds in hyperbolic spaces and spheres. The formulas are more complicated. It's no longer just one. It's no longer just one over the extrinsic distance or power of the extrinsic distance that gives the upper bound. But there is a statement that gives the equivalent result for linking numbers about total geodesic subspaces. And the results above have a... Yes, a question. Yes, there's a question of Joe. Can you see it? I'll read it. That title is. I read it. Does Teifel's proof go in the same way? Where it ends to lincoln integral with the symplectic form integral? Yes, yes. So trying to get that. Okay. So Teufel's proof. Teufel's proof shows again that the extrinsic distance times the appropriate power of the symplectic form, which in this three-dimensional case is one. form, which in this three-dimensional case is one, is equal to the integral of the square of the linking number of the curve in a three-dimensional Cartan-Aderman space about geodesics. And I'm all but positive that that is true in general, as long as your codimension two submanifold in the setting of this question bounds an embedded hypersurface. So in for So, for closed curves in three-dimensional spaces that are diffeomorphic to Rn, you have a cipher surface that it bounds, and you can use that to establish that same inequality. And in any dimensional ambient space, as long as your sub-manifold bounds an embedded hypersurface, I'm all but positive that you can that part of Banshoff and Pohl's proof of their results in Euclidean space then works and you can show. Space then works, and you can show that the integral of the square of the linking number is equal to this integral in terms of the pullback symplectic form, and then you get the inequality as well. Other questions or comments? To just briefly mention that the results above have sharp, strong. Sharp, stronger versions in the setting where the curvature of the ambient space has a negative upper bound. So they show that sort of the equivalent of the generalized Cartan-Adamart conjecture holds for the Banshoff-Pole inequality. And in this same setting that's covered by the generalized conjecture, where you have a strictly negative upper bound on the sectional curvature, Yao has proven an inequality, an isoparametric inequality, which basically says that the perimeter. Inequality, which basically says that the perimeter is bigger than the volume and encloses up to this constant for the dimension and the value of the upper curvature bound. And the results in this work also give sort of a quantitative sharp version of Yaus inequality. So the setting is again for a hypersurface codimension one submanifold immersed in a Cartan-Hanambert space where now we have a strictly negative upper bound in the curvature. Strictly negative upper bound in the curvature. And the statement is that the area of our Merse hypersurface squared minus the square of the integral of the absolute value of the winding number is bounded below by an integral over n by m of this non-negative analytic function of the extrinsic distance and the norm of the gradient of the extrinsic distance as a function n by m, which is strictly positive. Which is strictly positive inequality. And the first inequality holds only if and only if the manifold is the boundary of a hyperbolic ball, boundary of a domain isometric to a hyperbolic ball. And the function that C sub n, C super n sub k is related to the volume of a geodesic ball in hyperbolic n-space. It's a polynomial in the integral from zero to r. In the integral from zero to r of the volume of a geodesic ball of given radius, hyperbolic end space. And when you combine this result with the results above, you get a statement for you get a sort of a stronger statement for closed curves in Cartan-Heidermart surfaces where you have a strictly negative upper bound on the curvature, which says that they're greater than or equal to 4π times. To four pi times the integral of the square of the winding number plus the square of the integral of the absolute value of the winding number. So, again, when for curves that are boundaries of domains, L squared greater than or equal to 4 pi times a plus absolute kappa times area squared, that's the sharp isoparametric inequality in surfaces with an upper curvature bound, negative upper curvature bound. Oh, so sorry. And oh, so sorry. Again, this result was also proven by Ralph Howard. The way that Ralph Howard proved this result, the way that Ralph Howard proved this inequality in surfaces is by taking the known sharp isoparametric inequality in Cartan-Hadamard surfaces and using that to prove a Sobolev inequality for functions of bounded variation in Cartan-Hadamart surfaces. And then the And then the Banshoff-Pole inequality here, this inequality for the winding number, is the result of applying the Sobolev inequality to the winding number function, to this locally constant winding number function. And the proofs of the results above directly prove the inequality in terms of winding numbers, but then the isoparametric inequality is a special case. And in that sense, these the These the proofs of these results and Howard's proofs are sort of converses of each other. So, other questions or comments? More questions or comments? These results. If not, that's everything. So, thank you guys. Thank you very much. That was very That was very contradicting and also very condensed. So Alexander, has a question, please. Sorry, thank you very much for the talk. So maybe I missed what you have said when showing your last slide. But what is so do you have do you have expectation that this has implication so that you can show that So that you can show that it's possible to have some, to deduce something about is a parametric connection, about the Kata Hadama conjecture? I wouldn't say anything like that. I mean, in principle, if you can say enough about the function in, if you can say enough about this function c and k, maybe that would tell you. That would tell you something about the isoparametric inplan. In principle, I guess a strong enough and precise enough statement about this function could tell you something about the isoparametric and the Cartan-Hadamer conjecture in the setting where you have a strictly negative upper bound on the curvature. And Yao's inequality, and this is pointed out by Kleiner in the introduction to his paper: Yao's inequality implies. Implies in the setting where we assume a negative upper curvature bound, Yao's inequality implies at least the Euclidean isoparametric inequality if the volume is big enough. So one natural seeming question would be whether there's some inequality between the upper bound and the Banshoff pole inequality and then the perimeter. Let me find where the statement is. Let me find where the statement is. This one over the appropriate power of the distance function. And other than for curves, I'm all but positive that's not the case. That can't be the case because, at least in general, because you can take a submanifold whose area is intrinsically fixed, say one, and you can immerse it or embed it in an extrinsically very small neighborhood. So you can make this integral of one over the power of the distance function as big as you want. Function as big as you want with fixed area. So I don't think you can use this to say something about the isoparametric inequality by an inequality that goes in that direction. Yeah. Oh, yes, thank you. Hi, as soon as I'm going to be able to do that. Hi, so maybe I should turn on my camera. Hi, thank you. But could you comment on the similarity of Croke's proof using Santalo's formula? Because this does look kind of familiar, right? Yeah, yeah. So Croke's proof is also, so it uses Santelot's formula, which is based on this, in a sense, based on the same fact that the symplectic form. That the symplectic form on the unit tangent bundle is invariant under the geodesic flow. And the paper that has these also has a modified version of Crookes inequality that covers immersed. So yeah, it's very, there are definitely similarities. There are definitely similarities, starting with the fact that they both use the fact that the symplectic forms invariant under the GDA. The symplectic forms invariant under the geodesic flow. In a sense, Croke's result actually covers a more general case than this. It covers sort of any manifold that has unique geodesics that all extend from a boundary point to another boundary point. So you can take a multiple cover of the punctured plane, and that's not going to be isometric to a subset. To a subset of a Cartan-Hadamer manifold, but Croke's isoparametric inequality will still extend to that case. If you assume an ambient Cartan atom red space, there's also, based on some of these things, a modified version of Croxene. Thank you. Hi. Please show your theorem, the slide with your Ethereum. One before the last and something like this. Let's see. This. Yes, yes. So just one question. In your theorem, the manifold doesn't have to be connected. Doesn't have to be connected. Correct. The sub-manifold N does not have to be connected. It can have multiple components. So, and if you consider the situation of Yao theorem compared to your theorem, so this difference in the left-hand side of your inequality is precisely the difference. Is the difference of left and right-hand side in the outer theorem? Yes, the difference of the square of the left-hand side, etc., yes. Yeah. Okay, thank you very much. Yeah, yeah. And in a sense, the left-hand, it's really not any more general than in Yao's theorem because the two sides are additive in this case where you no longer have a natural geometric scale invariance. Geometric scale invariance. But yeah, it's the square of the left-hand side of Yao's inequality minus the square of the right-hand side bounded below by this integral of the question. So the Cartana devar conjecture, is it also conjectured in greater generality when there are no conjugate points? And if so, does the conjecture. And if so, does the conjecture also extend to a Finsler setting? So I don't know anything about the Finsler setting. No conjugate points isn't enough for potentially, even in two dimensions, you can have a small region of positive curvature and it'll violate the Euclidean isoparametric inequality. There are sharp isoparametric inequalities, again, due to Croke, that holds the equivalent of the Earth That holds in manifolds with no conjugate points. And basically, the equality case is a hemisphere. And I think there are asymptotic, like, you know, I don't know off the top of my head. I don't know. I'm not even positive that such a thing is established or what, but I think they're asymptotic for large regions in domains in mass. Domains in manifolds with no conjugate points. But for small regions, you can still have some positive curvature and you won't satisfy the Euclidean isoparametric inequality. Okay, thank you. So thanks again, Joseph, for the next. Sorry if there's a question. But maybe before Daniel asks the question, just a reminder for everyone, there will be a group photo very soon. So don't go away and bring your friends if they're near you. If there are an area, but please, Danielle. Can you show again relation 12, my question 12, please? Equality, yes, give me a minute. This was a special instance where you had equal in the Euclidean ambient space. Yeah. Can you explain why this holds in Rn only, or is there other cases? other cases so in rn um you you can take a spanning object a spanning submanifold for your hypersurface and again by sort of an integral geometric double fibration of the the grassmannian the bundle of grassmannians and the tangent spaces on the one hand over euclidean ambient space and on the other hand over this the space of affine planes you Of affine planes, you can establish this inequality. And the whole argument is a little more involved. So you start out addressing the case where your manifold bounds something embedded in the ambient space. And then if that doesn't work, you can put the whole situation in a higher dimensional Euclidean space. And then if your manifold is not cobordinate to zero, there's this other thing they do. But basically, because you can take a spanning object, and again, you have this double vibration of the bundle of Grassmannians. On the one hand, over. Cross monitors on the one hand over your ambient space, on the other hand, over the space of affine planes. So, this will not be true in hyperbolic space? It's true, and the double vibration is over the ambient hyperbolic space and over the space of totally geodesic subspaces of a given dimension. Okay, thank you. Yeah. Okay, so thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. And thank you, Jesus, for the very next talk. So we are now waiting for the proof what to happen. I will not quite.
