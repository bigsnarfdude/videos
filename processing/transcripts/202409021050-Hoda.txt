These are the best technologies I've got. So that was sort of the chance. Up next, we have Nimaha who will speak about flat Taurus theorem for project complexes. Okay, yeah, this is about upcoming work of mine with Zach.  All right. So Zach says that you'll see the paper on archive in a week, but I hope that's true. So I should start by defining quadrant complexes. These are kind of cousins or siblings of systolic complexes. They're kind of the square case where systolic complexes. Square case where systolic complexes or the triangle case. In case you might be familiar with systolic complexes, I'll start by defining a particular kind of local definition. A locally quadric complex is a square complex, so that's a two complex. Complex whose two cells are squares satisfying some what I'm going to call disk diagram replacement rules. Poison calls. So there's this one. There's this one and there's this one. So here we have three possible replacements. I'll see. I'll say a little bit better what I mean by disk diagram replacement rules in a second, but for now I'll just put these pictures. Okay, so let's recall that this diagram is a finite contractible complex. A complex D embedded in the plane together with a combinatorial map from B on to X. To X and a combinatorial map, all the maps are going to be combinatorial in this talk, is one that sends open cells homeomorphically onto open cells. Okay, so what does it mean, these disk diagram replacement rules? Let's say you have some distiagram in X, let's say it has some well. Well, naughty vertices, positively curved ones, you might say. Something like that. Degree 3, interior vertex. Degree 2, interior vertex. What the replacement rules tell us, draw X down here, what they tell us is that you can cut out those pieces and replace them. you can cut out those pieces and replace them with ones that have less squares. So maybe we don't know which one we can get, but maybe we get this one over here and then that guy gets replaced with a single square. And then the basic And then the basic consequence of this is that for any null homotopic cycle alpha in X, any this This diagram bounded by alpha of minimal area is a cat zero square complex, which we can just take to mean in mean interior emergencies have to be greater than or equal to four. Okay, so that's what these rules are really for. Questions? Yes, I'm not sure I have a well-formed one yet, but I'm okay. Have a well-formed one yet, but I'm a bit confused about what you mean by these replacement rules. Should we be thinking of this as like you have some complex, and the statement is that if there is a disk diagram of this type, then there is also another disk diagram of this type. Yeah, with the same. Yeah, and you could even think of these as being the form of the whole disk diagram. And the point is, if you got if you have one of this form, then you can replace it with one of this form with the same boundary. So I guess what I'm what I'm So, I guess what I'm confused about is if you have an embedding of that graph on the left, and this one or this one? The first one that you mentioned. Yeah, that one. Like, if you have that graph embedded in your complex, then you're saying that there's also an embedding of this one on the right that you can replace it with? Yeah, the implication is that these two map to the same edge. These two map to the same edge. You're drawn as graphs, but you want to think wherever you see a square it's filled in. Oh, okay. Yes, yes. These are, yeah, okay, so disk diagrams are contractible, finite complexes in the plane. So yeah, these are all filled in. These are all that's two squares here, two here, three here. clarify this further and that to make sure that I understand this correctly. So you're not really deforming X, but you're just looking at the colors of X. Maps into X. Maps into X. So yeah, these maps are sort of probing the combinatorics of X and then what we're being told is if you have one of these mapping tags. The maps from such a thing can be replaced by a map from it. Exactly. With the same Exactly, with the same, with the boundary walk, with the resulting boundary walk inside of x being the same. Like in words, I guess that first diagram is saying that if there's a square in x, if there's a pair of squares in x that share three consecutive sides, they must share the full. Yeah. Yeah. I usually additionally assume that that's actually a full of squares. That's to avoid. Of squares. That's to avoid being, I don't know, multiple squares, but I don't want to get to that. But for the other cases, yeah, really, it's yeah, thanks for those questions. Okay, so now I can define, so this is a local notion. Defined, so this is a local notion, but it has global consequences. So we have a name for things that are locally quadric, hence simply connected, and that is quadric. So quadric complex is a simply connected locally complex. And a quadrant group is a group acting properly and co-compactly. And co-compactly on a quadrant complex. Okay, that's all right. Well, um, I'll already be erasing this. All right, um, examples trees Cat zero square complexes, history loss and cat zero square complexes. In particular, as we need it for this talk, the standard square tiling. I'll denote by P squared sub square symbol of the plane. And then for groups, one very large source of examples. Oh, I always forget to say finally presented. Finally presented. C4T4 small cancellation groups. Okay, I guess that's part of what's important because those are not all co-compactly cubulated. So at least we can see that there are more things here than just Than just you would get from Edinburgh and Catsero Q complexes, or there are different things. And here's just to give another idea of what you get globally from these things. And as we already mentioned, it you get cats or dista. Mentioned it, you get cat serial disc diagrams, that's a horrible consequence. One skeletons of water complexes are characterized by the property That any isometrically embedded cycle as like four and also worth mentioning graphs. With this property are also known as hereditary modular graphs. Very modular graphs, although well the actual definition is different, but that's a theorem of band out. Okay, was studying this family of graphs decades ago? Yes, just to confirm, is it length exactly four or length that we used for? Exactly four. Yeah. Okay, so I can state the main theorem. Now, flat, no, not flat theorem, flat flat Thor's theorem, and this is, as I said, a joint result with Zach but N be a little bit of a nice thing. Let n be at least two, and suppose Zn acts freely on a locally finite watered complex. Then n equals two and Zn Z squared stabilizes an isometrically embedded copy Of the standard square tiling. I'm tempted to call this the quadrat plane because the systolic people call the standard triangular tiling the systolic plane. Okay, yeah, so that's the target theorem. This is Toling case has S the. Historic case, does it also make the assumption that it's not going to finite? I think there might have to be. I think there might have to be. Because you can take a z-squared action, you take a z-squared action on the systolic plane and then blow up the vertices to... The vertices to infinite cliques. And then I think you get a z-squared action on that thing, and then you can get a third generator, z-cubed, moving the infinite clicks. I think there might have to be. That said, if we just start with a z-squared action, then the local finiteness assumption is not necessary. We get our plane without any local finiteness. That's any local finance system. Other questions? Sorry to ask another, okay, never mind. I'm not sorry. The previous theorem about length four, I'm picturing the squared tile, and I'm picturing just like a really big square or rectangle in here. Are we ignoring all the in-between vertices and saying it's like four between? And saying it's like more because it's got more edges? Oh. You're asking about like an end-by-end grid. Yeah, yeah. And then the cycle that goes around it? That is not isometrically embedded. Yeah, you've got shortcuts that go through the middle. And that's shorter than going around. Oh, okay. Thank you. Alright. So we'll spend the rest of the time, and you're not that much time. But hello? 20 minutes? Worth into my notes? Yeah, so we'll spend the rest of the time, and I'll give some. We'll spend the rest of the time and I'll give some ideas on how we prove this. Oh, I should, in fact, write that our proof is very much following Tomash Elsner's proof for the systolic case. So let me in fact. Oh, well, let me first give a couple. I forgot to do this. I should give a couple corollaries of this theorem. Of this theorem. So, the first quadrant groups do not contain pre-abelian subgroups or abelian subgroups of rank. Of rank greater than two. And the other one, three abelian subgroups, Cabelian subgroups are undistorted in quadruposed. And quarter corpse. Are quadrant complexes not removed? Yes, they are. Yeah. In fact, well, I mean, not as defined, but there are cells you can add. So, okay, well, I know you have the. Have a you didn't rule out duplicate squares for you, but if you if you I mean even even just from the replacement rules because because if you have this I mean this thing this K23 with all the CREAS that correspond to the replacement so there's a way to glue in a cell for each complete dimensions yes yeah That cube could have as you said that doesn't belong to the cube. Okay, yeah, so let me set proof follows that of Elster quite closely, actually. Actually, for the systolic case. And let's talk about flats in quadric complexes. So if X is quadric, Quadric and F is a map, helmetorial map from the quadric plane to X. Then there are certain conditions that I'd like to define. First condition, F is isometric if it's an isometric. Isometric embedding just so I have to say last words embedding that is locally isometric if it's restriction every Every two by two subgrid is unisometric embedding three is locally minimal if it's restriction to every Each and every 2 by 3 subgrid is a minimal area this diagram and the lemma we have that's an important part of the proof is Part of the proof is that these conditions are equivalent. And just to give another word, F satisfying. Fine of these conditions is called a flattening of the city. Okay, so I was gonna say a little bit about I was going to say a little bit about how that works, but there isn't that much time. But just to say maybe one thing, for example, we wanted to prove the direction 1 to 3. It turns out that if you have a lesser area this diagram, Diagram for the boundary of this 2x3 grid, it's necessarily going to force there to be a path between a pair of boundary vertices that are closer than they should be in an isometrically embedded plane. And that's the flavor of at least part of proving that. Bad. Another important component is looking at flats that are at finite house durf distance. And we have a nice combinatorial characterization of those. To give a notion of equivalence of flats, two flats F and F prime are an equivalent if There's a sequence of flats starting with F, starting with F infinite sequence converging pointwise to F prime such that Fi and Fi plus one differ by a single or at a single vertex. Okay, so you should think maybe if If that's Fi, then you get Fi plus 1 from Fi by replacing a single vertex with something else that necessarily then is adjacent to all the neighbors of the previous vertex. Have a sequence of these kinds of single vertex. Single vertex replacements. Okay. And the reason this notion is useful is because with the following dilemma, if f and f prime are at finite I'll start with distance say distance h then in a quadrat complex X, then they are equivalent. And it actually follows then that they're at halstar distance one. So I'll try to say something. Try to say something about the proof of this. So implies that I was looking at some other UK. Yeah, it it may not be quite an immediate consequence. It turns out that you can reorder these and then you can permute the order of the vertices that you swap. And then from that, you can see that it's how. That you can see that's also just this one. Okay, so how do we do this? For a vertex B and F, we want to find someone in F prime, or at least we have to do this, that's the main part. We want to find someone, this is a vertex B in F, we want to find someone in F prime that has all of these neighbors. All of these neighbors in F has them all as neighbors. And the idea there is we start with V, a little 2x2 grid standard of V in F, and then we grow that to a much bigger grid. So that lives inside of F. F and then we delete D, so we cut a little hole. So now we have two, it's now no longer what looks like a disk diagram, looks more like an annular diagram. And then we're going to take shortest paths. We're going to take shortest paths at regularly spaced boundary points in this large enough grid. Large enough radio to F prime. And then we connect the endpoints with paths in F prime. So these guys are contained in F prime. These vertices are spaced. These vertices are spaced roughly at Hausdorff distance distance, and these are also roughly, of course, that's the Hausdorff distance between F and F prime. These are also roughly at distance h. And then to this whole thing, we glue a disk diagram for that cycle that lives inside of Fπ. So it's decided by f prime. We glue the boundary of this. So anyway, I'll say this is beta that lives inside of F prime. And this is, again, the boundary here is beta. And that gives us a disk diagram for this heat cycle. Heat cycle. And it turns out, and I'm not explaining all the reasons why, but when we perform all sorts of reduction steps on this resulting this diagram for this H cycle, we get something that looks, again, exactly like a 2x2 grid. And necessarily, because F is isometrically embedded, this vertex had to have come from. To have come from the image of this disk diagram that was inside of F prime. And that gives us our vertex in F prime that has the neighbors of V in F as neighbors. Sorry if that was a bit sketchy. Sketchy. I should mention one thing to notice about the replacement rules is when you perform them, you're only getting rid of vertices. So the image of your new disk diagram always lives inside the image of the previous one. That's important here. So a crawlery of this is, well, let me first give it a little bit of a Give a definition The thickening of F is the union of all flats at finite House dorm distance to F. And then the corollary that we get here is that, again, it's not quite an immediate corollary, but there exists a map R from thick F to quadric lane such that Such that for any vertices u and v in thickening, u and v are joined by an edge if and only if their images are. So that really gives the picture of this thickening being a copy of this quadric plane where each vertex is blown up to include more vertices which are adjacent to each other but which are adjacent to vertices from neighboring blown-up vertices. Okay, I just want to say a few brief words about how this all fits together in the proof. Is that like you to stop? Okay. Can I yeah, thank you. I'll say there's two steps to the proof. Get a finite index subgroup. Subgroup H and C squared to act on a flat in X. And that's more about using the characterizations of a flat using local minimality, because you can always get your torus, especially if you make your finite index subgroup so that. Your fine index subgroup so that translation lengths are large enough, hit your torus, and then you can the minimal torus, and then because it's not a skinny torus, then its minimality implies that the universal cover is minimal as a flat inside of your complex X. Okay, so that's a finite index subgroup acting on a flat, and then And then the next step is to get all the z squared to act on a flat. And coset representatives give some finite number of flats, all at finite halster distance, all of which H acts on. And then that part uses the characterization of the thickening to obtain a. To obtain a single flap on which z squared, all of z squared acts. Questions for me are there three-dimensional quadratic groups? Like yes, um Yes, um yeah. So following Posaida's work on systolic complexes, I... Yeah, I was able to show that there are higher-dimensional hyperbolic quadrate groups using similar methods. Yaniszkevich and Schwankowski also showed that there are higher-dimensional systolic groups. Systolic groups, so you might be a data person. But I never wrote that. That's from my console. They are simultaneously public and systemic? It's been a long time since I thought of that, but I think so. Yeah, I think so. Yes? Might this thickening results work for other isometrically embedded sub-complexes, or do you think it's very particular? Or do you think it's very particular to that? It's very particular to community. So yeah. Were there particular kinds of subgroups that you had in mind? Like something that looks like a hyperbolic plan, for instance. Maybe s maybe some of the I'm I haven't thought about that. I'm not sure I have a question so much, I just don't want to make sure I don't understand. I'm thinking, am I right? I'm thinking in a classical flat tourist theorem, you're just saying in the oh no, sorry, I see, yeah, so this is a flat tourist theorem I've heard about. So the claims any z-squared acts on a flat action will be on a standard flap, but it's acting in a standard way. So it's not just acting on the standard flap, but it's acting commuting the vertically, transiting the lock-ups versus the standard. Not necessarily transitively. Okay. Yeah, but yeah, because you could just use something like that, okay? Yeah, sorry, sorry. I think I was confused. Yeah, sorry. Sorry. I think I was confused when I started asking a question about confusing again. Announcement after lunch, there's a photo at one just to put the filling. I think. I think it's really fun. I didn't really mess. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
