Give this talk today. So, in the next 25 minutes, I will present some results from my thesis project. So, to a great extent, what I will be talking about today is joint work with my advisors, Yotas Prehier and Uli Bagner. The focus of this talk are compact and orientable three manifolds. Three manifolds, and mostly we will consider three manifolds without boundary. And so it's a classical result by Moise that every such manifold has a triangulation. This has come up several times already during this workshop. And by a triangulation, here I mean just a finite collection of tetrahedra glued together along triangular faces. Now when working with triangulations, Now, when working with triangulations, sometimes it will be helpful to forget the exact way they are glued together and just consider the dual graph, also known as the dual one skeleton, which encodes the gluing information. So its vertices correspond to tetrahedra of the triangulation and the edges considered to face gluings. And of course, when we consider three manifolds, we mean Three manifolds, we mean this equivalence up to homeomorphism. So, the broad context of this work is the algorithmic study of three manifolds. And here a fundamental challenge arises from the fact that if you take a three-manifold, any one you like, it has infinitely many combinatorially distinct triangulations. And algorithmically deciding whether two given triangulations actually Triangulations actually of any dimension encode the same d-dimensional manifold is a non-trivial problem that has a strikingly different nature across various dimensions. So in dimension two, this problem is relatively easy to solve. In dimension three, while it can be solved, it is notoriously complicated. In fact, it relies on the Thurston-Perham one. The Thurston-Pereman geometrization theorem. And if you go to dimension at least four, the problem becomes undecidable. So for now, let us stay in dimension three. And since the decision problem is in theory very, very and also in practice very complicated, when people approach this problem, typically they approach them in two possible ways. In two possible ways. So, if you believe that the two triangulations that are presented to you are the same, then you might try to relate them by a sequence of so-called Pachner moves to turn one triangulation into the other one. And if you find such a sequence, then you can be sure that the two triangulations are homeomorphic. Or if you believe that they are not homeomorphic, then you can try to tell them apart by taking... Tell them apart by taking your favorite invariant that you can evaluate on the triangulation. And if you get different values, then you can be sure that they are not homeomorphic. And I would like to follow up on this direction with computable invariants. The problem is that many invariants that are powerful enough to tell large classes of triangulations apart are hard to compute. Are hard to compute in general. However, it has been shown that if you take into account structural properties of the triangulation, then you can simplify your life greatly. And one such structural property that people have been taking into account is the three-width of the dual graph, which is a structural graph. Graph, which is a structural graph parameter I will discuss soon. For now, what I would like to flesh out is this chart, which contains some fixed parameter tractable results. And what I would like to highlight in this table is the middle column of running times. So note that the number of tetrahedra appears in each case as a linear factor. So if you restrict So, if you restrict your attention to triangulations for which the tree width of the dual graph is fixed or bounded, then all these algorithms become linear in N. And the presence of these algorithms motivates the main guiding question for us, namely, given a three-manifold M, how small can the tree-width of any dual graph be over all triangulation? Over all triangulations of M. And this question and some variations thereof have been of interest in the community of computational topologists. In particular, a variant of this question in the context of knot theory has also been asked at an Ober-Wolfach meeting in 2015. So maybe this is a good moment to take a brief intermenzo in FPT algorithms in Nazi. In FPT algorithms in math theory. So if you consider a limb diagram, then when you forget the crossing structure, you get a four-valent graph. And so you can consider the tree width of the diagram. And it has been shown that there are several link invariants that can be evaluated efficiently on diagrams that have bounded tree width, including the John's polynomial, the Honflipped polynomial. the conflict polynomial, but also some quantum invariants which include the colored versions of these above two polynomials. So the provocative question that has been asked in Oberbolfach sounds as follows. Is there a constant such that every link has a diagram D with tree with at most that constant? And I mean I mean, of course, if this would be the case, and if it would be easy to find such a diagram, then it would lead to a collapse of several complexity classes. So people have thought that this is not the case, but explicitly it has been shown only in 2019 by Arnold de Messme, Jessica Purcell, Saul Schleimer, and Eric Sedvik. And Eric Setchwick, they showed that for every natural number n, there exists a knot, a particular kind of torus knot, which has three width at least n. So any diagram you take has three width at least n. And so this result is in spirit very similar to the results that I would like to discuss during this talk. So maybe now let's talk about the tribute. Let's talk about the tree bit of a graph. So, the actual definition is a little bit technical, unfortunately. So, I have a backup slide which I can show you if you're interested, but maybe for the purposes of this talk, I'd like to keep it more informal. So, the tree width of a graph is a parameter that quantifies the similarity of the graph to any tree. And so, I'd like to illustrate it via some examples. So, as you would expect, the tree width of a graph has, the tree width of a tree is one, the tree width of the complete graph is n minus one, and you can actually get anything in between. And this has been a key concept in the development of graph minor theory, a cornerstone of parametrized complexity theory. And I should also note that there is a zoo, a whole zoo of bit parameters. A zoo, a whole zoo of width parameters for graphs, such as cut width, path width, and so on and so forth. Really, dozens of such parameters exist that capture structural properties of graphs in one way or another. So, if we have this guiding question in mind, then it is actually quite straightforward how we should extend this definition to three manifolds. So, we define the tree-width of a three-manifold to be A three-manifold to be the smallest possible value of the tribute of a dual graph over any triangulation of n. And of course, this way you can take your favorite graph parameter and by minimizing it over all triangulations, you can turn it into a topological invariant of three manifolds. We may call this collectively combinatorial bit parameters. There is There is a problem with this definition though, that it's quite implicit. It does not offer a direct way of computing these invariants. So the direction we have chosen in this project to understand this quantity indirectly by means of its quantitative relationship with classical topological invariants. With classical topological invariants of three manifolds, such as the Hagar genus, hyperbolic volume, the Charlemagne-Thompson width associated with generalized Hagar splitting, and so on and so forth. So in order to deal with this challenge, we need interfaces between these different perspectives on three manifolds. So in this talk, I am mainly considering three viewpoints. Considering three viewpoints, the combinatorial one through triangulations and their dual graphs, the topological viewpoint by which I mean Hagard splittings. And in case of hyperbolic three manifolds, also the hyperbolic structure, the geometric structure is important. One notable example in this context is the thickened decomposition. And luckily, there exists some powerful machineries, some powerful technology has been. Some powerful technology has been developed over the last decades that provide bridges between these perspectives. Moreover, they provide bridges in a quantitative way that we can also relate these various structures on three manifolds, taking into account these associated numerical parameters, such as the tree width, the Hagar genus, or the volume. And so I'd like to briefly flesh out three of these technologies. Of these technologies we have relied on. As I have also written in the abstract, one is generalized Hagard splittings developed by Charnamin and Thompson in 1992, which for our purposes is considered as an interface for turning various decompositions of three manifolds into Hagard splittings. There are also layered triangulations due to Jacob and Rubinstein. They were Time. They were already mentioned by Jessica earlier this week. And for us, they are an interface for turning Hagar splittings, or generalized Hagar splittings, into nice triangulations of three manifolds. You will see in a moment what I mean by that. And when we are dealing with hyperbolic manifolds and you consider a thick thin decomposition, then in this context, Then, in this context, it is a natural desire to triangulate the thick part, and this can be done also in a quantitative way due to the work of JÃ¼rgens and Thurston and Kobaya Shirik. So, these are the main buttons in our toolbox that we rely on. So, now I'd like to, in this second part of the talk, I'd like to give an overview. Talk: I'd like to give an overview of some of these results, and then I would like to also go through some proof sketches. So, oh yes, so the first result I would like to discuss is motivated by the quest for three manifolds with large three-wheel. And with Yonatan and Uli, we were able to show that if M is a closed, orientable, irreducible Orientable, irreducible, and non-Hakan manifolds, then its Hagar genus is always upper bounded by its tree width. So this result in spirit is very similar to the one by the Masmei, Purcell, Schleimer, and Sedgwick that I showed you at the beginning of the talk. And the upshot of it is that we can combine. Of it is that we can combine it with an earlier result by Hegel, who showed that there exist precisely such manifolds that have arbitrary Large Hagar genus. So when combining these two results, we get as a corollary that there exist also three manifolds that have large tree-width for an arbitrary threshold, where all triangulations you might consider. You might consider have a dual graph of 3 with at least n. In subsequent work with Jonathan Sprehr, we were able to show a reverse of this theorem, namely that the Hagar genus always gives an upper bound on the path width of the manifold, which in turn, that by definition, gives an upper bound on its tree width. And so it follows when we combine these two results that for non-Acan manifolds, the Manifolds, the 3-bit and the Higgard genes are always within constant factor. And what I would like to mention is that for the first result, we make heavy use of generalized Higgard splittings, whereas to establish the second result, it actually follows pretty directly from the layered triangulation machinery of Jacob and Rubinstein. So we have just seen that there are some three manifolds for which the tree width is always large. Always large, very large. But it's also very natural to ask what we can say about three manifolds with small three-bit. And quoting a result by Jacob and Rubinstein, if you take a closed orientable three-manifold with Hagar genus at most one, a land space, then you always have three bits at most one. They did not phrase it like that, but essentially what they showed that every land space admits a dual graph, admits a triangulation. Graph admits a triangulation, a layered triangulation, where the dual graph looks like this chain. And we were able to reverse, almost reverse this theorem by showing that if you take a three-manifold and you assume that its tree-width is at most one, then either you have a length space with Hagar genus at most one, or you have a single exceptional Seifert fibered space of Hagar genus. Cipher fiber space of Hagar genus II. And somehow the key first step to establish this result is that when you take three manifolds with three with at most one, essentially you have these three possibilities for dual graphs of triangulations. And then you still have to work a bit, quite a bit, but for instance, if you have Regina at hand, then you can And you can make great use of it, this software, to keep things under control and arrive at this result. As a corollary, well, from theorem 3, it actually follows that for a large class of orientable cipher fiber spaces, we have 3-width 2, like over the 2-sphere or non-orientable surfaces. And then it turns out that these three manifolds plus some graph manifolds cover a lot of the at most 10 tetrahedral triangulations. Interestingly, we were also able to find an example of a minimum triangulation which is not of minimal tree width. All right, now the last result I would like to flesh out to you is in the Would like to flesh out to you is in the realm of hyperbolic three manifolds. So, the Mostolf rigidity theorem tells us that geometric properties of hyperbolic three manifolds are topological invariants and it makes sense to relate them with other topological invariants. And Clema Maria and Jessica Purcell just did that with the tree width. Namely, they showed that there exists a universal constant such that for every closed hyperbolic Such that for every closed hyperbolic three-manifold m, the tree-bit is always upper bounded in terms of the volume. And I was able to show that there exists some other universal constant that for every closed hyperbolic three-manifold M, the volume upper bounds even the path width. And here, what I should say is that. I should say is that I follow a very similar agenda to Maria and Purso, but somehow generalized Hagard splittings can be blended in to the proof and that leads to this improvement. And yes, I would like to now go towards the sketches of some of these results. Sketches of some of these results, but first I would like to very briefly review some terminology on generalized Hagard splittings. So, in a classical Hagard splitting, a three-manifold is built by gluing two identical handlebodies together. Sebastian was talking about this Haggard splittings quite a bit in the previous talk. In a generalized Haggard splitting, you build a three-man. Build a free manifold by gluing together several pairs of compression bodies respecting certain rules. So, with the help of compression bodies, the notion of Hagard splitting can be extended to three manifolds with boundary. And one way of approaching generalized Haggard splittings is by first taking a decomposition of your manifold where you decompose your manifold into sub-manifolds, codimension zero sub-manifolds that interface. Codimension zero submanifolds that intersect along surfaces. And then you take a Hagard splitting for each submanifold in a coherent way. What do I mean by that? It's that I don't want to consider these circular generalized Haggard splittings, but somehow these Haggard surfaces are always somehow ordered. They can be swept through, and the boundaries. The boundary surfaces they play the role of the thin levels. And these Haggard splittings, generalized Haggard splittings, can be encoded by what is called the fork complex. This is a language that has been developed in his 2016 lecture notes by Charlemagne, Schultens, and Saito, and they come very handy when relating when you want to relate general. When you want to relate generalized Hagar splittings to, say, dual graphs of three-manifold triangulations. And what is really great about generalized Hagar splitting is that they can be manipulated in various ways, thinning, untelescoping, amalgamation, and so on and so forth. And if you consider the thinnest possible generalized Haggard splitting, the thin splitting, or a thin splitting, then such a generalized Haggard splitting has some various nice properties. Splitting has some various nice properties which make them very useful in various contexts. So, all right, so I have a couple minutes left, and I think that will be just enough to give you a very high level overview of one of these results that we established. So, yeah, theorem one. Here we would like to show that if you have a closed That if you have a closed-orientable irreducible non-Hawk and three manifold, then the Higgard genus is always upper bounded by the tree width. So the strategy is that given a triangulation of M, we would like to turn it into a Haggard splitting somehow with small genus. And when you are thinking of triangulations and Haggard splittings, there is this very well-known approach that you take a That you take a, what we call now a canonical handle decomposition associated with a triangulation. For each tetrahedron, you take a zero handle, for each face gluing, you take a one handle, for edges you take two handles, and for vertices of your triangulation, you take three handles. And if you split them, the zero handles and the one handles on one hand, and the two handles and the three handles on the other hand, then you get the Hagard splitting. Splitting. The problem is that if you started with a triangulation that has n tetrahedra, then the genus of this splitting will be n plus 1, and this is too large. So how can we somehow incorporate into this counting or construction also the tree width of the dual graph of the triangulation T? And the answer is by a generalized tier. Answer is via generalized Hygard splittings. So now here is a second attempt. So yes, so first we started, we may start with a triangulation that reaches this optimum. And there is a result from the theory of communication networks that whenever you have a graph of small tree width, then you can consider a particular kind of graph. Consider a particular kind of layout that has low congestion. I will not be able to define now what this precisely means, but essentially it's a tree-like layout of your graph where your vertices go to leaves of the tree and none of these edges in the layout are used too many times. Too many times. And this low congestion layout gives us a template for a generalized Tigard splitting where if we follow up on the construction, it turns out that we can carry it out in such a way that the genera of the thick levels are all bounded above by 18 times the tree width of the Doragraph plus 1. Now we can apply on this. Now we can apply on this generalized Saga splitting the Charlemagne-Thompson theory by bringing it into thin position. And in the very last step, we appeal to the assumption of being a non-Harkan manifold. And that gives us the conclusion that this thin generalized Haggard splitting must be a classical Haggard splitting, because we are in a non-Haken manifold. Hacking manifold. And I think my time is up. So here in theorem 5, what I would like to say is that the starting point is, of course, a thick-thin decomposition, which is then turned into a generalized Hagard splitting. And here, the key ingredient for keeping Ingredient for keeping the genera of the thick levels under control is the work of Kobaya-Schindrik. And then this generalized Hagard splitting can be amalgamated into a classical Hagard splitting, which has genus still bounded in terms of the volume, and then that can be turned into a triangulation by the machinery of Jacob and Rubinstein. And so my time. And so, my time is up, so I think I'll stop here. Thank you very much for your attention. Well, are there any questions to the speaker? No? I would love to hear more about the definition of free width. You said you had a slide on that. Sure. Well, so yes, so the definition of tree-width goes through what is called the 3-decomposition. So here I have an example of a graph G and I'd like to construct a 3D composition of it first. So what is that? A 3D composition A 3D composition of a graph consists of two things. So, first, you have to take a tree, and the tree will have some vertices, which are called bags. And what you would like to do is you would like to assign each vertex to one or more bags. Following three criteria. So, first, you would like to make sure that each vertex of your original graph is placed into at least one of these bags. So, this is how the bags look like. The second that you would like to make sure that each edge is covered by a bag. And if you look at this decomposition, you see that. You see that for each edge there is a monochromatic bag that covers it, so that's also satisfied. And the third condition is a bit more tricky. If you take, if you single out the vertex of your original graph, then what you would like to have is that those bags that contain that vertex of your original graph, they spread. Original graph, they span a connected subtree in T. So, of course, it might be a single bag, but essentially this is what you would like to have. And then the tree width of a graph, so first of all, the width of the decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus one, and the tree width of the graph is the minimum of this. The minimum of this quantity over all 3D compositions. And this turns out to be very useful in the analysis of algorithms in general, but as we have also seen at the beginning, it can also be exploited in the context of computational three-manifold topology. Well, we'll listen to our speaker again. Again, thank you. Uh, we're gonna start in a minute. Uh, just a statement. So, you can stop sharing screen and
