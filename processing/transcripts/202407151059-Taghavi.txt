Welcome to the second session of this workshop and public sharing on Alex Hanson's goal. And welcome first talk now is by Sayyid Mohammed Palabi and you see the title here. So please over to yours. Thank you very much, Chairman. Hello everyone, I'm very pleased to be here. My name is Edmund Otarabi. I'm a professor at the University of Laval. I would like to thank first the organizer. I would like to thank first the organizers of this wonderful event. The title of my talk is Rheological and Geological Interactions in Viscoblastic Fluid Flow Transport Groove Channels, which is the work of my PhD student, former PhD student Jose Rahmani, who is now hosting the Spirit Free Gaur and my current PhD student, Aguil Jolai. This work has been supported by many funding agencies, including the Canada Researcher. Normally, Normally in our lab we do experiments and modeling, but for the purpose of this workshop I will be presenting only modeling works. So considering the context of the workshop on personal media, boundary overall sleep in person media can occur due to the heterogeneity of the person structures or other factors. Examples include the purse media with rough walls, sleep regimes, sleep effects at this solid fluid. At the solid fluid interface, slip boundary, or liquid transport through nanoscale personia. So, considering this context, in this fundamental presentation that I will give to you, we will focus on a specific type of heterogeneity of the system, which is grooved channels. So, we consider a channel with grooved balls. And we will focus on a specific type of slip boundary, which is coming due to the superhard of a. Coming due to the superhydrophobic surfaces. So, with this, this is the outline of the presentation. I will provide an introduction, then talk about the methodology of our work, numerical methodology, results, and conclusion. And in the introduction section, I will talk about in the surface materials. So, Emma introduced these, just a little bit reiterate. Then, I will talk about superhydrophobic surfaces, and then I will provide a literature overview. So, tooth-based assembly is large. Tooth-paste, cinnamon slurry, chocolate, blood, hair gel are all examples of scoplastic or yield-stressed materials. Such materials are characterized by a unique property called the yield stress. So below which the material behaves as a solid and above which it behaves as a viscous liquid, as demonstrated in the constitutive Lincoln constitutive equation, the classical sort of equation. An example of An example of this behavior can be seen in the simple plain poison flow of a pink handful, where you can observe the middle unyielded plug zone and the region where the flow is basically yielded, and we have a normal boundary conditions in this classical configuration. So, in general, surfaces can be divided into hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. Hydrophobic surfaces Hydrophobic surfaces repel liquid while superhydrophobic surfaces are superior in repealing liquid due to the formation of the gas liquid interface on these surfaces. In fact, macro and nano-pertrusions on superhadrophic surfaces allow air to be trapped on these surfaces, reducing the direct contact between the liquid and solid. Patterned groovy superhydrophic surfaces can be created using longitudinal, oblique, and transverse configuration. Transverse configuration. For example, in the optic configuration, the applied pressure gradient in the system makes an angle of theta with the groove direction. So, this would be the case that I consider now. In terms of the literature of this, the literature is vast in terms of fluid flows on superhydrophic surfaces. These have been studied using experimental measurements, semi-linear modeling, and numerical simulations. In terms of the experiments, experiments have relied on flow rate measurements, laser. Flow rate measurements, laser-based velocity capturing. On the other hand, semi-analytical solutions have worked with perturbation, or in the classical sense, perturbation theory, and Fourier expansions and linear stability analysis. And numerical simulations consider finite element, finite volume, molecular diffusion, and Lattice-Foltzmann methods to analyze these fluids. However, most of these works that you see here have considered only Niotonian fluids, but to some extent. Newtonian fluids, or to some extent, shear thin materials, while the interaction of physical plastic materials has a non-Newtonian flow. Superhardi-flux surfaces have received less attention and this motivates our current work and in what I will present before something else in the analytical modeling and a numerical simulation of such people. For those who are interested to know that sort of what is being done these days in the field in terms of the literature of The field, in terms of the literature of the field, a lot of people are working on superhuman surfaces. For example, Crowdie has been developing analytical expressions for the curvature and curve meniscus. Yariv has done works on the singular units of superharatolic surfaces and atlas transfer shear flows. Schinocher has worked on the local slip legs as well as liquid-infused surfaces, which is a counterpart to superhalf surfaces. Mac Halo has considered composite surfaces. Considered composite surfaces, porous surfaces. Kyrt has considered heat transfer in these types of flows as well as parallel regions. Hodes has done works on analytical expressions for the slip lengths on superhydrophic surfaces, has considered also slowly varying the meniscus curvature, and Papa Giorgio has considered the linear instability and shear thinning method of these flows. So, with this sort of introduction, let's go to our methodology. Let's go to our methodology of our work. As I said, it's going to be purely numerical. I will talk about the problem setting and the equations of motion. Then I will introduce three types of solutions: semi-analytical type solution, then a full CFD solution, and then a stability analysis. So in terms of the problem setting, you can see a schematic configuration of our geometry of consideration, which is a plain Poisali Winkham channel flow. Poiseli Bingham channel flow with a lower basically superhard of the bulb, as you can see schematically here. So in this configuration, we have the widths of the groove, which is delta, we have L, which is the period of the groove, and we assume air to be trapped inside these cavities, we assume the L to be to have a flat sort of interface, and we assume the air to be pinned at the grooved edges. Grooved edges. In terms of the liquid interface, we consider a partial slip edge on the superhardrophobic sort of bulk, and we consider basically for an optic flow configuration where theta is the angle between the applied pressure gradient and the group direction, we will have a stream, basically a secondary flow stream perpendicular to the applied pressure gradient in the H prime direction due to the anisotropic stick diagrams. The equations of motions in dimensionless folds are summarized here. We can see the continuity equation, the momentum balance equation, general form. We will work with the Bingham constitutive model, which allows us to focus on the effect of the DNS via the Bingham number. Navier sliplaw takes care of the liquid interface dynamics, and this basically results in several dimensions numbers that govern the flows. Numbers that govern the flow system. As you are familiar with, the Reynolds number, we have Wingham number. Wingham number is the ratio between the yield stress to the characteristic viscous stress of the system. We have the slip number, small b, which is basically relating the shear stress at the interface, at the L equal interface to the slip velocity at these interfaces. We have L, which is the groove periodicity length, which is the ratio of groove. Is the ratio of groove period to the half-channel height? We have phi, which is the area fraction. We divide the widths of the groove, the groove period density lengths, and we have theta, the groove orientation angle, as I explained. So in this context, sorry, in this formulation, we will have L as the dimensionless parameters in the system, which can define two types of channel for our. Define two types of channel for our configuration. Large values of L correspond to a thin channel, and the small values of L correspond to basically a thick channel. So we will work with these dimensionless numbers in this presentation. So the first solution that I will present will be the semi-analytical type solution. And I'm going to present it in a general form without going through the details. Of course, the details of this can be found in our publication. Can be found in our publications. For example, in terms of the, and this is very classical, in terms of the steps, we perturb the momentum balance equations about the no-slip condition. For example, for the thick channel, we rely on the, we define a small parameter of the system, which is the inverse of the superhardener fluid ball wave number, and correspondingly re-escale the perturbation equations. Assuming periodicity in step three, we rely on the Fourier series expansions of the perturbation steam function. Of the perturbation stream function and velocity, leading to two coupled ODEs for these, which we can basically solve considering the exponential form of the solution for the stream-wise, sorry, for the stream function and velocity, while applying the boundary conditions, which is the mostly boundary conditions at the liquid air interface, zero perturbation velocity at the lower yield surface, and the zero strain rate magnitude at the lower yield surface. And then at the end, we apply the sticky. And then at the end we apply the stick slip conditions at the super hydrophobic wall and find coefficients that are unknown via solving the system of linear equations. So this was the first solution. The second solution that is more complete and to have to compare with our similar analytical solution would be a CFD solution, which is a finite body of method that was implemented via simple and principle algorithms in open Algorithms in OPEM for the viscopelastic modeling, we rely on the Papanostasia regularization model and we consider the channel for which the mesh is refined towards the superharden fluid wall as well as it is refined towards the good edges of the interface. So a narrow sleep as I explained also for the semantical solution takes care of the liquid air interface and no sleep condition basically is accounted for at the liquid solid Accounted for at the liquid solid interface as well as the upper wall, and we consider basically the cyclic conditions at the rear and front patches as well as the left and right patches in our system. So, this was the second solution. As a third type of solution analysis, we develop a linear stability analysis for a specific case where the sleep area fraction phi goes to one. So, this is also a classical approach in terms of what we conduct. We conducted linear perturbations of the movement. We conducted linear perturbations of the motion equations. We developed an eigenvalue problem and then solved the system by a chain-shaped collocation method, resulting in two types of solutions, a modal static analysis, which gives us, which can be used to capture the least stable and eigenvalue, and a non-modal static analysis, which we can use to find the energy growth of the perturbations in terms of the eigenfunctions. So with these, let's go to the results section. Please let's go to the results section. I will talk about some velocity and perturbation field, effective slip lengths, unwieldless zones, regime classifications, the effect of groove misalignment, and stability. So let's look at the velocity profiles via semi-altrical and CFD results for a thick channel and a transverse flow. In the corner of each slide, I will put a marker if the channel is thick or thin in the corner, and then what is the groove orientation? What is the groove orientation? For example, here we have a transverse groove orientation. What we can observe is a good comparison between the dots, which are the CFP results, and the lines that are basically semi-identical solution. And what we observe is that the change in the velocity profile is basically dominant near the groove edges, and this slip velocity actually increases by increasing the B the slip number, small B. B, the slip number, small B, or capital B, which was the pink hot number, so increasing the slip number, or the Bingham number results in having a larger slip velocity at the liquid A injections. But this is probably both. So, in terms of the slip velocity profiles, using again semi-oltical and CFT results, in the left panel, we are looking at the effect of the Reynolds number and sleep number. By increasing the sleep number, what we observe is that the sleep velocities are increasing. Observe is that the sleep velocities are increasing as expected. You have more sleep, you're going to have more sleep velocity, basically. On the other hand, by increasing the Reynolds number, what we observe is that the sleep velocities actually are decreasing a little bit and they become asymmetric due to basically the convexity. In the right panel, I'm showing the effect of L and P. So by increasing phi, which is the slip area of fraction, we observe that the slip velocity is The steel velocity is increasing. So, if we have a wider interface on the superhardophobic ball, the steep velocity is increasing. And if we are increasing L, which is basically making the channel thinner, again the steel velocities are increased. So let's look at the Cartesian velocity field. We have some analytical solutions. So in the right side, we are showing the effect of increasing the Ping Han number. The effect of increasing the Bingham number. By increasing the Bingham number, what we observe is that the wall-induced perturbations are increasing and actually they grow towards the unwielded basically surface of the center channel. And by increasing the Reynolds number, on the other hand, we see that the volume disease perturbations are decreasing and they become asymmetric, as I mentioned also before. In terms of the average sleep velocity, so these are really. Of the average slip velocity, so this is obviously sort of showing how on average the flow behaves in terms of the slip velocities. We see that both components of the sleep velocities increase with increasing the sleep number, and also by increasing phi, which was basically the sleep area fraction, both components are also increasing. And interestingly, the approach towards the homogeneous sleep condition as the value of phi is going to the critical value of In the lower basic panels, the color bars are showing the W prime, which is the average slip velocity in the Z prime direction, and the dashed lines are showing the U prime, which is the average slip velocities in the X prime direction. What we observe is that by variations of theta and phi, we see a non-monotonic effect of these quantities on the U prime, the average steel velocity in the X prime. The average steel velocity in the x prime direction showing that the secondary flow motion is maximized at an intermediate values of these LCV quantities. On the other hand, or dimensionless numbers, on the other hand, by increasing the L, which making the channel thinner, we observe that the U prime divergence velocity in the exponent is decreasing, meaning that if you are making a channel thinner, that the secondary uh flow motion um basically is diminishing. Basically, it is diminishing due to the confinement that you are creating. In terms of the effective sleep lengths, the normal component and the shear components are shown in this slide. We see that the normal component is always maximum at theta equal to zero, which corresponds to the longitudinal flow. And on the other hand, we see that the shear component is always maximum at an intermediate value of theta. And by increasing the slip number, And by increasing the slip number and the pink hot number, we observe that this maximum, the theta that corresponds to this maximum, deviates from 45 degrees. But for a Newtonian corresponding Newtonian fluid, this maximum always occurs at the 45 degrees angle orientation of the group. In terms of the contours of the velocity and unyielded plug zones, in terms of the CFD results, we are showing, for example, here I'm Showing, for example, here I'm showing the gray zones, which are the unyielded zone at the center of the channel. What we observe is that by increasing the slip number, the deformations in the basically these center plugs are increasing and they are eventually blowing due to the wall-induced perturbations due to the superhardoffing ball. By increasing the Bingham number from up to bottom, we see that the center plug remains unbroken, but it becomes highly wavy close to the superhardofing ball. Way close to the superhard of a grid ball that is the lower ball. And if we keep increasing the Bing Han number, what we observe is that if we focus at the superhardoflip ball at the interface of the liquid at the air-liquid interface, we observe the formation of another plot that has a sort of a fox-headed shape that we call a superhyperfluid wall plot. So it's the secondary plot in this system. This system. So, this allows us to basically provide a regime classification based on the appearance. So, whether we have the center plug breakage, first of all, or we have a center plug that is not broken, and or a super hard football plug that appears or is absent. So, four regimes in total can be defeated. So, if we can plot these in a plane of the slip number and the L groupers. L group per se length for the thick and thin channel limits. We observed that at small values of L for thick channels, we have a transition between a regime where you have a no-slip, sorry, no superhard of a wall plug to a regime where you have a super hyperfocus wall plug. So, in both of these cases, the center plug will remain unbroken. On the other hand, for the thin channel limit, we can see a transition between all of See a transition between all of these regimes from a regime where you have no subhadavib wall plug to a regime where the center plug is broken to eventually a regime where the center plug is broken but you have a subhadafi wall plug. You have a center plug is basically due to the wall intuitive perturbations, it becomes broken, but if you focus at the subhavi wall plug, you see basically a plug at that interface. So we are currently also So we are currently also extending the works that I mentioned to two superhardened basic walls as schematically shown. And the aim is to see or analyze the effect of misalignment on this configuration. So for example, a typical example of these results are presented here. Here I'm showing on the top panel the streamwise perturbation velocity and from left to right the misalignment is increasing. So here is no misalignment. So, here is no misalignment, and then on the right side, complete misalignment of the grooves of the lower and upper balls. And what we observe is that by small, even a small misalignment, we observe that the streamwise perturbation velocity field becomes asymmetric, although it remains large at the liquid interface, and the asymmetry is increasing. But if you have a complete misalignment, A complete misalignment again, symmetry is achieved. The same goes for the center plot. So, if you have a small misalignment, the center plug is broken, the deformation continues to increase by increasing the misalignment, but again, symmetry is achieved at the center plot when the misalignment is maximum, but the large deformations persist. In terms of the cross-flow perturbation velocity field, we can see that these have large. We can see that these have large values at the basically sides of the channel, at the groove edges, and they increase by increasing the misalignment and they grow towards their channel set. If we analyze the perturbation velocity orientation angle, we see that they are oriented towards the liquid interface, and by increasing the misalignment, they increase towards the channel center. And in the channel center, they have comparable values. Values in terms of the cross-flow perturbation velocity and stream-wise perturbation velocity. So this corresponds to large perturbation velocity orientation. And we are also basically extending the work to analyze this in terms of an unsteady motion, how the center plug is being broken. So this is a preliminary result that I asked my student to send me for this thought. So we are going to look Talk. So, we are going to look at how exactly basically the center plug is being broken in a time-dependent flow. The third solution that I introduced was the stability analysis. So, here are the results for those. So, a stability picture in terms of the modal and non-modal linear stability analysis, we can see in terms of the modal stability analysis, we can plot the spectrum of eigenvalues for the no-slip control. Eigen values for the no sleep condition, streamwise sleep condition, and sorry, span wise, pure spanwise sleep condition, and pure streamwise sleep condition. And interestingly, what we can observe is a new mode of instability for the pure spanwise sleep. And this mode of instability actually occurs for small values of stream-wise wave number and large values of spanwise wave numbers. So, if we look at the corresponding isosurfaces of The corresponding isosurfaces of the contributions of the spanwise perturbation velocity in the perturbation kinetic energy, and compared to the case of the noise slip. And spanwise slip, we observed that these have large values near the wall, which basically justifies the unstable configuration. On the other hand, if we analyze the non-model stability analysis and plot the transient energy growth of the perturbation, we see that this maximum is the. Perturbation: We see that this maximum is decreasing by increasing this streamwise skip, and correspondingly, this basically shows the stabilization effect of the streamwise skip in this configuration. So I don't know how much time I have. Seven minutes? Okay. So to conclude, we studied the plain Poiselli pink hump flow of a fluid on a superhalophobic groove. On a superhydrophobic groovy wall. So, in terms of most of the presentations, I showed the results on one superhydrophobic wall, but we are extending also the results to superhydrophobic walls as we show some examples for. We considered longitudinal transfers and obligat flow configurations in clipping and inertial flow conditions. We developed semi-analytical and CFD results as well as stability analysis. We found good agreement between all of these. We found increasing the ring-hop number generally results in the growth of the Has results in the growth of the perturbation field, but increasing the Reynolds number diminishes it and results in hindering the perturbation field. And we predicted this formation of the sub-Hadafuye wall plot at a critical slip number, and we classified the regime correspondingly based on the appearance or absence of the Super Hadoop wall plot. And we explored the new and stable mode for the standardized sleep conditions at the minute of fee going to. Of fee going to Y. So, what I presented has been published in seven or eight papers, mostly in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Journal of Internal Eight Mechanics, and also recent submission to Physical Review Fluids. So, I would be happy to answer any questions. Thank you. Thanks very much for the talk. A couple of questions.
