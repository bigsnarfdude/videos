But I want to talk about the local aspect of ASAS theory. So that is its role as a local classification theorem of representations of periodic classical groups. So I want to let F denotes always denote a finite extension of QP in my talk. has been so far firstly local long-land correspondence is conjectural still conjectural in general but so far there are a lot of results so this has been established for Been established for various groups. I think the first breakthrough is high status work for GLN, and the others theory covers the case of the causes with classical sympathetic special orthogonal groups. For special osoga groups. And they are really important results for specific groups. But it's also possible to try to construct local long-term correspondence by specifying the class of representations instead of specifying groups. So there are also a lot of results for some specific class of representations. And so let me also add via various approaches here. Here, the result for specific representations, so typically I want to mean in this talk, classus result for some special class of superclassial representations, so-called toral. Representations, so-called total supercaspia representations. So the point here is: depending on the approach for constructing the local longness correspondence, I mean, the construction is really defined, so depends on each approach. So it's really natural to ask whether if we pick two of those approaches, it's natural to ask whether Reserve results, different constructions give rise to exactly the same correspondence or not. And so, concerning this question, let me first state the following result. This is my joint work with Pokemon. This is my joint work with Fokimoto, which was published in 2021. We proved that actually for let me first suppose that the P is not equal to 2, then we show Paris Taylor's local Language correspondence is the same as Calesa's one. For vigorous bulk hospital representations from GLN so California construction of local long-range correspondence is given for Long-range correspondence is given for so-called regular supercascar representations. So, in order to compare two constructions, we have to work in the intersection of those how to say yeah intersection of those works. So, in this case, we we think about the regular superhospitals of GLN and today's main result is Main result is in some sense, it's a continuation to this result in GLN case. But here, let me assume that G is symplectic or special orthogonal group, R which is quasi-split. And in this case, let me assume that P is sufficiently large. So, this is something explicit, which can be the assumption which can be explicated, but I don't explain in detail. So, my result is RSARS correspondence and the coles correspondence. Color fast correspondence 0.5 for all super casual representations. So what I want to do first is to explain or maybe say just a few words about the uh what uh torrent's Berka Sphere representations are. Supercostable representations are. So, firstly, let me assume that G is a tamely ni-fider connected with a factor group. Defined over F. But eventually we will focus on the case of GLN or quasi-specific classical group. So the total superclassical representations are defined by based on use theory, which was explained by Jessica. So let me use the word tame supercast spell representations. So this is a class of supercast spell representations obtained by so-called use construction. So in his paper published in 2001, he formed some very explicit procedure to create a lot of supercast files. Create a lot of superclassical representations, and so his construction is given by considering the so-called u-data, which I will say more about later. And so, rigorous Bakaski representation is a subclass of times of Bakaspia. Is a subclass of times of Baccaspia representations, and the total Baccaspia representations are further smaller class of representations. And so, in order to say a few words about Torres Focusbar representations, let me just say something about what your data means. Ah, okay. So in general, your data consists of maybe this depends on a formulation, but my formulation is: I want to follow the formulation of Hakim Munahan. So U datatum consists of the following four objects. Maybe this. Maybe this is different to Yesica's formulation. But anyway, let me briefly explain what these objects are. Now, firstly, this G, G O is a sequence of subgroups whose members are. Whose members are so-called tame-levi subgroups. Maybe I should say tame-twisted Leby subgroups. So these are subgroups of G which are F-rational and also become Lebesgue subgroup over timely line-friend extension. And this phi is a sequence of characters. Of characters of each GI characters of GI are satisfying a certain technical condition called genericity. And the third one, third one is a point of buriotics building of G0. And the last one. And the last one, pi minus one, is a depth zero supercaspial representation of the smallest one contained in this 10 label subgroups, subgroup sequence. So, roughly speaking, the idea of use construction is starting from this depth zero superconductor representation of G0, we extend. G0, we extend in some sense to our superclassial representation of the next step inductively by using this given data. Or also we can say that we construct types of each level inductively. And so the totality of the obtained supercaspial representation is defined by We find the intermusable value they don't. So we say a U datum is total if firstly this sequence of the fame levy subgroups. Sequence of the fame levy subgroups are just consists of two groups. And the first one, so in this case, S is G0, and this is a timely verified and elliptic maximum velocity G and G one is equal to G. So this means the induction inductive process involved in. The process involved in use construction of a spell representation just finishes by a single step. And also at the same time, because this is G0, because G0 is Taurus, let me first say this one. So in this case, the sequence of cars. So in this case, the sequence of characters should consist of two characters. But by definition of value data, we see the second component must be a trivial character. And so in this case, pi minus one, which is a depth zero superconductor representation, is a character of s. So it can be absorbed in this character QC of S. capital Q C R S. So this means for total u data actually the corresponding use times per caspel representation is parameterized by only by this data. So a timely 95 elliptic maximum towards G and a generic character of S, a character of S which is generic in G okay. So let me write a pi sub x C for the corresponding torus superhospital representation. And I don't explain anything more about the construction of total supercastical representation. So instead, next let me talk about how to associate About how to associate a parameter to the such as the Boga SPL representation. So, namely, the construction of the local language performance. Yes, exactly. Yeah. In fact, the idea of idea of constructing the associated L parameter is really simple. So, firstly, by using the local long-run correspondence for tori, this means S in this case, we can get L parameter associated to this character. So, let me write. Character. So let me write a phi C for this L parameter. The idea here is so simple. So if we can find an L embedding of this L group into that of G, then by composing it to this L parameter, we can upgrade this to an L parameter of G. However, it's not so easy to find such an embedding because, for example, when G is For example, when G is split, the Gala action on G hat is trivial. However, here we want to think about especially elliptic maximum tolerance of G. So the Gala action on S is typically highly non-trivial. So it's really a non-trivial task to define a well-defined homomorphism from this semi-direct product group to that for G. However, so there is a machinery to construct such an Machinery to construct such an AMB. So it's the theory of Langrans and Shelf stud. So, what they found is that if we have a so-called a set of chi data, I don't explain the definition of a chi data, but anyway, so this is so something related to some additional data related to the root system of S. The root system of S in G. So this is the root system. So the point, so again, the point here is so here S is an elliptic maximum towards. So it can have a really non-trivial color auction. So here we regard this set of root system as a finite set equipped with a really non-trivial color auction. And if we can find an additional Can find an additional data for this finite set equipped with a curl action called set of chi data. Then there is a uniform way to construct an embedding from LS to LG. So this is what is explained in the paper of Langand and Schefstand on the definition of transfer factor. Transfer factor. So, what Kalesa did is to find a way to construct a set of chi data in a uniform way, so by using the information of this generic character X of S. And so the construction of this set of chi data is one of the most really subtle. A really subtlest point in class construction of LLC, but let me just regard it as a black box. So, the idea of constructing a parameter itself is really simple. A depth, yeah, yeah, yeah. So actually, I didn't explain anything about constraints on the u datum, but the point is, so when we consider toral u datum, the depth of this character of s must be positive. Let's say R. And in that case, Say R. And in that case, the depth of this resulting supercoasphere representation is again given by R. Okay, so this is a construction of Caresa's local Ramanuques. Canesa's local Ranglands correspondence for total supercospi representations. And what I want to think about today is how to show the L pockets. So actually, here I just explained how to attach an L parameter to each torus pocket spell representation. And so in college of And so in Calessa's paper, he treated more generally regular supocasical representations. And of course, it could happen that two inequivalent regular supercastical representation give rise to the same L parameter. So this means this construction gives rise to a non-trivial L pocket structure. So in Calesa's paper, he also investigated the internal structure of a pocket. Bump pocket. But anyway, so what I want to do is to show that Calesus L pockets satisfy the twisted endoscopic character relation. This is because, as I explained in As explained in Alan Sibia's talk in this morning, twisted endoscopic character relation is nothing but the characterization of Arthur's local Rangan's correspondence. So if we can check this, then we can conclude that actually Carassus construction is exactly the same as Arthur's one. So next, let me talk about the setting of the twisted endoscopy. So, this is also explained in Aran Sibia's talk, but let me briefly review it. So, firstly, we consider a general linear group, let's say G, equipped with an involution given by, let's say, J transpose inverse, J inverse. J inverse. Here, J is an ant diagonal matrix like this. And for convenience, let me put G tilde to be the non-identity component of the semi-direct product group of G and it's a finite group generated by. It's a finite group generated by theta. So this part is, of course, of the order 2. And let's say H is an endoscopic group of G, G, and theta. So you may think of H as a for example simple economic group or a special orthogonal group. For a special orthogonal group. And the picture is like this. So, firstly, so here now I'm trying to explain the twisted endoscopic calculation. We first take an L parameter of H. By the way, in Aran CBS talk, G was used for class. G was used for classical group and H was G N. But so here notation is swapped. So be careful. So firstly, we take an L parameter for H and let me assume that this is tempered. Then by definition of an endoscopic group, we have an embedding of L H into L G. So by composing this with a given L parameter, we can get an L parameter for G. For G. So by applying the local Rangans correspondence for both group G and H, we get two L pockets. The first one is for G and the second one is for H. And because now we are assuming that G is G L N, this pocket for G must be a single tone. So let me write pi for the unique length of this single tone. If all the unique impact is single to my pocket, so so this is a pocket. Okay, so now let me write down the twisted endoscopic characterization here. Maybe it's also possible to state. It's also possible to state it as a distribution form, but here I want to state it in a function form. So let's suppose that we have a delta. So this is an element of this twisted space of which is strongly regular semi-simple. Or also we may think of the Also, we may think of delta as an element of Gf, which is strongly, how to say, strongly state regular and state-semi-simple element if you follow the formalism of the Kotovich study. Anyway, the identity is as follows. Let me let me write down it first. Let me let me write down it first. So I will explain the symbols later soon. Okay. Okay, so this is a character identity. Character identity. So firstly, this theta of pi h denotes the highest general character of the pi h. So it's a function defined on the regular semi-simple locus of HF. And the sum on the right-hand side is taken over stable conjugacy gases of the rational elements of H. The rational elements of H, which are norms of delta in the sense of twisted endoscopy. And the left-hand side, here I put the symbol pi tilde, but symbol tilde on pi. So because this is intended to express that this is an extension of pi to the this twisted group. But anyway, so this is something variant of usual Herschel character. Of usual high shanger character called twisted character. So basically, everything is already explained by Alan Sevia. So, because pi is constructed by the lifting from h, so it's uh it's guaranteed that pi is a status stable. So, in such a situation, we can define the Yeah, theta twisted character pi. And finally, this delta gamma delta gamma delta is some constant so-called transfer factor, which is a really delicate and subtle correction term necessary for formulating this character identity. Character identity. So, this is the identity which I want to prove for collectors total supercast VL buckets. And so, actually, my strategy is really simple. So, what I did is to just imitate Carlesa's proof in the standard setting. Setting. So, the important fact here is that in Kalessa's paper, he also checked that his construction indeed satisfy the untwisted version of this character identity. So, the character identity for standard and scopy. He checked this. So what I did is to just imitate his proof in the twisted setting. So for this reason, next I want to talk about the sketch of Caves' proof in the standard setting. In the standard setting. So, because his result is for general connected reductive group, which is 10-minute Wi-Fi, let me again temporarily Temporarily let G denote a temporary unified connected with active group. And let's say we have a total supercospa representation. Of G of depth, let's say R, which is positive. So what I want to explain here is how to so let so please suppose that this atoral supercaspe representation is a member of a given L packet for G. So we want to check that the standard Check that the standard version of this endoscopic character identity is satisfied by the L pocket for G and so the L pocket for H. So please furthermore assume that the L pocket of G containing this representation is coming from H. No, no, no. I should call. Should yeah, I should go there. Wait, wait, I am so confused which blackboard I should erase next. Maybe I did this one. I'm supposed. Can I use this one? Because I have never swapped blackboard in this way for okay. And the key ingredient of the Calesa's proof of the standard endoscopy characterization is a really explicit character formula for those time supercasp representations established by Adra, Debaker, and SPITE. So I want to write down it next. Write down it next. And in order to explain that, so let's take an elliptic regular semi-simple element, maybe strongly regular semi-simple element from G of F. So here, because I'm talking about the proof in the case of standard endoscopy, so this delta is not twisted. And also, because we have so-called Because we have so-called elliptic inner product for supercasp representations, or more generally, elliptic representations. For our purpose, it's enough to check that the character identity is satisfied for any elliptic regular sensitivial element. So, this is a harmless assumption. And the point of Adora de Baker Spice character formula is that so we first take its product decomposition. Decomposition called a normal approximation. This is a product decomposition of delta having a lot of nice properties. And so, maybe if you know the notion of the topological Jordan decomposition, you can think. Topological Jordan decomposition, you can simply think of this as a generalization of topological Jordan decomposition. So delta greater than R means the depth of this element is greater than or equal to r. So this precisely speaking, this means because delta is regular semi-simple, it belongs to a unique maximum towards g. So we can think about its root value. And so this means any root value belongs. any a root of value belongs to a root of value of this part belongs to like like one one to p to r and the same is true for this shallower part and so as in the case of the topological jodan decomposition one of the most important properties of this decomposition is that they commute each other Is that they commute each other, and moreover, we have the following thing if we put J to be the connected centralizer of this shallower part, then so this deeper part belongs to the identity component of this centralizer. So, deeper part belongs to J. So, this is a point. Yes, so the point is both of them are semi-simple in the sense of algebraic groups. So yeah, here we are really think of a topological Jordan decomposition. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So now let me write down the explicit formula of the Baccala Spice. The character of the torus Poca representation at this element delta is expressed in the following way. Uh so this competition. Condition to the condition to the city of the city of the city, so let me explain the symbols here. Explain the symbols here. Firstly, okay, so this index set is over the elements of this double quotient. And the condition is that, so here I put a g on the exponent of the left exponent of delta smaller than r. So the meaning of this is it is a conjugate. It is a conjugate by delta, sorry, by g so the condition is that the uh the conjugate of this uh shallower part by a g belongs to s. So yeah, so this because goods is a character of s, so this symbol makes sense. And so let me just say epsilon j is something, so this is a rule. Something so this is a root of unity determined by J and epsilon of G conjugated delta shall smaller than R this is a sign determined by this conjugated element. I don't explain the precise description of these signs, but this is also something which can be explicated, and it's directly related to the sign character mentioned by Yessika in her talk. And finally, the last term. So, this is the Fourier transform. A Fourier transform of the orbital integral a Lya-Schebler orbital integral with respect to the element g conjugated X star. So here this X star will Here, this X star also appeared in Yeska's talk. Basically, this is an element of the algebra, a dual of the algebra of S which is determined by the character plural character C of S. Okay, so now by using this explicit character formula, we want to check that the standard endoscope character relation is satisfied for collector cell bucket. SSL pocket. So let's suppose that H is an endoscopic group of G and also let's suppose that we have an element gamma of H which is a norm of delta because the endoscopic side of the character identity is the sum of our norms. The point here is, so here we have a normal Have a normal approximation. So, if gamma is a norm of delta, then we can transfer this decomposition to the endoscopic side. And the point here is a really important thing in this formula is this Fourier transform of the algebra orbital integral, because this is nothing but. Because this is nothing but the Lie algebra version of the character of irreducible admissible representations of groups. And actually, there is a Lie algebra analog of standard and scope characterization. It's a big result of Vargi-Pougé and Gau, and it enables us to relate this kind of Fourier transform of real algebra or bitter integrals between a G and its endoscopic group. But the point here is that this realgebra Is that this realge of orbital integral is not taken in the original group G, so it's taken in the descended group J. So this is defined to be the connected centralized of the shallower part. And the same thing also happens on the endoscopic side. So, the important point is by the theory of Langrans and shows that on descent of standard endoscopy, we know that this descended J H has an again a structure of standard endoscopy, endoscopy group of J. I say again. So, yeah, here. So, firstly, this is defined as a distribution, but by the theorem of Harish Chandra, it's represented by a locally element function. So, now we are thinking about, regard it as a function defined on the V algebra, and we are evaluating it as the log of delta greater than R. So, yeah, this is a long blanche chest of descent. Then, we can apply the various position transfer between these two descendant groups. The algebra version. So we can utilize it to compare the orbital integral part on G and also that on the endoscopic side. But so this doesn't complete the because we also have some really subtle part root of Root of unity or assign, so determined by the shallower part of a given element. So by combining all of this and also doing, let me just say, very subtle sign computation. Kalesa was able to show that his packet satisfies the standard endoscopic calculation. Copy characterization. So yeah, so I will imitate this picture in the twisted setting. Okay, so let's go back to the twisted setting where G is GLN equipped with an embolition theta and H is an H is an its endoscopic group. And as before, let's suppose that we have two buckets. And moreover, here we additionally assume that both of them consist of only of total supercast field representations. Let's say toral supercast. Toro focus field pockets, but in the sense of Khalesa. So firstly, if we try to imitate Khalesa's proof, we must think about the twisted version of Adora de Baker's formula. And it was formulated in terms of normal order approximation. So, we so our first task is to find a normal approximation of an element of this twisted space. And so, this is one of the most technical parts, but I want to just say so we can find some nice processes. Some nice product decomposition also in this setting. But really important point here is that, okay, let me use this blue chalk. The big difference between this twisted setting and the untwisted setting is that, so because delta is an element of this twisted space, both This twisted space, both of these two elements, how to say. It couldn't happen that both a part belongs to the twisted space, because if this shallower part and the deeper part, both of them are an element of G tilde, then the product belongs to the untwisted group, so G of F. So exactly one of them can be an element of a twisted space. And in this setting, actually, this deeper. In this setting, actually, this deeper part is an element of G of F, which is untwisted, and the shallower part is an element of G tilde. And moreover, as in the untwisted case, the following thing is true. The deeper part belongs to the connected centralizer of the shallower part. And by using this decomposition, basically, by tracking all of the proofs of Adra de Baker's bias formula, we can establish the following formula of the twisted character of a given toral supervocate representation. And I don't want to say. And I don't want to say much about the symbols in this formula, but I just want to emphasize that it's really parallel to the standard and the character formula in the standard setting. But this is because this is a formula for twisted character. Let me just put a tilde on. Tilda on everything for indicating that it is an invariant arising in the twisted character, except for this Leargebla orbital integral part. So I said the deeper part is no longer twisted. And moreover, this Lyon-Sheba orbital integral is taken in the group. Is taken in the group J. So this group is defined to be the connective centralizer of this twisted element, but it's taken in G. So this group is also no longer twisted. So at this point, we can have an expectation that maybe a similar approach works as in the standard setting. Maybe all Robbie Visas are concentrated on sport second. So, yeah, let's write again write the same picture as in the standard setting. So, here we have an endoscopic group H object filter. scopic group H of G tilde and we consider their descent with respect to the shallower part shallower part of the normal R approximations however the story is not so easy because in contrast to the standard setting this design Standard setting, this descended group may not have a structural standard endoscopic group of this group. However, so let's say this is J and J H. However, these two groups, J and J H, can be still related if we introduce one more additional notion. So further variant of the notion of standard endoscopy correlating non-standard. Correlate non-stand non-standard endoscopy. So, by using that notion, these two groups can be related. So, this is what Varjebug found. So, what he found is that let's first take the simply connected cover of the derived subgroups of these groups. Then we can find another Another connected quasi-split connected reductive group, which is a standard endoscopic group of JSC, and such that it's simply connected to cobalt and JHSC form so-called non-standard endoscopic pair. And also, as in the standard case, Standard case for this non-standard and endoscopic pair, we have the realge of transfer theorem. So, both of them have realgelar transfer. This is a framework of the Polish project called a twisted endoscope is not so twisted. I can't pronounce this So basically so basically by appealing to this framework Framework. We can do the same thing as in the standard setting. So I finished my explanation here, but I want to just say in the standard case, so we had to do one more thing. It was about the comparison of this same part coming from the shallower parts of. Coming from the shallower parts of given elements. And actually, in the twisted setting, the comparing that sign component is much more complicated. So basically, the same strategy works in this setting if we can complete a very, very subtle sign computation. And yeah, so this is the outline of the proof of character identity in the case of GLN and classical groups. But let me say a few more words about this sign computation. So originally, I wanted to get this character. Get this character identity in a more general setting. So, I mean, g is at least any quasi-spirit group, and theta is any involution. And actually, most computations of my yeah, most computation of what I did so far works in such a general setting, except for this sign comparison part. And so, the situation is like this. So, if we try to like this so if we try to compare the twisted character formula to that in the standard uh sorry so that on the character formula on the endoscopic side so eventually we arrived at a really so uh so mysterious constant which is given by the product of a various arithmetic constant and what i found is that at least in the case of gln we can show that that constant is in fact true That constant is, in fact, trivial. And so that constant is actually related to the root system of S in G, which is equipped, which is a finite set equipped with a Garo auction. So at least by noting this, actually, my result can be a bit more generalized. So actually, we can also show that the class. So, actually, we can also show that the Calesa's total supercussible pockets satisfy the twisted endoscopic character relation in the following setting. So, G is quasi-split, and the theta is involutive, quasi-semi-simple, a pinning-preserving automorphism. Automorphism and this is an elliptic maximum autoverse, but a feature splits over a finitely a finite extension whose ramification index over f is odd. Let's say Euro So my impression so far is that the So, my computation of this assigned part somehow doesn't work well if we just regard as a set of root, if we regard the set of root just as a finite set with Galois action. However, in fact, there are not so many cases of twisted endoscopy satisfying these conditions. For example, if we assume that the Dinkin diagram of G is connected, then we only have the possibility. Then we only have the possibilities that like G's of A N or D N or E E 6, I think. And actually, the main theorem of Verjebuget's work is also established by really case-by-case argument. So if you look at his book, then you can find that chapter 14 untwisted case, and chapter 15, the case of AN and with involved data, and chapter 16, the case of D4 with trialid. As a case of default, with trial ID. So, one possibility is that this computation makes sense only by such a case-by-case case computation based on the classification of twisted endoscopy. But yeah, so that's all I had so far. So, yeah, thank you so much.
