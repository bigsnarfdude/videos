Yes, and in fact, I'm not sure from where you are. Oh, you are from the UK now, speaking from the UK. Okay, so first I'd like to thank Anja for the invitation and for having organized the workshop in hybrid mode, because otherwise it would not have been able to attend. I'm going to cover a paper that came out in Science last year and was led by the group of Malcolm Bennett. Led by the group of Malcolm Bennett at the University of Nottingham. The first author was Bipin Pendy. And it's all about compaction in soil. So at Nottingham, they have this nice X-ray computer-assisted tomography system so they can visualize inside soils here. So here we have on the left a sample where you see grains and there's also pores that are the dark black regions and then there's also water which is the blue. And so the issue here is what is the importance of soil compaction? What is the importance of soil compaction for, for instance, crops and roots in general? So, on the left here is the case of, sorry, on the right is the case of wheat varieties where they've measured the root density and actually numbers per centimeter square. But anyway, the message here is that once you've gone below, let's say about 40 centimeters, then there are very few roots. Okay. And so this, of course, can be understood as basically the Is basically the water, the air, the nutrients are more in the surface than in depth, and particularly when the soil gets very compact, when it's down here in the 50 centimeter region, then the roots are not going to be able to benefit very much the environment. So, in fact, compaction has become a practical problem in a number of places, even in Europe. So, here in the bottom left, you have a plot on the left. So here in the bottom left, you have a plot on the left, which has been tilled, and on the right is a plot which is compact. And so this compactness is aggravated by the fact that machineries tend to be very heavy. And you can see in the plot on the right there that obviously plants do not like compact soils. So what does this compact soil do to individual roots? And so here we have on the left an imaging of these soil samples with in yellow the reconstructed root. Within yellow, the reconstructed root. In this case, this is a rice seedling. So on the left, we have a non-compact soil. So compactness is measured by the bulk density as grams per centimeter cubed. And on the figure next to that, you see that in the more compact soil, the root grows less. And here, this is 1.6 grams per centimeter cube. And you see, in fact, that they take these pots and they push, they compactify the They compactify the soil, and that leaves these characteristic sort of round surfaces. And you can say on the right there that, in fact, this is kind of a quantitative trait that is the greater the compactness of the soil, the slower the root growth occurs. So overall, you can say, well, what is preventing the root from penetrating the soil? Well, it could be mechanical impedance, but it could be also that if the root is smart. So that if the root is smart in some sense, it would know that it's better hedging its investment and putting more effort into exploring soil that is less compact. And so it would have maybe a program to turn off or to slow down root growth in regions which are too compact. So there has to be a way to sense soil compactness for that though. And so rather than taking sort of the biological path and showing you the different experiments until we converge to some kind of model. Until we converge to some kind of model. We're at a modeling conference here, so I'll just give you directly what the scenario or the model that we're proposing is. So you have these roots that are growing, and the tip of the root is producing ethylene, which then is released into the rhizosphere, into the soil. If the soil is non-compact, as on the left, the ethylene just is able to diffuse away, and so there's no local accumulation. In contrast, on the right, once the root is in a region which is rather compact, The root is in a region which is rather compact, the ethylene will not be able to diffuse away, and so that can trigger an adaptive response, okay, in particular growth arrest or slow growth. So the experiments that the group produced strongly suggests that in fact that there is this ethylene signal, which is going to be used by the root as an adaptive response to slow the growth. And you can do this even if there is no mechanical impedance. So the lead author is Bip and Penn. So, the lead author is Bip and Penny, as I mentioned, who's on the right here. And so, if you want to claim that ethylene detection is being responsible for the plant or the root able to slow the growth, what happens then, of course, in the mutants when you break that ability to sense ethylene. So on the left, schematically is the ethylene response pathway where you have a receptor, then you have intermediates, a cascade, until you have the transcriptional. You have the transcriptional activation of certain targets. So, on the left, we have a wild type behavior. And so, the root just goes down all the way to the bottom of the pot. And then again, at low density, the next plot shows the case of this ethylene-insensitive mutant ion2 in rice. Okay, so both cases in the uncompact soil behave perfectly identically and similarly. And similarly. But as soon as you have compact soil, then the wild type is going to adapt and slow down its root growth. Whereas the ethylene-insensitive mutant, it doesn't know that the soil is compact in a sense. And so it's just going to keep on growing. And so what we see here is that if you're insensitive to ethylene, you do not have this response to compactness. So this is conserved, at least in the case. So we have rice, which is a monocot, but it's also Which is a monocot, but it's also true in Aridopsis, which is a dicot. And if you look at the actual cells, what are they doing? Well, it turns out that the cells are in the presence of compact soil or elongating less and they're getting fatter. Okay, so that's whether you do the growth in the compact soil or whether you just expose them to ethylene. So ethylene is phenocopying what the compaction is doing to the root. So in both cases, Is doing to the root. So, in both cases, you get these fattenings and these less lower elongation of the epidermal cells in particular. So, it's also nice to know where this is happening in the root. So, they developed a GFP reporter for one of the proteins in the cascade here. So, we have on the left the control. So, in the absence of any ethylene, there's no response. That's fine. And as soon as you put in some amount of ethylene, in fact, in this amount. Some amount of ethylene. In fact, in this amount, it's in parts per million. So it seems like not much, but in fact, the system is very, very sensitive to ethylene. And so the whole system lights up quite significantly. So that was in the case where you just put ethylene. What happens now in a compact soil? Well, on the right, we see that in the presence of growth in a compact soil, in fact, there are a lot of cells that light up and respond to this compactness, and it's particularly true in the vascular chart. Particularly true in the vascular chart and in the elongation zone. So basically, you have that the ethylene is perceived by the root close to where the cells are precisely elongating. And so that can drive the growth arrest because of the change. So what does this compaction do? Well, intuitively, it's clear that what it does is it compresses things. So any sort of vacancies will become smaller. And you can make that quantitative by And you can make that quantitative by their facility, which does this x-ray imaging of soils. So on the top, we have non-compacted soil, which has a number of pores that are more or less large. And so the red regions are the ones which have the largest pores. And when you have compacted soil in contrast, basically all the pores become very small, as you might expect. You can also do an explicit measurement. So this was done by collaborators in the By collaborators in the Netherlands. So, what they did, their physicists or biophysicists, they constructed a system in which you have on one side a bottle of which you can inject ethylene, and you have in between the two bottles a soil sample, and you can put in different bulk densities. And so, the idea was to measure directly the diffusion of ethylene through this soil sample by detecting and measuring the concentrations of ethylene at the bottom bottle. Okay, so schematically. Bottle okay, so schematically they did this for several bulk densities, the bulk density of 1.1 grams per centimeter cube and 1.6. And what was interesting, of course, is that you see that the system does reach equilibrium for the case of low bulk densities, but at high bulk densities, in fact, the system just doesn't move. It's as if there's essentially no passage of ethylene through the sample. The sample is really resisting diffusion. So you can go back and sort of. Go back and sort of just fit those different kinetics to exponential curves. So the theory there is very simple, but it also works very nicely. And the key point at the end is that you end up being very sensitive to the bulk density. So if the bulk density changes by this amount here from 1.1 to 1.6, it doesn't feel like that much. But in fact, the result is that it really has a huge effect on the ethylene diffusion coefficient. So the diffusion coefficient goes. Coefficient. So the diffusion coefficient goes down quite dramatically between these two cases. So the smoking gun experiment is the one I prefer. And so the idea was that there are people who insist that mechanical resistance is the key to this inability of roots to penetrate soil that is compact. And so the idea was to separate here in a lab system the mechanical resistance and the gas diffusion. And the gas diffusion out of the root. So, what they did is they put some vacuum grease, which is used in vacuum pumps. And so, it doesn't let any gas and in particular ethylene diffuse through. So, you put this on the tip of the root and you ask, well, in the system, which is in fact a kind of a sample soil, which is very soft, so there's really no physical or mechanical resistance, is this going to affect then the? Is this going to affect then the growth rate? And so the conclusion is yes, indeed. They showed that it not only arrests the cells, but also leads to the same kind of ethylene signaling in the cells further up in the elongation zone. And so essentially, in a system which has essentially no mechanical resistance, but does have this signaling through the ethylene pathway that is basically being forced to accumulate near the tip of. Force to accumulate near the tip of the root, you have the phenotyping or phenocopying of the compact effect. Okay, so the conclusion is: besides the fact that compactness is a problem in agriculture, it seems then that root growth arrest is an adaptive response. The hormone ethylene, which is a gas, is used by the root tip to detect whether the soil is compact or not. If you disrupt that signaling, you can get mutants that will penetrate. You can get mutants that will penetrate highly compact soil. And of course, this is potentially of relevance for having crops with deeper roots. Okay. So, since Anja also asked for a number of questions, so I have some biological questions. I'm leaving them up here just for the recording, but let's focus on the last one, which is that root tips use ethylene sensing to, in particular, not only detect compact regions, but also avoid obstacles. Might it be a method? Obstacles, might it be a mechanism for root root avoidance? Okay, so what I'm proposing is to check this experimentally, if some experimentalists are interested, with a simpler system with the root growing in a cylindrical channel. So here is represented a channel and section. And so what you have is a source of ethylene. That ethylene is going to diffuse, but at the same time, the root is growing. So you have a moving surface problem. This is reminiscent of two problems that I'm Of two problems that I'm familiar with, which I worked on when I was still in physics, which is the diffusion of impurities during directual solidification when a crystal is forming, for instance, and also there's a similar thing called Sathman-Taylor viscous fingering, where you have a fluid which is being pushed by an air bubble. The air bubble is the part here in gray, and it gives rise to a channel with the air moving forward. Air moving forward at constant velocity in the steady state. Okay, so you can do the same thing in principle for this system. It's probably quite a bit of partial differential equations to solve to get a steady state. And this would allow you to get a profile of what the ethylene concentration is in this tube or in the cylinder as a function of, in particular, the diameter of the cylinder. So that will be potentially of interest. And what we know is that in And what we know is that in practice, then the ethylene concentration is going to slow the growth velocity of the root. So you have a coupled system. So, in fact, if you do the quantitative modeling of this, you'll end up with a self-consistent selection of what the gross velocity is. Okay, so you can expect that as you increase the amount of concentration around the tip of the root, its velocity will decrease. And so this will give you a coupling between these two partial differential equations. Differential equations. So, as possible applications, if you think of this cylinder as potentially having a diameter which you can adjust, what will happen is that when the cylinder is very large, the ethylene will be able to diffuse and never will reach very high concentrations. And so you'll just have the root tip that goes forward at its velocity very happily. But as the cylinder gets smaller, the diameter gets small. Sorry, I had this system. Sorry, I had this system, it's one over a cylinder diameter. If the cylinder is too narrow, then in fact, the root growth will be too slow, and in some sense, the ethylene will always catch up with it. And so you will have a discontinuity in the behavior of the root growth velocity. It will suddenly drop. And so you'll have a whole range of velocities, which will be, in fact, forbidden. So, but coming back to my question of the competition between roots, so the idea would be that. Roots. So the idea would be that just like in these physical systems, you can have a competition between the roots. And what we see is that there is, in some of these systems, a characteristic length scale. So basically the roots will repel on a certain length scale, which will depend on the diffusion of the ethylene. And so the question is, well, if you change the diffusion coefficient.
