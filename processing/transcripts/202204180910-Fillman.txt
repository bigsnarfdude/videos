Seems like we are recording. I'll also record here, just in case. So, welcome to the second talk of the conference today. It will be a talk by Jake Fillman from Texas State University. We'll talk about spectral properties of the unitary altmost massive operator. So, as I was doing for the first talk, if there's questions on the Questions on the chat? I can either relay them or you can just unmute yourself and ask it as it goes along. Jake, the floor is yours. Okay, thank you very much for the introduction. And thank you to the organizers for putting together the workshop and for inviting me to speak. So we saw some Schrodinger and Dirac operators in the first talk. And so in the course of this talk, I will introduce some other operators on the unitary side of things. On the unitary side of things, namely CMV operators and quantum walks. So these may be familiar or very familiar or not at all familiar to some of you. So I will introduce them in the course of the talk. Before we get started, I want to acknowledge my collaborators. So this talk will be a summary of two distinct works, one of them with Darren Ong and Zheng Hejeng from 2017, and the other more recent work from 2020. And the other more recent work from 2021 is with Darren Ong and Christopher Setzig. So, what I want to do to start off is to formulate an extremely general scenario and some objects that one might consider and some questions that one might ask. And then we will specialize this to a more specific scenario. So, an abstract quantum walk simply consists of a Hilbert. simply consists of a Hilbert space script H, a unitary operator which we'll call w for walk, and a unit vector psi, which I will alternately call the state of the system or the walker or the time evolution or something like that. So the object of interest here is the discrete time dynamical system given by iterating W on the initial vector H. So the natural kinds of questions you want to ask are Questions you want to ask are: What can you say about the dynamics? So, given your initial state of C and your unitary operator W, you want to study psi of L equals W to the L Psi, where L runs through the integers. That's sort of the natural indexing for time in this scenario. And this is intentionally very broad. You might ask, is the walker localized to a fixed region of space, or does the walker propagate to infinity? And if so, at what rate of speed, and so forth and so on. And so forth and so on. Does this depend on the choice of the initial walker, and so forth and so on? Naturally, this probably reminds one of problems from linear algebra, in which in calculating the power of a matrix, you don't actually perform L-iterated matrix multiplications, but rather you study the spectral problem. So, a very natural, closely related question. What can you say about the spectrum of your unitary operator W? Of course, it is unitary. Of course, it is unitary. The spectrum lives in the unit circle. What else can one say? And then a closely related question to this will be: what can one say about the spectral measures, which are given by integrating a function g of z against the spectral measure gives you exactly the inner product of psi against g of w of psi. So I want to give one very specific instance of this on the next slide with an apology to the experts for whom this is very familiar. The experts for whom this is very familiar. This is aimed at the students in the audience. I want to give at least one very concrete example that I can say just in a single slide. What is one instance in which one sees this interplay between, again, the dynamics given by the iteration of your unitary operator and the, say, the characteristics of the spectral measures. So suppose for the moment that your spectral measure mu psi is absolutely continuous. Measure mupsi is absolutely continuous, again with respect to the natural Lebesgue measure on the circle. In this scenario, one dynamical question you might ask yourself is, what is the probability after L time steps that you find yourself back in the initial state in which you started? So that's precisely given by the inner product modulus squared of psi, the initial state, with psi of L, the state at time L. The state at time L is naturally given by W to the L is naturally given by W to the L psi. And so, in view of how spectral measures are defined, this is simply the integral of z to the l against the spectral measure modulus squared. And this is now essentially a Fourier coefficient of an absolutely continuous measure. So this goes to zero as L goes to infinity by the Riemann-Lebesgue measure, by the Liemann, by the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma. So, what one observes here is a specific manifestation of Specific manifestation of a phenomenon, which is if you have some absolutely continuous spectrum, you tend to see an absence of recurrence for the walk. So, this is but one manifestation of connections between spectral measure, spectrum, and so on with the dynamical characteristics of unitary dynamics. So, of course, there are other and more precise things that one can say, and these are established in what is commonly called the rage theorem. So, what I want to do now is, this is a very general setting of discussing the iteration of unitary operator on some general Hilbert space. So what I now want to do is to focus in on a very particular family of unitary operators. So, these are going to be so-called generalized CMV matrices. So, what I want to do now is tell you what is a generalized CMV matrix. Tell you what is a generalized CMV matrix and then give you the first introduction to what we decided to call the unitary almost matthew operator. So, a generalized CMB matrix acting in L2 of C is a unitary matrix of this form. So, it has this repeating 4 by 2 block structure that you see here with coefficients alpha n and rho n, which should satisfy modulus squared summing to 1. One thing that I want to point out if you are Want to point out if you are familiar with the literature on C and B matrices, what does the word generalized here refer to? If you look closely, you will see that there are complex conjugates on the rows. So in standard usage, the row ends in a CMB matrix must be non-negative. So that's what is meant by generalized here. One is allowing complex-valued rows. And indeed, this is a completely central part of the work. We really have to allow. Work. We really have to allow the row ends to be complex. That introduces a few wrinkles along the way. So where do CMV matrices come from? So they come from orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. So you take a measure on the unit circle with infinite support, and then you perform the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure to get a basis. Procedure to get a basis of rational functions for L2 of that measure, and then you represent multiplication by Z in that space. So that gives you actually half-line CMV matrices, again with all real rows. So the unitary almost Matthew operator is a particular instance of this given by choosing the alphas and rows in the following manner. So the even alphas and rows. The even alphas and rows are given by lambda times cosine and lambda times sine plus i times the square root 1 minus lambda 2 squared. And the odds are simply given by alpha is the square root of 1 minus lambda 1 squared. And rho 2n plus 1 is lambda 1. So this is now a quasi-periodic family indexed by theta and phi and lambda 1 and lambda 2. So these lambda j's, they run from 0 to 1. Lambda j's, they run from zero to one, the thetas run through the circle, and the phi should be chosen to be irrational. So on the one hand, you notice I'm saying this is the first introduction. I decided to give this one first because this is the easiest one to put on a single slide, and I wanted to have the operator definition come as soon in the talk as possible. So, this is what the unitary almost matthew operator is. And of course, we are mathematicians. Course, we are mathematicians, and so one is welcome to define whatever operator in whatever manner one wishes to, but you can be forgiven for at this point thinking that this is not very well motivated. I've just written down some coefficients for some operator. So, what I will say is that there are other ways of thinking about this, which I will discuss later in the talk, and which are more illuminating. So, just to reiterate, the unitary. So, just to reiterate, the unitary almost Matthew operator is a generalized C and B matrix with cosine Verblensky coefficients and with these particular complexified row n's. So in particular, when you are looking at this, there are some natural questions you might ask. For instance, why is the quasi-periodicity only on the even coefficients and not on the odd ones? And so forth and so on. Some natural mathematical questions are: how does the How does the interplay of the Lambda j's, so lambda one and lambda two, how does this affect the spectral theory of the operator? So before we do that, let's just make some very general observations about this. So, first of all, here is an argument that's very familiar to the experts on quasi-periodic operators. If you notice that phi is a Notice that is irrational. That means that the translation by phi on the circle is minimal, and the association sending theta to E of theta is strongly continuous. And so that means the spectrum is actually independent of theta. So there's some uniform set which only depends on lambda one and lambda two and phi, which gives the spectrum for all theta. And again, here irrationality of phi is important. And so going back to these questions at the And so, going back to these questions at the beginning, we would like to know things about the spectrum. We would like to know things about this set sigma, lambda 1, lambda 2, phi, and we would like to know about the spectral measures of this unitary operator. So quickly, let's just discuss some edge cases. If you set one of the lambdas equal to zero, you get a more trivial operator. Trivial operator, which nevertheless is going to shed some light on some results that we'll see here in a minute. So, in particular, let's see what happens when you set lambda one equal to zero. So, if you look closely, when lambda one is zero, that means all of the odd rows vanish. So, here are two odd rows, here are two more odd rows. And so, if you look closely, you see exactly these blocks here vanish. Blocks here vanish, and so these things that mediate interactions between the four by two blocks go away. And so, in this case, when lambda one is zero, the matrix just becomes a direct sum of two by two blocks. And so, then you can calculate the spectrum and spectral type very trivially. It's a direct sum of two by two matrices. On the other hand, when lambda two is zero, the quasi-periodicity on the even terms disappears completely. Disappears completely, and then one simply has a periodic operator. One can study this with flow K theory. And in both settings, one can calculate the spectrum exactly. It's just this right here. So this is just a nice little calculation you can do. And it's just that. It's the set of points in the circle with real part absolute value less than or equal to lambda. And furthermore, by what we just said, when we set lambda two equal to zero, we get pure AC spectrum. And when we set lambda one equal to zero, We set lambda one equal to zero, we have pure point spectrum. So you notice the difference between the ranges on lambdas, of course, w0 zero has pure point spectrum. So this second behavior wins when they're both zero. So you also see here a very primitive sort of precursor to something that will come later on in a more general way, which is Obri duality for these operators, namely the lambda. The lambda zero case has pure AC spectrum, and the zero lambda case has pure point spectrum, and moreover, the spectra are the same. So, this already gives a hint, if not a real proof, that duality for these operators happens by exchanging these lambda ones and lambda twos. So, this already, I hope, gives a little bit more motivation for why things are set up in the manner that they are. One more. One more boundary case. If phi is rational, then this unitary operator always has a C-spectrum, unless you get one of these trivial cases that leads to a direct sum of two by two blocks. So as already mentioned, if lambda one is zero, you again get a direct sum of two by two blocks. Or if lambda one is two and theta is rational with respect to phi, one again gets a direct sum of blocks. Sum of blocks. This time, not 2 by 2, this time the block length is longer, but still it's the same phenomenon. You have a decoupling of your operator and you get compactly supported eigenfunctions. So having dealt with the kind of trivial cases, let me formulate first the main result. So this is our theorem with Chris Sedzik and Darren Ong. And on. So you consider lambda one and lambda two between zero and one. And then we can say for almost every frequency and almost every phase. So this AE is Lebesgue. So for Lebesgue, almost every phi and theta, the spectral type of this operator is pure point when lambda one is less than lambda two. It's singular continuous when lambda one and lambda two are equal. And it's absolutely continuous when lambda one is larger than lambda two. So, what this gives another manifestation of some reason why we feel like this is a unitary version of the almost Matthew operator in the sense that we are observing sort of a sharp phase transition in the spectral type as the competition between these two constants is altered. So, when lambda one is less than lambda two, this is exactly saying that the causing periodic part is dominant and MD1 observes localization. And indeed one observes localization. One other Jake, there's a question by yes. Yes. Hi. So you say for almost every fine kita. So do you have a society for ignited condition which goes with this almost every? So could I get someone close to the mic to repeat the question? I actually cannot hear the room very well. Do you have an explicit Do you have an explicit arithmetic condition for this almost every localization proof here is given by the method of Juan de Monic, which adapted the proof of organ and Golstein. So this gives a sort of non-explicit Diophantine condition. And then this was later after our paper came out, Han Yang showed that it holds for all diaphantine. Han Young showed that it holds for all diaphantine pie. Okay, thank you. So there is some competition between these lambda ones and lambda twos, and then there also the arithmetic of phi and theta also definitely comes into play. One thing I want to mention, so I mentioned Uh, one thing I want to mention. So, I mentioned there is a pair of papers. So, what did the 2017 paper study? It studied the case lambda one equals lambda two equals one. So the most extreme case. And so, in that one, we had purely singular continuous spectrum for almost every phi and theta when lambda one and lambda two are both one. So, the most of these statements can be refined in various regimes. Refined in various regimes. So, for instance, when lambda one equals lambda two, the spectrum is always a Cantor set of zero Lebesgue measure. So, in particular, this singular continuous statement holds not only for almost every phi and theta. The singular half of the singular continuous statement holds for all irrational phi, and then all theta, again, by minimality, as mentioned before. The singular continuous half holds for all irrational phi and all but counted with many phi, and in fact, Countable many phi. And in fact, for the experts, it's exactly the set of theta that you think. It's the exceptional, the countable exceptional set is precisely the set of theta, which are rational with respect to phi. And then as discussed before, the localization holds by the method of Long Demonic, which adapted Borgen and Goldstein's localization technique and hence gives a full measure set of phi and theta, but not an explicit description. But not an explicit description. And an explicit description was later given by Fan Young, who showed that localization holds for all Diophantine Phi and non-resonant thetas. Do you understand correctly that this singular continuity not holding for this countable humanity is just you don't know, right? That's correct. We don't know. So we looked at some of the works which showed that one Of the works which showed that one can actually have eigenfunctions on the set of resonant thetas, and the methods did not work in our setting, so it's currently unknown. We don't know whether or not the singular continuity extends to all theta or whether there could actually be some localized eigenfunctions there. So, a few general comments about. So, a few general comments about the model. So, as mentioned before, the case lambda 1, lambda 2 equals 1. This was studied by us with Darren and Jungha in 2017 and was studied a bit earlier in the early 2010s by some folks in the physics literature. So there are papers by Linden, Katsura, Shikano. We actually came to the model in sort of a different way. So we originally just sort of were studying quantum blocks and we wanted to think what is the simplest. To think what is the simplest quasi-periodic quantum walk that we could write down, and it was precisely that model. We started trying to study it, and only after we had worked on it for some time did we see that, oh, this is something that is studied in the physics literature as well. So, as mentioned before, whenever lambda 2 is less than 1, this is not a genuine CMB matrix because the row n's are not necessarily real and non-negative. And this is something. Non-negative. And this is sometimes not a big deal, and sometimes it is a big deal. Nevertheless, if you want something to be a genuine CMV matrix with positive rows, you can always achieve this with a diagonal unitary. So you can always conjugate this E lambda 1, lambda 2, phi theta to a genuine CMV matrix via a diagonal unitary. You just look at the phases on your rows, and then you inductively construct this diagonal operator with the Construct this diagonal operator with these phases. However, you still don't always want to do this. And the reason for that is often one wants to leverage the quasi-periodicity of the coefficients. And if you conjugate by this diagonal to get rid of the phases on the rows, you will destroy the quasi-periodicity of the alphas in general. So I'm not saying you can never do this. I'm just saying that there are things to be aware of. So there are some things. Of. So there are some things which are obviously preserved under diagonal unitaries and some things which are not. And so one just has to pay attention to these things and to not just immediately reduce to the genuine CMB setting reflexively. So I promised a more intuitive perspective, and I want to give that now. So I want to give a second introduction to the operator, which takes a few slides, but which then Few slides, but which then motivates why the operator is chosen in the manner that it is. So we are looking at a Hilbert space, and so we're specifically going to look at the Hilbert space L2Z tensor C2, which it'll be helpful to think of that as just a direct sum of a Z's worth of C2s. So this has an orthonormal basis, delta N plus minus, delta N is the standard basis of L2, E plus minus is the standard basis of C2. Of C2. So, first one defines a weighted shift, S lambda. So, the way to think about this is S lambda acts on delta N plus minus. So, we think of E plus and E minus as internal spin variables. So, I'll often call delta N plus minus the state with spin up at site N, and delta N minus the state with spin down at site N. So, what does S lambda do? It takes the mass at N. It takes the mass at n and it shifts the spin up part to the right and the spin down part to the left. It spins an amount of lambda in that direction, and the remainder of the mass stays at site in and gets its spin flipped. So this is a sort of conditional shift. The spin up part tends to go to the right, the spin down part tends to go to the left. My video is mirrored, so my hands went the wrong way for all of you, but that's the general idea. And then on the other And then, on the other hand, you have one other piece. Given a sequence of coins, which are two by two unitary operators, the corresponding coin operator is simply the direct sum of the Qns. So you take a sequence Qn of U2C matrices and form the direct sum. That gives a coin operator. And the corresponding quantum walk is simply the product of these two things, S times Q. So, the idea here is: if you are thinking in terms of analogies with Schrödinger operators, since most of the audience is very familiar with Schrödinger operators, you should think of S lambda as functioning like the kinetic part of the operator, since this is the part of the walk which actually moves mass from one site to the next. Whereas Q, the coin operator, and the coins, you should think of this as the landscape or the external environment of obstacles with which the walker. Obstacles with which the walker is interacting. And I actually want to make that a bit more precise in some coming slides because I want you to see what I mean when I say that the coins can be thought of not just as transition probabilities, but as obstacles with which the walker interacts. So in your intuition, you can think Sλ is functioning sort of like the Laplacian for Schrodinger operators, and Q is functioning sort of like the potential energy. Okay, so here's a simple but important example. Suppose one of the Q's is off-diagonal, so say Q0. So by that I mean that the diagonal entries of Q0 vanish. So Q just has unimodular entries in the 1, 2, and 2, 1 positions. So it's not hard to check that the following subspaces are invariant. The following subspaces are invariant. So you take the space with all spins to the right of zero plus spin down at zero. You take all spins to the left of zero and spin up at zero. These will be invariant subspaces. So anything that starts to the right of zero cannot cross through zero to the left. And anything that starts to the left of zero cannot cross through zero to the right. So you have this impermeable barrier that the walker cannot penetrate. More generally, if you're More generally, if you have a whole sequence of off-diagonal matrices, the same thing happens at every location where you place an off-diagonal point. You get a direct sum of finite blocks, and so you have this manifested by some invariant subspaces. So you take spin down at nk, spin up at nk plus one, and everything in between, and this will be an invariant subspace. So in this case, your walk is completely localized into a finite block. Localized into a finite block. So, what this makes precise is some idea that the Q's can represent obstacles with which your particle or your walker interacts. So, namely, since Q12, whenever that is equal to 1, that represents an impenetrable barrier. So, I just put some function here that gives you infinity when q12 is 1. Infinity when q12 is 1 and 0 when q12 is 0, you think of the off-diagonal elements of the coins as representing some sort of heights of barriers. So one other example, which illustrates something important. So suppose for the moment that lambda is one and every qn is the identity, the two by two identity. So this you should think of as sort of the quantum walk analog of just Of as sort of the quantum walk analog of just the free Laplace. So instead of v equal to zero, qn equal to the identity is sort of something which doesn't impede the walker at all. And you'll see why exactly. So if every qn is a two by two identity, then of course the direct sum of them is just the identity on the full Hilbert space. So your walk is just the shift. So if you start with an initial state delta zero plus, it simply goes to one plus. It simply goes to 1 plus, then 2 plus, then 3 plus, then 4 plus, and so forth and so on. So the walker propagates at a constant speed without impediment. And so this is a very, very explicit version of ballistic motion. And it's also not hard to check. It's a fun little exercise you can do. The spectral measure of this pair is Lebesgue measure on the unit circle. So you have an AC spectral measure, you have ballistic motion, and this is not special just to the Is not special just to the constant point equal to one case, it's just a lot easier to see. So, this certainly persists for the periodic case, subject to the restriction that we, if you want to have something that propagates freely, you can't have these off-diagonal guys. So if the qn sequence, the sequence of coins is periodic, one has two possibilities. Either some qn is off-diagonal, and then because of periodicity, you have infinitely many off-diagonal. Infinitely many off-diagonal points, then the walk has pure point spectrum and every walker is compactly localized in a finite region. Or none of them are off-diagonal, and then you can use bloke theory. You can show that the W has purely AC spectrum and the walkers propagate ballistically. So, the thing you sort of want to The thing you sort of want to take away from this is how to understand the interaction between the coins and the walker. And the way to think about this is that when the coin is close to the identity, you are in the regime of small potentials. And when the coin is close to an off-diagonal, then you are in the regime of large potentials, roughly speaking. So at this point, what I want to do is. So, at this point, what I want to do now is to circle back and give you the second introduction to the unitary almost Matthew operator, which, as promised, is more grounded in the quantum walk world. So all of this is a reminder from a few slides ago. So the underlying Hilbert space is L2Z tensor C2. Your orthonormal basis, delta N plus minus, your shift is S lambda, and your coins are Q. So in this space, So, in this space, you can realize the unitary almost Matthew operator as a quantum walk with the following coins. So, w lambda 1 lambda 2 phi theta is shift with constant lambda 1 and coins q lambda 1 q lambda 2 phi theta given by this unitary matrix here. So, rather than focusing too much on the explicit form of things, it's more instructive to just try to think about the competition between Lambda 1 and Lambda 2. If Lambda 1 is large, then the behavior of the shift dominates. And if Lambda 2 is large relative to Lambda 1, then this behavior dominates. Another way to think about this is if Lambda 2 is 0. Another way to think about this is if lambda 2 is 0, now you see the coin is simply i minus i 0, 0. And so you are in the purely diagonal case, which as we saw in the previous slide is something that leads to ballistic propagation. There's a typo. There should be a minus in front of that, lambda 2. Is lambda 2 prime the square root of 1 minus lambda 2 square? Ah. Minus lambda 2 squared? Ah, yes, yes, absolutely. So we will encounter lots of square root of 1 minus something squared. So yes, those will all be denoted with a prime. Thank you. Okay, so the unitary almost matthew operator comes. It arises as a quantum walk with suitable quasi-periodic coins. And so now, And so now I hope it's a little bit clear why the lambda one equals lambda two case equals one was the first one that was studied, because this really is the most natural choice of quasi-periodic coins. So if lambda two is one, then this just becomes the rotation by in phi plus theta matrix. So one last thing that I will say on this is that the first version of this This is that the first version of this talk had a third introduction to the unitary almost matthew operator, but that was a bit excessive and so it was cut for time. But let me just say in words, you can still think, okay, that makes a little bit more sense. But where did we get the idea to choose these coins with these sort of complexified diagonals? So, this in turn comes from a two-dimensional quantum walk in a Two-dimensional quantum walk in a magnetic field, which we then project to one dimension with a suitable gauge transformation. And so in the two-dimensional picture, lambda one is your hopping amplitude in the vertical direction, and lambda two represents the hopping in the horizontal direction. And so that's another reason why this sort of parallels the theory of the almost matthew operator. Okay, so let's talk just a little bit about some of the ideas that. bit about some of the ideas that go into the proofs. So naturally you want to study the properties of w via the eigenvalue equations. W psi equals z times psi. So you set this up and then you want to solve it and then you do the canonical thing. So you can solve this with a transfer matrix co-cycle which I'll call AZ. In principle it depends on lambda one and lambda two but to keep the notation from getting too cluttered let me just suppress that. Just suppress that. And so, this is going to be an important point. All we can say at the beginning is that these matrices are invertible. So, they're not in SL, they don't have determinant one, and they're not real valued. So here is the cocycle. The important thing is not to write this down and memorize it. I'm just showing this to you so you can see what it is. And what do I mean when I say that this combinations of sines and cosines encodes? And cosines encodes solutions to this difference equation. I mean that if psi satisfies this, so w psi equals z psi, then if you know the spin up component of psi at n and the spin down component at n minus 1, then evaluating this matrix at theta plus n phi propagates that solution data and gives you the solution, the spin up component at n plus 1 and the spin down component at n. So naturally, you consider So, naturally, you consider the skew product of rotation by phi and this co-cycle map, which simply translates by phi in the first component and then multiplies by az of x in the second component. And then you chain these together with iterates. So, of course, the idea is if AZX moves you one step forward in the difference equation, then AZX, AZX plus phi, et cetera, through AZX plus n minus 1. Azx plus n minus one theta, moving forward n steps in the difference equation. So naturally, one has this co-cycle map, one has these iterates, and then one wants to study the Lyapunov exponent. So L of Z is the limit as n goes to infinity of 1 over n, the average of log. The average of log of norm az n of x averaged over x. So this isn't the only thing that you need to study to study the spectral properties and the properties of solutions, but it's certainly one of the primary objects. And so what we showed using global theory of one-frequency co-cycles is that for every Z in the spectrum, Is that for every z in the spectrum, l of z is precisely the max of zero and this expression involving lambda two and lambda one? So you should think of this very much as sort of being the manifestation of the formula for the usual almost Matthew operator, which says that the Laphanov exponent on the spectrum is the maximum of zero and log of the coupling constant, suitably normalized. And so here you see the Lepanov exponent either vanishes on the spectrum, or if lambda 2 is bigger than Lambda 1, so exactly in this regime that we claimed had localization, when lambda 2 is bigger than lambda 1, of course, this expression in brackets is bigger than 1, and hence the log is positive. And so you have uniform positivity of the Lyapunov exponent. So, what I want to do is give just a few ideas for the proofs and what is actually needed to tackle these objects. So, as I mentioned, something that's very helpful in this setting is the theory, the global theory of analytic SL2R cocycles. However, it's a calculation you can do, the determinant of AZX. Do the determinant of azx, you can just do this by hand. It's this ratio, it's this rational function, and this is not identically one, so it's not a unimodular co-cycle. So this isn't a huge deal because one can, and we did, show that this determinant nevertheless has an analytic square root. So you can renormalize to something which is determinant one and analytic with an analytic extension to a Analytic with an analytic extension to a strip. And in fact, you need a little bit more than that. So if you now view this as a function x, where x really is allowed to run through the whole complex plane, you see that this has zeros of the numerator and denominator at certain values of the imaginary part. And so, really, in fact, what we want to show and did show is that for all other fixed imaginary parts, one has an Parts, one has an analytic square root. So that's really what one needs to kind of apply the arguments in the form that we used them. Okay, still doesn't belong to SL2R, but at least we can have determinant one now. So if you are familiar at all with CMV matrices, then you know that the transfer matrices associated with CMV matrix don't belong to SL2R, they belong to SE11. To SE11, which is conjugate to SL2R in a canonical fashion. However, you can check again that not only does this AZX renormalize not belong to SL2, it doesn't belong to SU11 either. However, here is a calculation which you are welcome to check. So you define this unitary matrix U of lambda, which is u of lambda, which is this particular combination of one plus or minus square root, sorry, square root of one plus or minus lambdas. So this is unitary. And you can check that if you conjugate AZX by this unitary matrix, then you get the following. And what you observe is every entry of this matrix is indeed real. So we call this AZR. This is sort of the SAZR, this is sort of the real version of this co-cycle. And so this is an analytic SL2R co-cycle. So anything that we want to apply from the sort of general theory of analytic SL2R co-cycles, this is relevant to this object now. So again, this is not a trivial calculation by any means. A trivial calculation by any means, but one can do it. You really just have to write it all down. So, let me briefly summarize some aspects of Avila's global theory. So, if you have an analytic function from the circle into SL2R, which has an analytic extension to a strip, you can consider for each epsilon the complexified cocycle with imaginary part epsilon. So, B epsilon is really. epsilon. So b epsilon is really bx plus i epsilon. And then you consider l epsilon, the associated Lyapunov exponent. So one of Avila's many results is that this association from epsilon to L of epsilon is continuous, it's piecewise affine, and the slopes are 2 pi times, they're integer multiples of 2 pi. And so what that leads to is a classification of co-cycle. Is a classification of co-cycle behavior. So by Johnson's theorem, the spectrum of this operator is characterized precisely as the complement of the set of Z's in the unit circle for which the co-cycle is uniformly hyperbolic. So Z belongs to the spectrum if and only if it's in the unit circle and the co-cycle is not uniformly hyperbolic. So you have three possibilities. They're called supercritical. If the Lyapunov. They're called supercritical if the Lyapunov exponent is positive, subcritical if the Lyapunov exponent is zero and this persists in a strip, and critical otherwise. And so when we are discussing the Lyapunov exponent, that is really what we proved in our paper. So we showed that the cocycle is subcritical. is subcritical when lambda one is bigger than lambda two, critical when lambda one equals lambda two, and supercritical when lambda one is less than lambda two. So these correspond respectively to AC, SC, sorry, absolutely continuous, singular continuous, and pure point spectra. So how does one do this? I'll give you the quick bullet points. The strategy is an implementation of an earlier strategy. Implementation of an earlier strategy by Jidomir Skya and Marx for the so-called extended Harper's model. So, first, you again you pass to this complexified co-cycle with imaginary part epsilon. So, if you remember, this co-cycle has this denominator out in the front, and this becomes problematic in the next step when we want to pass to very large imaginary parts. So, the first step is to regularize, to remove these singularities, and get something which is analytical. Singularities and get something which is analytic everywhere. And now you look at epsilon large, and now you can sort of compute things exactly. And then you use Avila's global theory, namely this convexity and quantization of acceleration, to bring this information back to epsilon equals zero. And then you now have to pay the price for regularization in the beginning. You have to perform a suitable exact calculation to get rid of this regularizing factor. So, I want to show a picture of what the complexified Lyapunov exponents look like. So, lambda one less than two, this is the supercritical, critical, and subcritical cases. So, this is what, so the blue shows the Lyapunov exponent of the cocycle. The co-cycle, and the red shows the regularized. So, what you can see is the regularized co-cycles look like what ovulus global theory says they should. They are piecewise affine, continuous, and convex. You notice the blues are not convex. And precisely the point where convexity breaks, this is exactly where you have these singularities of the cocycle. So, again, the idea is to regularize, and then you can apply global theory for all epsilon to this BZ. And then you bring information about BZ to the origin. And then part of the exact calculation is simply to show that the Lapinov exponent of AZ is the same as that of BZ near epsilon equals to zero. And then once one has this, one can Once one has this, one can study the spectral type. But I really wanted to focus on the co-cycle because I really wanted to focus on just kind of one thing in the talk. So with that, I have said what I wanted to say. So thank you very much for your time and attention. Questions either from my audience or from the people in the room. So if there are questions in the room, just as usual, you have to speak up or have someone repeat it to the microphone. I guess I have a bit of a I I guess I have a a bit of a naive question in a way. This complexified the Apollo exponent is is the first uh time I see them appear in somewhere. What sort of is there some sort of intuitive description of the non-positive I'm not sure I understand the intuition behind this vibration of the yeah so I'm sorry could so could someone repeat the gist of the question I got that the gist is about complexified Lyapunov exponents but I didn't catch the rest I'm not sure is there some sort of intuition that we can have about the complexified version of the Lyapunov exponent in the same way as we have the usual intuition about the real version um Sure. So I think let me come back here to the definition of the Lyapunov exponent. So if one has a map, say AZ, from the circle into SL2C, then one can form iterates in this fashion and then calculate the Lyapunov exponents as shown here. So, I mean, the basic idea is you think. idea is you think of varying the imaginary part. You can envision this as sort of like a horizontal slice. So instead of considering a z n of x, you replace x by x plus i epsilon. And then you consider the behavior of these iterates and the Lyapunov exponent as epsilon varies. And so what Avila shows is that this behavior of not just the co-cycle itself, but the Lyapunov exponent as a function of Of exponent as a function of the imaginary part is exceedingly regular. It is piecewise affine, it's continuous, it's convex, and the slopes can only belong to 2π z. This was later generalized by Chitomirskaya and Marx, and then Abula Chitomirskaya Sadl to sort of basically any dimensional co-cycle you want with the proviso that in higher dimensions the slopes can belong to. belong to what is it 2π d over 2z something like that lana is here so she can correct me about that yeah it's actually a rational with denominator up to d yeah i do have a question what can you say about the case oh great question so that was something that i didn't uh expound on but one Uh, expound on, but one can definitely show. So, in the supercritical case, when lambda one is less than lambda two, so this expression is positive. So, what one can show is that if phi is Liouville with a Liouville constant less than this quantity, so less than the Lyapunov exponent, then one has singular continuous spectrum. Has singular continuous spectrum for all phi. Oh, do you mean that when you define this beta alpha and then you compare it to the Laud number sword as usual? Yes, exactly. So beta, so beta of phi is this limit of log of Qn plus one over Qn. Yeah. Yeah, so in the sort of regime where the Lyapunov exponent is larger than this. Of exponent is larger than this Liouville constant, the singular continuous spectrum persists. So, in particular, for the very Liouville numbers with Liouville constant infinity, the singular continuous spectrum holds for all irrational, sorry, for all theta and all coupling constants. Is there any critical one as in the case of the Ross Matrium? Sorry, can you say again? Is there any critical one? Is there any critical line, as in the case of the almost mature? So I would, I'm not sure which verb to use here. Suspect, expect. There is probably a critical line, and it's probably the one that one expects. So namely, beta equal to log of the Lyapunov exponent, or sorry, beta equal to Lyapunov exponent here. But it's not currently known. Currently known. Thanks. Do we have any other questions for Katie? Yes, in the Schulinger case, you sometimes have that you have a characterization with the Yapanov exponent and the spectrum. So here you have something like if you are in the spectrum, then you know something about the Yapanov exponent. So can you express the whole spectrum via the Yapanov exponent or not? Did you get the question, Jake? No, I didn't. I didn't even hear anyone talking then. So yeah, what was the question? I'm just talking about spectrum as well. So I'll not talk about this one. So there's a question by Zikric who's asking if you said that there's a characterization of the that there's a characterization of the of the spectrum of the economic exponent in terms of the spectrum as a set can you can you can you characterize the spectrum in terms of the economic spot as a set ah okay so let me know if i'm repeating the question wrong the question is can one characterize the spectrum in terms of the lyapunov exponent is that the question yeah okay yes uh so in the So, in the critical and subcritical cases, the spectrum is precisely the set on which the Lapinum exponent vanishes. And in the supercritical case, when lambda one is less than lambda two, the spectrum is precisely the set on which the Lyapunov exponent takes this value. So it's really an if and only if. So Z is in the spectrum if and only if L of Z equals this expression. Okay, thanks. Okay, thanks. Yeah, you're welcome. May I make a quick comment? There will be, first of all, thanks for the beautiful talk, but there will be several talks related to Lyapunov exponents of quasi-periodic co-cycles on Thursday and Friday. And actually, in some of them, some of the questions that have been asked about the significance and The significance and the nature of complexification, and also of characterization of the spectrum by Lapunov exponents will be actually answered in an interesting way in general. So, especially I want to advertise in this regard a talk by Tulin Rui. Yeah. So, pay attention to those if you are interested in that. Thanks. Thanks, yeah. Thank you. Thanks, uh, and I think that we can unless there's any other questions that I'm reading. Otherwise, I think we can thank Jake again for the nice talk.
