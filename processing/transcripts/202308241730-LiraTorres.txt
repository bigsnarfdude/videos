Realization of spectral triples on unital algebras. The work that I'm going to show it is joint work with my supervisor, Professor Shanmejit. And then this is the brief outline that I want to share. I want to say a little bit about the formulas that I understand for non-commutative geometry. Non-commutative geometry, a little bit of the formalism that I understand for the spectral triples. One example, and then finish. So let's start. So as someone said yesterday, this is enough for me. So I'm just going to assume that the space-time is not continuum. And then for I'm going to use or one, I'm going to think of non-commutative coordinate algebras as an effective way to describe it somehow. As an effective way to describe it somehow. I'm going to think I'm going to be working in unit star algebras over C only. I'm not working with sister algebras or something like that. I'm having a little bit of more general results in that sense. I'm going to assume a few things because I want to mimic what is happening in geometry. I'm going to call some maps like the map. Like the map that you are looking at there, which is going to be a linear map from the A to the one forms omega one that is going to have or is going to be obeying the Leibniz rule. So this map, whenever I have an algebra, I define it in a nice way in order to fulfill my purposes. And also, I am assuming that I'm working in differential graded algebra. I ask d squared to be zero and this is To be zero, and this is the relation that I'm going to have with the wedge and the d relation. So, recall that because I choose D in every algebra that I have, I have the freedom to choose D in a nice setting. This expression is going to change a little bit from algebra to algebra. Then I am, I need, I want to do some Riemannian geometry, so I need a metric. So, I'm going to understood as So I'm going to understood as a quantum generalized metric as an element of the one-form tensor over the algebra one form element such that it is bilinear and has an inverse map. If, I mean, when I construct this or when I recover this metric with these properties, then automatically I have that it satisfies to be central. So it conmutes with the elements of the algebra. With the limits of the algebra, and the wage of this is zero. Sorry. So, all these formulas that I have in here are, of course, even if not, of course, it is the formulas that my supervisor and Begs are having in a book a few years already. Then I want to extend what already my supervisor said at the morning, at the very, very early morning, that I am requiring to have a I am requiring to have a left and a right action. The action that I'm going to have is going to be seen as a bimodal connection. I mean, the connection that I'm having, it is a bimodal. And it has this relation. I have a definition that is more or less natural on the left. And the right, because I want to relate between each other, I need a map that allows me to do this. And it is going to be the generalized grading. So this element, whenever I recover, Whenever I recover, it is constructed in a way that it is uniquely determined or uniquely attached to the connection that I'm having. For some, when you're working with it, as you can see, it's kind of the flip map plus something else. So whenever you're working with a problem, sometimes it is nice to work with the most basic expression, but I mean, in order to be the most general possible, In order to be the most general possible, you should have to consider how it interacts with the elements of the algebra, the elements of the one forms, and of course, the interaction that it has with the connection. I'm going to just mention this very quickly, that when we have, I mean, I'm assuming that I'm having my one form to be a that it has a basis, then I am. Then I am assuming because of that, and as a consequence, I can define or I can have something that is a derivative that is basically just an expression of how my map D, my linear map D that is acting as a differential relates with the algebra and that is like just a linear combination. But I just want to say that it exists. Now, working on in the quantum Levy-Shivita connection, the definition. Connection. The definition that we're going to work is basically the left, it is the left. So I am asking, I'm requesting that this thing is torsion-free, therefore it's going to satisfy this relation. I didn't mention, but whenever I'm working with these elements, I do ask that the grading that I have somewhere that I don't see anymore, it's a list. I don't see anymore. It's a list of degree two. So I can have the expression of the Levita connection, at least, means the minimum that I can ask. And then I'm asking what is a metric compatibility. So because I'm choosing or I'm not choosing, I'm doing this in a kind of a bottom-up approach. I really need to be careful that whenever I introduce some element in here, it is compatible with all the settings that I use. It is compatible with all the settings that I already have, so that's why we have the metric compatibility. So, this is the stronger version. It's not always happening due to the algebras sometimes, the nature of them. I don't know that much, that many algebras to have a wise comment in here, but not always happens. When it doesn't happen, I keep asking for the torsion free. Asking for the torsion-free, but I'm going to have a relation that is weaker, that is the co-tortion-free. So, for the example, that we are going to see today, the solutions or the satisfying the QLC is not possible, but it is possible, I mean, without being trivial, but it is possible to have a little bit of more meat in the solution for the weak QLC. Okay, yeah, so then. So then now let's move to what I understand for geometric realization of the spectral triples. So in this case, I want to give kind of a recipe because the equations that are need, it is axiomatic, it's an axiomatic approach. So therefore, there are a lot of things that need to be satisfied and need to be coherent. And they are kind of ugly if you see it the first time. First time. If you have been working with the align cones approach, it's probably mimicking or resembling something because it is inspiring that. So I'm going to choose a coordinate algebra, possibly non-commutative, and that's the goal. I'm going to choose some kind of vector bundle that I'm going to specify a little bit later, what are really this apostrophe means. And I'm going to require a clip or action. Of course, that's kind of the way that we construct the definition of the Way that we construct the definition of the Dirac operator that forms or that belongs to the spectral triple definition. And of course, I want to have a connection related to this vector bundle, spinner bundle somehow. And then the definition that I'm going to use is going to be this. So basically, if we can recover, if we define correctly, coherently, the Clifford action, the connection by module X that I haven't said. By module S, that I haven't said that is a bimodal, but it is a bimodal, or I want it to be a bimodule. This is the definition that I'm going to have for the Dirac operator. And then we want to recover the spectral triples. So I'm going to say the definition or how I decode the actions from CONS, well, not my supervisor, but I follow the algebraic features. What of them are strictly algebraic? Strictly algebraic, what of them are strictly or somehow geometric? I'm going to say why geometric. And of course, then is the analysis part, which is inner product can generate in the Hilbert space to have the full picture of the spectral triples. So at this point, I want to say the construction. So I am kind of recapitulating somehow. I'm taking a unital algebra that is compatible with some star structure. Compatible with some star structure because I'm working, or I'm assuming that I'm working over the complex numbers. So the star structure has to be in there. I am not giving exactly how is the star structure compatible with each of the elements out of my remaining geometry, but there is a way to give it. It's in the book. And of course, I am having, or I am going to be asking that whatever is this S that is going to play the role of the spinner bundle, it is an A. The spinner bundle, it is an A by module. So just remember that this is kind of mimicking the thing. That's why it has apostrophes. I want it to behave in that way. I'm assuming in this approach that whatever is my one forms and whatever is my S spinner bundle, it has these selected dimensions. Now, the way that we do it in this way, and I didn't set Way and I didn't set too much in the Riemannian geometric Riemannian geometry. Is we set the dimension of the set of the one forms for the Lebesgue-Shibita connection, we have the definition of the algebra, we set the definition of D, and then we have several restrictions that allows to understand and to define explicitly who is the explicit form of this S1, S2, depending on the problem that we have. And that's why we repeat kind. And that's why we repeat kind of this idea, and we assume that we know exactly the dimension. We are basically making it fit. So then, so this is the ugly part. Depending on the eyes that you have, you probably look some beauty in here. It's up to you. But this is a resembling of the axioms of the Dirac operator from align cons. So we need a From align cons. So we need a clip for action that in this case is going to behave in this way. So I'm just saying that the interaction of this clip for action with the elements of my basis of E that were the ones of the spinner interact between each other with some kind of matrix multiplication of the two by two matrices. I am assuming that this is our matrices. Something very similar with the definition of the bimodal connection. Definition of the bimodal connection. I'm basically just giving linear expressions in terms of the basis, and then therefore, later I'm gonna try to decode what is exactly this expression according to the algebra that I'm taking or the restrictions that I have. And therefore, as we mentioned before, I mean, this is just another kind of connection. I need a rating in the framework that I'm working on. And the definition that I'm having is this one. Is this one? It is simplified, if you remember from the other one. But I mean, the basic thing is it's a flip map with some kind of matrix over there. And then for the definition of the spectra, the drag operator, we need a charge conjugation antilinear map that is going to behave this. So until this point, I want you to notice that they don't really interact. Notice that they don't really interact between each other. The matrices C, the matrices S, the matrices sigma, and the matrices J are kind of independent at this point. So therefore, when you are trying to solve this, you don't really have too much interaction between them. So we need more things. This thing is the reality condition, which is going to start to connect the notion that is given from the Given from the spin or the matrices related with the connection, the bimodal connection, and the antilinear map. And also, we need to try to make to mingle everything. And therefore, this antilinear map is very important. And I want it connected with the Cliff Raxion. So at this point, I am not taking, if you see, If you see, I'm not really taking into consideration at all my algebra and the structure that I already supposed to have, the Riemannian, the quantum Riemannian structure there. It is still kind of blank. I'm not using it yet. So I just to mention that this definition in the online cons version, if you see, I have some epsilons that I suppose to put in orange. Sorry if you don't see them, but. I'm sorry if you don't see them, but should be here. And this has a plus-minus permutation. And therefore, depending on the conjugation that we are going to have, this is at the end of the day a very big system of equation. So whatever is the combination that is giving me solution for this system, whatever is the algebra that I'm taking, it is going to be classified in the table of the dimension of the Dirac operator. And then just have that in mind. And then I want to say that there are cooperators in the axioms of aligned calls. There is an even another structure. So whenever you have or you need to use the map, what is this? Gamma, then your direct operator is going to be even. And it is keeping, I mean, this by module map, it is relating with whatever is already in the basic one to four. Oh, well, that's a nice numeration. Three, four, one, two, three, four numbers over there equations, axioms. And now, so what is the difference then with this, other than starting with an algebra that is unital, that it is star compatible from the beginning, is that I want to use the Riemannian geometry. I want to use the Riemannian geometry that exists already in the algebra that I'm working on, and somehow I haven't taken it. So there is an extra condition that I'm going to be imposing, that it is the covariance condition. So basically, I don't remember I put expression of the Levi-Shivita connection explicitly, but it should have this resemble of the crystal symbol form. Form. So, whenever you define it, it has something in terms of the basis with this resembling Christoffel symbol that it is related or it is giving you the information from the Levita, basically is the Levishivita connection symbol. And therefore, at the moment that we have this expression in here, we are relating. So, if we remember, it is the rating that. It is the braiding, the one that is related with the spinner, yes. And the C is the one, where is it? It's a cliff for action. So we are really relating and mixing the structure that we already have or we want to have in the DIRAC operator and the one that is from the Levi Shibita connection. Yes. I'm not able to grasp why you relate those kinds of Why do you relate those structures in this way, which is the principle? It's the coherence principle, but I know which sense. I don't think I understand it. So why it has exactly this shape, the equation? I don't remember. I should know, but I don't know at this moment. I can check and we talk it at some point. Yes, thank you. Great. Okay. Okay, so then the next thing that is also part I'm taking in account the Levi-Shibita connection is going to be the compatibility between the Cliff or Action and the set of two forms, which is given by this. So now. So now, before we continue, so if you see here, they are basically mixing everything together, but it is still, I mean, whenever you work with it, it is way too big, it is way too big to work with it. So when we are working, we usually, I mean, when we work, we usually fix something in the geometric conditions that we know that satisfies, for instance, the c's. Far is for instance the c matrices in here. The simple, the most basic example that solves that are the poly matrices. So with that, we start to simplify a little bit the problem and try to connect with the information that we have in here and try to get a solution of what is exactly the structure of each of these matrices and start to try to see if we see something inside of the algebra. Of the algebra. And then, so that will be the geometric and the algebraic part of the Dirac operator. And then we need to continue to complete it with an spectral triple thingy. So therefore, we need an inner product and we need to complete it somehow. So this is the way that we assume that we can complete it with mu is a measure in A measure, um, in it is a measure. Um, in the most simple case, you take the identity and that works, um, but a lot of work needs to be done, more complicated stuff can be done, but um that works so far, okay. Um, then, um, so once we have all the conditions, we can just put use the table that we have at some somewhere and then classify whatever we have. Somewhere and then classify whatever we have the solution as the dimension that we have in here. Or at least know if it's even or odd at first glance. So this is where it is going to be used. So that is the way that we construct from any algebra choosing the Dirac operator and the spectral triples. So we continue with one example. I hope this makes some sense. And I hope this makes some kind of sense. Okay, so we need first, so we want to arrive, we want to learn the Dirac operator. So first we need to know what is the Lebesgue connection. And with this formalism, this means we would need to understand the algebra, the relation with the map D. We need to understand the relation with the structure, the star structure, and we need to know how it relates with the grade. With the grading and make it everything compatible. So, in this case, if we choose a very simple example that is the non-commutative torus, we take the most basic definition where u b equals to e to the i theta v u, where theta is some irrational number that is multiple of 2 pi. And we have the star relation with the electron. Relation with the element of the basis that is going to be related in this way. And then we define who is d who is going to be playing the role, the exterior derivative, with the elements of the algebra that we are having. And of course, we are start to land in the one form. So the elements S1, S2 are going to start to appear. But then we should know how is the relation of this in a more explicit way within S1 and S2. S1 and S2. So in this case, basically you simplify or work in this equation that is in the third point, and then we make it self-adjoint in order to fit for the problem. And when you have this expression in this way, for this case, we have that this basis is central and also that satisfies the d2 dsi is zero, which is desirable. And then we understand. We understand whatever is the wedge or the maximum prolongation between the elements of the set of one forms. We have this relation. So that is well known. And then I just want to mention, as I mentioned when I was finishing the introduction of the Riemannian geometry, it is, I want to understand what is, how to describe the partial derivatives. Partial derivatives, I'm going to use it somewhere at some point. So the relation is going to be basically a linear combination or something for the elements of the algebra in terms of F. Now I choose F for some reason. It is going to work in the way that we already know. There's nothing interesting outlining in there. And then the next thing is we need a metric that satisfies the relations of B. satisfies the relations of the quantum metric, which is the relation that I put a long time ago that it has to satisfy with the problem given. This is the expression that will recover. Now in order for this, so this is quantum somewhere realization. So these things are real. And then Um and then uh so from these from this expression because I want this to be quantum symmetric and then it it it can be resembled or reorganized in this way um and then um in order for this to be invertible i didn't put some emphasis but for the definition of this for being a quantum metric we really need to have or to force or to recover the inverse so in this case because we have a general expression of the quantum metric is basically constants with Quantum metric is basically constants with the relations of the basis of the one form. Then I need to impose something, and the imposing by the definition of having an inverse being quantum symmetric tells me that the combination of C1, C2 cannot be equal to C3 square, whatever is the elements of Ci. I mean, all those Ci are intervals. I repeat myself to make sure. Make sure. Then, so that's that's the quantum metric that I need. So, I keep collecting things. Then I mentioned that I did not have a QLC for this problem, but I do have a weak QLC, which means that I'm going to have to have torsion and co-tortion compatibility. If you remember, that's nice. The explicit solution for this looks in this way. Looks in this way. And then I want this to be hold, I think, is equal to zero. And therefore, the relations and the combination that I have from the basis tells me that these are the solutions that I can have. And then I want to understand or want to declare my connection. And I just say that the braiding is. The rating is the most simple case, which is the flip map. So, at this point, we choose basically the flip map because it was already kind of big to compute. And I decided to start doing it by hand, a mistake. So then everything has to be evolved in mathematics, of course. But okay, we have this. The solution for this problem in the... In the complete version, the QLC, it is too simple, it is not useful, it doesn't give too much information to allow it to solve the system of the Levitic Vita, the spectral triples. And then now that we have all, so we have the connection with the WITLC, we are going to kind of record. Are you going to kind of request to have a two-dimensional S-by-module that is going to be playing the role of the spin bundle? And then I'm saying that the rating, the spin is a flip map from the axioms. If you remember, I told you that one solution that can be given in the geometric conditions or the geometric properties is the polymatrices, and I'm taking it, two of them at least, and then. List and then I'm going to express the connection in this way, which is a very basic way. Basically, I'm just giving just the basis and some coefficients that I put in the real numbers. So then after we have this, I want to give the full expression, I think, in the next one. I know this is the one. So believe me, this is it. And then I want to recover the Hilbert space. That means that I have to. Hilbert space that means that I have to complete this thing and I'm going to complete it with this expression. And here I took the measure equals to the identity. And this is the solution that I recovered. The integration that I'm considering here is the classical torus. And therefore, the full expression of the Dirac operator, it is going to be given by this one. And in a shorted version, it's going to be this under up to unitary equivalent. Up to unitary equivalence. And let me say that I don't remember anything else to say. Okay, so to finish, just some comments. So not every cone spectral triple can be geometrical realized like the way we did in here. As you see, there are some points that there is not there's That there's no way to evolve it in the problem or continue working without assuming a little bit of things, like taking the polymatrices, for instance, or taking mu equals to identity, things like that. So, but it is not formally speaking this the DIRAC operator or the full spectral triples. Spectral triples. It is kind of one step before, like this, like the original one. But nevertheless, this formalism or this approach does picks out some of the geometry because it's taking it from the Lebesgue beta in a very explicit way. The cliff reaction should be covariant with respect with the connection of the two sides of the map. That's an extra. The two sides of the map, that's an extra comment. The optional geometric conditions of the cliff reaction link the spinner structure to the metric that I just said. And I think that's it. Thank you. It needs a harder. Yeah, and you need a separate girl. With the non-commutative torus, where did you use the fact that theta is irrational? Because when theta is rational, then the algebra is more equivalent to the algebra of matrices on a torus. So it's a normal manifold. Sorry. I use that in the solution, I mean in the system inside, gives me a nice expression for J. It is inside of there, but I think it's because. Is inside of there, but the thing is because it's inside Mathematica. There's, I, I, I think my answer is not satisfactory. Um, in the sense that I it either writes or I use it and develops the solution and gives. Did you use a particular value of theta? No. Then it could be rational. Um, this construction works also for theta rational. Uh, and but for theta rational, then the algebra is more. A rational, then the algebra is more equivalent to the algebra of functions on the torus because it is the algebra. But then you have a structure which is both for commutative and non-commutative manifolds. To see where exactly, but yeah. Exactly, but the reality conditions she put all in ordered U and V was ordered. No problem. Because it's isospect once here. But in the rational case, even uh the algebra is not commutative, it still is non-commutative. Well, it's not a non it's non-commutative towards, that's no problem. Community toros, that's no problem, but it's a isospectral isos spectral triple of con, which she recognizes. I landed the same thing, yeah. She just gives more structure, but con did with the partial derivative. Yes, and it works because it's it's um oh, you have a trivial bundle, that's why it works so well. Yeah, it's trivial, the bundle is trivial. Dora has a trivial bundle, so tangential bundle is trivial, and then she does everything. The dungeon mother is trivial, and then she does everything, and two copies of the Toros functions. Because since on this torus, Rosenberg, for example, has been constructing a Levi-Chivita connection that is Levi-Chivita with respect to an arbitrary symmetric metric. I was wondering whether this construction can be carried over for a generic Levitica connection rather than this specific equivariant metric. I need to check. I don't really know. I guess, yes, but I don't know. Can I ask a question? So, I suppose you can define a curvature also for your connections and all this, right? Yes. Okay, so in the case of this non-commutative two toros, a good test would be to see if you can prove something like Gauss 1A theorem. Because, I mean, in the algebraic I mean, in the algebraic case, as it was mentioned, Paolo mentioned, Rosenberg did that purely algebraically, but just for conformal perturbations of the deformations of the flat metric. Nothing has been done beyond that, but with a different formalism, maybe one can prove it in general. I mean, that would be very interesting to prove a Gauss Bonet or I mean that. Yes. It just means trace of the curvature is zero. That's in this case. That's all. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, sure. Thanks. Yeah. Just one other question. At the end, what was the condition of the vector S, the vector bundle S? What is the condition? Or the assumption? You put it at the end. I don't remember. I don't remember. Something like two-dimensional? Yes, yes, to, I mean, that it is coming from, I mean, when I asked that to be two-dimensional, then the conditions in here became the two-by-two matrices in the solution because of the dimension of the basis and the way it is stated. Like a free model? Yes. Free model? Yes. Yes. I asked that it's kind of the bottom-up approach. I mean, I'm making otherwise it is how. More questions? We are short on time. I think we this discussion we postpone to the evening, to dinner. So next speaker is Ona or also next speaker.
