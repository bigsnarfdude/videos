All right, so welcome everybody to my presentation and also my big thanks to the organizers for inviting me to talk for today. I'm leading the team of computational genomics of cancer and so cancer is the main topic of our research and today I will be talking about one specific problem that we try to solve. The research is not final yet but we are getting to them. So what we're interested in in studying is intratumoral transcriptional heterogeneity. But before I get there I would like But before I get there, I would like to tell you more about what type of heterogeneity we can have in tumors. And first, I would like to start with the difference between inter-tumor versus intra-tumor heterogeneity. So for inter-tumor, we mean heterogeneity and cell composition between different individuals. And then when we talk about intra-tumor, we talk about heterogeneity within one particular tumor of one patient. And then for intratumor, And then for intra-tumor heterogeneity, we're going to have the other types of heterogeneity. So, one would be heterogeneity of tumor microenvironments. So, the composition of healthy cells that infiltrate the tumors, immune cells, terminals, the dul cells, and so on. So, this is one type of heterogeneity which we don't have. The second type is intratumor transcriptional and epigenetic heterogeneity. And this is when we look specifically at the malignant cells within the tumor, so, cells and mutations. So, cells and mutations and copy number aberrations. And then these cells here may be all the same, expressing all the same genes at the same amount. In this case, we talk about homogeneous tumor. Or we can have cells which display different gene expression profiles. For example, we can have cancer stem cells, which are not proliferating that fast, but more resistant to chemotherapy, versus more differentiated cancer cells that proliferate faster, but can be maybe more easily killed by chemotherapy. Be maybe more easily killed by chemotherapy. And these guys don't have to have differences in their genomes, so they can have exactly the same profiles of mutations. Copy number mibrations, it's just the transcription of any epigenetic states will be different. And then we can also talk about genetic heterogeneity. And in this case, we talk about subclonal mutations or copy number mibrations. So this is different from transcriptional heterogeneity. And of course, there are links between these three types of heterogeneity, but I'm not focusing on these things today. Not focusing on these things today. So, the topic of my today's talk is this intratumoral transcription and epigenetic heterogeneity. And to characterize it, we can apply single-cell RNA-seq profiling of our tumors. And we can complement it with single-cell adapt-seq, maybe to link changes in the gene expression with differences in activities of transcription factors. But again, I'm not talking about ATAC-SIG today, so I'll focus only on transcriptional profiles. On transcriptional profiles and trying to find this heterogeneity on the level of transcriptional profiles between different cancer cells within the TM. And in addition to the two examples I mentioned, cancer stem cells, or just more differential cancer cells, we can have cells in some hypoxic states that in the same tumor and like nomoxic state. We can have cells which are more into EMT, we have an Zegmon transition, more migration. We have a double Zengman transition, more migrating cells, sometimes called nest cells, versus those which are not migrating. So we can find these different states. And what we are interested in is shared transcriptional heterogeneity. By this, I mean states which are observed not just in one patient, but that can be observed across patients. So for example, pro-migrative mesenchymal state can be found in several patients in different proportions. Cancer stem cells may be also. Stem cells may be also found in some cells in high some patients in high proportions versus in other patients. So, we're interested in quantifying and identifying this intratumor arc genetic, which is shared across patients. And there are many works already for different cancer types where biologists and clinicians could find this shared transcriptional states. And one example is given by neuroblastomas. This discovery was. Thomas, this discovery was done by my team together with the team of Zabel Janmex from the Curie Institute. And then, same year, we had a publication by Rojay Verstei Group. And what we discovered is that one tumor, one neuroplastoma tumor, we can have cells in two different transcriptional states. One is pro-migratory mesenchymal-like state. So, here we can see on the staining that these cells have yellow cells, and then you can. Cells as yellow cells, and then you can have cells which are more differentiated. So, this is classic noject-like neurobostoma state. And these cells can be seen in blue in this particular tumor. So, you see that it's heterogeneous, and we can also confirm the existence of these two states in different tumors and different cell lines. Then, in glioblastoma, 2019, these office published four different shared transcriptional states. Transcriptional states. So this is the OPS. So oligodendrocyte progenitor-like, you have mesenchema-like state cells, you have astrocyte-like cells, and then PC, which is neuroprogenitive-like cells. This is for glioblastoma, then another example, breast cancer. So you probably know about ligninal A, ligninal basal types. So what these authors did, they took tumors which were annotated as lignal B or ligninal A. Annotated as luminal B or luminal A or basal or HER2. And within these tumors, they say that we observe cells that display more basal-like properties or more luminal B oluminal-like properties. So for example, each line here is one tumor. And here you can see that in this tumor, which is characterized by epithologists as basal, only 50% of cells are so-called basal state, and then you have lots of cells in so-called B state. So-called novic state. And then, last example, I wanted to show you: this is Zephygeo skemos cell carcinoma, and here the authors discover eight shared states, and each tumor, which is shown by column here, is characterized as a mixture of cells and these eight different shared states. How the researchers, yeah, why it's important to find this heterogeneity, characterize this heterogeneity, because we Because we believe that this can be linked to the survival of cancer patients and also to the sensitivity to different anti-tumor drugs. You can make an analogy of the society. So, if you have a heterogeneous society versus homogeneous society, then this society can be more resistant to stress. So, for example, if we treat our tumor with some standard treatment, then some cells which are sensitive to this treatment can die, but other cells This treatment can die, but other cells may survive and cause the relapse later on. And we think that heterogeneous tumors should, in general, more aggressive and more resistant to standard therapies, unless we apply combinations. So this is why I think it's important to be able to identify the shared transcription states and characterize intratumor transcriptional heterogeneity in cancer patients. So how it is usually done in these papers that I just Usually done in these papers that I just cited, there we take each tumor separately, we analyze each tumor separately, for example, clustering and the spatial gene expression of single cells, and then we analyze clusters with the differential gene expression, and then we compare signatures or biological processes which are differential between different clusters, different tumors. And then we can identify maybe this shared transcriptional state. So, for example, these yellow cells will form. Example, these yellow cells will form clusters and different patients. The downside of this approach is that if you have some red cell types, like this red cells, it may happen that they will not form a distinct cluster or your clustering ports will be not sensitive enough, and you may miss this shared state. And we think that remedy to these challenges could be provided by analyzing all tumors together. Together. So we'll take just all tumors, all single cells from different tumors, and we'll try to identify this shared transcriptional state by projecting these tumors into common space. So this is our idea. Hope in the future it will work something like this. So this is a manual analysis of the data. We want to have just one method. Click on the button, get this representation. Why is it? Why is it so complicated to do? This is because you have lots of technical effects which are specific to each patient or sometimes cells, and also you have biological variation driven by differences and copy number variations. So, for example, here I'm showing to you a UMAP of gene expression from single-cell data with this colorful cancer data set. And each dot here is a cell, which is characterized by a vector of gene expression and a color. Expression and a color corresponds to the patient. And you can see that cells from different patients form distinct clusters. So cells from different patients don't cluster together, as we can see here in this beautiful example on gliobostomer, where the resurface identified four shared signatures. And the main reason for this, in this example, is that different patients have different copina migrations. So for example, this purple patient can have a low-signal chromosome 10, which is absolutely A low sign in chromosome 10, which is absent in gray-brown patient, and then genes which are present in chromosome 10 will be at low expression in purple patient versus the brown patient. And this can drive differences in gene expression. So we need to correct for this. And so ideally, what we want to do, we want to somehow integrate this data, remove the patient-specific effects, which are either biological in the sense of copy numbers or technical, and find. And find a common latent space where cells from different patients will be mixed, and then prescriptional programs will correspond to some parts of this shared latent space. This is what we ideally want to do, but it's not that easy because single-cell data are not that nice. Sometimes they are quite noisy. In particular, they are known for so-called dropout effect. And here, I'm visualizing to you on the left. On the left, gene expression data measured bulk RNA-seq for two technical replicates. And so each dot here is an expression of one gene. And you can see that reproducibility between two replicates for bulk RNA-seq is very nice. And on the right, I'm showing to you the gene expression measured from two identical cells. And again, each dot here, it's expression of one gene within these two rapids. One gene between these two replicates, two cells. And you can see that here in these boxes, there are genes which have zero read count in one cell and they have very high read counts of 10 power 4 in the other cell. So this is partially due to the fact that when you do single cell RNA-seq, we only capture something like one-tenth of all transcripts. So some transcripts, even if they are present in the cell, may be missed by the technique. Missed by the technique. So we need to account for this. And a common way to deal with this is to model single-cell RNA-seq grid counts with a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution. So negative binomial is proxy for over dispersed poisson. And zero-inflated means that we just put some zeros into the distribution. Just the formulas. So it's known that zero-inflated negative binomial models quite nicely single-cell RNC data. All right, so what we need to remove when we try to find this latent space to find the shared transcriptional signatures is first batch effects. So here I'm going to visualize the batch effects which are due to two different chemistries of 10x used in this colorital cancer data set. So here I'm showing to you only healthy cells, not cancer cells, and each cell type is colored by its own color here on the right. So for example, Color here on the right. So, for example, here in gray, you see these T cells and they form two clusters. And if you look at which type of chemistry corresponds to these two clusters, you see that this is clearly chemistry two on the right, chemistry three on the left. So, this is this clustering is clearly due to the batch effect. We need to correct one. But even if we correct the batch effect, we will still see differences between different patients in terms of gene expression. Different patients in terms of gene expression because these patients will have patient-specific copy named. Then, on top of the copy number migrations, what we want to correct for is different biases. So, we have a bias of the total read count. So, each cluster here, it's one particular tumor. So, each dot here, it's a cell from one tumor here, shown in different color. And you see gradients and total read count very nicely. Very nicely, you see gradients linked to the mitochondrial RD account, and you also see gradients related to the cell phase. So, all this is unwanted variation. We don't want to capture this when we have this shared latent space. So, we try to remove the sources of anodic variation and we propose an approach to do so, which we call CANSIC, which is composed of. Which is composed of three modules. I will not have time to go through all of them today. So I will just mention that we have a pre-processing step where we filter out low-quality cells and also we remove genes which are not variable enough. And then for each cell, we quantify its copy number profile using gene expression data so that we can discriminate malignant cells from non-malignant cells of tumor microenvironment. And then the most important part is the small. Most important part is this model line part where we try to find this shared latent space. And then the last part, this post-processing part, this is where we try to associate some parts of the latent space to the non-prescriptional programs using ballmarks of cancer data. I will show you some examples, but first I will mention just how we do the modeling. So the modeling, this is this key part of our pipeline. Modeling, this is the key part of our pipeline when we provide as input a matrix of row read counts and genes and a cell. And then we propose the user to use one of the methods to find this latent common latent space. So either the user can use an approach proposed by the authors of SCVI or homemade conditional variation on the encoder followed by NMAP or you can. We can use also harmony, and the default one is the SCEI method, which consists of running conditional operation auto-encoder with a zero-inflated negative binary conditional likelihood pass. And why I think this is a good choice? Because first we use auto-encoders. So in this case, we have our lid space capturing the hidden cancer. The hidden cancer cell cancer states. So we condense our data to something which is supposed to be shared. Also, variational open encoder has very nice properties because it creates a very nice latent space which can be used as a generated model. And then, also, this is a conditional variational encoder, and we can provide. And we can provide this covariance reflecting the unbounded sources of variation as a condition to get rid of, so that the latent space that we identify does not contain information about these different conditions, which is the total read count. So we don't want to have the total read count bias in our space. We don't want to see the cell phase too much. We don't want to see patient ID or clone ID if we talk about copy number versions too much. Too much, and we don't want to see much of the gradient mitochondrial RNA content. So, all this can be done when we just add this information as a condition, the conditional operational auto-encoder. And then we also use a different laws than just mean squared error laws. So, here we use this ZIM conditional likelihood laws, also proposed by a CVI, so that we can explicitly model the shape of the distribution of single-cell RNA C data. Of single-cell RNA-C data. So we apply this model first on our simulated data. So here we have eight samples, they have batch effects, and we model them so that there are three different transcriptional programs present in the samples. And what we want to get rid of is cell ID. So this is what we put under the condition, and our latent space is nicely organized. So we don't see any. Any part of the space which is specific to one batch or one tumor in this case. And then if you look at the programs now, we see that parts of our organ space are very enriched and program zero, program one, and program two, which we use to model update. So on simulated data, it looks like our latest phase makes sense, but then we wanted to validate it on real data sets. And the problem with the real data sets is that And the problem with the real data sets is that we don't know the ground truth. So, what are the shared transcriptional states? The only thing that we can do is we can use current publications. So, here we use publications for these three different cancer types. And then we use the signatures that were manually discovered by the authors of these publications to see whether we also observe the signatures in some parts of our latency space. So, key for validation we used is. We used isophageal cancer and colerful cancer, and also breast. But today I'm going to show only results for esophageal cancer very briefly because of lack of time. So here I'm showing to you what the input looks like before we did the correction. So we see a very strong bias for patient-specific effects. And then after the correction, we see that now an all-related See that now in ovulated space, we don't see clear clusters corresponding to patient-specific cells. We also don't see any attacks linked to the read count or mitochondrial counts. And if we project on this latent space known signatures, so this is groundproof signatures, we see that they occupy some specific part of our latent space. So here I'm showing to you UMAP projection of the initial latent space, which is six dimensions. Initial latent space, which is six dimensions, and then when we have this latent space, we can analyze it to say that if we don't have the signatures, what different cells in this latent space do. And for this, we can apply clustering and then potential gene expression. And then for each cluster, we can apply gene set enrichment analysis to say that one particular cluster is enriched in some home of cancer. Whole map of cancer, and we can do it for different number of dimensions of our latent space for different number of clusters, for different number for different random seeds. And then for each combination of these hyperparameters plus random seeds, we can look at the enrichment score for our particular hallmark. And if you see that whatever we do, this hallmark always has a high score in this case. You see it as red, so the most enrichment score above two is. Modern score above two is considered strong enrichment. We can say, indeed, this hallmark different alpha response is one of the shared transcription states. And before I conclude, I wanted to show you a visualization of this post-processing process. So, for example, we apply, we use one random sheet to create one realization of a latent space of Realization of latent space of 10 dimensions. Oh, so here's six dimensions. Sorry, then we apply clustering with a k equal 10 clusters. We take this cluster six here. For this cluster six, we do differential gene expression. And then on the differentially expressed genes between this cluster six and the rest, we apply gene set enrichment analysis. We see that the strongest enrichment is for the whole market for the mesenchomon transition, so these will be migrating cells. And then And then we do the same with different number of dimensions, different number of clusters, and we see that always, so almost always, we have very strong conditional transition. And just to show you how this agrees with the previously published signatures, so for Ezepage, Camusol Carcinoma, authors who published the single-cell data set identified this migrating signature, mesenchyma-like signature, and you see that the score of the signature is very high. Of the signature is very high, or for our cluster six, which we found in an unsupervised way. So, overall, what we try to solve is to be able to analyze all samples together and detect this shared trust state from cancer cells from different patients and progress for the sources of unbounded variation. And then, in the end, we link the states or shared states to get identified to known biological processes. To known biological processes using gene set management analysis. And in the future, what we will try to do is, when we are sure about our results, we'll try to quantify the hydrogenating patients and then try to link it to cancer aggressiveness and sensitivity to treatment. And we hope that by analyzing what kind of cells exist in each tumor, we can suggest better ways to treat the patients by killing multi-microspirit. By killing not only just one type of salt, but two types of salt with combination therapies. I would like to thank people who contributed to this work.
