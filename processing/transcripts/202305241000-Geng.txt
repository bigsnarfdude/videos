I did, but not complete. Hello, everyone. Just put it up. Yes, so it's time to start. So it's a pleasure to introduce the first speaker of this morning's session. Yes, Shigeng from Melbourne. And the title of his talk is The Radius of Convergence for Logarithmic Signature. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you very much for inviting me to this nice conference, and it's a great pleasure to be here for the second time. So comparing to many of the previous SPD talks, my talk today is a bit more on the rough path side. Rough path side, and so to some extent, it's a bit more elementary, I guess. So, this is based on joint work and ongoing work with Horatio Bodihasho and my PhD student, Sheng Wang. Okay. So, to give you the motivation, so let's begin by considering Let's begin by considering a general differential equation. So, here X is a multi-dimensional path in Rd, and V is a collection of D vector fields on Rn. The state space is Rn. Because I'm just giving the motivation here, so let's just do things formally at this point and not worry about any analytic issue. So, there are two basic. So, there are two basic perspectives of looking at the solution to this differential equation. The first one is the more natural one through Taylor expansion. So basically, if you try to do a Pitcard type iteration, it is pretty standard that you could express the solution in terms of a formal series given by this in terms of the derivative. In terms of the derivatives of the vector fields at the starting point of the solution. And then you will see these iterated integrals of the driving path coming up. Well, we could just give the name to the right-hand side of this expression and call that a function phi. So formally, you can think of the solution as a function of the starting point and this quantity we And this quantity we call that Sx. So Sx is given by the collection of global iterated integrals along the driving path. There's a natural algebraic structure to describe this object Sx. So let's define the tensor algebra over Rd. So formally, elements in this tensor Elements in this tensor algebra are sequence of homogeneous tensors where the mth component lives in the mth tensor product of Rd. And this quantity Sx, you can think of it as an element in this tensor algebra. So the mth order iterated integral is an element in the mth tensor product. So this is Tensor product. So, this is one thing to note is that this is not a number. So, it is a multi-dimensional object. The dimension is d to the m if the dimension of x is d. And if you want to get a real number, you have to extract coordinates. So, for example, if you put if you extract the i1 component of x1 and im component of xtm, you get this coordinate iterated integral. So, it's just a concise. Iterated integrals. It's just a concise algebraic way of describing this Sx. And there's a name to this quantity in the rough path literature. This is called the signature of the path x. So for example, if x is a bounded variation path, then the iterated integrals are defined in the Lebesgue state. integrals are defined in the Lebesgue stigma sense. And if x is a Brownian motion, then the integrals are taken in the Stradnovich sense. So one basic reason of looking at this signature transform is that there is a fundamental theorem in rough path theory called the signature uniqueness theorem. So it says that every rough path is uniquely determined by its signature up to three-like pieces. So three-like pieces Like pieces. So, tree-like piece means that the piece on the path where you travel along it and reverses back along itself. So, in other words, essentially all information on the geometry of your underlying path is encoded in the signature. So, this is one perspective of looking at the solution from the perspective of Taylor extension. To describe the other perspective, perspective, we have to first introduce a little bit more about the algebraic structure of the tensor problem, of the tensor algebra. So the tensor algebra has two natural operations, addition and multiplication, where multiplication is just defined by the tensor product, defined in a way that is similar to In a way that is similar to polynomial multiplication. So the tensor algebra is equipped with these two operations, it's an algebra with a unit. Now with these two operations, then you can define the so-called exponential and logarithmic function just basically by using the Taylor the usual Taylor formula. But the only difference is that the Is that the product here has to be interpreted in terms of the tensor product instead of real multiplication? So these two maps, these two functions, exponential and log, they are one-to-one and they are inverse to each other. So given the signature of a path, if you take the logarithm of it using the previous functions, you get another. Functions, you get another tensor series, and that is called the logarithmic signature of x. Well, you might ask, why do we consider the logarithmic signature? One basic reason is that for the signature itself, there are some redundant information about because there are some algebraic dependencies among different signature components. signature components. For example, if you multiply the, if you take a product of two components coming from the first level, which is just the increment of the path, so if you multiply them, then you can express the product as a sum of two coefficients coming from the second level of the signature. So there are some dependencies, some universal algebraic dependencies. Well, on the other hand, if you take the log signature, somehow If you take the log signature, somehow this kind of dependencies got eliminated because the log signature essentially lives in a freely algebra generated by the Rd. Okay, so here is the other perspective of looking at the solution to the differential equation. I think it's best illustrated using a commutative diagram. So let's look at this diagram. Diagram. So the bottom arrow is just the previous Taylor expansion map. So here, GRD is the intrinsic space where the signature takes values in. So the phi is just the Taylor expansion. If you fit in the signature, you get the solution using the function that I just described at the beginning. Now, on the left, my LRD. My LRD is the intrinsic space where the log signature leaves. It's just a logarithm of this guy. Well, on the right-hand side here, what is this Lie of V1 up to Vd? So it is the Lie algebra generated by the vector fields V1 up to Vd. So the vector fields are the ones given in the SDE. So this is a space of So, this is a space of vector fields on your state space. So, every members in here are vector fields on Rn. Now, what is this exponential? So, this exponential is just the one I define on tensor algebra. What is this exponential? Given the vector field on Rn, how do you obtain an element on Rn? So remember that we fixed the starting point y0. The starting point y0. So y0 is always fixed. So then you just flow along the vector field w and evaluate that at time one. So which means that you just solve an ODE given by the vector field W, and then you look at where it lands at time one. So that's the definition of this exponential. Well, the last thing to common is that there is a canonical map, which I call it. Map, which I call that V hat from this log signature space into this Lie algebra of generated by V1 up to Vd. I don't want to go into the details about defining this V hat. It's not so important for now. It's the unique Lie algebra homomorphism induced by the linear mapping the I basis of Rd to Vi. Of Rd to Vi. But anyway, so what is this other perspective of looking at the solution? The point is that formally, this diagram is commutative. So you can solve your differential equation using a Taylor extension, but you can also go the other way around. So you can begin with the log signature and then go through this canonical Lie algebra. Canonical Lie algebra homomorphism to obtain a vector field, and then you flow along that vector field, and then you get where you land at is your solution. Now, from this representation, it is natural to expect that in order to make this analytically precise, somehow we should expect that. We should expect that this kind of diagram will come out analytically if the vector field V and the radius of convergence for the logarithmic signature satisfy some quantitative relation. For example, you might expect that if you have a type of relation like this, if some sort of norm of the vector field is smaller than the radius of convergence, then you might expect You might expect that this diagram makes sense analytically. So, in the same way as you think this phi is our solution, V hat is also taking the log signature of the input signal and mapping it to something that is ultimately identifiable with the solution. So, that's right, that's another kind of solution. Yeah, that's right. Okay, so what. Okay, so what is the definition of the radius of convergence? So if you have a tensor series in the tensor algebra, the radius of convergence of C is defined to be the radius of convergence of the power series that constructed in this way. So you just basically take the norm of the mth component of the log signature to be Of the log signature to be the mth coefficient of your power series. And the radius convergence is just defined in there in the usual calculus way. Yeah, I don't want to write up a bracket. You're right, you're right. Yeah, it's the infinite one. So here comes the very basic mathematics. So, here comes the very basic mathematical question one can ask. Is this, does the log signature define an entire function? In other words, is the radius of convergence of the log signature is finite? So, my talk is mostly concerned with this basic question. So, to get some feeling, we can look at a trivial example. So, if so, suppose that we have a line segment. So, if x is just a line segment in Rd, then explicit calculation shows that the signature is just the exponential of v. So, of course, the log signature is just v itself. So, it only has one component. So, in that case, your log signature, of course, defines an entire function because your power series only has one term in it. And then somehow. Somehow, it was conjectured by Lyons and Starova in 2006 that the line segment is actually the only example where the radius of convergence is infinite. So they expect that the log signature is always finite unless the path is a line segment. Well, on the other hand, if you look at the signature itself, it's always infinite because it is Is infinite because it is well known that the signature decays factorially fast. The signature coefficient decays factorially fast as the degree goes to infinity. So, somehow this behavior is quite different. So, the log signature does not decay that fast. So, if we consider just the concatenation of two linear parts, we observe doing this calculation at the rest of the well, this can be proved, but it's not a simple calculation. But it's not a simple calculation. It's not simple. The conjecture is that the Love signature always has finite radius of convergence. Finite. So finite, yeah. But the V, I mean, except the case of line segment. So line segment is the extreme where you have infinite radius convergence. So for example, if you look at the quantity. So, for example, if you look at the concatenation of two line segments, you immediately get finite radius of convergence. So, they confirmed this for two quite special classes of paths. The first type of path is paths that are strictly monotone in one direction. So it's a fairly restrictive class of paths. And the other class of paths they consider. And the other class of path they consider is the class of piecewise, a generic class of piecewise linear paths, they call it an unpaired path. So, what is according to their definition, a piecewise linear path is called paired if you can divide the pieces into pairs, such that in each pair, it's given by a vector and its opposite. So, that's called a pair. So that's called a paired path. So, unpaired is the path that is not paired. It is generic for piecewise linear paths. So, for these two class of paths, they show that the log signature has finite radius of convergence. X is component strict from 1, 2, 1, and 2. I think it's being identical. So you have a multi-dimensional path for enhance it to a deep one-dimensional path by introducing a line statement in the well but then you change the path itself and and the sick and and and you're you're talking you're not talking that the signature is also different okay sure yeah yeah uh right so before trying trying to to to to understand Trying to to to understand this uh uh conjecture in a more general case. We we we we first asked uh ask the the the question in in a probabilistic uh situation, what happens for the Brownian motion? Because Brownian motion is the is the fundamental example where where you know where the SD is of interest, right? Basically, because uh eventually the motivation comes from solving uh uh rough differential equations. Rough differential equations. And so we managed to show that actually this is true for Brownian parts. The log signature of Brownian motion is always finite. And we also managed to prove a lower bound for the radius of convergence, which is simply bounded below by the inverse of the p-variation of x. And this is deterministic, it has nothing to do with Brownian motion. Nothing to do with Brownian motion. But the main thing is the finiteness of the radius of convergence. Okay, so the rest of my talk will be trying to describe the main strategy of proving this kind of result. And we basically follow the main philosophy of Lancidarova's original work, but we try to somehow understand this in understand this in in in try to understand the essence of of of of the of the philosophy in a more geometric uh way so the starting point uh is that um is to look at liftings of of your of an euclidean path into into uh arbitrary le groups so to be more precise suppose you have a path in rd suppose g is a given lie group with vie algebra little g f is a given linear map from r Linear map from Rd into the Lie algebra. Then, using this data, you can naturally lift x onto a path on the Lie group by solving a left invariant differential equation. So the intuition behind this equation is quite simple. Suppose currently you're at location gamma t. So how do you move in the next step? You take a small increment of your original path, which is Of your original path, which is Euclidean, and then you map it into the Lie algebra using your F. And then you take the exponential map to map it down to the Lie group, and then you translate it to your current location at gamma t. So that determines how you move next. So, in this way, you obtain a path on the Lie group. And this is often known as the Cartan development of Known as the Cartan development of your original path X. This could be done given any Lie algebra, Lie group, and any linear map F. Now here is the key observation. Suppose that, so we want to prove that the log signature has finite radius of convergence. So we prove by contradiction. So suppose that the log signature has infinite radius of convergence. The key observation is that you do have an Is that you do have a commutative diagram analytically? So, this can be proved precisely, the commutativity of this diagram. The main reason is that in the context of Cartan development, the underlying vector fields are left invariant vector fields. So the Lie algebra generated by these vector fields are actually finite-dimensional, which is just the Lie algebra G. So, everything works out nicely. If the log signature has Nicely, if the log signature has fine infinite radius convergence, if you do have an entire function. So, if this diagram can muse, then so here is your Cartan development, the end point, the end point of the Cartan development is here, which is the point on the Lie group. And because of the commutativity of this diagram, so if you assume the log signature has infinite radius convergence, then the conclusion is that the Is that the endpoint of the development is actually inside the image of the exponential because of the commutativity of this diagram. So it comes from the exponential. Right. So if you keep this in mind, and then it is natural to expect what should we do? What is the natural idea of proving the finite radius convergence? You just need to construct a suitable. Need to construct a suitable development. You just need to choose a suitable G and F such that the end point of the development somehow is not in the exponential image. That gives you the contradiction. So how do you choose a development? Well, the first thing you don't want to do is to choose a compact Lie group. Because for the compact Lie group, you have a subjective exponential image. So it's always. Exponential image. So it's always you can't make this happen. So you should turn to a non-compact Lie group. And the simplest non-compact Lie group is the isometry group of the upper half plane, which is commonly known as SL2R. So this is the space of two by two matrices with a determinant one. And the Lie algebra is the two by two matrices with zero trace. There's a simple There's a simple way to visualize these objects. So, for the Lie algebra, there is a canonical Lorentzian structure. So, you can draw a line cone in this Lie algebra. So, inside the line cone, okay, I think I messed this up. Inside the line cone, you call that the elliptic elements. Outside the line cone, you call that hyperbolic elements. And on the line cone, you call the parabolic elements. line kong you call the parabolic elements so this is the lie algebra uh well for the for the for the corresponding li group you can visualize it as uh looks like a hyperbolic surface but it is uh literally it is three-dimensional so at every point on the surface uh there's actually a circle attached to it so it's a it's a three-dimensional thing so uh the identity matrix is here the minus identity is here and The minus identity is here, and the horizontal axis is the trace of the matrix. Okay, now where is the image of the exponential map? The image, so first of all, the exponential map is not subjective. And the image of the exponential map is everything to the right of negative identity. So meaning trace is greater than minus two. So in other words, Two. So, in other words, there is a simple criterion of testing whether an element belongs to the exponential image or not. A matrix in SL2R belongs to, does not belong to the image of the exponential map if and only if its trace is less than minus two. It could also be minus two, but as long as it's not the minus identity. So everything greater than minus two will be inside the exponential image. Inside the exponential image. Okay. So, how do you choose it? How do you construct a development that leaves the exponential image? Well, the construction is not explicit. We prove existence of such a development. The basic idea is very simple. You first pick a stupid development. Pick a stupid development that sends you to minus i. But unfortunately, this is not enough because minus i is actually in the image of the exponential. So and then somehow you expect that, okay, if I perturb this stupid development, then I might have a chance of going out, because minus i also happens to lie on the boundary of the exponential map. To be a little bit more precise, let's say we have a two-dimensional. Bit more precise, let's say we have a two-dimensional Brownian notion, and you can write down the stupid development explicitly. Now, here is what I meant by the perturbation map. So, it's a map from the Lie algebra to the Lie group. So, given an element in the Lie algebra, so in the stupid map, in the stupid linear map F0, you map E2 to 0. You map E2 to zero. E2 is the Y component of your vector space. So the perturbation is you just replace zero by y. So you perturb the y direction. And what is this map possi? So given any y, you replace the zero by y to get your linear map, to get your linear map from the Lie algebra, from R2 into the Lie algebra. Two into Lie algebra, and then you solve the Cartan equation to obtain the Cartan development, and then evaluate that at the end point. So that gives you a position in the group. So this is the definition of the perturbation map. It is a perturbation because when y equals zero, you just get that your original stupid development, which sends you to minus i. So this is a smooth. So, this is a smooth map from a neighborhood of the origin into a neighborhood of the negative identity. And so how do you show that you are able to touch the outside of the exponential image? The only thing you need to do is to show that this map is non-degenerate. Because if you can show that this map is non-degenerate at the origin, then that means. The origin, then that means it's a local diffeomorphism. So that guarantees that you can, certainly, there exists developments which sends you to the green region because it's a diffeomorphism between the two neighborhoods. And if you do the explicit calculation, you can easily figure out what is the determinant of the Jacobian. It is just as simple as. Jacobian. It is just as simple as this expression. So, in order to show that this is non-degenerate, you only need to prove that, for example, this stochastic integral is non-zero almost surely. And one elegant way to do so is to prove a much stronger claim that this guy has a density. And this could be done by Maliven calculus. And if you think about this integral, it is actually a stochastic line integral with respect to a spatial one form. So when we come across this expression, we immediately ask ourselves a slightly more general question. So if you have a hypoelliptic diffusion on some manifold, where hypoelliptic means that the vector fields along with the bracket. Vector fields, along with their brackets of arbitrary orders, they span the linear space at every point of the manifold. Suppose you have a hypoelliptic diffusion, and then suppose phi is a spatial one form on M, then under what quantitative conditions that you can prove that the stochastic line integral has a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure? So this is a natural question coming up from the Question coming up from the previous special, the previous problem. It turns out that we managed to write down intrinsic conditions. Intrinsic means that these are conditions defined on the manifold and independent of choice of coordinates. We have a general criterion, but the results are stated in a neater way in some special cases. So, for example, if you assume So, for example, if you assume that the vector fields are elliptic, then the condition on the one form to guarantee the non-degeneracy is exactly just the condition of non-closeness. So if you assume that the one form is non-closed almost surely, almost everywhere, then the stochastic line integral has a density. And in the step two hypoelliptic case, the condition is also quite. The condition is also quite neat. So it says that if the exterior derivative of this one form is non-zero, then you have the non-degeneracy. So here, omega 1, omega 2, omega 3 is the dual basis of the v's, is the co-frame due to v. And d is the exterior derivative. Okay, I think maybe I should stop here and thank you. Thank you very much. Are there questions? Yes, got it. Is that some connection with Holmander's condition with this in part two? Yeah, I think this is Holmander's condition. Yeah, I think this is Homander's condition, yeah, but uh some type of yeah I think you will even get the existence of the density for the couple xt and together with the line integral at least in the first one right if you write a Mandarin's condition, you know for the couple xt one is that I think I think that the point is that you if the first condition that is in just in this slides is a Herman Dorse condition and it just seems to me that this is Herman Dorse condition for the couple Xt together with the stochastic integral. That such that the few things. Because you can just directly state that as a sufficient probability, but it's still not obvious because you have one extra information about changing the dynamic. So it becomes less likely. So So I would say that these are these are the conditions that the issues that new system that we can satisfy by adding this new will satisfy amanda. Exactly. Yeah, okay. Thank you. Are there other questions or comments? From what I've seen, the only place where you use that X is a Brownian motion is to prove the density of your light. Motion is to prove the density of your line into the five or six slides, but I get it in a more general yeah but you're right. The argument is very realistic to some extent. The Brownian motion only comes i i it in quite uh through these multi-channels. Any other question or comment? Okay, if not, thank you very much again.
