E is a graduate student in my department at Duke. She is going to be junior PhD at the end of this semester, and she's going to be talking about an auction problem. Yeah, so everyone can see this presentation, right? I just want to make sure. Okay, that's cool. So, hi everyone. I'm going to talk about uncommon knowledge in multi-party auction problem. A multi-party auction problem. So, by this, we mean by like trying to solve a multi-party auction problem with relaxation on the common knowledge assumption. So, first, I'm going to introduce the auction problem that we care about and a PSNE solution. So that stands for Pew Strategy National Equilibrium, since this type of solution motivates the mirroring solution. So, that's why we try to stretch that. And we provided two. And we provided two alternative solutions to the Pure Strategy Nash equilibrium with no common knowledge assumption. One is the Mirroring equilibrium and the other is level case thinking framework. Okay, first I'm going to talk about the auction problem that we all care about. So it is the first price, sell-bid auction. By that, we mean all the bidders participate in the auction simultaneously. And whoever bid the highest price. And whoever bid the highest price will win the auction, and he or she will pay the price that he is bid for. And no bidder knows how much the other auction participants have bid. So that is standard sale bid means. And such that each bidder knows his or her own value for the object. So there is a realized value for that. And that value is not influenced by the other bidders. So that's an independence assumption over here. And assuming all And assuming all bidders are trying to seek to maximize their expected utility, and our goal in general is trying to find the best strategy. Okay. So there are some standard assumptions in the ASHIN province for simplicity, but this is not essential. We assume that everyone's utility function is linear in money. That means like if one, so if one One, um, so if one dollar is one, two dollars, two, so on, so forth. The Pure Strategy Net Equilibrium Solution, or we call it PSNE, models that N-speed's private value as a random variable Vm, and that is independently drawn from his or her own type distribution, Gn. And this for this GM, we have the following assumption: we assume that this GM have common and compact support from the V and Support from the V underscore to V bar, and that the GM are continuous with strictly positive densities on the support. And the last thing we assume is that we assume this GMs are common knowledges and known to be neutral, but the actual real life value Vm are private information. So this set of GMs are public, but the real life value Vm are private information. And we can formulize our objective at the following. So, the goal is to use this type distribution information to determine each participant's bidding function, beta m. And this beta m functions prescribes his optimal bid Vm given his value Vm. So that is the realized value from the type distribution. And his knowledge of the type distributions of all the other objects. Of all the other options and the type distribution they attributed to him. So, under that, a PS and PS and E solution are defined as the following. So, let beta minus M to be the collection of optimal bidding functions, except for the M's bidder. So, this beta minus M is actually like a set of functions. A PSNE is n-triple of bidding functions such that for all n, Such that for all m, beta n is a best response function to every other strategies in the collection of beta minus m. So this beta n over here is indicates one bidding functions over here, while this one is like a collection of bidding functions. And what we concern about is that under those standard assumptions, two of them are very easily to be weakened. Easily to be weakened. So, one of them is like to have the common support, and the other is we assume that they are strictly positive. However, the third one is not so easily to be weakened. That means the type distribution is the public information, which usually is too strong and unrealistic in the real life. Like, how can we make sure we know other people's type distribution? And we think it is entirely reasonable. And we think it is entirely reasonable for two bidders to have totally different beliefs about the type distribution of the third bidder. And that's why we want to relax this assumption and find alternative solution to the PSNE. So let's start from a simple case, and then I'm going to introduce the case that we more care about, and then introduce two alternatives to the PSME. So a simple case will be a semantic. So, a simple case will be a symmetric options. So, in a symmetric options, all the gm are equal, so we call it g, such that all the m bidding functions are also the same because they have the same type distribution. And we denote that function to be beta v. And then for each bidder's expected profit will be the difference between his value and his bid, beta v, times the probability. times the probability that all the other bidders are less than this beta v. So in this case, that will just be the probability that the else bidder, a bidder, win the auction because he's the highest one and he wins the auction. Because if you're entering an auction and you lose, you get nothing. So that's why we care about this probability. So the bidding function in the symmetric case are trying to solve the following equation that is maximize the expected utility. Maximize the expected utility. If we set the expected utility, take the derivative of it and set it equal to zero, then we can get an ordinary differential equation. And then solving that will give us the following solution, closed-form solution, which usually requires a numerical solution. Now we are moving to a more complex scenario. Into a more complex scenario where each of the GM are not necessary to be the same. So we have subscribed to indicate whose type distribution it is. And therefore, the bidding function are all different at the same time. So we have the indicator beta n to n to indicate each people's bidding function. And then now the goal is trying to solve the following set of equations instead of just one because everyone is different. Because everyone is different. So the subscribes I indicate for each of the participants I. And we're trying to maximize the expecting utility for everyone. And this P over here, that indicates that the ICE bidder went the auction and he or she got the item. So this is the probability that all the other options are bid a price that is less than the ice bidder. And for simplicity, notation-wise, we denote FIW to be this probability. Now I'm going to introduce the first one. So it's the first alternative solution to the PSNE, which is we call it memory equilibrium. So instead of assuming common knowledge, we take the adverse real risk analysis perspective. Analysis perspective. A mirror equilibrium is the solution that each bidder believes his or her opponents are modeling all the other participants as seeking a PSNE. So that's why we want to sketch the PSNE at first and then talk about the mirror equilibrium. So in the Aussian problem where there are only cubiter, then this mirror equilibrium are the same with PS and E. But when we have, when we move to like an Aussian problem, We move to like an auction problem with more bidders that is greater than two, um, then this is uh, this mirror equilibrium are different than uh to the PS and E. Since, for example, we have bidder one, two, and three. Um, bidder one can think bit two has uh has one type of have a belief on bit three, and he can also think himself can hold a totally different belief on the bit three. So that's where the distinction comes from. Come from. I'm going to illustrate the properties of the mirror equilibrium. I'm going to show two propositions that is relative to the mirror equilibrium. So the first one says that in an asymmetric auction with common knowledge, if all type distributions are autonomous, continuous, and differentiable, except at a finite number of points, then there is a unique solution. There is a unique solution such that all the bidding functions are continuous. I'm going to sketch the proof over here. So let G1, G2, Gm denote a set of continuous type distribution that are differentiable except at Km points. Then for each of points xi at which gm are not differentiable, there is an open interval xi minus delta to xi plus delta. 2 Si plus delta, such that Gn is differentiable at all points except for that Si in the interval. Then we can replace the value of Gm on those intervals by a monotonic increasing differentiable function that is also differentiable at xi minus delta and xi plus delta. Then for each of those m, let g and m be constructed distributions described above for the intervals si minus delta. intervals s i minus delta over n to s i delta over m then for each of the m prime that is greater than m um we have the l2 norm square equal to the following integral and then we can rewrite this as the following summation of the integral and cal we are talking about um like a like a dist we are talking about a distribution therefore the maximum um the maximum discrimination The maximum discrepancy for this one is actually equal to one. And the width is two times two times delta over m. So we have the width over here. And because there are at most Kn points, so that's why we have the Kn over here. So we can have an upbound for this summation of integral. And then, therefore, for any epsilon that is greater than zero. epsilon if that is greater than zero the l2 um the l2 norm uh is less than uh epsilon for each l2 norm less than epsilon uh we can just choose m to be greater than um two times uh two times km divided by epsilon then we can have this l2 norm being bounded by um less than epsilon and therefore by cauchy convergence criteria this limit exists and this holds for all the gm Holds for all the GM. Therefore, each GMM is differentiable. And Lebron in 1999 proved that the corresponding bidding distribution FMM exists, and it is unique and is differentiable. He also showed that the existence of unique differentiable monotonic bidding functions, beta as a vector for this case, when all type distributions. When all type distributions are differentiable. Therefore, for the type distribution G1K, G2K up to GNK, there exists differentiable meaning functions beta1K, beta2K to beta NK. Each beta nk is non-negative and bounded above by V-bar, V-bar over here. And then monotonicity on the compact interval implies that the derivatives are uniformly bounded, and therefore epidemic. Bounded and therefore epic continuous by Azilla-Ascali theorem ensures that the sequence of beta 1k, beta2k up to beta nk also contains a convergent subsequence, and therefore its limit must be unique and almost everywhere differentiable. Therefore, we have the first proposition. The second proposition is immediately followed by the first one. It states that for each of the type distributions that are The type distributions that are almost everywhere differentiable. The memory equilibrium problem has a unique solution that is almost everywhere differentiable. From the first proposition, a common knowledge auction has a unique PS and E solution that is continuous and almost everywhere differentiable. Therefore, so Bita1 models each of his components analysis of an option as a common knowledge option. As a common knowledge option, although the different options may model the believings differently from the common knowledge. Hence, the big one finds a unique, continuous, and almost everywhere differentiable distributions for the bid of each of the options. Since there is an independent private value option, the product of these distributions determines bid1 spinning function, and therefore the product is continuous. The product is continuous and almost everywhere differentiable. Now, I'm going to move another alternative to the PSE, which is proposed by Stan and Wilson in 1994 and 1995. It's called level K-syncing. It's supposed that the options reasoning in a fashion of I think that you think that I think to a fixed depth of K-piles, a level zero thinker is non-stretched. zero thinker is non-strategic perhaps acting at random so that means like um if his or her value towards an item is v then he or she would bid a random proportion of that v such that it will result in a non non-negative utility towards him or her a level one thinker views his options as a level zero thinker and makes the best response to that model and a level two thinker models his options as a level one thinker and so on As a level one singer, and so on, so forth. To illustrate this framework, let's first start with a two-player argument. So bid1 might model bid2 as non-strategic, and bid one does not know that the fraction that the fraction or the value. So because bid1 model bit two as non-strategic, so he thinks that bit two is bidding a random proportion. Is bidding a random proportion to his or her value, but he doesn't really know this fraction, where this fraction comes from or the value. But he can have his own subjective distribution with densities HP and Gv for them. So one is stand for the fraction and the other stands for the value. Then Biden1 can calculate his distribution fx for bit Q's bit by the following double integral over here. Following double integral over here. Then bit one bit F star such that F star maximizes his own expected utility, where F0 over here is bit one's true value, which is the private value that Bit1 knows. Now let's move one step further to a three-play option without loss of generality. Generality, we stand with bit one. Now, suppose that bit one is a level two thinker who models all the other participants and level one thinkers. Now, bit one consider bit two and bit three separately. He assumes that bit two calculates F21 and F23 and makes the bit that maximize his expected utility against the maximum of the corresponding random variables, which has the Which has distribution F2 star. And bid 1 does the same calculation for bid 3 and finds the analogies F3 star. Finally, BI1 makes the bid that maximize his expected utility against the maximum of the two independent bits. One is from F2 star and the other one is from F3 star. I illustrate that in this following chart. So where the big one is then by B. The bit one is stand by B, sorry for the confusion, and this is bit two and bit three. So, bit one is a level two thinker, and he um he think that A is like a level one thinker, and he thinks C is a level one thinker. And in the bottom of the set game, everyone is looking for the PS and E. But after we got the PS and E at the bottom level, A stepped out of this PS and E solution. Out of this PSE solution by utilizing the solution that he thinks B will add and he thinks C will add, but that is all under bid one's thinking framework. And he take this two pieces of information to get his or her true bidding strategy according to his or her true value towards the item. And then we step out again, and B takes this piece of information, and similarly, he takes the same. Similarly, he takes the same information from the other side, FBC star or F31 star in the previous notation. And combining these two pieces of information and the bit one's two knowledge of this item, he got his final answers FB over here. So, this is how it works in a level two thinking framework. We have a numerical We have a numerical example for that. So we assume that bit one believes that all the participants think that all the types are triangular distribution, just for simplification. So every support is on zero and one. This is not necessary to be a common support. This is just for illustration purpose. And suppose bit one thinks, bit two thinks that his type distribution has a peak at one over seven, and that bit three's type has its peak at two over seven. Type has its peak at 2 over 7. Similarly, he believes that beta 3 thinks bitter1's type has its peak at 3 over 7 and bit 2's type at its peak at 4 over 7. Finally, bit 1 thinks beta 2's type has its peak at 5 over 7 and bit 3's type at its peak at 6 over 7. Additionally, bit 1 thinks that bit 2 believes that people bid a random fraction of their true value and that fraction has the And that fraction has the beta 91 distribution because at the bottom level, people model the others, the other, everyone else, as level zero, non-strategic being. So therefore, we need another layer of information, subjective belief about the fraction. And similarly, by the same reasoning, he thinks that beta 3 believes that the random fraction people bit has beta in one distribution. Then we can solve this. Can stop this. And this is the result that we got. And so, in the middle and the right, those are the results for at the very bottom, what Biddle 1 thinks about Biddle 2, their PS and ES. So this two PS and E solution. And this dotted line is Biddle 2's final response combining his two information about his vowel. Information about his value and this dollar line maximize bidder twos under what bid one thinking is the best strategy over here. And similarly, this is at the bottom of what bid one think bid three is looking for. And what bid one do in the end is he stepped out of the bottom level and he combined these two pieces of information together. So it's the dashed line and solid line over here. And finally, he combined with his two. And finally, he combined with his two value distribution towards the item and got the dotted line over here. So that is the final response for the bid one. Yeah, thank you. Thank you so much. That's all about this uncommon knowledge auction profits. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks. Thank you so much, E. That was lovely. And Ayu, I want to mention that E is extending the work that Tim Al did in his PhD. That Tim Al did in his PhD thesis. So she has advanced it from Tim's solution algorithm for a two-person auction to handle a novel auction problem in which you have three or more opponents and they do not have the same beliefs about each other. So that seems like a very realistic situation and it could easily arise in computational advertising where Advertising where different Wendy's McDonald's and Hardy's are all trying to bid to make a to display an ad for you. And Wendy's thinks that Hardy is going to bid, Hardy's is going to bid low, but McDonald's is going to be bidding high. But sorry, Wendy's thinks that Hardy's is going to bid low, but Wendy's also thinks that McDonald's thinks that Hardy's is going to bid high. Thinks that Hardees is going to bid high. So that's the situation we're in.
