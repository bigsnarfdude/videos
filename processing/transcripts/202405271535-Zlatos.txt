Okay, thank you, Peter, for the introduction and thanks to all the organizers for inviting me. I'm sorry I couldn't come in person, but at least remotely, it's a pleasure to speak at this conference. And so I'll talk about homogenization. And let's see, yeah, that works. So obviously. Obviously, we all know a lot about reaction diffusion equations and they model all kinds of reactive processes, combustion population dynamics, all kinds of others. And we often look at them in homogeneous environments, but frequently these kinds of processes don't really happen in homogeneous environments. So, for instance, Jean-Michel spoke earlier today about infections. About infections spreading through a geographic area. Well, you know, there are some differences in the speed how infection spreads through, let's say, a populated area versus some kind of less populated area. So in cities versus just the country, etc. So there is often some kind of inhomogeneity in the environment. Another example is forest fires. Example is forest fires spreading through an environment with different geographic features, different types of vegetation. So, all that has to be taken into account when one wants to model these processes. But in many situations, there is a first-order model which is homogeneous and can tell us a lot about the corresponding dynamic. And the question is: well, how well? And the question is: well, how well does it model the situations that are not homogeneous? And one consideration is that, well, if we have a large scale environment, large scale dynamic, large scale evolution, maybe all kinds of inhomogeneities in the environment could sort of average out over these long distances and long times, and maybe we could see some effectively homogeneous behavior. Homogeneous behavior and evolution in the process. And so that's the question, the main question of the topic of homogenization for all kinds of models, all kinds of PDEs, and in particular for reaction diffusion equations. And so what I'm talking about today is having a random environment or possibly periodic, which is not random but is also inhomogeneous. And so in the random situation, we have a reaction diffusion equation when there is a A reaction diffusion equation when there is a diffusion operator which you can think of as being a Laplacian, but also can be some other second-order operator with coefficients that depend on space for sure in many models, sometimes on time. For instance, if we have during a period of several years modeling something and the weather is changing and the climate is changing as well. And then, of course, there is a Well, and then of course there is another variable, which is a random variable, omega, which models the randomness. So there can be dependence on this, and of course, our usual dependence of the reaction function on the solution itself. And so we have this equation, and the question is: if we look at the large-scale dynamic of the set where the solution is close to one, so I'm thinking about the sort of standards. Thinking about the sort of standard situation when the solution is between zero and one. Zero and one are stationary states. The reaction vanishes at both for all Tx and omega. And so then we are asking how this set is spreading, this set where solution is close to one. And homogenization says that if you look at large-scale dynamic of this set, then it should be effectively homogeneous if you are in random media. So that's when homogenization happens. So that's when homogenization happens. Now, in a homogeneous medium, the spreading is well known for many reactions, and basically it's just spreading at a constant speed in all directions. And it shows, therefore, a linear growth. So we should somehow expect that we still have some kind of ballistic type growth in random media, and hopefully it will average out over large scale. Average out over large scales in space and time and give us effectively homogeneous behavior. Now, today I'm going to talk about KPP reactions, but we have also results for other reactions, in particular monostable ignition reactions. And so KPP satisfies this inequality that the reaction is below its tangent line if we just look at it as a function of u and fix t and x and function of u and fix t and x and omega. So it's tangent line at zero. So u times constant, the constant is derivative of f with respect to u at u equals zero. Okay, and so when we want to look at this ballistic scaling, so linear in space and time, and we want to look at large scales, that means we need to scale the whole equation and the inhomogeneities. And the inhomogeneities so that in the old scaling, in the original scaling, large distances become size one, and also large times becomes size one. Okay, so the scaling you do is something like this, where epsilon is a small parameter. And this is not too important. This is what you get when you do that scaling. Okay, so I'm not going to talk about this in detail, but the point here is that homogenization then is something like this. We take this u epsilon, which is the We take this u epsilon, which is the solution for the equation where size 1 distance is really in the original problem size 1 over epsilon, so very large distance. And so, and we take an initial condition, which is going to be, let's say, a characteristic function of some set in this. So, this is a unit-sized set, but originally it would be a very large-sized set. And why is it a characteristic function? Because we Characteristic function because we somehow expect that the transition between the regions where the solution is close to one and where it's close to zero is going to be not too large as time progresses. And therefore, in the large scale scenario, when we are zooming out and looking at large scales, the transition layer will be very thin. So the solution hopefully will look closer and closer to just a characteristic function of a set, which is going to be spreading. Which is going to be spreading with time or propagating somehow with time. So, initial condition makes sense to take something like that, so close to a characteristic function of some set G. And then we are asking when we take epsilon to zero, how do the solutions, when we now let this dynamic run, how do the solutions look like? And homogenization would be the statement that. The statement that as epsilon goes to zero, the solution converges to a characteristic function of some space-time set, which depends, of course, on the initial data. And that convergence happens almost surely in omega in the random variable. And so, as a result, then the homogenized dynamic, again, if it holds, would basically be a set evolution. We start with We start with some set at initial time zero. Characteristic function of this set is the initial condition. And then the solution at every given time looks like some larger set. And therefore, it's going to be in the limit epsilon goes to zero characteristic function of a space-time set. Okay, so now when you think about it for a bit, you realize that this set evolution would have to be local. Would have to be local, even in fact, and this is true, even if we have even results for non-local diffusion version of this equation. So, when this diffusion operator is non-local. And so even in that case, because we are looking at large-scale phenomena, the diffusion operator will ends up end up or should end up being local in the limit of large scale, because even non-local operators. Large scale, because even non-local operators have kernels that fall off. And so, in that large scale, it will just end up becoming local. And therefore, again, if you once you get some experience with reaction diffusion equations, you realize that basically what it should be, if there is a limit of this evolution as epsilon goes to zero, should be an evolution which obeys this equation. Obeys this equation. It's a first-order equation, so it's a very different equation from the second-order reaction-diffusion equation. And essentially, it just tells me that the level sets of the solutions of this equation are spreading with speed C star, and the speed depends on the direction. And so we take the normal vector, this is the normal vector to the level set, and this is the speed with which the level. This is the speed with which the level study is spreading. And that ends up being the only thing that sort of makes sense. So you should be looking for something like this in the limit if there is a limiting evolution. And the speech will be obviously deterministic because, again, as we take everything over large scales, then the heterogeneities of the environment should average out. And so this should be the averaged out speed in a particular direction in this direction. Speed in a particular direction in this direction. And so this is a Hamilton-Jacobic PD. And moreover, the solutions we are looking at for this PDE are discontinuous because, remember, they are characteristic functions of some space-time set. So they are solutions in a weak sense. In fact, they are viscosity solutions and not just regular but discontinuous viscosity solutions. And there is a theory for this, so we can solve this equation for. Equation for with that kind of initial data and for those kinds of solutions. And now the question is: so how to prove something like this, that the evolution, the large-scale evolution for the reaction diffusion equation, would really converge to the evolution for this Hamilton-Jacobi equation. And so, our first idea is to look To look at a special, we could call it a fundamental solution of this equation. And that's a solution that starts from a single point. And that solution corresponds to a solution of the reaction diffusion equation, so this one in the original scaling, which starts from some kind of initial. Some kind of initial character, initial set, which, of course, after we scale it down will end up being a point as we take epsilon to zero. And looking how that set evolves over time. And so, again, of course, the solution is now a function. It's not a characteristic function of a set. It's a smooth function. But we can look at the level set, let's say, one half of this solution. Of this solution and ask how it looks like. And so it will be spreading, of course, if there is spreading built into the system, for example, if the reaction is non-negative. And what happens over time? Well, after a very long time, these perturbations or this variation of the level set is going to sort of wash out. It's not going to go away, but it's going to become smaller and smaller relative to the size of the hole. To the size of the whole level set. So the level set is growing with linear speed in time. And hopefully, this needs to be proved, but hopefully these oscillations, variations here of the level set will be growing with a slower rate in a random environment. Of course, if it's a random environment, not periodic, for example, then these oscillations will grow. They will not be... These oscillations will grow. They will not be just of one in time, but they hopefully will grow at a slower rate. And so, if you wait for a long time, hopefully you will see something like this for the level set. And, you know, you can think of a forest fire, you sort of see the same thing. If you look at a small scale, then you see all these variations. But if you then zoom out, look at a large scale, then this line will look pretty straight. Pretty straight. So, and so this shape, if it exists, is called a wolf shape and wolf shape for the original PD. And that wolf shape would then correspond for this scaled or hopefully homogenized limit of the PDE to a solution which starts from an initial point, so the set G is just a point, and then grows linear. Grows linearly with time. So that means the space-time set, which corresponds to this initial condition being just a point, is the set in space-time, which at any given time t is t times the wolf shape. Because that's what we would expect, even if the time is short. Remember, this is for in the scale for this equation. So in the original equation, that's going to be a very long time. The solution should look like some multiple of the wolf shape, in particular. Multiple of the wolf shape, in particular t times s, times the scaling factor, which is one over epsilon. So one over epsilon, of course, goes to infinity. So now, before I continue, let me just mention a couple of things here. There are two arrows drawn here. So this wolf shape, if we are looking at the growth of this with time, we can ask about two speeds in every direction. In direction E, there is the spreading speed, so this is S star, and that's So this is S star, and if this is the origin, then that's the length of this vector. This is, of course, the wolf shape, the unit wolf shape. So length of this vector is exactly the spreading speed in this direction. But that may be and usually is different, except for let's say isotropic environment, from the front speed, which may or may not exist, but if it exists, is no less than the length of this vector, which The length of this vector, which is we take the point on the wolf shape, which has a normal vector e, and then draw a tangent line and draw the parallel line through the origin. And this length is going to be the lower bound for the front speed if the front speed exists. We are in a random environment, so it's not even clear what exactly front speeds are. I will not define that for you here, but there is a way to define it and There is a way to define it, and we have situations when we can prove the existence of front speeds. And so, this is because when you are looking at this wolf shape, and we are just growing it with time, so you know, take it to be Ts at time t, then this point is, as the wolf shape is growing, is moving with the speed C star e. And by just a comparison principle, one can show that if there is a front speed, then it has to be at least that much. On the other hand, if we are. That much. On the other hand, if we are growing this with the same speed, this point is moving in this direction with the speed s star e. Okay, so that's about the wolf shape, which is a sort of a fundamental solution. And so now let me come to some results, but just a very quick few comments on to set them up. So I'm talking about KPP reactions and So, I'm talking about KPP reactions, and for KPP reactions, we of course know that when they are homogeneous, the front speed exists in all directions, is the same, and it's 210 squared of f times zero. So that's, of course, very well known for over 80 years now. And an interesting thing is that if you look at all kinds of other results that have been achieved for KPP reactions with non-homogeneous With non-homogeneous reactions, then the propagation speed, even in deterministic situations, always depends on this reaction F in all these results only through the derivative at zero. That's because you end up linearizing, and it turns out for KPP, the linearized problem determines the speed basically. There are situations where it's not quite that, but the dependence is still. When it's not quite that, but the dependence is still only through f derivative at zero. And so it's, we call this the dynamic is pulled, and it's because the reaction rate, which is the ratio of f and u, which is the exponential growth rate for the ODE in time, if we just ignore all the spatial variables, if we take a solution which starts with value close to zero. So this reaction rate is the strongest at UE. Rate is the strongest at u equals zero. So that's the reason the KP dynamic is pulled. And nevertheless, even though this statement has been observed in all previous results, there was no formal result stating this. And if I have time, I'll mention that at the end of this talk. So this is a new result as well. And so very quickly, the hypotheses are the A, which is the diffusion matrix, is uniformly elliptic, the B, Form the elliptic, the B, which is the drift vector, the advection vector, there is some upper bound on this, this turn in terms of the ellipticity constant, in terms of the u derivative of f at u equals zero, the infimum of that. This is necessary, otherwise those results would not hold. And finally, the reaction has some kind of lower bound. So it's a KPP reaction, but after KPP reactions, but F divided by its derivative at u equals zero has to be, of course, less than or equal to u. That's what KPP means. Also, it has to be greater or equal than GU, where G is some other KPP reaction with one derived at zero being one. So obviously, some kind of uniformity is necessary to obtain results, and this is the most natural hypothesis. And finally, what I mentioned up here has to do with this. Has to do with this picture. When we have a reaction function f, we can define a sort of default or template reaction function with the same derivative at zero at u equals zero. And it's this one here. I will call it f prime. You just take the derivative at zero at u equals zero and multiply by minimum of u and one minus u and gives you this kind of roof type of graph. And it turns out the results I present to you will give the present to you will give the same, will be the same for this reaction F and for its template F prime, which only shares the same derivative at u equals zero. So that will show the explain this statement here. Okay, so let me just tell you the first result here. And this is for time independent or time periodic. Or time periodic, but random in space. So stationary ergodic in space specifically, stationary ergodic is the minimum one needs to have any kind of almost sure result for random media. So this is again a standard assumption. And basically the result is that under the above hypothesis, we do have homogenization. And in fact, it's a very simple, very simple result or very simple characterization of this. Characterization of this limiting sets set. So basically, the set that we get in the homogenized evolution. You start with your initial set. And if you want to know how does the set where the solution is close to one at a later time t look like, or for the homogeneous equation where the solution is exactly one, how does it look like? Well, you just add t times the wolf shape. So here's a picture. Imagine that this set. Imagine that this set here, this pentagon, is your initial set G, where the solution is one initially, or for the reaction diffusion equation where the solution is close to one. And you're asking, well, how does that set look like after time t? Just take every point of this set and take a wolf shape times t around it. And the wolf shape is some convex set which contains the origin. Set which contains the origin. And so you just basically put it there and then take the union of all these sets, and that's where your solution will be close to one or equal to one for the homogenized equation. Okay, so and that's the statement here. So if you take epsilon to zero in the pre-homogenized equation, so in the original reaction diffusion equation, then your solutions will be very close to the characteristic functions of this space-time set, which has a very simple. Space-time set, which has a very simple expression here. And this limit is locally uniform everywhere, except of this transition region between values 0 and 1 for the solution, because of course the solution of the reaction diffusion equation is continuous, so there is a smooth transition between 0 and 1, whereas the limiting solution is discontinuous, so there cannot be uniform convergence everywhere. But this is the minimal set where we have to assume, that we have to exclude in order to get a result. In order to get a result. And so, indeed, that result is true. And that's for almost every omega. So the best you could hope for. And I want to just spend a minute or two quickly mentioning some previous results here. So, in fact, this result I am telling you, not quite, not with this nice description of the limiting dynamic, but just with some kind of Dynamic, but just with some kind of homogenization, was stated in a paper by Leon Suganidis, but it was for a time-independent reaction, but it was not proved there. And so this is the first proof of such a result. There were some other results by myself, Jessica Lean, and myself and Paul Jank. And by the way, this previous result. And by the way, this previous result is mine, but a lot of this work was joined with Paul. So, about stationary ergodic ignition reactions in dimensions less than equal to three, but there were some limits on that. With Paul, we had finite spatial ranges of dependence. With Jessica, we need to assume isotropic reactions. There were some other reactions for periodic models, Alpha or Gelati for monostable, and myself with Jessica for ignition. There were Myself with Jessica for ignition. There were many other results, but not about homogenization, but about wolf shapes or front speeds. Goethe and Freylin, many, many years ago, and since then, Sheen, Berstick, Hammel, Weinberger, and many others. I don't have time to mention all of these. A nice thing about this result I just mentioned is also that not only we have homogenized dynamic, but also we have existence of fronts and a very nice formula for a front speed. Nice formula for the front speed. It's given straight from the wolf shape. So basically, what it means is that on this picture here, this length is the front speed. The front speed exists and is not strictly larger than that. It's exactly this length. So this wolf shape tells you the front speeds in all the directions. You just need to take the corresponding tangent line. Okay, and I think I'm almost out of time. So let me just give you a very quick Give you a very quick slide here on another result, which is joined with Paul Zhang. And this is for time-dependent reactions. Basically, all these results I mentioned to you before are for time-independent reactions. In fact, most of them are also for just the Laplacian being the diffusion operator and all of action. But definitely, there is no time-dependence. And in fact, even in the homogenization. And in fact, even in the homogenization of other models, like Hamilton-Jacobi equations, there are some issues with time-dependent models when the Hamiltonian is not convex and coercive. So here's a first result where the time dependence is not just periodic in time. It turns out periodic in time is sort of similar to just independent of time. And basically, what we can do is that if We can do is that if there is some kind of temporal range decrease in temporal dependence of events, so basically, if you take two events, F and E, here we go, F and E, and event E is measurable with respect to the sigma algebra generated by the random environment up to time t, so from minus infinity to time t, and f is measurable with respect to the sigma algebra generated by the random environment starting from time t. Environment starting from time t plus s and going to infinity. So there's this gap of size s. And if you are asking what's the probability of f just itself versus given the e, so the event e happened. Okay, so the conditional probability. And you look at the difference and you take supreme of this whenever there is gap s, you call this phi s, right? So if this is You call this phi s, right? So if this is zero for some s, that just means there is a finite temporal range of dependence for this environment. But we can have it, we have results when this temporal range, this phi s just goes to zero. So the dependence decreases as events are separated in time, but doesn't go to zero. And so the result is the following: that this previous theorem, these statements in this theorem, carry over to Carry over to space-time stationary random environments as long as this phi decreases at some algebraic rate. It doesn't matter what, just some slow algebraic rate. And if it just decreases at some rate, then we have a slightly weaker statement. It's the same statement, but the limit holds only in probability, not almost surely, which is slightly different, but it's Is slightly different, but it still basically tells you that with probably close to one, this homogenization happens. And so, as I said, this is the first result for space-time-dependent reactions. And so, let me just do one last slide. So, as I mentioned, the wolf shape, existence of wolf shape, is the first step in the proof. And if we have And if we have time independence or time periodic reactions, one can use the famous Kingman stability-Vergodic theorem in the proof of the existence of wolf shape. But there is no such thing, or at least there was no such thing for time-stochastic reactions or time-stochastic media in general. And so actually, with Paul, we wrote a paper that is a pure probability paper. It appeared in the Electronic Journal of Probability last year, where we generalized this Kingman-subjective ergodic theorem for time. Ergodic theorem for time-dependent environments. And so that's the first step. And finally, the second step is then to show that the homogenized dynamic from the wolf shape carries over to the general initial condition, not just a point. And that's using this statement that I mentioned to you before, this theorem, which is a result of mine, which says, again, I don't want to spend more time on this, but it basically says that you can just take initial condition of a KPP reaction diffusion function. Of a KPP reaction diffusion function, and you can change the reaction to this template reaction, and the leading order of the dynamic will stay the same. That means the leading order of dynamic depends only on the derivative at u equals zero. And moreover, you can do even more. You can take the initial condition, you could also split it into little cubes and or little squares, whatever, little ellipses, and just solve them separately. And just solve them separately, and then that will also tell you how the solution looks like for the full initial condition, even though the equation is not linear. So it's a sort of linear linearity for the equation, even though it's a non-linear equation. And I can see Peter already standing there. So I think it's time to stop. So that's it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Hungary. It's almost time to start the next lecture, so we'll let one question. Question from the audience or online? Yeah, may I ask a question? Do you hear? Go ahead. Discontinuous viscosity solutions of Hamiltonian Covey equations, and there is a theory for that. What do you have in? Theory for that. What do you have in mind there? Well, so there are papers which discuss solutions to these kind of equations. And you have to have a whole sort of technology for this. So the viscosity solutions usually deal with having continuous solutions and defining solutions in And defining solution in terms of touching it from below and from above, so you define sub-solution and super-solution in those ways. And then you say a solution is something that is super solution and a sub-solution at the same time. And the thing is, you do still the same thing. So you touch with these parabolas or paraboloids these solutions from above and below, but they are discontinuous. So what you need to do is. What you need to do is that you make the function either lower semi-continuous or upper semi-continuous by instead of taking the function, you take limits of all points converging to a point and then taking the limin for this lim sub and making that the value of the function at that point. And then you can define what a sub-solution and super solution is. And then you can again say a solution is something that is both a sub-solution and a super solution. Is something that is both a sub-solution and a super solution. And it sort of agrees with the usual viscosity solutions theory, but extends to these discontinuous ones. I don't know whether this answers the question you want to. If you want, you can email me. I can send you some references for that. There may be some, there are some even in our papers. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. Right, thank you again.
