Thank you. Thank you, Mayenka. Thank you, also, Kumar, for organizing these wonderful workshops. And I'm really grateful and honored to be presenting here today from Paris. So for those of you who don't know me, I'm Damir Jurik. I'm a researcher at the CNRS in Researcher at the CNRS in France for the last 16 years or so. And for the last, well, last year and the next year, I'll be a fellow at DAMPT in Cambridge and working with Colin Caulfield on various projects. But so I'm splitting my time between the UK and France. My collaborators for most of this work are listed here, Jalal Shergui, who Jalal Shergi, who you can see in the photo here on the right, or on the left actually, and Seongwan Shin in the middle. And this was taken in one of the ICMF conferences in Korea. So today I'd like to talk to you about an overview of the work we have done and are still doing in multi-phase flows. In multi-phase flows. And really, today I want to focus on the two aspects of M5, which would be multi-phase and multiphysics. So the title, sorry, it sounds a little presumptuous, but really, I just want to present some of the work we've been doing over the years in multi-phase flows in a wide variety. In multi-phase flows, in a wide variety of applications. And what I'll talk to you today about is a little bit about what methods we're using and how we do it, and then a lot of examples. I won't go into too much mathematical detail. A lot of this is all published. So that can be found with a lot of rigorous detail. And some of it is just brand new, just has been developed. Has been developed by us. So I'll indicate that as the talk goes on. So basically, two main themes: the numerics and then examples. Again, this is the approach we use is direct numerical simulation. So the ingredients of our approach is first of all to use a simple domain and a simple mesh. So, that right there has been our overarching philosophy towards computing. As much as possible, simplify things. So, right off the bat, we start off with uniform Cartesian Mac mesh. This is about as standard as you can get. Mac meshes from Frank Harlow in Los Alamos, where I'd spent a couple of years, and Cartesian meshes. And Cartesian meshes, which are essentially the simplest thing you can design as far as meshing, essentially takes zero time to mesh a domain. And our domains are simple, just rectangular 3D domains. So having said that, now we get into the more complex things. We have complex objects. These could be fluid phases or could be solids. And these are These are generally treated with a variety of methods under the umbrella of immersed boundary methods. We have, I'll explain this in the next slide, a hybrid front tracking level set approach for the fluid phases. And for the solid geometry, we make extensive use of the idea of a distance function to be able to handle complex. able to handle complex geometries in our simple domains. And then after that we couple a lot of physics, continually trying to add physics to our methods. So we have lately worked a lot on complete fluid structure interaction with elastic objects, even solid objects, surfactants, non-Newtonian flows, turbulence, albeit just one. Albeit just one well-known turbulence model and phase change, which is kind of leftover from my PhD days at University of Michigan. And finally, to make this all work reasonably, we have to go to high performance computing. And of course, now that's continuing in the direction of using GPUs and things like that. And things like that. But so far, it's CPU-intensive high-performance computing on generally thousands of cores, even though the code we use works on hundreds of thousands of cores. So I don't really need to put up this equation. It's a one-fluid formulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. That's our basic solver for the fluid aspect. Fluid aspects. And the marker function plays the role of distinguishing between phases and allows us to define densities and viscosities. The two approaches, the reason it's hybrid is that we have front tracking as our main method that allows us to get very high precision on quantities like the surface tension and the affection of the. And the affection of the fluid interfaces. And then, for ease of handling the myriad topology changes that invariably happen in multi-phase flows, we also incorporate level sets in the idea of having a distance function that naturally handles topology change. So, essentially, summarizing this for the front tracking, we like it because of the mass. The front tracking, we like it because of the mass conservation, the idea of very high precision surface tension, no parasitic occurrence. And we also have built in a contact model in case that's necessary. And the other aspect of level sets is published in our method called level contour reconstruction. And essentially, it's a way of reconstructing all. It's a way of reconstructing all of these front-tracked triangles from time to time. So, we have in the past focused on the canonical problems of drop splash and multi-phase flows of that kind, as you see here on laptops, on supercomputers, on 4000 processors, and things like that. But what I want to show you now is. But what I want to show you now is further what we've been working on in a variety of examples. And these involve complex geometries invariably and solid objects that could be doing many interesting things. So I'll start with microfluidics as first example. Here we want to study the flow in those very small channels. In this picture on the right is a dolomite chip and we're Right is a dolomite chip, and we're interested in the junction here between three incoming flow streams and one outgoing stream. This zone here is the junction called the cross junction, and it has definite dimensions in this chip. And we wanted to try to reconstruct this in our simple domain, but using this idea of immersed boundaries, where we Of immersed boundaries where we can construct exactly this geometry using predefined primitive objects, so planes, torus, sphere, cylinder. We can combine these using union intersection operations and surprisingly construct very complex objects like this object out of these parts and their distance functions. So here is the Uh, the computational domain with our solid object in it, with uh, the orange representing the uh the continuous phase. The gray is the introduced main flow trying to go through this cross-junction. Now, if we focus on what's going on in this cross-junction, the next slides compare some experimental work done at UCL in London with our With our simulations at the top and bottom. And this is a flow map of what to expect when we have different ratios of the flows of the inner and outer phase through this cross-junction. So you could get plugs, pancakes, jets, and so forth. And this is kind of what it looks like in action, depending on the ratios of the. On the ratios of the flows. So you see, you have plugs, jets, little pancake-like objects, and then little drops that are actually fit within the channel themselves. So that was at this regime, microfluidic low-Reynolds number regime, our code works very well. You can even get very highly detailed information. Out of these simulations, the structure of these of the flow with these intricate vortices, the pinch off, the coalescence, recoalescence. You see a lot of detail and structure in this. So for this regime, our code is very confident in how this works, including these complex solid objects. Moving on to To a little bit more complicated situation, and you have the same thing, except now you're introducing two different fluid phases. So you have a total of three fluid phases. And in this configuration, you're introducing a drop within a drop. You're creating a drop within a drop. So this encapsulation is very important for many applications. This is another aspect of the flexibility of our. The flexibility of our code. Continuing on with the theme of complex geometry, we might want to also look at something that is called a static mixer, very commonly used in chemical process operations. Essentially, you're trying to force a multi-phase flow through this labyrinthine object, solid object. Object, solid object that we can actually construct in the same way with we did the cross junction. And so if we introduce now this multi-phase flow, let it flow through there. This is what we get. I'll show you this in a sort of a video sense of how tortuous the flow can become and how you create a finely dispersed. A finely dispersed multi-phase flow. And the idea, of course, is to use this in optimizing the design of these static mixers for optimizing pressure drop for display. You can construct again in the same way out of these primitive objects complicated tanks with baffles and inlets and outlets. Tanks with baffles and inlets and outlets and even impellers to stir the fluid. And in this vein, we focused on stirring using pitch blade impellers. And in this case, we're creating a vinaigrette out of oil and water. So, if you watch what happens as the impeller spins, it draws down the oil into the water in a Water in a classic vortex funnel. And let's add a couple of seconds. But essentially, you're creating a mixture of vinegar. Sort of give you a foreshadowing of some aspects later in the Aspects later in this talk, I'll just show you the same kind of thing, same simulation on the left as you saw before, but in the other three panels, we've introduced surfactants to the interface. And now you can see what happens at different levels of beta, which is the coupling of the interface surfactant to the surface tension. So you can get an idea of how. How the surfactant at the interface affects the flow, the drop size distribution, and so forth. So now we've introduced solid objects that are static, that are in fixed motion, either rotational or translation motion. And we can also introduce these solid objects by reading in stereo. Reading in stereolithography files, which are essentially triangular format, which is what we do with front tracking, anyways. We use triangles for interfaces. So it's very natural. So for example, you would read in the STL file on the left of this mug, and we would then be able to convert this to our required triangulation of the interface. As you can see, the main difference here is that for flat surfaces, For flat surfaces, the STL file has very few triangles, and we would need triangles that are roughly the size of the underlying Eulerian mesh. You can also read in objects and be a little bit whimsical and pretend that you are simulating a multi-phase flow around the Tori Fell. Nothing prevents us from calling... It prevents us from calling the solid structure that you see here instead of solid, calling it a gas or a liquid and seeing what happens. And so, this is really something that highlights the flexibility of our approach, especially when we want to work with even more increasingly complex solid shapes. Now, the complete fluid structure. The complete fluid structure interaction problem here is really demonstrated by some simple calculations done on very, not very resolved meshes, just to give an idea. These were just toy problems. But this is air and water with a solid object that is less dense than water falling through air onto the air-water interface. The air-water interface. So there you have the splash since it is buoyant, it will rise, and you have activated the contact line modeling. So you see that interaction there. You can likewise have a mixture of fixed rotating objects with free floating objects. And finally, we've worked. Finally, we've worked in the last year or so on introducing solid objects with an elasticity component calculated by using, resolving the three components of the left partial green stress. And here, as a toy problem, flow across a cylinder with a flexible plate. A flexible plate behind it, and here in the more common formices or more common street is deforming the flexible solid. And this toy problem is a fiber that is flapping in an oscillatory flow. Those are some 2D toy problems, but we've also wanted to extend this to 3D naturally. This is to 3D naturally, and this would be a flexible cantilever. This is now full multi-phase air, water, and a flexible solid. Dropped it bouncing on this guiding board essentially and deforming and dropping. This is one example of one other toy problem we just calculated. Problem adjusts calculated of a drop being forced upwards to hit this free, in this case, free the free object, a rectangular bar. And here the interaction is to bend the bar through the impact of the drop, and then everything falls down and hits the walls of the domain and deforms. Walls of the domain and empty forms. So we have worked on this lately. This is our really some of the latest things we've introduced into the method. This I'll go through rather quickly because I'm not sure if I have a lot of time. I will just introduce the fact that we've worked on a lot of jet flows with a study of what happens. Study of what happens in this multi-phase flow with either liquid gas jets. Essentially, this is something that you've seen a lot of in the great work using Basilisk and Jeris by Stefan Porkina. And we've also looked at this. We don't have the AMR capability that they do. So we're limited in resolution. But we do look at liquid-liquid jets and look. And look at aspects of that in terms of studying in detail the morphology of the jets, the hairpin vortices that we've identified. And here you can see the flow of, the roll-up flow of this mushroom cap, and the formation of all of these intricate structures essentially being carried on, carried in into this world. Into this well. And eventually the cap of this mushroom breaks up in whole development. Let me skip over a lot of this in the interest of time. We have ligament formation. We want to look at holes, tearing, ligament formation, all these various details and some validation to show that we do have a good comparison with the A good comparison with the canonical Eger solution for a ligament pinch-off. These are the surfactant equations that we've introduced coupled with Navier-Stokes. And we looked at the drop size distribution comparing with clean surfaces versus contaminated. Let me move on to this other. There's other other things, falling films, and things like that. But one interesting new aspect of our research is in biomedical flows. So here we partnered with Sarah Waters and the Mathematical Institute at Oxford in looking at how kidney stones could be removed using laser ablation. And the previous work in their group was just the 2D steady state. 2D steady state analysis of a simple domain. And we extended that to a 3D spherical domain to give a simplified geometry to a part of the kidney physiology. And looking at the trajectory of some of these stones as they circulate around as a jet of Of of fluid is used to try to wash up these stones. So you see here we've simulated in a spherical cavity, which is nice, but what we really want to do is use our STL capability and read in actual patient data and look at what happens to these, again, idealized spherical stones as a jet of fluid is a. Jet a fluid is attempting to wash them out of the part of the kidney. So, this is a promising work, and we're getting increasingly realistic with this simulation. Last topic really is looking at a project at DAMP with Colin Caulfield, and this has to do with, again, idealized version of microplastics in the ocean. This is alluding to Mona Ra. Alluding to Mona Ramani's talk yesterday on microplastics, but here we're using DNS to look at individual spheres. And then a recent article came about in Physics of Fluids, calling this phenomenon here an internal splash, where you have a sphere falling in a stratified fluid, essentially a miscible mixture of Of water with saline below it. And what happens to this sphere as it falls, it hits this miscible interface and doesn't just monotonically descend, it resurfaces a little bit, if you'd like to put it that way, and has sort of this internal splash, they call it. So this indicates that. They call it so this indicates that at stratified interfaces in the ocean, curious behavior of settling particles could occur, especially if you have multiple particles and how this might affect the sedimentation of not only microplastics, but in biogenic materials, and how in turn these settling characteristics might affect the internal internal. The internal internal layers in the ocean. So, this is a new topic just getting started. So, in the interest of time, I'll end there with a list of, partial list of collaborators. Laurette Tuckerman mostly work on Faraday waves, which I haven't had time to talk about here, but it's a favorite topic of mine. It's a very, very rich area of theory. Each area of your dominance. And of course, the following list, I include Tomislav, who will be talking next, who we've had a great collaboration with, really wanted to extend capabilities of not only R code, but also OpenFOM, which he's an expert at, to marry the two strengths of those methods. And finally, I'll leave you with. And finally, leave you with a chocolate fountain as another sort of whimsical simulation, but also showing that this is relevant to a lot of chemical engineering processes. This is a heated chocolate. So here on the right frame, you see the temperature plumes of this heated chocolate as it falls. I have the falls, and at the end, the last tray of chocolate is not quite well enough resolved by acceleration. But in essence, this is a study you see at APS more and more, the chocolate fountain. So, I will end with that by saying that we have other things that we're interested in before. With this numerical methodology, it has a lot of flexibility, and that is, I think, due to the fact that we started with our philosophy of simple domain and simple underlying mesh, and then adding complexity on top of that. So, thank you very much for your attention. This is just a kind of a summation of the different. A summation of the different capabilities in the code and funding agencies, computing time, and what we're working on next, adaptive mesh refinement, machine learning. In fact, we're submitting a paper on that right now. Adding compressibility to the code and other physics. So, really trying to put in as much as we can. So, thank you very much for your attention, and I'll be glad to take any questions. I'll be glad to take any questions. Well, thank you, Damir. Let's, for the interest of time, start taking questions right here. Folks on the Zoom, could you post your questions either in the chat box or you can unmute yourselves right after the talk? So questions. Well, your visualizations and animations are very incredible. Let me put it that way. Let me put it that way. So let me. So many things. Nothing, I guess. It's been a lot of years of work on this. Yeah. So what I would ask is in this case of your kidney stone thing, why is jet just always in the impinging manner? Is there no swirl or vertical swirl? So you could see it. Verticals also, you could see in the patient-specific data, some of the particles were in the side, and you would not see the jet go and then get reach to those kidney stones, right? Like this one. Yeah, yeah, if you would add a salt to it, it might actually have some chance. Yeah, this is a good question because this is exactly what some of these clinicians were interested in. Our first attempt was to look at this nozzle in a co-author. In a coaxial axisymmetric initial introduction. But after this, the question quickly arose, what happens if you have an off-center jet, if you have this catheter, essentially, that they introduced, would also include a small laser and a camera. So there is necessarily a lot of things packed into this small space. So that would also. Small space. So that would also, we could work on including that and maybe even including the heating of the fluid as it tries to uplate these stones. The idea is to use the laser to basically break up, to find dust, these stones, called dusting, essentially. And it's one of the newer techniques of kidney stone removal. And then once you have it. And then, once you have these stones dusted and small enough that they can get washed out by this serum that's introduced, this saline serum. Okay. That's a great question because there are many, many different parameters that we could look at in this rich area. Excited to continue with. Fantastic. Thank you, Damir. That seems like Tomislav Maris is waiting for us. Tomislav Maric is waiting for us. So we'll thank you for your talk. And hopefully, next workshop, we're going to see you in person. All right. Thank you. Thank you very much for organizing. All right. So our next speaker is Professor Marich. And Thomas Love, could you share your screen?
