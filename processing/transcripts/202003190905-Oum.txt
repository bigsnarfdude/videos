I'd like to thank the organizers for making this opportunity. This is a unique opportunity for me and for all of us to give a talk at home. All right. So the title of this talk is Three Degenerate Induced Subgraph of Planar Graph. And this is joint work with Testart and Chihao. And Chihao and Sujingju. Yeah, it's 12 o'clock here in Korea. So this project started a long, long time ago when Soo Ding was visiting KAIST for a colloquium talk in 2011. And the paper was finally finished this year, so it took like nine years. It took like nine years, so it's uh, it took longer than any other project that I ever had. So, let me start from the definitions. I think all of us know what k-degenerate graph is, but just to make sure that we are on the same page, I will just retrain the definition. So, the graph is k-degenerate if every non-nerd subgraph has a Every non-Neural subgraph has a vertex of degree at most k. Or you can also describe it as following: so the resist ordering of vertices, so that every pi has a most k neighbors in v1 up to vi minus one. So zero degenerate graphs are exactly graphs without edges, one degenerate graph. Edges one degenerate graphs are forest and two degenerate graphs are graphs with i mean having vertex of degree and most two at each time whenever you can delete i mean you can delete a vertex of degree two and then in the remaining you can find another vertex of degree mos2 etc so you can continue this and uh this is a paper by nobody loan jeffkan for semer in Jeff Khan Persimmer in 1987, and they studied the problem of finding a de-degenerate induced subgraph in a graph. And one of the theorems in that paper is about the largest induced de-degenerate subgraph in a general graph. So let me explain the theorem. Uh the theorem. So let's say alpha d of g is the maximum is the number of vertices in the largest d-degenerate induced subgraph of g and then they prove that if graph has average degree d bar and no vertex of has no vertex of degree less than d then the alpha Then the alpha d is at least this quantity. And by using Jensen's inequality or Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, you can easily show that this number is at least d plus 1 over d bar plus 1 times n. So, and this is type because we can think of the case when d bar is integer. And in that case, this number. This number is tight because of the disjoint union of complete graphs. Now, yeah, there's a small catch. When you read this paper, you have to be careful that their definition of D degenerate is a bit different. So I marked it here. So it's not smaller than, but now people usually call it at most D, but Okay, so many people are showing up now. All right. Yeah, so, but anyway, if we prove in their theorem for planar graphs, then we know that planar graphs, well, I mean, I can assume that our graph is a plane triangulation, so d bar is going to be the average degree is going to be six minus some small number. number and then we have this lower bound for alpha zero and alpha one two three four but of course these lower bounds are far from being optimal because they're inequalities for arbitrary graphs but anyway well we we get something yeah is everyone all right many people are showing up Many people are showing up now. Okay. All right. So, this is the definition of alpha D. So, we want to find the largest D-degenerate induced subgraph in the graph. And in that paper, in the last page, they mention some interesting problems. So, one So, one case that they mentioned is for planar graphs. So, what can we do if graph G is a planar? Can you do better inequality? So, what I'm going to show you is one result towards that direction. Namely, yeah, so let's say tau of d is the best possible constant. is the best possible constant so that the arc of d is at least tau of d times n for any n vertex planar graph. Of course, planar graphs are 5 degenerate, so if d is 5, then this is meaningless. You can take a 1. So the only interesting problems are from 0 to 4. And what we prove this for the case when these three For the case when D is three. So the theorem that I'm gonna discuss is this theorem that every planar graph has a 3D generate induced subgraph on this many vertices. So the number of vertices we are aiming is five over seven times M. Is everything clear? If you have any questions, please let me know. All right. But before going into this theorem, I will give some survey of what's known for this problem. And then I will show you the idea of the proof. And then at the end of the talk, I will talk about some open problems. All right, so some survey. So what's known for different values of D? So, if we take a D to be zero, so if we are looking for zero degenerate induced subgraph of planar graph, then of course, if I faucal theorem, we always have a stable set of size, quarter of the number of vertices. And this is best possible because of the graph here, K4. I was wondering whether there's any. I was wondering whether there's any theorem or anyone can prove this without using full-color theorem. And at least I found two papers discussing that. So the optimum is going to be 0.25. The best known so far is, it seems that it's 0.23. So that's the paper by Cranston and Alban. So this is the research for the case when. Richard for the case when D is general. How about one degenerate subgraphs? And for this problem, it's a long-standing open problem by Arviston and Berman. And I think it's also proposed by Akiyama and Watanabe independently. One in 19. One in 1979, the other in 1987. So they conjecture that every planet graph has an induced forest on half of these vertices. And if you think about it, then this conjecture is obviously true if graph is 3D generate. Why? Because, I mean, we can apply induction. So suppose I mean, we can apply induction. So, suppose the graph is three degenerate, then I can find the vertex of degree at most three and delete it. And the remaining by induction hypothesis, the remaining will be partitioned into two parts where both two forests, where both of them, no, remaining is partitioned into two forests. Now, I try to add this vertex, and this vertex has at most one level to one of the forests, so I can just add it so. Added. So if graph is 3D generate, then it can be partitioned into two induced forests. So one of them will be at least half of the vertices. And there are cases where planar graphs are 3D generate. So if graph is triangle-free, then by all this formula, we can prove that it's 3D generate. But there are interesting, there are other cases like see if a graph has no cycle. If a graph has no cycle of length five or no cycle of length six, graphs are planned graphs are 3D generate. So for these cases, we knew that this conjecture is true. And actually, not only is true, but you can get a better bound for triangle-free planar graphs. Liu has a paper saying that you can actually find an induced forest on five. Used forest on five ninths of the vertices. And Raspo and Wang had a paper saying that if graph is C43 or has no two triangles within distance two, then actually graph is not 3D generated. And yet you can still partition it into two linear forest, two forests. So the conjecture is still true. So, the conjecture is still true. So, these are the cases where, as far as I know, these are some cases where the conjecture is true. But the best known for general planar graph is due to the Borodin's HQ5 coloring method. So, Borodin has a theorem saying that planar graphs have HQ5 coloring, meaning that you can find the proper five coloring. To find the proper five coloring, such that union of any two color classes given HQ graphs. So if you have an HQ5 coloring, just take the largest two color classes, and that will occupy at least two-fifths of the vertices, and that will give me a forest. But that's best possible, best known so far. So there's a big gap. There's a big gap. How about two degenerate induced subgraphs? And we conjecture that it's two over three. And the reason is due to octahedron, the graph over here. So this graph is four regular and planar. So in order to get a two-degenerate subgraph, I have to delete at least two vertices. I have to delete at least two vertices in this graph. So we have six vertices here. I have to delete two. So four over six is the ratio. So because of octahedron, maybe this is best possible. So we conjecture that every m-vertex planar graph has two degenerate induced subgraphs on two-thirds of the its vertices. Of the its vertices. And since planar graphs are 5D generate, you can easily show that planar graphs can be partitioned into two 2D generate subgraphs by the same logic. Just by using induction and delete a vertex of degree most five, remaining is partitioned into two degenerate subgraphs, and this vertex will be will have. Be will have at most two neighbors to one of these parts. And that's best to know, I think. I couldn't find any papers improving hash to anything more than that. It's interesting. You can prove a little bit more. Instead of partitioning into two degenerate graphs, you can also partition into two outer planar graphs. Two outer planar graphs. And proof is still simple. You just take one layer out, and then next layer is high. Okay. All right. You take one layer out, color by red, and then next layer you color by blue, and then delete it, and you take the next layer, color by red, etc. So this picture is really like that. You take one layer out of the graph, one infinite boundary. One infinite boundary and take it color by red, next layer color by blue, next layer color by red, etc. You continue that. And then in the end, what you get is the two coloring of graph where each color class induces outer planar graphs. So that's another proof, but you get a better graph class. It's a more restricted graph class, but still you only get half. So, 3 degenerate is our theorem. So, let's go to 4 degenerate. So, Su Din Zhu and his collaborator, so after we got idea for 3 degenerate induce subgraphs, he worked on 4 degenerate induce subgraphs, and they prove that eight of 9 can be proven. So, every n-vertex planar graph. N-vertex planar graph has a 4-degenerate induced subgraph on 8 or 9 of the vertices. But we conjecture that this is probably not optimal. And here's a graph of a cosahedron. So it's five regular private graphs on 12 vertices. And in order to make a four-degenerate subgraph, you have Generate subgraph, you have to delete at least one vertex. So the ratio is going to be like 11 over 12. And we couldn't find a better graph. So probably this is the constant, but we never know. Okay. All right. So our theorem is we can find the three. We can find the three degenerate induced subgraphs on five sevenths of the vertices. And we believe that this is not optimal, probably. The conjecture is maybe five-sixths. And there are two examples where this is tight. So one is equal to five regular planar graph on 12 vertices. In order to get three designary subgraphs, you have to delete. Subgraph, you have to delete two vertices, right? So that means now I can get 10 vertex in this subgraph. So 10 over 12 is 5 over 6. Octahedron is a 6 vertex graph, four regular, so I have to delete one vertex, at least one vertex, so 5 over 7, 5 over 6. So both graphs have 5 over 6. So that's conjecture. That's conjecture. All right. So let me tell you a little bit about the proof. And as you can imagine, the proof is by induction. So it's motivated by the proof of five list coloring by Thomason. So here's so this is not the actual theorem, but here's the first attempt. But here's the first attempt. So we put the weights on the vertices, but the people on the boundary, people on the infinite phase boundary, will have a higher weight, 20 over 21. And internal nodes have a weight 15 over 21. And we claim that alpha 3, so the maximum size of three degenerate induced subgraph, is at least some of the weights. Is at least some of the weights of the vertices. If this is the induction hypothesis, then we can assume the graph is a pseudo-plane pseudo-plane triangulation because I can add an edge without doing any, I mean, unless, yeah, there are certain situations you cannot add, but you can add an edge, for instance, between any. add an edge for instance between any two internal nodes you can add an edge or between a vertex between uh internal node no between internal node and the boundary vertex you can add an edge without any trouble so you can basically assume the graph is pseudo triangulations and if you have a vertex of degree less than four then i can delete and apply induction so uh this These things you can assume. But if you remember the Thomason's proof, so first of all, why do we care about this kind of setting? Because, for instance, this kind of weighting allows us to prove that every vertex on the boundary has at most three internal neighbors. So, here's the claim. So here's the claim. So how do we show that? Well, suppose that some vertex on the boundary has three, no, at least four neighbors inside. Then I can delete it. And these four vertices will be exposed to the boundary. So they will now have a higher weight. So the gain that we get is four times five over 21 because they used to have 15 over 20. Because they used to have 15 over 21, but now after the leading degree, they will have a 20 over 21, so the gain is 5 over 21. But we have four vertices, so the difference is 20 over 21. So even if we lose the weight for the infinite weight for this vertex V, we still have the same total sum. So this weighting allows us to assume that every vertex on the boundary has at most three internal neighbors. three internal neighbors. So that's the well that was beginning why we set this weighting. But we don't want to have a chord. If you remember the proof of five list coloring, one case is when how we remove chord in the in the plane in the plane graph. So how do we remove the chord? For that we are For that, we are actually modifying the claim and add some more constants. So instead of making right-hand side just to be sum of the weight, we add a 2 over 21. And then we also make a stronger assumption. Then I can pick some vertices, vertex set A, which is a vertex set of some paths on the boundary. And we say the graph is 3A degenerate if every subgraph has a vertex not in A whose degree is at most 3. Unless the subgraph is actually a subset of unless subgraph is contained in A. So I don't want to delete vertices in A. I can keep deleting vertices not in A. Probably the induced subgraph may have a vert may Have a vertex, may skip some vertex in A, but the remaining graph, remaining 3D generated in this subgraph, I don't want to start by deleting vertices in A. The vertices in A will be the last one to be deleted in this ordering. So that's a stronger assumption. And so let's say the alpha 3GA to be the maximum size of 3A degenerate into subgraph. And with this extra. And with this extra constant, 12 over 21, we can actually prove that the minimum count example has no quote. I mean, there are certain steps where I can assume the size of A is 2, but I will not talk about that. So let's assume the size of A is 2. And so if you have a course, those two vertices will be on one side. Now, what we do is we decompose. Now what we do is we decompose into two cases. So G1 is the left hand side and G2 is on the right hand side. But for G2, I will set these X and Y, those two vertices forming a chord, to be my A prime. And that's how we apply induction hypothesis. And then what we do is you find the largest 3A degenerate induced subgraph on G1. Let's say it's Let's say it's induced on X. Oh, that's a type. Yeah, this is a type. So I should have an X1, X2, and then this is X, but this X is from G1. And this X prime is from G2. Now, if I have two 3-degenerate induced subgraphs on left and right, I want to combine them. But there are cases where I can just take a union, but sometimes I have to sacrifice vertical. I have to sacrifice vertices x and y. So, for instance, on the left-hand side, 3D generally in this subgraph may contain a vertex, this x-vertex. And the right-hand side, it may contain vertex y. Then, I don't want to use any of them, so I have to delete them. So, that's what this means. And this is gonna be my new 3A degenerate. This will induce 3A degenerate induce. During a degenerate induced subgraph. And then we just apply induction up thesis, size of x's, and list this. So we now have an extra constant, 2 over 21. Size of x prime is 2 over this thing. And if you compute it magically, by this magic choice of the constant, you get again the sum of 8 plus 2 over 21. So this extra constant. So, this extra constant allows us to do say that there's no court under certain assumptions. Of course, I skipped many details. For instance, the left-hand side could be a triangle or right-hand side could be a triangle, but these things are special cases. So, you know, what happens if G is a one-vertex graph? Right, so right, yeah. Well, if G is one vertex graph, this is incorrect, right? Graph is incorrect, right? So, this second attempt is not true. Not only that's the count example, but also there are infinitely many count examples. You already found one vortex example, so that's also a count example. This graph, four regular graph on six vortices, this is also a count example because the sum of weight is five. The right hand side is gonna be five plus two over twenty-one. Plus 2 over 21, whereas the maximum size of the 3D generated in this subgraph is 5. So we really like to have extra constant, but because it's not true, what should we do? So what we did is to actually classify all count examples. And we ended up having three possible classes of count examples. Classes of count examples. So the count example looks like this. So it's composed of, it consists of all five possible configurations. So we write Q, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. And you can glue them. But I can only use Q for many of these yellow triangles, but only one black can be something else, like Q1 or Q2 or Q3, Q4, or it could be one vertex added. Could be a one vertex added to this thing. So single vertex is also included. Single vertex graph is also one of the counterexamples. And then instead of 2 over 21, now we define constant. So epsilon GA. So this constant will be 0 or 1 over 21 or 2 over 21, depending on the situation. So one vertex graph is, I think, in one of the, yeah, one vertex. Yeah, one vertex graph will be one over 21. So then you can imagine what kind of ugly induction step will happen because whenever we delete something or doing some reduction, we have to check whether we suddenly fall into the count example or not. And that kind of argument has to be done. So we did that, but I'm not going to show you the details, but that's just That's the theoretical. And we also have to restrict the set A carefully. So there are conditions on A. All right, so that's the sketch. So let me conclude the talk by showing some open problems. So this theorem can be used as some bound on the following problem. So imagine Problem. So imagine that you're given a planar graph, and we know that planar graphs are five choosable. But can you find a large three choosable planar graph or four choosable planar graphs? Four choosable induced subgraph as a planar induce some. How big is it? And since k-designed graphs are k plus one choosable, so obviously any bound. Any bound on the tau k will give us something on the choosability. And for two choosable industries subgraph, k4, because of k4, this is best possible. But for other cases, I don't know whether this is best possible. So maybe interesting. But there's another direction. So instead of giving list of size 4 or list of size 3, now, I mean, so the previous case, the list is, so the induced subgraph is first given, and then somebody gives you a list of size k and k plus 1 for each vertex. You want to color them. Here's the difference. Now I give a list to every vertex. To every vertex, so I give T colors to every vertex, and then we are supposed to choose some subset of vertices so that we can find the proper color. So, this is a conjecture by Alverson, Grossman, Haas in 2000. Let's call it partialist coloring conjecture. So, if you have a S-colorable, S-choosable graph and T is less than S, and if I give a T colors to every vertex, then conjecture. Vertex then conjecture said that I can choose T over S and vertices of the graphs so that these vertices are properly colored from this list. And they prove some theorem that if chromatic number is chi, then you can always properly color this many vertices, one minus something to the t. And the proof is really, really nice. It's beautiful. It's beautiful, provided he once explained to a high school student, they all enjoyed it. So, what happens with the planar graphs? So, this conjecture will give us 0.4 for the case t is 2 and 0.6 and 0.8. And their theorem will give, because planographs are four colorable, the theorem will give up 0.43 for the case when T is. For the case when T is 2, 5, 7 for 3 and 6, 8 for 4. Later, for the case when T is 4, Chapel improved it to 7, 2, 4. But still, these two cases are open for the planar graphs. But since our balance on alpha t minus 1 also gives us some number for partial list calorie, Number for partial list calorie, but none of these numbers are better than the existing one, unfortunately. But the conjectures on this alpha t minus one will all imply this PLCC. So that's funny. So it'd be nice if we know any of this, then we will prove this thing for at least for planar graphs. All right, so that's it for the All right, so that's it for the uh the talk. Sorry for taking slightly longer time. So these are my uh collaborators. So the first one is Harry Tierstadt. He sent us a photo in 2017 after he's doing camping writing approach for two weeks. And Chiha was visiting me to work on this paper, and Su Din was here. Thank you. Thank you for your attention. Okay, thank you very much. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you. Any questions? I have a question. So it seems all these constants alpha D and these other ones you mentioned at the end, they all can be approximated by using the Lippen-Tarsian separator theorem up to graphs on a. So if you want to approximate it up So, if you want to approximate it up to epsilon, you could check graphs up to some constant over epsilon squared vertices. And by the Lepton Targient separator theorem, you can delete at most some epsilon n vertices, and the connected components would be small at most constant over epsilon squared. I was wondering if anyone has tried this sort of approach, or is it just computationally infeasible? I don't think anyone has tried it. So, it won't. So, I it's very it was difficult to find any uh literature related to this problem. So, it'd be interesting whether this can be pursued. Yeah, okay. Any other oh, I had one question. So, your last transparency, which I've managed to, can you go back one? So your conjecture for alpha it's stronger than these conjectures for the choicability? Yeah, so these conjectures are portendered graphs. Are for general graphs, so of course, the bound for planar graph should be better. Yeah, so you should expect a lot bigger number actually, because if you look at the this Meriam Majucanis, the example where the graph is not four choosable, but five choosable, right? The smallest example has a 60-something vertices, so the ratio we know is like 62 over 63. Over 63, or something like that. That could be the correct number. I don't know. Okay, any more questions? All right, let's thank you again. Thank you.
