Under these circumstances, and I hope we will all meet in Bannf next year. So, my talk is about local in-time existence of solutions to strengthening scalelasticity, and this is a joint work between Snarbai and Adai Tarkip, and I will give you the reference at the end of my talk. Okay, so let me show you the equation right away. We are interested in this equation, in this partial differential equation, where t is the Equation where t is the Cauchy stress and g is a nonlinear function and Î½ is a positive constant. So this equation is dried using equation of motion and a constituent relation, which is a generalization of the usual non-linear Kalman-Boyd-Biscoelastic model under the assumption that the strain and the strain rate are small. So I will show you the derivation in a minute, but it's special because the It's spatial because the nonlinearity is on the inertia term. This meeting is being recorded. And it's not in terms of the displacement, but in terms of the stress. So we are interested in proving locally in time existence of strong solutions for this equation associated with some initial values. Okay, so I will tell you a little bit about implicit constituent modeling. I will drive the equation that I've just told about and I will That I've just told about, and I will talk about the local in-time existence of the solutions to the Cauchy problem. So, institute constitute implicit constituent modeling. So, if we think of an explicitly constituted material, we can think of an analog as a spring. So, in equilibrium, everything is in equilibrium. And once you apply an external force, then the mass moves to the right, but there's an opposite force in the spring, and it tries to push the. Spring and it tries to push the spring to its equilibrium. And after some time t, your mass moves to the place xt. So we can write the constant specification for the spring as Fs is equal to Gt and if it is linear, we can write a linear constitute relation. And then using balance of linear momentum, we get an ODE out of this. And we can analyze that. An implicitly constitutive material, we can think of and analyze. We can think of an analog as a mass spring wire system. So here we have a mass again in equilibrium, everything is just in equilibrium and there's no motion, but once we apply the force, the external force to our mass, again, the system gets in motion. Again, there's an opposite force in the spring and our body moves towards right as we continue applying the external force, but after some External force, but after some point it doesn't move. So even if we continue applying the external force, once the wire reaches its maximum length L, our mass cannot move to the right. So in this case, it is much more sensible to prescribe an implicit relation between the force and the displacement. And it might be challenging because we might not be able to write kinematics in terms of the force or the force in terms of the kinematics out of this implicit relation. It depends on the Sit relation, it depends on the properties of G. So, in this case, the situation is in this graph, and this is exactly what we have in mind when we are talking about strain limiting theory for materials. So, the focus, our interest is a particular class of elastic bodies which are defined through implicit constant relations, where the linearized strain epsilon is given as a function of the stress. As a function of the stress sigma, and it exhibits a limiting strain behavior. So even though the stress goes to infinity, our strain will be limited. So the notations are the usual notations as we have. F is the deformation gradient, B will play the role of the strain, which is the left Cauchy-green stretch tensor, and D will play the role of the dissipative part of the constituulation. Constant relation and epsilon will be the linearized strain. So, how do we draw the model that I told about? So, we start with an implicit relation between the stress and the strain, which in most general form can be written like this. Once you apply isotropy and objectivity, etc., you can write as this highly non-linear and very complicated relation. Here, alpha i's are not constants, they can depend on these invariants, actually. On these invariants, actually. So, if we start with Cauchy elasticity and write the stress as a function of the strain, as in here, and if we linearize, which means we assume that the deformation gradient is small, we can only get this relation, which is a linear relation between the stress and the strain again. And there is no way of getting a non-linear relation. In fact, this is what Rajagopal introduced to the theory. Even though implicit constitute modeling was known even in 1919, Modeling was known even in the 1940s. For example, Prager was mentioning those things and he was calling them locking, locking materials, etc. What Raju Gopal did was by starting with an implicit relation and writing the strain as a function of the stress, we can get a non-linear relationship between the stress and the linearized strain. So that was the novelty in his arguments. And this is how we do it. And this is how we do it. So let's start with the implicit relation and write the strain as a function of the stress. Of course, the right-hand side can be more general than this, but this is just one nonlinear relationship, right? And then we linearized our strain, which will be like this. And replacing it here, we get this equation. And this is a non-linear relationship between the linearized strain and the stress. So this is because we started with the implicit constitutive relation. We start with the implicit constituent relation and write the strain as a function of the stress. As I said, the right-hand side can be any general non-linear function of the stress. But we are interested in viscoelastic version. So to the left-hand side, we add this new D here, which will play the role of the dissipative part. And again, we do the linearization and we obtain epsilon, the linearized strain from B, and epsilon T related to D coming from D. And we are. And where I will talk about today will be a one-dimensional version of this, and I will generalize the right-hand side. So I will not keep this quadratic as my non-linearity. I will just write it as gt. So this thing is this epsilon plus nu epsilon t is equal to gt is my non-linearity is my constitutive equation where epsilon is the linear rise strain and g is the general non-linear function of the of function of the stress. And I need to have some assumptions on G so that I will obtain existence of solutions. So using the equation of motion and of course assuming that everything is smooth enough then and using the constituent relation that I have I can write down this equation but it's same as writing it in terms of the stress like that. Okay as I said it's interesting because the nonlinearity is only The nonlinearity is on the inertia term. But what I will do is, by assuming immortability of G or monotonicity of I will invert this equation into an equation in terms of the displacement, which is what we usually do. Okay, the Cauchy problem. We want to study this equation, and it is much more meaningful to give initial conditions in terms of the stress. Initial conditions in terms of the stress rather than the displacement. And this is our constituent. So, what we do is we define another variable, which will be omega. So, it will contain the stress, the linearized stress, and the linearized strain and the strain rate. And we assume that g is strictly increasing so that, as I've just said, we can invert g and we can write the stress as this omega. So, I can write my equation in terms. So I can write my equation in terms of omega now. It is very important to note here that this right-hand side of this equation, we cannot separate it as the elastic part and the dissipative part, because omega itself contains some dissipation. So I really can't say that this is the elastic term, this is the dissipative term. We can't do it here. Anyway, we can also put the initial data in terms of omega and then we can consider this system now. Consider this system now. Okay, we can see this system, we can write this system as this system now, okay, where sigma is h of omega and plus nu h omega t. But we assumed invertibility of t, so we can see this as a hyperbolic system with dissipation. So the first equation here somehow it suggests It suggests that this omega and phi are coming from a potential. So that if omega is the x derivative of that potential and phi is the t derivative of that potential, well, they will be equal, right? Omega t will be equal to phi x. So keeping this in mind, we can take this potential function eta like this, so that we can turn this equation, this differential equation into its divergence form, which is much more useful for us. Which is much more useful for us. So, writing this potential equation like this means actually omega is eta x. Okay? Anyway, I can turn my initial value problem into an initial value problem in terms of eta now, which will be this one. So what I will do is, okay, I will see this equation as a parabolic equation with 4 eta t with a source term h eta xx. And I want xx and I want to get a bounded operator. I want to use the properties of that. You will see why in a minute. And in order to do that, I add eta t to both sides. I will tell you why in a minute as well. So from the original equation in terms of eta to here, what I do is I add eta t to both sides and I just write the time derivative of this term explicitly here. It is good because we see that the nonlinear Because we see that the nonlinearity is really here and it is linear in eta xt. So that's important because my method depends on linearization around the given state and then recovering that given state by a fixed point argument. So what I will do is really for a given state, I will put that state here and to the right hand side. So the nonlinearity will disappear, as you see. So it will be a linear function in terms of So, it will be a linear function in terms of that state. I will solve it and then I will recover that state. So, that's why it is important to see that explicit dependence on eta xt here. Okay, so what do we do? How do I define my operator? So, again, I have a lot of time derivatives here. What I will do is I will write phi instead of eta t. I will go back to the original variable at the end. So, even though I'm making a lot of change. Even though I'm making a lot of change of variables, it's fine. I will go back at the end. So eta t will be phi. So this equation will be really this one, where a t is defined to be that one. As I said, I added eta t to both sides of this equation because so that I have this 80 is defined like this. As you see, it has one here. So the reason for that is that to make a invertible, because I invertible because I need inverse of a as well and in fact I have some good properties of the inverse. Anyway, so right, so h is here as you see it appears as the derivative h prime of eta x and writing just a function a of x and t instead of h prime, I can see my operator like this. And using a product estimate and assuming a good space and assuming a good space A is in a suitable space and sobo have embeddings for S bigger than 5 over 2, we can have this kind of estimates for the operator. Moreover, I will use some ellipticity properties of this operator. In order to have that, I just need to assume that nu times A is bigger than or equal to a constant, but I know that nu is strictly positive, strictly positive already, so it is enough to assume that infinite. Enough to assume that infimum of this a is equal to a constant which is strictly positive. As I said, because of adding this one to my operator, I'm able to invert it and I have some good properties of the immersed operator as here. Okay, so what do I assume about nonlinearity? We assume local Lipschitz continuity. If H0 is 0, we assume this one. If not, then we assume this one. Then we assume this one. And we, as I said, we want the ellipticity condition to hold. So we assume H prime at zero is strictly positive. It is okay to have this assumption. I mean, mechanically, it's fine because near equilibrium, when stress increases, strain also increases. Remember the graph that I showed you? So it is exactly that. So it's fine. Here, okay, by using continuity of H prime, etc., I have this property as well, but it's Sector, I have this property as well, but it's kind of a detail which we use in the linearization part, but I won't be able to go into the details of that. But anyway, H prime zero is strictly positive, and we make use of that as well. So the approach is, this is my final equation in terms of phi, and I know that phi is eta t, eta sub t. Okay, I see this equation as a variable coefficient heat equation, and we know the existence of a solution for that. Solution for that. And this solution provides us an evolution system phi. And I can write my solution phi using that evolution system like this, which means I can obtain estimates for phi, but remember phi was the time derivative of eta. That means I have estimates for eta and eta t. So the next step is to linearize around the given state, which I mentioned before. So I assume that I'm Assume that I have a given state and I put it on the right-hand side, so that's given, and also in the non-linear function in the definition of my operator A here, so that I will have a linear equation. So this technique is also called localization technique, and it is used in many places for viscoelastic materials. And then we need to recover this given state, so we have to. This given state, so we have to design a fixed point argument in a suitably defined Banach space in order to recover that given state. Okay, this Banach space that we will have is this one, this set XS. Okay, it is not so difficult to understand it, but also it contains like the altar bar, which is kind of a technical detail. Kind of a technical detail. In any case, it is good to note here is that we need that the HS norm of Z is small, but its time derivative is not small. So we don't need that. We just need that it is bounded. So that was what we didn't expect, but technically in the analysis, it came out like that. And the norm is the usual supremum norm that we consider. Okay, so if S is bigger than 5 over 2, we are in. Is bigger than five over two. We are in the good situation, and we have nice initial data with some assumptions. Again, delta bar appears here, which is also in the definition of the Banach space. And we can show that there exists a sufficiently small time where we have existence of a unique solution to the Cauchy problem in terms of eta. Okay, but that was eta. So, what about the other? What about the other variables? What about the other problems that we started with? But remember that eta was, so remember the system. So we said that we somehow think that omega and phi are coming from a potential and we defined this potential eta. It was that. And omega is eta x. So just playing with the spaces a little bit, you can also state the same result. The same result in terms of omega in a slightly different banach space, but that's fine. So you just need to design the fixed point argument in this space, but everything is more or less the same. So we get existence of eta by the property that omega is eta x, we get existence of omega as well. How about the original problem? Okay, in order to say something about the original problem, In order to say something about the original problem, we should be able to say something about the displacement u and the strain ux. If we can say that, it means we can say something about this equation as well, because we inverted this equation and we obtained something in terms of the displacement, right? But recall what changes we made. Okay, epsilon was the linearized strain, so that's really ux. Ux. Omega was containing both the linearized epsilon and linearized strain and the strain rate. So it was epsilon plus nu epsilon t. And also omega was somehow related to the potential function through omega is equal to eta x. So combining all these, I can write eta as u plus nu ut. But I have already proved the existence of eta. So I can write this equation. So I can write this equation, this relation, like this: u to t plus 1 over nu u is equal to 1 over nu eta. And I'm given the right-hand side because I know eta exists. So I can see this as an ODE for u and I can solve it, where eta appears here. So I have all the estimates for eta, etc. I can take the derivative of this with respect to x, and I get this relation where I have omega here, but I already have. Here, but I already have proved the existence of omega in some suitable sub-lave space as well. So since eta and eta t, omega and omega t for s bigger than 5 over 2 exists, I can immediately obtain that the same results, I mean similar results hold for the displacement u and ux respectively. So it tells us a lot about the unusual equation that we have associated with some. That we have associated with some initial data. So, as I said, Rajagopal was the first one to realize that once we start with an implicit relation, it is possible to get a non-linear relationship between the strain and the stress. And Roger Gopal sub-commanded the fourth paper is where they introduced viscoelasticity firstly and they investigated the wave propagation, etc. And the fifth paper is where And the fifth paper is where well possess of the theory, the limit strain limiting theory in the elastic setting was done in the most general situation. And the last one is where it is basically the reference for this talk, where we prove local in-time existence of strong solutions to the initial value problem. And as I said, Hussnarbai and Alberta keep are my code. Back, I keep are my co-authors for this one. Okay, thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much. The recording has stopped. Are there any questions? So, let me maybe ask you, because this is local existence, any chance for global existence? Yes, it is well, not. Well, not submitted as Edor said yet, but it will be in a short time. So, what we do for that is just to look for blow-ups, basically, and we show that there are no blow-ups. And then it will somehow show that the global solutions exist the global strong solutions in the one-dimensional case. So, for the three-dimensional case, well, on Friday, Vicki will talk about the Wiki will talk about the three-dimensional problem and about weak existence of weak solutions for that. So that's a different issue. Okay, so we'll continue with this topic. Yes. Any more questions or remarks? Okay, so if not, then let's. Joseph, Joseph, Joseph raised hand. Joseph raised hand. Okay, Joseph. Sorry, I didn't know. Thank you. Yeah sorry I didn't know thank you for your talk. Uh I just want to add uh one reference to your to the end uh your talk. When you talk about this article with Sandre Silly 2014, so this is like survey article, but but regarding the results, so there are there are really stronger strong stronger improvements which which are in a joint paper with Seliza Beck, Miroslav Bulicek and Andrea Sili and it was published in I think 2017 or 2018. In, I think, 2017 or 18 in archive for astronomechanics. And so, this is it goes in the direction which was outlined in 2014, but really the improvements and I would say finalizing of the theory from certain perspective is done in that article. Yeah, okay. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Joseph. If I can make a comment, I think that Vicky will talk about it, right? Just me. Yes, yes. Right, just meme, yes, yes, yes. So, Victoria Petle, I think I do not know where when she's scheduled, we'll be talking about this issue, I guess. On Friday. On Friday, yeah.
