Here. Okay. And I started the recording already. You have great. Yes. Okay. So the format is, I ask each of you to spend sort of 30 seconds to a minute or so just giving a sort of big picture vision of what the important questions are, where you think the field is going, what the important challenges are, where you know. Important challenges are where your work fits into that. So, do all of that in 30 seconds to a minute. And I'll start with, I'll just start with Dan. Sure, yeah, so it's 5 p.m. here and 30 degrees. So the most important thing is for me to get a beer. But beyond that, you know, I actually really enjoyed this workshop because this is a sort of different set of people than I usually talk to. And I want to, beyond what I'm doing, I'm going to be I want to, beyond what I was talking about, no one actually knows how to formulate causality in terms of sort of like boundary conditions. So, you know, in like a holography sense or just the pure S matrix, you know, if I if I only look at observables far away from nasty quantum things that I don't understand, you know, I have my lab. How do I actually formulate causality in a way that's satisfactory is a very interesting question that I've recently been meditating on and I've been, you know, enjoying. Meditating on, and I've been enjoying hearing everybody's sort of perspectives on this. So, actually, I think this is a really important question that's sort of understudied, at least in the high-energy sort of world. Yeah, great. Thanks. Thanks. That was in the time. Yeah, Thomas, you go next. Thanks. Yeah, I guess to me, yeah, the notion of like subsystems and how to define subsystems without some kind of classical background. Without some kind of classical background seems important to me. Can we define subsystems with appeal to something like internal? You know, we model everything dynamically, and is there some internal way of doing them? So, and maybe quantum reference frames, for instance, but I also think there's been papers where people look at, you know, just look at the dynamics of the system, and then you can more or less divide stuff into like, you know, weakly interacting parts. And I think, yeah, especially for kind of quantum foundations where we tend to take composition as a primitive, you know, this kind of categorical approaches, it's not clear to. Categorical approaches, it's not clear to me that's the right way around. Like when I approach the world, it's some big, undivided mess, and then I try and make sense of different parts in some way. Yeah, so to me, that's one of the and yeah, I don't know much about quantum gravity, but I've talked to a few people who work on it, and it seems to also be an issue there. So I think maybe that's where foundations and quantum gravity can kind of come together. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, and Akem, go ahead, please. Thanks. Well, we know from mathematics that And we know from mathematics that we sometimes have an abstract structure, such as an abstract group, which then has concrete representations. For example, a Lie group could have a concrete representation as a matrix group. And what I'm suggesting here is that the framework of a quantum field or quantum fields living on a curved space-time are a concrete representation of some more abstract structure. And that abstract structure. And that abstract structure would be a set of abstract correlators, which are operators on a Herbert space. And if they have certain properties, then they can be represented as the correlators of quantum fields on a curved space time, and otherwise they cannot. And in the low energy regime, these abstract correlators encode in particular through their divergence, namely the Namely, the propagator, two-point correlators, where they diverge is where the light cones are. And from the inside to the outside of the light cone, we have a sign flip of the correlators from correlator to anti-correlated, roughly speaking. And for the n larger than two correlators, such as vertices, we have that their diagonalization, the bases in which they are diagonal, if they are diagonalizable, which they are at low energies, those bases. Low energies, those bases are the positional bases. They tell us in the Hilbert space where a coordinate system lives. And all of that may still be valid at arbitrarily high energies, except that these vertices may not be diagonalizable at arbitrarily high energies. They might not really be diagonalizable. And then that whole representation of quantum fields on a curved space-time would only be approximate. And the In that. And the more abstract description would still be valid, but not the concrete representation. And the abstract description, being in terms of correlators, would invite an information theoretic analysis. So thanks. Thanks very much. So I can see we have a few questions lining up. And if you have questions, please raise your hand. You can also put questions in the chat as well. So, Magdalena, you were first to raise. So, Magdalena, you were first to raise your hand. Great, thanks. So, yeah, I would like to ask a question to Dan that I had following his talk. And yeah, thanks all the speakers for really fascinating presentations. It would be a quick question, so I'll try not to make very long introduction to it. So, I really like the proposal. It's really extremely interesting, and I find it a very elegant idea. So, congratulations on that. What I've been thinking is that. That. What I've been thinking is that the revivals that you see come from periodic time evolution of the oscillator, if I got it right. And you mentioned noise in terms of the temperature of that oscillator. So I wonder there will be all other masses with which that test superpose superpose, small call it test mass will interact. Not all of them will have a harmonic oscillator behavior. On the other hand, Or behavior. On the other hand, all interactions to second order would be harmonic oscillator with linear force. So there will be a lot of different periodic periods that will be and all the other systems that are going to be interacting in the same manner. Gravity is universal with your oscillator. So I wonder how much you can avoid that and what are your thoughts on these things. Thoughts on these things? Yeah, no, it's a good question. I think the simple answer is we don't have a good quantitative understanding. I mean, you know, of course, you just say I put everything as far away from the system as possible, but I think quantitatively, it's an important question and it's unavoidable. You're totally right. So, yeah, I don't have much to say in detail. Thanks, Maya. That's right. It's a really interesting opportunity. Interesting opportunity's for Dan too. Very interesting talk. Of course, the nice thing about the original proposal where you measure a All way you measure a Bell inequality is that it's device independent. And so there's kind of if you see entanglement, then you know it's not dependent on it being quantum mechanics even, so to speak. But it seems like you are assuming quantum mechanics is correct when you sort of infer that there's entanglement. Infer that there's entanglement from the dynamics you see by just looking at one of the objects. So, yeah, I guess the question is, have you or anyone looked at what alternative models for what would happen if there aren't gravitons would predict in this situation? Yeah, so cool. Okay, good. So I do agree that actually what we really are saying is we have an entanglement. Really, are you saying is we have an entanglement witness? So, you know, you assume quantum mechanics and you make an entanglement witness in the usual sense. So, in terms of alternatives, I mean, only you know, people have made these classical channel models of gravity and it's easy to work out in that model. You, you know, you won't see the signal, there's no entanglement, and so forth. But I mean, like, I think these more interesting kind of general probability theory models and stuff like that, this would be super cool to understand how it works. And we just haven't thought about it in detail. Okay, thanks. Yeah, thank you. Great. And Rob, please. Yeah. So I guess two short questions for Dan and one for Thomas. So I guess, Dan, one is presumably you want these masses to in the, you know, that are superposed to be as heavy as possible. Is that right? I mean, how heavy, like, can you make, can you use buckyballs or something that is a lot of mass? That is a lot of mass. Ah, like for the atom, the atoms. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's true. Right. So, um, well, yeah, good. So, the best thing to do would actually be to use one of these like crazy fermion BEC, these things where like the BEC itself is like just some big and tall, you know, solid thing. Um, okay, but yeah, Holger has rubidium atoms, and so we kind of just stuck to that for the estimates. But yeah, it would be better bigger than mass. That's a lot lighter than either of those things. So, I would have thought that you know, you want to. That you know, you want to have as much gravitational attraction as you can muster, right? Yeah, that's right. So, I think my understanding of the problem is that the bigger and more composite something is, the more it's going to have like electromagnetic moments and then decohere and be horrible. So, atoms, beautiful neutrality that really underlies why you can keep them coherent so long. All right. So, then the other is: when do you think this experiment's going to get done? I mean, well. I mean, well, Folker's got to do it on me. You know, I think the first step is more like do an electromagnetic version of it and just make sure we're not totally, you know, fooling ourselves or anything. And that I think is sort of on the immediate time scale. But the gravity one, yeah, it still will take some development. Is it measured in days, weeks, months? Oh, years, decades, or centuries? Years. Decades or centuries. Years. People should all be thinking of better proposals than these. Now you can learn. And then, since I'm here, one for Thomas. I asked this before about others. All the examples are abelian, right? Translations are abelian. What happens if it's non-abelian, like rotations? Yeah, so with a student and Catherine de Lamet, we defined all these changes of quantum reference. Find all these changes of quantum reference frames for non-abelian groups. So they just have to be locally compact. So you can do that for kind of rotations. For that, you just need to be kind of careful that you have the kind of right action and the left action of the group in a sense. Essentially, the property of the quantum reference frame is that it has to encode all the group elements in an orthogonal basis. So these are very large systems. For SU two, you need L two of SU two, so square integrable functions on the SU two manifold. On the SU2 manifold. And yeah, so I mean, Esteban talked about it a bit. And also, I'm working on a project where we're trying to do this perspective neutral thing, this constrained system, where the constraint is no longer just, yeah, some CA plus CB plus C C, but you could have multiple constraints, which then generate multiple parameter group. So yeah, that's still work in progress. But yeah, in terms of just changing quantum reference frames, it works fine for non-abelian groups as well, as long as they're locally compact, essentially. Along with the locally compact, etc. So there's no additional issues with refactorization or anything? Okay, good. Yeah, no, so we haven't, we haven't. I mean, Esteban might have, but yeah, I haven't exactly worked out the factoring thing. That might be, I, yeah, that might be hard. Like, that's what I would think. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. I mean, you can make use of like just group representation theory, and that gives you some like, you know, division into subspaces. But yeah, the actual refactoring, um, But yeah, the actual refactoring, um, yeah, I think that's hard. Uh, familiar, go ahead. Yeah, so just to add something to this, so in the we so we have looked at the perspective neutral structure with rotations as well. And okay, there actually, when you have continuous variable systems, it really complicates things because you don't have a global. Things because you don't have a global choice for the constraint anymore. So this is a bit more complicated. And yeah, so I guess that in that setting, studying the rotations and in the way that Thomas presented would be, I mean, maybe you can correct me if you have a different intuition, Tom or Alex, but I would guess that this would be very complicated because it was already very complicated. Because it was already very complicated to go to the reduced structure. Yes, I think it's very complicated to do kind of actual physics, but you can just write, if you have, you know, your three systems, HA, HB, and HC, acted on by group G, you know, UG, A tensor, UGB, tensor, UGC, you can just say the physical states invariant under this. Yeah, typically, we don't just want that, right? We have particles and it's a bit more complicated. And it's a bit more complicated. So I think, because, yeah, I looked at your paper where you do the rotational case. Yeah, I think that's quite hard. And whenever I've tried to do examples, it's very quick, very close to intractable. But yeah, writing down the abstract thing, it's invariant under some group action that you can do fine. It's just actually working out examples, which is hard. Yeah, I would just say conceptually, I think the program is there to do it all, but then, like, technically, it's hard because things aren't a million. So, yeah, I would say it like that. So, yeah, I would say it like that. Yeah. Can I also take the occasion to ask a question to Ahim? Please go ahead. So, actually, I was interested, Ahim, in knowing, you said that the correlator is diagonal in position basis, but does this mean that position basis is automatically selected in this case as a preferred basis? And so, would you say that this we are able to extract? And you say that this we are able to explain why we see we classical observers see things in position basis. Well, that's an interesting question. In some sense, I suppose so. You see, the formalism is agnostic as to what basis we choose. Basis we choose. So, in principle, the calculations are set up and done basis independently, just like in quantum mechanics. You can choose a basis, but you don't have to. But in the regime where this abstract structure has a representation as the correlators of quantum fields on a curved space-time, then for beings such as us who Such as us who inhabit such a universe, it is then, I suppose, natural to think of locality, right? But in principle, I suppose the answer is yes, in the sense that, I mean, imagine that there's no general relativity, it's just ordinary flat space-time and we have quantum mechanics on it. In this case, we could ask: does quantum mechanics Does quantum mechanics single out the position basis? And in principle, the mathematical framework does not at all. And yet, we humans feel that we are living in position space. We don't feel that we are living in momentum space, even though as far as quantum mechanics is concerned, there's nothing wrong with quantum mechanics in momentum space. It's the same theory exactly. And yet, we perceive as living in position. Perceive as living in position space, presumably because we are agents that act locally. And that locality singles out interactions that are local. So we think in the eigenbasis of local interactions. And I suppose that then carries forward into that framework that I'm proposing. So gravity doesn't add in that regard anything new. But I think that's a very subtle question that you ask there because it's basically the question. It's basically the question: if a framework is agnostic to what basis you choose in the Hilbert space, could it still be that nature singles out the position basis, or is it a perceptional thing of humans to single out the positional basis? I guess it's the latter, but I'm not entirely sure. Yeah, thanks. Tom, you're nodding your head. Did you have a comment on that from your perspective? Seems like there's a possible connection between. Perspective seems like there's a possible connection between what you're doing and Akim. Um, I mean, yeah, I mean, I think the I just nodding because I was kind of agreeing with Akim's point. I don't think I have that much to add. Um, yeah, why, yeah, why the position basis? Yeah, um, I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I can answer it even with quantum reference frames either. Um, I guess typically you might have some preferred like inter you know, if you look at the how if you have some like wave function and some Hamiltonian and the way the interactions is. And the way the interactions is, it might kind of single out a basis, maybe like the position basis. You know, things which are close together interact more than things which are far away. So maybe that might prefer the basis. But I'm also very partial to the idea that it's all just perception. So yeah, I'd say either look at the Hamiltonian or like somehow it's like, yeah, an interaction between a human mind and the rest of the world. Okay, thanks. Tim, you had a question, but then do you still have the question? Do you still have the question? Um, oh, yeah, just to Kim, um, I guess, um, just it's a kind of more prosaic version of this question about, you know, do we have to assume the vacuum state or being on flat space? I mean, even if we're, you know, on flat space and you're looking at these correlators, I mean, the real universe is not in the vacuum. It's at three. Not in the vacuum, it's at three Kelvin. So, do you need to have that information in order to back out the curvature correctly? Very interesting. Let's do a Gedanken experiment. Let's consider the LHC and imagine that with the progress of technology, we Technology, we could miniaturize it and have a tiny accelerator that would fit into a pocket, maybe even into the smartphone. And so you have this accelerator inside your smartphone. And what you could use it for is test what the Feynman rules are, where you are, right? Because you can view the LHC as a machine to test Feynman rules. Because you give yourself Feynman rules, which is to say you give yourself a theory, and then you make some predictions, and then you measure them. And if they don't pan out, then you. Measure them, and if they don't pan out, then you have to tweak your Feynman rules until you get them right. And if there is significant curvature, then the Feynman rules will be affected by that. So in principle, you could go around with a smartphone that has an LHC built into it, and you could measure the local Feynman rules. And then from that, you could infer what locally the metric is. Now, you're right that the formulas that I presented assume that. That I presented assume that you look at the vacuum expectation values of these products or field operators. And in principle, I suppose this would mean that you would have to shield your operators. Just like inside the tubes of the LHC, there's probably not three Kelvin. They will try to make it much cooler and have only the particles then really fast go around in what is effectively the vacuum. And I suppose a pocket. The vacuum, and I suppose a pocket LHC would have to do that too. Then, I mean, if you want to use the measurement of the Feynman rules in order to recover what the metric is, then yes, if it was all happening in a heat bath, then the formulas would have to be adapted or you would need some shielding of the CNB or any influence, really. Okay, thanks. Thanks. Arkham, I thought you held it up as an Arkim, I thought you held it up as an advantage that we've clocks and measuring rods that they don't really exist everywhere, so isn't it better to look at something that does exist everywhere? And miniaturized LHDs also don't exist everywhere, even if the technology was conquered. And so I thought the advantage was that this two-point correlation function was something that existed everywhere. And so well, that's true. I mean, you got me there. It's not easy to measure the. There, it's not easy to measure those quantum fluctuations. I think Tim and I, we discussed once, right, whether we could, with a homodyne detector, for example, pick up the quantum fluctuations of an electromagnetic field here, and then another homodyne detector picks them elsewhere, and can we pick up the correlations? Can we do it at such close proximity that we can get the correlations in between them? Yeah, so it's not easy to do in principle, though. In principle, though, I would maintain, I mean, not for practical purposes, which you are for sure right, but in principle, it's a matter of detecting whether or not a quantum fluctuation has happened locally. And that's a fundamentally different thing from using a rod, which is non-local in space, and a clock, which is non-local in time. Sounds good. Do we have any more questions? Can I ask a question, actually? Yeah, please go ahead. I just was curious, actually, in a number of talks, and especially this talk that came up, you know, does anybody ever think about three-dimensional gravity in this world? It's kind of a funny foil, right? So I don't know if you know, I mean, in 3D gravity, there's no propagating degrees of freedom, right? And all of that can have point sources and conical metrics. And so the interaction. And so the interaction is not local. You know, it's like a whole different ballgame. And I wonder how any of these things kind of play out in that sort of strange world. I don't know, because I haven't done it, but I have done a little sample calculation in four dimensions. If you like, I can show it. I have the slides for that. It's simply that you write down the Einstein action. down the Einstein action in not only a diffeomorphism invariant way, but in a way that's invariant under the full unitary group. And then you write down the action for the Klein-Gordon field, again, fully invariant under the unitary group, and then identify the degrees of freedom and path integrate over them. And that can actually be done and the partition function can be calculated explicitly. But then with the partition function, in principle, you have access to a lot of Function principle you have access to a lot of things now, but I haven't worked it out yet. But you can calculate the partition function. But then, you're right, it would be cool to look at the 3D case. And Rob, just in the Gather Town break, raised a similar question with it: one plus one dimensional case where gravity is entirely trivial. Yeah, one plus one even better, right? You can just do the path integral. Yes, exactly. Yes, exactly. Yeah. I think that example is worth trying. I mean, it would show either the virtues and/or the limitations of this thing, right? Well, ultimately, the hope would be that we get some indication for why the dimension of space-time is what it is. Remember, Anthony Valentini, Rob, years ago said that one of the virtues of string theory is that it predicts the dimensionality. That it predicts the dimensionality of space-time up to an order of magnitude. I mean, what other theory gets it right, at least up to an order of magnitude? Yeah, well, that's a backhanded compliment, if ever there was one. I think it was definitely intended, isn't that? Yeah. Correct. It's like Weinberg's remark about an economist. An economist is someone who, if you forget your telephone number, If you forget your telephone number, we'll estimate it for you. Oh, that's pretty good. Anyway. I would have a question or just a comment, perhaps. Yeah, please go ahead. I found it interesting, Thomas, that you were also encountering a case where you had to go beyond the permutation group or the diffeomorphism group into the bigger unitary group. So I found that. Bigger unitary group. So I found that curious. And there is perhaps another connection, which is Mermin's theorem about the tomography of a state of a system from the properties of its subsystems. Are you familiar with this? There is a Mermin of the Mermin-Bartner theorem. He has this little theorem. It's actually easy to prove that if you have a system decomposed into two subsystems and you know all Systems, and you know all the correlators between the two subsystems, then this gives you a perfect tomography of the total state. It's called tomographic locality nowadays. Yeah, okay. Yeah, it's pretty nice. Yeah. Yeah, just about your comments about going beyond the diffeomorphism group to all the unit trees. Yeah, at this point, it's just kind of some kind of thought. I haven't really looked into it much. Haven't really looked into it much, but because yeah, you mentioned you looked into that as well, right? When you're writing these like um actions and things, um, yes, exactly. Um, if there, yes, you see, um, if we want to describe geometries in terms of spectra and abstract properties of operators, then all these abstract properties are invariant under the unitary group of the Hilbert space, which is much bigger than just the diffimorphism group of when you write. Morphism group of when you write things down in the position representation. And that offers challenges and opportunities because it's a guiding principle, so it helps you write down what works. But of course, it's a bit harder to do that than just have the diffomorphism invariance. But what you gain is that you can then use all of the machinery of the functional analysis of Hilbert spaces. For example, if you have an operator, then you Then you know that the set of all of its invariants under the full genitary group is, you know, if it's a self-adjoint operator or generally normal operator, is simple spectrum. And that settles that. Whereas with the diffromorphism group, it's much more messy to find out what the geometric invariants are under the diffromorphism group. Sounds very interesting. Okay, so I think we've gone over time. Over time, so perhaps we should leave it there. Gavatan will remain open for non-socially distanced interactions throughout the night.
