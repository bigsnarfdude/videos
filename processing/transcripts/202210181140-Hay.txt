Okay, so thanks, Veronica. I'll just get into it. So, thanks for the opportunity to talk about our work on exploding seed pods. So, you can see the pod from Cardamini Hirsuta that we study there exploding and ejecting its seeds. And these seeds travel for meters around this tiny weed. So, this is a big advantage for this weed. For this weed. And the other point I want to say here is that it's a very rapid movement. So this whole process happens in less than three milliseconds. And this is a trait that we study in cardamony. And we find that trait in cardamomy species and not in other species in the Brassicaceae like Arabidopsis. And so we can use this comparison between Arabidopsis and Cardamina to try and understand. In cardamomy, to try and understand how the trait works. And so, as a really rapid plant movement, it has these common features that it needs to slowly store elastic energy and then rapidly release it. So, we're definitely in Rico's elastic world here. And so, we can show this with a bow and arrow. So, it's the stretching of the bow here that deforms the shape and causes elastic energy. The shape and causes elastic energy to be stored in the bow. And so, in the case of the fruit, it's the differential contraction of lignified and non-lignified tissues in the fruit valve that generates this tension. And so, then, of course, this tension is rapidly released. So, here when the string is released, that potential energy is converted to kinetic as the bow relaxes. And that's what fires the arrows. And that's similar to the seed launch in the fruit. The fruit. And so, what I want to focus on today is that first part, how that tension is generated. And one reason for this is that we made a discovery previously that these tissues are not deforming through drying, because this is also, you know, this drying hypothesis is very common for how, you know, tension can be generated in explosive seed pods. But it's not the case here. And this was something that Richard Smith first observed. That Richard Smith first observed when he was looking at these plants in the greenhouse and he saw the valves exploding, like you can see here, these coiled valves. And when they landed in the water, they didn't relax, but instead they curled tighter. And so he went, hmm, that's interesting. And so now we know that that's because the tissue contraction, so the part of this differential contraction, the tissue contraction is active. Contraction is active, it's not a passive process through drying. It requires live cells that can maintain turga pressure. And so, you can see if you put that valve actually into salt or sugar and they lose turga, that's when you get the relaxation. And so, we could image and 3D segment the cells in these osmotic treatments and see that even though these cells are expanding in response to Turga, they're In response to Turga, they're actually shortening in length. And they're contracting in length because their cell surfaces are bulging out. So this is a 3D shape deformation similar to this air mattress here. So because of the bulging out, the air mattress is shortening in length. And so in our case, the bulging that you can see here is due to the shape and the anisotropy of these cells. Anisotropy of these cells. So they expand in response to Turga, but they contract in length. And so, in this model of the process that we did, it's because of the shape, this very large surface that these cells have relative to their shallow depth. That's really important for the contraction. And the fact that there's material and isotropy in this length direction. So these. 10th direction. So these two features were really important to allow contraction. And what we want to know now is how, through the process of development, do these cells acquire these features? So previous work that we did had showed that we measured Turga, and we know that Turga is staying constant throughout development here. And so essentially, the cells are transitioning into this configuration here through growth. Here through growth. So, what do we know about growth in these fruits? So, one thing that's interesting is that the fruit of these closely related species is almost identical. So, even though this is explosive and this Arabidopsis fruit is non-explosive, they have a very similar shape. But it's important to remember that even very similar organ shapes can arise. Very similar organ shapes can arise from very different cellular growth patterns, and that's certainly the case here. So, if we look at the epidermis of cardamomy, we have these uniformly square-shaped cells, whereas in a rabidopsis, these cells are so elongated, you can't even fit a single cell into the same field of view here at the same magnification. And so, these Arabidopsis cells are getting very, very large. Getting very, very large through elongating in a single direction. So, we can see in that graph here that cell area is increasing for these Arabidopsis cells, but the largest empty circle that you can draw in these cells is staying pretty constant. So they're just elongating in one direction. And so, what you can see is that that is not the case for cardamomy. So, to understand cellular growth here in cardamomy, we did time-lapse imaging. Time-lapse imaging. And so, what I'm showing here is eight days of fruit development where we're imaging at different time points, and then we can quantify growth between those time intervals. And so what I'm showing is the growth anisotropy, because it's very distinctive that there's these two peaks of bright colours. So high anisotropy here and here. And oh, I need to remind you that fruit only grow by cell. Fruit only grow by cell expansion. So after fertilization, growth is by expansion, not division. So most of the growth occurs in this first 48 hours. So this is when the cells are elongating in this direction and the fruit is elongating to its full length. So that's when there's a lot of growth and it's highly anisotropic. Then there's this period of more isotropic growth. You can see the colours are dark here. You can see the colours are dark here. And then we've got the second phase of anisotropic growth where the direction has changed by 90 degrees. So now these cells are growing only in width. And this is the part of development where the fruit are growing to reach their final width. And so during these experiments, we imaged microtubules at the same time, and we could see that the alignment of microtubules predicts. Alignment of microtubules predicts this direction of growth. So, here at this point, the microtubules are aligned transversely, and that predicts this elongated growth. Then there's a period of realignment of the microtuburles, which is associated with this more isotropic period of growth. Then there's this realignment, and the microtubules are now all aligned parallel to the long axis of the fruit. And that produces. Fruit and that predicts the second phase where cells are growing in an orthogonal direction to that. So, we also use genetics to show that these microtubules are required for this anisotropic growth and they're required for the explosive coiling of that valve. And we also use live imaging to look at the cellulose synthase subunit, CISA3, to show that it co-localizes with my. That it co-localizes with microtubules. So these are these small puncta here. And so we can say that when we're looking at microtubules orientation, that's a good proxy for the direction that cellulose microfibrils are being synthesized during these stages of development. So at this point, we're really interested in this phase here, because this is where those parameters for contraction For contraction have emerged. We've got this anisotropy in this direction along the cell length, and we've got this growth in one direction to produce these square-shaped cells. So we're thinking that this, you know, this phase here, this growth phase, is what's important to achieve this unrealized shortening of the reference length of time. Shortening of the reference length of these cells. And it's that failure to realize that contraction that, because, of course, this epidermal layer is attached to all the inextensible layers of the fruit, that builds tension. So how do we look at this problem? It's a very simple idea, but it needs to be tested through modeling, and it needs to be tested using a growing mechanical model of 3D. Mechanical model of 3D cells. And so that's what Gabriella did here. She used a file or also a block of cells that are growing by strain-based growth. And then she specifies material and isotropy in just this one direction. And it's very important that this material can't relax. So, because there's no growth in this direction, you saw from the previous slide. There's only growth in this direction. Slide: There's only growth in this direction. So, when she inflates that template and calculates strain, she sees that's what I'm showing here: that strains in this direction, and so growth will be in width. And so, that's what I'm showing here in this graph, that these cells grow, and then we stop the simulation once they've grown to a square shape of 50 microns. And what you can see by the stretch. By the stretch ratio, is that the wider the cell grows, the more that cell length is contracting. So just to be clear, the stretch ratio is just the ratio between the length of the cellophiles when they've grown, but their ends are still fixed, and then the difference, the ratio between the length when we release those cells. So essentially, So, essentially, this is great. We've been able to show that this contraction can emerge from just the interaction of growth with anisotropy. So, we've been able to sort of use modeling to test and show that idea. But one thing that we were thinking about was this very parallel anisotropy that we've specified here. Because as Dan Cosgrove notes, As Dan Cosgrove nicely showed, cell walls, including these fruit cell walls, have a cross-lamellate pattern of cellulose microfibrils. And we were, so we're interested because that's a more realistic pattern, but we're also interested because we've always thought of this process as similar to a Macibon actuator. So the MacKibben actuator, you know, is this artificial ear muscle that can contract because it's got this. Because it's got this braided mesh. And so, what Gabriella wanted to do was find a modeling framework where she could specify anisotropy separately in a couple of different directions. So, this is a multi-layer model where she can specify anisotropy in two different layers, and then there's a third layer, which is the growing isotropic layer. And so, what I'm showing here is that if the anisotropy is just specified parallel, the same as the previous model, then we get contraction to the same reference length as I showed previously. So that just verifies there's no difference in the modeling framework, the results from the modeling frameworks. But what's interesting here is that if she specifies that anisotropy in two different directions, so that we Different directions so that we get a crossed fiber pattern, then actually, what you can see is even though these have the same amount of stress, there's more stress accumulated through growth here in this model. And when that's released, there's actually the file contracts to an even shorter reference length. And so we can see that in this parameter scanned here. This parameter scan here, where she's looking at different fiber angles from parallel through to 56 degrees here. And in all of these simulations, she grows the cells until they're 50 microns wide, like I showed previously, or the maximum width that they achieve through growth. Because what you can see is that as the fiber angle increases, Increases, this starts to restrict growth in width. And so you can't even achieve 50 micron width. But what we were interested, what I was showing you in the previous slide, was going from parallel fibers to these slightly crossed fibers at 14 degrees gives you this increase in contraction. So there's an advantage to this cross-laminal. advantage to this cross lamellate pattern. And the other thing that I want to point out here is that this also provides a mechanism to halt growth. So, you know, what you can see here is that if the fibers are parallel, then these cells can grow to hundreds of microns in width. So what I'm showing here is the final, the maximum width that growth can, you know, that these cells can grow in this. You know, that these cells can grow in this model. And so, actually, by having crossed fibers, it can restrict growth to, you know, sort of limit it to more biological values, you know, to get these square cells. So this is an interesting thing. And this is my final slide about the open questions here. So because of this last bit of modeling that Gabriella did, we could see that there's a potential influence of this. There's a potential influence of this cross-lamelet pattern of cellulose fibers. Because, in our very particular case, here that pattern actually seems to interact with growth to produce length contraction. And it also seems to provide this intrinsic growth halting mechanism. So, those are the things that we'd like some comments on. This is work that's funded by the Plant Morphodynamic Dynamics. The plant morphodynamics unit in Germany, and it's a project I started with Richard Smith. The work I've shown today is all done by Gabriella and Ryan. We're working in Miltis' department in Cologne. So, thank you. And Gabriella's online too to take any questions you might have for her. Oaxaca is muted. Is Oaxaca muted? Should we get now? Sorry. Okay. Let's start over with the applause. Yeah, so let's applause then. Applause, okay. Actually, um, so we have time for one quick question. I was going to say, um, Rico, did you keep your hand up? Yeah, I did. I did, I'm afraid. So thanks, Angela, for a lovely talk. One thing that occurs to me, given the talks we've been hearing, is that if you've got mutants, non-exploding mutants, would be a fantastic resource for looking at things that reduce cell adhesion, like quasi-mutants. Cell adhesion like quasi-mutants because they wouldn't be able to withstand the tension because it would tear the cells apart. Or you could also get extensibility mutants that basically can't, because you extend, because your extensibility is increased, then you again, you can't build up the tension. So have you looked for mutants that don't explode? And what sort of things happen in such mutants? So we always do mutant screens. And so the mutant. And so the mutants that we've been looking at are actually to do with the opposite side of the valve. So the differential, you know, contraction is that one has to contract and the other is lignified, you know, and has to not contract. So the mutants we've been more interested are in those. And that's because the lignum pattern is needed for the quick release, you know, mechanism too. So, but you're exactly right. If you delete that layer, Right. If you delete that layer, so we have mutants where there's no lignin, or we have lots of mutants that control the lignin, etc., those will just keep contracting. And also, the plant can't resist that contraction. And so they buckle down the sides of the fruit. Thank you. But it'd be good to, I mean, but we could do the opposite in a more seeing as those mutants didn't come out of screens, we can always do reverse. Come out of screens, we can always do reverse genetics and look at CRISPR things of QASI, and that's a good idea.
