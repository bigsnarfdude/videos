Express in a proper way how happy I am to be at this wonderful workshop that you organized. Thank you, thank you, thank you very much for having me. I had so much fun. I hope this talk will not change this. Okay, so as Caroline said, as Carvo said, this is about the time-dependent linear Schrodinger equation, which may not come as a complete surprise in the context of this workshop. Here it is in its full beauty with the usual Here it is in its full beauty with the usual ingredients. So we have the wave function, we have the time deliver, we have propression, I omitted the constant in front, we have a potential, and we have initial data. And we heard this many times at this workshop. So the typical situation is we have the initial data, we have the potential, and the question is how to compute the unknown solution to this equation. And one of the main challenges is that typically the dimension of the state space is very large. Is very large. Okay, so far so good. In this talk, I will change the perspective a little bit in the following sense. So, here I will consider a situation where both the potential and the initial data are not really known or only known to a certain extent, meaning that there is a certain degree of uncertainty in the data. So, let me explain why this could be the case. So, Graham and also Eric explained. Graham and also Eric explained very nicely that the very first thing which you do when encountering the molecular Schrading query is the Bonhaupt mine approximation. So you do a kind of model reduction and in order to do this you have to compare the speed potentials to the energy potential surfaces. This involves computations and computation involves errors. So that means when we have this Schrodinger equation for the nuclei, even before we start doing approximations, we must be aware that this potential here This potential here is hopefully good enough, but not exact in a certain way. And the same holds for the initial data, because the initial data also have to be calculated with some long-state calculation and the like. So here I will assume that there are errors in the initial data and errors in the potential. And the question is, what can we do about this? Therefore, I will consider what is called a parametric Schrodinger equation. Roughly speaking, the idea is to follow. We do not solve it. The following. We do not solve one problem with one potential in one set of emission data. We want to solve the family of problems. And this family of problems is parametrized by a parameter vector y, which is in some parameter space, which for simplicity is just the interval from minus one to one in the d-dimensional space. So that means for every y we get a different potential and we get a different initial wave function and hence Initial wave function and hence a different problem, and hence a different solution. The solution will also depend on y. Good. So now, of course, we could just say from this family of problems, we just pick the right y, we solve that problem, and then we're done. Unfortunately, we do not know what the right y is, because this is due to uncertainty. This is modeled by the fact that y is, in fact, the realization of a random variable. For simplicity, we just say. And there, for simplicity, we just say it's uniformly distributed, and we assume that this parameter space is large. So, this small d has high dimension. Okay, so two important remarks about this. So, there is some randomness in our problem, but this is not a stochastic differential equation. There's no stochasticity in the dynamics, there's no Veno process under that. And the second is: why is not an additional space variable? Because there are no Space variety, because there are no derivatives with respect to y. The Laplacian only acts on x, not on ve. So, what to think about this is the following. I mean, you could just say I draw a random vector from this distribution, and I have a fixed vector, and for this fixed vector, I have a fixed potential, fixed psi zero. For that problem, you can just solve the Schroeder equation in the usual way. So, that's what is important. Now, of course, since we Now, of course, since we have a random variable, the solution itself is also random. And typical goals would be to approximate, for example, the expected wave function. Or even more, we would like to see how the entire solution at a fixed time changes when we change the problem, so when we change y. So this is what we understand by uncertainty quantification. In this talk, I will focus on time and on y and not so much on x. So therefore, I will. And not so much on x. So, therefore, I will henceforth omit the space variable and just write wave function of t and y. But of course, the x is still there. And you may have noticed that I already made some simplification, and here comes the first disclaimer. So, in this talk, the dimension of the physical space is not large, it's moderate, or in other words, it's ridiculously small compared to the numbers that Eric Conces gave in his formula. So, here I consider a small problem, but Here, I consider a small problem, but with a high-dimensional random space. That's the first disclaimer. The second is, for simplicity, I consider the problem in the torus. Now, Marcus said already in his talk that there are some issues with the torus and also with other boundary conditions here. Of course, I assume that this is not the case because, for example, we have a constraining potential, so we can do this. The reason why using the torus is the same as in all the splitting talks we had yesterday. I want to use splitting. Right, so here's the parametric Schr√∂dinger equation again. As promised, I have now omitted the x variable. And just as a warm-up, I would like to present what standard Monte Carlo is. Standard Monte Carlo would be where the first choice to approximate this problem. So this is very simple. You just take a number m, which is sufficiently large, which is the number of samples, and then another number, which is the number of time steps. We define the step size and discrete times and you. Size and distribute times in the usual way. And then you do the following. So for every k from 1 to m, you just generate such a random vector by drawing it from the uniform distribution. For that vector, you get your potential and your initial data, and you approximate the solution of the Schroding equation by standard strength spectrum, which I do not have to introduce anymore because we have to see this very often already. So this is here where I need the periodic boundary condition because in space I want to use pseudo-spectrum. Okay, and then we can, for example, approximate the expectation with respect to y at some fixed time, say tn, but just replacing the expectation by the mean. That means we just take all the results we got at the end time for different y's, we sum it up, we take the average. Of course, we cannot do this for exact solution, but just we base the exact solution by what we got from the strength speed, and that's it. Yeah, so that's done. That's it. So that's standard Monte Carlo. It's very simple, it has nice properties because parallelization is trivial because each solve of the Schlinger equation is completely independent from the other. And most importantly, the convergence rate is independent of the dimension that is being got. However, in this talk, we won't do that because there are also some downside. Namely, the rate of convergence is slow. So the expected error scale is like 1 divided by the square root of m, which would Square root of n, which is bad. Moreover, we only have probabilistic error bounds, for example, for the expected error, which doesn't tell you anything in practice. It may happen that you take double the size of samples and you get an error which is worse, because you only have information about the expected error. Moreover, as I said, actually, we would like to have a function which tells us how the solution depends when we change y, and here we only get something about the expectations. The expectation. So, this is why I will not consider Monte Carlo here and instead move to stochastic collocation. So, here the concept is similar but different. So, here we choose finitely many vectors, again in our parameter space, this three-dimensional interval. For each of these parameter vectors, we again solve the Schring equation by applying strength splitting. And yeah, now we know the solution at these points, but we also. The solution at these points, but we also want to know them in between. And in order to do this, we simply do interpolation. So we say, okay, for all other values y, which do not belong to these nodes here, we just use polynomial interpolation. So just what we teach in our basic numerics lecture. The only difference is here we do not interpolate points, we interpolate solutions of a PDE. So the concept is very simple. So the concept is very simple. The first question which comes to mind is of course how should we choose these interpolation nodes yk here? And one thing which we always teach in the context of polynomial interpolation is that if you have many nodes, you shouldn't use equidistant nodes because this leads to undesired oscillations, as we all know. So we should choose the abscissa, so the points where we interpolate in a clever way. So the classical way would be So the classical way would be to use Chebyshev nodes, which are the zeros of a Chebyshev polynomial. Here we do not do this. Instead, we're using the Chebyshev-Curtis of scissors, which are the extrema of Chebyshev polynomials. They have similar properties. In particular, the Lebesgue constant grows only logarithmically. That's nice. And they have an important advantage over Chevy Chef, namely they're anastic. So that means, roughly speaking, if I already have five non-chefs. If I already have five nodes, and now I want to go to nine nodes, then from these nine points, five will be the same as before, and the other four points will not equal to me. Now, so this is nestedness, which has algorithmical advantages and computational advantages. So, in one dimension, this is clear. The question is, what can we do in higher dimensions? Again, the first idea which comes to mind is to use a tensor bit, just use these tension curtains, in this direction, this direction. Curtis opscisses in this direction, this direction, come up with the tensor. Yeah, of course, this is not a good idea, you know, because as I said, d is typically large, and so we run into the cursor of dimensionality, and the number of points will scale exponentially in dimension. And remember, for each point, we have to solve the Schrodinger equation once. Else, we cannot afford this. This is not. And yeah, this brings us to sparse grids. So now I have to talk a little bit about sparse grids and the experts. About sparse grids, and the experts in the audience may pardon me that I'm simplifying a few things a little bit. So, sparse grids, there's an entire zoo of it. And here I'm talking only of a particular species, which is called a smoly sparse grid. A sparse grid looks like that, and the first thing, which is obvious, is it contains less points than the tensor grid. It's a subset. So, every point you find here on the right-hand side appears also here on the left-hand side. Now, we have to understand how to choose which points we keep and which points. Which points we keep and which points are discarded. So consider this formula here. For the moment, it's not so important where this formula comes from. Consider this formula here. And we pick two green numbers. So two here, four here. So the sum of these two green numbers is six. And well, if we put it into the formula, we get two other numbers, namely three and nine. And three and nine are now the number of points we choose on the red grid. On the red grid. Now only focus on the red point. So we have one, two, three points in this direction, and one, two, three, etc., nine points in that direction. Now, of these, we construct a tensor grid, a standard tensor grid. So this is what you get, what you see here with the red points. Okay, fine. Now, I would like to change these green numbers here, but under the constraints that the sum is still 6. So, for example, I could say, okay, now choose a 3 here, then I have to choose a 3 here. Again, insert in the Again, inserting the formula gives me a new number, which is 5 and also 5 years. So now I have 5 points times 5 points. This gives another set of red points, and for these red points, again, our tenses. And I think now you've got the idea. Now I do this for all combinations of two numbers, which together yield 6, and this gives me all the points I have on the right-hand side, not 2. One exception is when the green number here is 1, so this would give me 2 to the power. So, this would give me 2 to the power of 0, which is 1, and then 1 plus 1 is 2. So, this I do not want. I want an odd number of points. So, if the green number is 1, I would just discard this one. It isn't a special case. It's also clear if I increase that number here, I get more combinations, so I get more points in total. And this is what you see here. So, those are sparse grids of different levels. So, we have this number six. So, this is for six, and this is where we increase this number on the right hand side. I increase this number on the right-hand side. So obviously, we get more points, but what is also clear is that the number of points does not grow as fast as it would for a flotens grid. Okay, so those are sparse grids. Now we have to think about how to do interpolation on sparse grid. For the moment, just consider a tensor grid. So let's go back to the situation where we just consider the red points. In two-dimensional, we pick two numbers, those were the green. Numbers, those were the green numbers, two and four, which we put into a multi-index. And we put these numbers into what is called the graph rule. So, this is this formula here, which gave us two new numbers three and nine, which is the number of points. So, graph rule established a link between this index here and the number of points. Okay, on a tensor grid, we know how to interpolate. By just constructing a tensor of Lagrange polynomials in a standard way. Lagrange polynomials in a standard way. We simply do Lagrange interpolation in 2D, no big deal. So that means on a tensor grid we can do this. Now we recall that a sparse grid is just somehow a collection of tensor grids. And this tells us how to do sparse grid interpolation. So don't look at this factor here for the moment. It does not really matter where this comes from. Of course, there's an explanation, but it does not matter. The important thing is, so here we have a tenter product interpolation. Tensor product interpolation, and then we sum up over all such indices here. So, over all sets of these green numbers. We combine them in a strange way with respect to here, which does not matter. So, this is sparse group interpolation. The important thing is, so we're doing this over a certain index set, and this index set depends on some capital L. This capital L is the level. So, this capital L tells you how many points there are in your sparse. Okay? So, sparse interpolation is actually. So sparse interpolation is actually nothing else than tensor product interpolation, but in a fancy way and then combined in a fancy way. Okay, this can be done, but of course now the next question appears, namely, well, we've thrown away quite a lot of points, which looks nice from a computational point of view, but maybe you would expect if you throw away a lot of points, you also throw away a lot of accuracy, don't you? So the question is what can be said about accuracy of these interpolations? See what these interpolations. And in order to say something about this, I need a function space, a suitable function space, which is the space here CKx. So here's again our domain, so our parameter domain, not our space domain, but the parameter domain, and we pick some k which is an integer, then x is now just some Banner space. We can think about the real numbers, but later it will be a function space such as L2. For the moment, it does not matter what x is. So now this space. So now this space CK mix contains all functions from our gamma to x with the property that partial derivatives are again continuous. And the number of partial derivatives that we can have depends on k. So this space comes with a norm, which is kind of natural. For each of these partial derivatives, you take the the c norm, which is the supremum norm, and then you take the maximum overall multi business which you have. Multi-resistance which you have. So this looks very much like the classical space CK without the mix. The only difference is that here we take the infinity norm, the infinity vector norm, instead of the one norm, which you would usually do also in sodular spaces. So here's an example. Suppose we're in two dimensions, and suppose that our k here is simply one. Then a function w is in that space here. W is in that space here, if and only if these three functions are continuous according to this definition here, but also that function. And the red one would not be included if you have CK without the mix. This is why those spaces are called spaces of dominating mixed smoothness, because you also need mixed derivative. To put it in another way, so those spaces are smaller than the classical spaces, so we have more regularity in those spaces. This is what we need for sparse grid interfaces. Need for sparse grid interpolation. Okay, so here's an error bound due to Nobel Temporium and Webster. So if we have a function in this nice space for some k, then the interpolation error is bounded by this. So this is the interpolation error because well, identity times w is the original function, and this is the interpolation operator on sparse grid with level edges. Now, on the right-hand side, we clearly have a constant. We have a term which measures the Have a term which measures the regularity of a target function. And then we have two terms. The green one is a nice term because eta L is the number of points in our sparse grid, which increases when you increase the level of the sparse grid. But this term tells you, well, that the error is going down if you're using more and more points. And the speed, how quickly it's going down, depends on the K, which comes from the regular meters. So higher regularity means higher speed of conversions. Speed of convergence, but there's the red term. And this red term is unpleasant. First, because it's not very aesthetic, and second, because it slows down conversion, because it grows when the number of points grows. So the red term slows down the convergence given by the green term. But we can handle this by saying, okay, we compensate this red term by moving from k to another rate. So for example, for every So, for example, for every k in every dimension, you can just say, okay, I choose mu to be k minus 1. So, I sacrifice a bit of speed of convergence, and then I can deal with this red term here. And this is what we want to do. So, we know there is such a rate mu, which gives us conversion of the sparse grid interpolation. Okay, and now actually we have all the ingredients we need for stochastic collocation. So, now the method is simply as following. Method is simply as following. We choose a level L which defines our sparse grids, number of points. We choose a number of time steps we want to make, then we just compute the nodes of our sparse grid, and we proceed as before. So each of these nodes, we approximate the solution with the strength splitting, and then we use sparse grid interpolation just to compute and interpret. And the result is then an approximation VTO function, which gives us the exact solution, not for finitely. Exact solution not for finitely many y, but for all y, without having to compute all y. This is actually what we wanted to have. And yeah, at this point we could stop and say, so this was the problem, but I still have a few minutes. So the next goal is to get better accuracy, because in fact we can do better and we want to do better. And this is where the multi-level approach comes into the game. So so far, comes into the game. So far everything was computed with the same step size, and one sparse grid. So go back one slide. So here we've chosen the level, so we can screen one fixed sparse grid on that sparse grid being the collocation. So now the idea is to use several different step sizes and several different sparse grids. And well first question of course why does this have any benefit, but we will see. So now if So now things become a little bit more complicated. So now we have a sequence of interpolation operators on different sparse grids. Now the index here is not the level of the sparse grids, but the number of points of the sparse grid. Moreover, we have not one step size, but a sequence of step sizes which are obtained by this formula here. So tau zero is something like the maximal step set you want to take. For simplicity, you can say, well, hey, the maximal step set is just the length of a Maximum step size is just the length of our time. So we can compute a sequence of approximations. So for each step size, of course, we get a different approximation. And the number of steps in the strength scripting, of course, it's always chosen in such a way that we end up at Tn. So now our goal is only to compute an approximation at the end time for simplicity. Of course, you could do this also at any other time. Okay, and yeah, now the idea is to follow. So on the finest level, on the finest sparse grid, the highest level, this would be our approximation. And we write this as a telescopic sum. So this term constants with this one, this term constants with this one, etc. So if you put this definition here, we can conveniently write this as such a sum. So in principle, that is the guy we want to compute, and then we only have Guy, we want to compute, and then we only have to compute the interpolant of that guy. But we're doing it now in a more complicated way, namely, we're doing interpolation of each of these parts, and for each interpolant, we use a different sparse grid with a different number of points, which may sound strange from the series fields. So, we divide our approximation into these bits here, we use different step sizes, and we use different sparse bits. Baskets. And that's an idea which is due to technical Jans-Webster and Gunsberger. So let me illustrate this by a picture. So here we have the time interval. Let's suppose our time interval is from 0 to 1 and points show you where we do approximations with the strengths with them. And L is the number, the maximal level of the sparse grids, and our slab sizes are here, etc. So the first of these terms here, by definition, so that By definition, so that that guy would be zero, so we just have that guy. And if L is equal to zero, that means we just make one single time step over the entire time. So whenever we start here and do one step with the strengths, of course, it's a very bad approximation. Then we interpolate this on a sparse grid, which is pretty fine, has many points. In the next step, we have such a difference. So now we're comparing strength splitting with half the step size. Half the step size and strength splitting, which with this step size here. We're taking the difference and again we interpolate it in a sparse grid, but now with less points. I go back one slide, so here we have more points, now we have less points. And so on. So now in the next term, again, we compare two strength splitting approximations with different step sizes. We take the difference, we interpret it, and again, over anonymous pulse, we do flat spots. And so on and so on and so on. And on the last level, On and so on, and on the last level, we have many time steps and only one single point in our spouse. Why should this work? The idea is the following: I mean, if we use a very small time step here and here, we expect that both strength solutions converge to the exact solution, which means that the difference here should be small, because both are close to the exact solution. And that means if I interpolate something which is small, I don't have to make much effort. So one single point is enough. So here, time. Enough. So here, time integration is expensive because I have a small size, many steps, but interpolation is cheap. Whereas on the upper levels, interpolation is costly because I have many points. I have to solve the training equation in each of these points, but we have extremely large step sizes, which then makes it cheaper again. So somehow we balance the computational cost in a good way. And good. Question is again. Question is again: what can be said about convergence? And so, in this paper, they considered such multi-level stochastic allocation methods for elliptic problems. It's not our idea, it's their idea. Surprisingly, for elliptic problems, you don't have time. So they considered finite element approximation and did this multi-level in the grid size. But what they gave is abstract conditions for convergence and this frame. For convergence, and this framework can actually apply to the Schrodinger equation because it's so abstract that you have some problem, you have some approximation, you have some parameter which defines how good the approximation is, and they came up with some abstract conditions which tell you that if these abstract conditions are satisfied, you have convergence. So, in principle, this can be adapted to the Schrodinger equation, but one important part is missing. And this is now all concrete. You need an error bound of this type here. You need an error bound which takes Linear error bound which takes this regularity in the parameter space into account. So assume that your potential has a certain regularity in space and in y, so in the parameter space, it has to be in the space CK mix. Same for the initial data, initial data have to be in H2, in space, and in that space. And if this is true, then you can prove that the error of the spread splitting satisfies this error bound here with a constant which Bound here with a constant which we can show is bounded. So it's like a standard error bound, but it involves also this space, CK mix, and this is what makes it complicated. In fact, this is related to some work which Christian Lubich and I did when we were so much younger. And I mean, in that work, there was no y. But if you take this proof here, you say, okay, assume all assumptions are uniform in y, then this corresponds precisely to the case where k is. K to the case where K is the zero. But yeah, cases where K are not zero are much more involved more technically. Okay. Who are we doing on time? Fine, six minutes. Six minutes, okay, good. So that's another one, sorry, I programmed 4.15, but you know, we wanted to be a bit narrow. Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, we must. Okay. Okay. So that's an error bound. Yeah, that's nice. That's what we we are usually interested in. But people in higher dimensional approximation are interested in other things. They say, at the end of the day, I want to do the following. I want to define a tolerance, I want to choose a tolerance, and I want that my error is below this tolerance. And I want to know what it costs. So what is the computational work to achieve an error which is below a given tolerance of psych. Now it turns out that the answer. Now it turns out that the answer depends on mu. It raises the question: what is mu again? It appeared 10 slides ago, and so here's a reminder. Remember the screen on red term, so this was the interpolation error on sparse grids. And I said, okay, green term good, red term bad. But at the end of the day, we get situated here. This is our mu. So the mu tells us how quick our sparse grid interpolation converges. This mu will now. Convergence as you will now prominent role because once we have the theorem which we just proved, as a corollary, you get this nice theorem here, which says the following. So, well, this is also due to these guys here in the model form to Giles. Suppose you have a tolerance, which for some technical reason has to be less than the inner Euler's number. Then you know for this epsilon, there exists a level L in a sequence of grid points. In a sequence of grid points such that you know that the arrow is lower than epsilon. Up to here, it's not surprising with a convergence method. Sooner or later the arrow will be below epsilon. But with numerical costs, which scale like that. So that the numerical cost of the multi-level estimator scales like that, and there are three cases, and that three cases depend precisely on the mean. So this middle case here is a little bit academic. That's a special case. Academic. That's a special case, and you can ignore this now, but actually, you see these two cases. The nice thing is that the proof also gives explicit formula for the number of points you need. So the number of points then tells you which sparse grid you have to use on each. So the question is now, of course, is this good or bad? And if you compare with a single-level collocation that we actually started with, you see this is really better because of a single-level collocation. The cost of a single level collocation level is like that. So here you have both terms: one over mu and one half. So on the next slide, I will see what the savings are. So that means I will divide this term by that term. Of course, okay, this notation means there is still constant involved which we cannot quantify, which we ignore. But on the next slide, I will divide this by this, and this is what you get. So you can compute what you want right here. So this picture tells you the So, this picture tells you the following. Here, in this direction, there's view, in this direction, you have the accuracy you want to achieve, and this plot tells you the savings. So, that means if we have one, that means both methods have the same costs, so you don't save anything. But if this function is very small, that means multi-level collocation is much better than stochastic collocation. And you see that this is typically the case when u is small, so low regularity, and when you have high accuracies. When you have high accuracies. So, this is where this method has most of its benefits. Okay, of course, we did numerical experiments to test this epsilon cost theorem. That is, we chose a number of different tolerances, epsilon, given by this black line here. And we cooked up a model problem, a linear Schrodinger equation with Gaussian initial data and quadratic potential such that we can compute the solution analytic. That we can compute the solution analytic curve. And then, yeah, we used this multilevel method, and we saw that indeed our error is always below this tolerance. And on the left-hand side, we see the computational work. So, of course, when epstrom gets smaller and smaller, the computational work rises. And the slope, so the average slope that we observe is this blue line, and it agrees pretty well with the predicted slope, which is 1 over mu. Now, so these two lines. One over mu of another. So these two lines are almost parallel, which tells you that indeed what the absolute cost freedom says can be observed in Mark. Okay, and so let me conclude. So we were looking at the time-dependent Schrodinger equation with uncertainty in the potential and diminished the data. And our goal was to see how the solution changed if we changed this parameter which parameters our family of problems. For the time, this quantization we use strength splitting and we use co-location in. Splitting and we use collocation in Y with interpolation on the sparse grid. We used a multi-level strategy, so that means we use different step sizes, different sparse grids. The main result and our only contribution, LESPOS all well known, is this special error bound for the strengths of this special space here. Once you have this, all the other results come as a corollary from other people's papers. Now there's an open problem. Now there's an open problem. So once we had finished this, we thought about okay, Fourier and Taurus and strength splitting, this is not so good. A grid-based method for the X discretization is not good because you stop to lower dimension. Can we combine this maybe in MCTDH? We've thought about it for some time, but I'm not very optimistic that this will work, at least not on a theoretical level. On an algorithmic level, maybe, but I doubt that we can prove something. But you end the talk with some positive. But to end the talk with some positive results, Benny Schlein in his PhD also proved similar results from nonlinear problems, nonlinear Schwider equations of cross-Petovsky types, and for nonlinear parabolic problems, which shows that this approach is also feasible for other problem classes. And that's it. Thank you very much. I wonder, so you didn't say so much about how do you model, what kind of model parametrized potentials are used. That's the first question. How would one make Make, I mean, you need a kind of model of what you don't know about potential. And the second is: why do you assume that there's a large number of parameters in this uncertainty? Okay, first question, a good question is it's a modeling thing. So you would start with the energy potential surface which you got from the calculation, and then you would think about, for example, adding perturbations, and of course, for the perturbation, you have to. And of course, for the perturbation, you have to imagine a certain type of function, which you have to guess. So, this is something which requires some insight how you got your energy potential services, actually. You think, okay, if there is an error, it's most likely of this particular form, then you will do this. But this is a non-trivial problem, it depends on the application. In our application, of course, we cooked up a model problem, which is took some potential, which in some way depended on why. But I agree. Why, but I agree for applications crucial. The reason why the parameter space is typically large is just because it allows it flexibility in the randomness. Typically, if you have a lot of randomness, you need a lot of parameters. I mean, if you're pretty sure that your initial data is is good and you only need potential stake in two dimensions or something like that, then of course this assumption does not apply. And then you don't need sparse grid and something of that like that. Sparse grid and something like that. But typically, people in uncertain qualifications say it's already an approximation to think about finitely many. They often think about infinite perturbation. So already the step to go to a vector of finite length is already an approximation. But again, this depends on the application. Do you consider an application? Did you consider application uh for a one-dimensional Schrodinger equation, uh that um uh the following wave packet and with uh can uh observe uh uh Anderson localization and uh because we know that if the professional is parallel if uh there are some randomness one D yeah and uh if uh really Uh if you know uh really uh there are only cases but some randomness you may have only traveling wave packet we we did not there because our grid was fixed so we were fixed to a to a finite interval so we could not observe the wave packet over but in fact the model problem was one D, one D in the physical space, and in five dimensional in in the random random space. In the random random space. And I'm not quite sure if I got your question, but here you can observe the randomness, you can see how the y acts on the solution, and how you get a different solution for every y. But you wanted to see some effects on the richer, there's no calculation. And if you have Excel, okay, will it be speculator function So nobody is would it be that uh just if you take expectation value of the over the averaging over the randomness you would get localization? Yeah, well it's more that um that for almost every set of parameters you need a localization, except for some where you have some privacy. And uh yeah I was wondering whether you could get such an interpolation, knowing that uh the cases where you have uh The cases where you have different behaviour, small measure, yeah. That's interesting. Of course, in our toy model, this did not appear, but that's an interesting question. Probably that would be possible, is my conjecture. I don't think you would see anything in the expected solution that or if we compute the expectation of the solution, you know the relativity and the expectation you will probably Of course, it would average out, but yeah, but I don't know how much information is. Yeah, okay, but I have one more question. Well, I am interested in how about potentials which have uncertainties in time in time. It time dependent potentially. Yes, because I'm interested in modeling atoms and molecules that interact with very strong and short laser clotters. There are standard models for these laser clots, I mean a formless one, but you don't really know what the shape is. And the outcome, I mean, we are interested in that, for example, we can compute something called a high harmonic generation. Something called a high harmonic generation spectrum, which tells you about well, this is important when you want to make that spectrum is a function of the whole history of the wave function, but that spectrum will surely be perturbed if you perturb the laser pulse model. So I guess uncertainties for time dependent potential should be possible. Time-dependent potential should be possible. Of course, you have to change the proof because for a standard spread speed, you have to modify the potential is time-dependent. But conceptually, I would conjecture that this works, because after all, this multi-level collocation does not care about what you do in the other two-dimensional. It just says, give me a solution and these grid parts, and then your collocation. But of course, you have to control if such an error bound is still possible, which allows you to. Possible, which allows you to prove conversion. But here I would be very confident that this could be done. It's a conjecture. It's not a promise, it's a conjecture.  This is a speaker relatively easier. Juan, to pronounce the first name and the first name correctly or one is correctly and it'll be about a bit about that's right. Thank you very much for the invitation. I am very grateful to be here, especially very grateful with Carolina for all the kind support. And it's been a pleasure to support her. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Now I have to
