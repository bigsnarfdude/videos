Talk, I was thinking, Do I show what I'm working on this week? Do I show the paper we're working on right now? And I thought, well, that's it. I mean, multi-tapers are deeply involved in them, but you don't actually illustrate where they come from in terms of the analysis, the seismic analysis. So I backed up a bit to talk more about this type of seismic data processing, and that has to do with deconvolving the body waves of. Body waves of earthquake signals to find scattered waves underneath, buried within those first arriving waves that tell you something about the layered structure underneath any particular station. Now, because these look at these, these methods look at the seismic structure or geologic structures underneath individual seismic. Underneath individual seismic receivers, they're called receiver functions. And estimating them is, in some ways, just a standard deconvolution problem in time series. So what I show down here are the two different ways that this is done. One with an incident P wave, a wave that comes in as a compressional wave, the first wave from a seismic event, that will convert at various different interfaces partially to S- Partially to S waves, sometimes reverberating through the interfaces. And the first wave coming in is the P wave, and waves that trail it are P to S converted phases. And their relative timing and amplitudes tells you about interfaces beneath the station. The same can be done for S waves. And when S waves convert to P, those S to P converted phases actually arrive earlier than the S wave so that they Than the S wave, so that they're a bit easier to see when they're visible and therefore are favored in certain situations. I'm also particularly interested in structures that are more complicated than these diagrams suggest because I'm interested in the elastic anisotropy within the planet, which tells you things about the stretching and squeezing and tectonics of the crust. Of the crust and mantle. So, why should we care? Well, what do we have here? Most seismologists will look here and say, Well, we have crust, we have mantle, we have a boundary between them that's named after a Yugoslav seismologist named Moho Borichik, which is given as Moho. We refer to the Moho as the transition from mantle-type rocks to crustal-type rocks. To crustal-type rocks, very large jumps in both compressional velocity and shear velocity, and therefore very good scatterers of P to S energy or S to P energy. Now, there are other interfaces, but the MOHO is what you normally are looking for if you're just trying to tell if your data has any signal in it at all. And anisotropy has to do with the shearing. Has to do with the shearing of the planet's rocks in Earth's interior. On this slide, these are various diagrams that are kind of centered on mantle anisotropy that's developed in typical upper mantle rocks that are dominated by the mineral olivine. Olivine is, the olivine crystals are about 20% anisotropic, so if you're able to line them up in a shear flow, you can You can create a pretty robust big anisotropy in the upper mantle. And so we try to investigate that with various seismic means. And this P to S scattered phase is one of the primary ways of doing that. Now, these are scenarios for the mantle in the crust. There are at least a dozen other kinds of scenarios for developing anisotropy. There can be fine layering, there can be different kinds of Layering, there can be different kinds of minerals that are highly anisotropic, micas, schists, horn blends, all sorts of things that will develop anisotropy and scatter these surface waves. And I should say that most of the signals that one can see from these crustal waves, this crustal anisotropy has to do with scattering less than the actual changes in wave speed itself, because often you don't. Because often you don't have waves that travel long enough in the in like 30 kilometers thickness of crust to develop large time delays. Okay, so this kind of is a schematic of what the P to S converted phases are like. A P wave will interact with maybe an anisotropic shear zone at depth. Most of the energy leaves as a P wave, but then part of it will convert to either an S B polarization or an SH polarization. Polarization or an SH polarization. The SH polarization is unusual because most of the time when you have flat layers between isotropic structures, you'll only have P to S V conversion, no P to S H, because it involves taking it involves taking the particle motion associated with the P wave and actually turning it. The P wave and actually turning it at right angles. And it tends to follow a particular kind of behavior that makes it easy to spot or relatively easy to spot in your data. Because if a P wave approaches an isotropy that has a particular axis of symmetry, its P to SH converged phase will flip its polarity as you cross as you go from one. Be as you go from one side of the axis of symmetry to the others, it'll go through zero actually if the P wave is aligned with the axis of symmetry itself. So that's one thing you look for in these kinds of converted phases. So this means that if you're looking at any particular station, what you want are a large number of earthquakes coming from all directions of the compass, and so that you can compare what the amplitudes and polarities of these scatter waves are at different time delays that correspond to different depths within the planet. Depths within the planet. Okay, so what do real earthquakes look like? Earthquake signals look like? And you give the impression in this previous discussion that they're all little delta function pulses that will convert to other little delta function pulses. And all you have to do is stare at them and kind of reconstruct what the layers are. And that's not how it is because earthquakes are long rupture events and they involve a lot of scattering in the source area. Of scattering in the source area, and once they hit the area where your receiver is, they start reverberating and scattering in the local crustal structure, and you have a big mess. And so here you have a very high signal to noise P wave on the vertical component. Here is the top, the transverse component is in the middle, the radial component is in the bottom. Transverse and radial are the horizontal components that are rotated. Horizontal components that are rotated to be aligned with the great circle connecting the source and receiver and perpendicular to it, transverse to it. And these are pulses and wave trains that are going on for about 50, 60 seconds. And somewhere in here, these P to S converted phases typically have a delay if you're looking at the bottom of the crust of about five seconds. Crust of about five seconds. So all of those scattered waves are inside those big pulses. So deconvolution is what you have to do. So we deconvolve it, and this was defined as receiver functions a couple generations ago by Bob Finney and then later by Chuck Langston. And the idea is that the vertically incident P wave or near vertically incident P wave, most of its motion is on the vertical component. So you use the vertical component to deconvolve the horizontal component. Deconvolve the horizontal component motions. And therefore, if you do it right, or if it gives you a good result, you will be able to determine what the time sequence of P to S converted phases are beneath your feet. How do you create this sort of thing? Well, one way of creating a prediction filter is with time domain deconvolution using a prescribed endpoint prediction filter whose coefficients you solve for using. Efficients you solve for using a big matrix, and hopefully with some damping constant so it's not too wild and unstable. It's also possible to do this in the frequency domain simply by effectively spectral division. If you do spectral division, in theory at least, the prediction filter is the ratio of the vertical and the horizontal components. And the horizontal components. And this down in here, again, you'll have a here's the radial component frequency spectrum, the vertical component frequency spectrum. You divide them, damp it with a constant in here, which is what's called the water level trick. And then this is your frequency domain receiver functions. Invert the Fourier transform and out comes a sequence of pulses associated with the bottom of the with with the with the With the structure beneath your station. Okay, so the problem is both of these simple techniques developed all the way back from the 60s and 70s, used by most of my colleagues in seismology and by me before I applied multi-tapers to it, are tremendously unstable. Tremendously unstable. So here's the way you do it with multi-tapers. Instead of taking a spectral ratio for the cross-correlation, Correlation. You treat this estimation of the receiver function in the frequency domain. That's this H of R for the radial component, the H sub T for the transverse component, and treat this as a least square estimate. And what's nice about the moldy tapers is that at any particular frequency, if you have K tapers, you get K statistically independent estimates of the spectrum at F that are. At F, that correspond to averages of the underlying spectrum over a narrow bandwidth. And so if you create vectors, complex valued vectors of these spectral estimates, then this spectral ratio then becomes a least squared problem. And it's really a vector projection problem in which you have a vector of spectrum estimates that's equal to another vector of spectral estimates. Other vector of spectral estimates with a complex-valued scalar coefficient. First, for the radial component, also for the transverse component. And solving this by means of a vector projection, here's the formula. Very simple. The denominator has lower variance than in the spectral ratio test. Test, it will have two K degree statistical degrees of freedom if you've got K tapers, because you have two degrees of freedom for every spectrum estimate, I can spectral estimate. Okay, so what do those formulas look like? These are really ugly, but they code really nicely. It's not very, very hard, and especially once you're in advanced languages and stuff, you're able to sort of use, you know, Sort of use vectorization of your variables to get things done. Here are the eigenspectral estimates, the formula for that. The coherence of the vertical and the radial component is here. The coherence of the transverse component and the vertical component is here. These are the formulas. Sums over the spectrum estimates. Over the spectrum estimates at sums over the spectrum estimates at a particular frequency f. The receiver functions themselves, again, this is that dot product in here, but expressed as a sum. And also, if in case you're worried, you can put in a damping constant in here as well that's estimated from the pre-event noise. If the pre-event noise gives you an idea of how much signal-to-noise you actually have in your Noise you actually have in your particular seismogram, it allows you to sort of downweight those seismograms for which the pre-event noise is so large that it may be affecting your estimate out of the it may be influencing your estimate of the receiver function from the actual body wave. One nice thing about how this works with the coherence is it also possible. With the coherence, is it also possible to get a variance on the receiver function estimate? And it's a variance that is a function of frequency. It is different for every one of the frequencies in principle. You might think, oh, it must be some constant someplace, but as you'll see, it is not. This coherence is highly dependent on frequencies, as you'll see. Okay, so here's the example from that same station. That same station at RT in Russia from an earthquake on Bastille Day in 1989. On the left-hand side are spectra. You have the vertical component spectrum of the P wave, transverse component, radial component. The pre-event noise spectrum is the dashed line below it. You can see that there's a couple of orders of magnitude higher, so this is very high signal to noise. The P spectrum itself, The P spectrum itself, the different components have much different amplitudes. That's fine. And their coherences are here. Most of the time, the coherences are above the simple expectation of 0.3, sometimes close to one, but often not. It's highly variable. It's not quite clear why it should be one way or not. And in fact, when you look at a large data set, many events, same station, it turns out that. It turns out that the coherence does seem to be somewhat random. It has a lot of fluctuations, as we'll see as we start averaging stuff. The receiver functions themselves, the time domain receiver function from the inverse Fourier transform of those functions is here. And also here are the frequency domain receiver functions. And what's key in here is this is the, is that you've got Is the the is that you've got the amplitude and the phase of the receiver functions are here, uh, uh, and the and and they have uncertainties that are shown with with error bars. And that the thing to note is that the uncertainties for this particular event, this particular station, highly variable with frequency. So what does that mean? Well, what you're going to want to do is not to have to depend on a single receiver. Depend on a single receiver function from a single event when you've got all the earthquakes on the planet for as long as that station's been recording data. You want to combine all that data. And what these uncertainties allow you to do is to stack the receiver function in a variance-weighted sum. You can downweight those receiver function estimates that have high variance and upweight those that have low variance. Weight those that have low variance. Now, what's more or less average in here? Well, this is station RT, 442 events, and the coherence has been summed, basically all summed. And you would like in the perfect world is for this coherence to be close to one. And this is not a perfect world. So instead, the expected value for random noise is about 0.33. It's one-third in this case, because there's three eigenspectra that were used. inspector that were that were used so the uh uh uh so it it follows the the the statistics of two and and and four degrees of freedom uh and and and so and so uh the coherence for the radial vertical uh coherence and the transversent vertical coherence are above this aggregate in an aggregate sense uh uh for for that station and and it turns out that that is actually significant Is actually significant at the well above the 99.9% confidence level. I've got another map, another example that shows this. And it goes out to fairly high frequency with about the same amount of coherence, net coherence, essentially, out to here to six hertz, which is someplace that no seismologist had dared take a receiver function before. And what this does is it allows you to go to higher frequency. You need to go to higher frequency. The multi-tapers allow you to go to higher frequency relative to other methods. This is an example on the left, is the station RT in which a time domain deconvolution was used. Stations were stacked and attempts were made, and we were able to actually detect interesting things, interesting signals in this data. But these were because But these were became much better and much more stable when we started looking at using a multiple taper correlation in which we could fill out in which fine detail what the receiver function would look like from all directions of the compass. The y-axis here is the back azimuth degrees clockwise from north, which is the direction that the earthquake is coming from. Now, the green box is showing you if. Now, the green box is showing you a feature that we jumped on in 1998 that suggested to us that we had strong anisotropy in the lower crust underneath this station. And what you could see in the radial and the transverse is that you had a big signal that flipped polarity across about 60-degree back azimuth. And at 60-degree back azimuth, the radial component had its highest amplitude. That is diagnostic of seismic anisotropy. Of seismic anisotropy in the deep crust there. On this side, you see the same signal, but in a great deal more detail and at higher frequency, which gives you better depth resolution. This is just to give you the same, the same, looking in here, you can see that this signal up here flips polarity at roughly about 60 degrees. And it's at that. Degrees. And it's at that point, the radial component is at its largest amplitude. And that is, theoretically speaking, the effect you expect from a P to S converted phase in the presence of strong anisotropy. Okay, so what about the frequency domain? What about the statistics of how these work? I told you I used three multi-tapers and I used P, the time bandwidth project 2.5, but these Product 2.5, but these are variable parameters. You can change them back and forth to lower values of the time bandwidth product or higher values. In the case of seismic data, you don't quite have the same problem you have with some other kinds of data because the data sets are in some sense infinite. You could actually extend the window out into this lower area here. Actually, you would not have put this. Not have put this a P wave at the start of this data set. You would put the P wave maybe at about a quarter of the way in this timing. But what happens is that the longer data sets you have and the shorter data sets you have, the time series you do for these analyses give you different amounts of signal for time delays. If you use a shorter window, 20 seconds in the P. Shorter window, 20 seconds in the P wave, you're able to actually reconstruct signals with delay times that are fairly short. And if you go to 80 seconds, you can go somewhat long. You'll notice that they tend to agree, but the shorter your data window, the more likely you are only to be able to resolve reliably signals at very short time delay. Another thing to do is to try to manipulate the To manipulate the data that comes in so that you can rotate it to actually the P wave, the actual P wave motion and the actual SV motion, the shear wave motion, rather than the vertical and the radial. And to do this, you can then what you do is you rotate the vertical and the radial components by a particular angle that's predicted by how far away the earthquake is. When you do that, actually, it turns out. When you do that, actually, it turns out that what looked like the vertical and radial being having high, relatively high coherence for much of the spectrum that you analyze, that's actually an artifact of the fact that the P wave is coming in at a finite incidence angle. And so part of the P wave is actually sitting on the radial, and you're not actually seeing any scattered wave energy in that. When you rotate so that PNSV and PNSH can be. And PNSH can be scattering, can be compared directly. It turns out that they're about kind of an equipartition of energy in terms of scattering. Notice also, again, the black line is the null expectation for aggregate coherence at this particular station, Arain in Saudi Arabia. The 99.9% confidence is only 10% above that. And so all of this signal here is indeed a significant. Is indeed significant, but the amount of significant signal in there is not very big. An awful lot of these waveforms actually are from the standpoint of receiver functions, incoherent noise. This gives you an example of how that works. These are examples of estimates that were made in various time windows, frequencies, and earthquakes coming from particular directions. Earthquakes coming from particular directions. The averages of this set of receiver function estimates are given by these blue dots. And the actual individual estimates make a big cloud. If you only saw the cloud, you would not know that there was a real honest to goodness signal in there. So, but yet, yet, there it is. The statistics of these guys actually behave in a way. These guys actually behave in a way that seems sensible as well. In that, you expect that if you're going to make an aggregate receiver function estimate, that the residuals would follow chi-square statistics. And so up to a point, they do. For instance, in some of these estimates at various frequencies, in some of the bin averages that are done in some of these, in what I've shown you before, you've got a number. You've got a number of degrees of freedom left over in the residual for the receiver function. And the chi-squared misfit, as estimated from the coherence-generated uncertainties, tends to follow what you would expect, at least in terms of its median value. So that looks kind of okay. When you look in Of okay. When you look instead just within the distribution, not just at the medians, but the actual distributions of what those residuals are, they're somewhat broader than you would expect for the number of degrees of freedom you might be estimating. There's actually more signal in that noise that you're not retrieving in the receiver functions because the actual number of degrees of freedom that appear to be that you tell is much lower than the actual number. Is much lower than the actual number of that that is theoretic of the data that you've got. Okay, other things you can try to do is to look at depth. You recall yesterday, my graduate student, Will Frazier, was looking down into the Earth's transition zone. Well, the P to S converted phases are down at that depth, or perhaps maybe 40 to 60. 40 to 60 seconds behind the P wave. In order to see those, you actually would like what we do is we actually take the we cross-correlate the vertical component with the P wave with a time shifted copy of the horizontal components, like so. So we cross-correlate the horizontals with the time delay so that we try to center it on the P to S converted phases, the interface. P to S converted phases, the interface that we're most interested in. When we do this, we can do some interesting examples. These are bins with epicentral distance in which the natural move out of some of the traces, some of the pulses, predicted pulses, is evident. When we stack on a P to S converted phase that's supposed to be at about 220 kilometers depth, a bunch of these blue pulses line up in here. Up in here. But when we try to actually sum them at the time delay expected for a crustal reverberation, we can make this red pulse into a nice straight line. This blue pulse is another reverberation in a nice straight line. And then some of these other phases in here are shifted over like so. This is important when you have cases where the actual signals are not so visible and you need to stack them with the time delays in order to make them visible. Delays in order to make them visible out of the noise. This gives you another example of one of these things where you take one of these migrated pulses with a time delay, a receiver function that's centered on some depth point inside the planet, and then to create a single trace, you splice them all together. It's also possible to do bootstraps and jackknives. Bootstraps and jackknives with the data set. This is not specifically multi-tapers because these are actually bootstraps on the data set itself. Either taking a bootstrap of you have 100 earthquakes, you randomly sample 100 earthquakes out of that data set with replication and get your uncertainties in there. Okay, so what are you using this for? I'm going to give you. Using this for? I'm going to give you a couple of things in here to show you, to give you some applications. These are formulas for anisotropy of wave speed, directional dependence of wave speed, having to do with P wave velocity, that's alpha. Shear wave velocity is beta. Their first, their isotropic terms are A and D here. A and D here. Their first, their simplest anisotropic behavior is given by B and by E. In here, they're actually separate parts of the stress-strain tensor, so you can study them separately. And this has been done again with a simple model to show what these things look like. And when you look at a backasimus sweep, again, you're looking for P to S converted phases that change amplitude and That change amplitude and polarity with bachazimuth. This is what you'll end up seeing. These waves have been interacting with a mid-crustal layer that has an axis to symmetry that's tilted, some kind of tilted type of fabric in the rock. And it will give you P to S converted phases that have a single cosine or sine harmonic with back azimuth around the circle. If you have If you have one that's a horizontal axis of symmetry, it will have a four-lobed or cosine 2π, sine 2π variation in amplitude around the circle for earthquakes coming from all directions of the compass. Other things that one might notice are the P to S converted phase from the MOHO might undergo what's called birefringence that shows up here in the transverse receiver functions on this side. This side. So the strong sensitivity to tilted axis andisotropy is very strong, according to the laws of physics. We've also move-out corrected these synthetic seismograms to 30 kilometers depth. When these are transformed or you undergo a harmonic regression where you're actually fitting those sines and cosine terms. Fitting those sines and cosine terms to it, these signals come out very clearly. Here, the anisotropic layer in the mid-crust with a tilted axis of symmetry shows up with these two-lobed patterns with opposite polarity at the top and the bottom of the layer. There is a four-lobed pattern also that has opposite polarity at the top and bottom of the lowermost layer. And the laws of physics predict that there is a relative. Predict that there is a relative phasing of the radial and transverse P to S converted phases that is predicted by anisotropy, and there's another relative phasing of them that's not predicted by anisotropy, which we call unmodeled. And if you do the analysis and the regressions and find out that the unmodeled amplitudes are low, then that suggests to you that the signals are anisotropy, or sometimes it's an interface dip as well. Interface dip as well. So we've got that there. So there's also a case where we only have S-wave anisotropy through the crust and the only signal is PS by refringence that gives you this big signal here. Now, you might want to know what the station looks like. And the station gives you a, this is a station Array in Saudi Arabia. It gives you Arabia. It gives you a strong Moho pulse here, but that pulse there is at the base of an anisotropic layer because you have a very strong signal here that has a two-lobed variation with MACAS in it. At death, in the mantle, roughly another two and a half seconds down, deeper than the Moho, is another signal that has very strong anisotropy. Another signal that has very strong anisotropy that's within the mantle that is another interface that is strong, for some reason, some strong shear. Now, I'm going to stop here because I'm running over, but this gives you a picture of what one is able to do with these signals. I'll just rush through and just to make a couple comments on the crustal anisotropy just from the science side. We discover that pre- We discover that the anisotropy in the P waves has a stronger influence on these converted phases than does the VS anisotropy. This is different from the other kinds of metrics that seismologists use for inferring anisotropy, and therefore it's complementary. A tilted axis of symmetry generates larger PS and SP waves than a horizontal symmetry axis, and particularly for near-vertical incidence of the waves, waves that may be coming through Earth's core, for instance. May be coming through Earth's core, for instance. And this is important because these signals are quite common in real data, meaning that there are a lot of structures that have orientations that most geologists and most seismologists are not worrying about. Sheared layers in the crust are very common, but are better to isolate with the short-period receiver functions than with PS by refringence. And then we've also discovered that there are some behaviors. Also discovered that there are some behaviors that can be explained by like five to 20 kilometer thick shear zones that have that have that actually have a sweep in direction that kind of makes their signals come in at slightly different times, as though it looks like a ramp in these things. And those that would suggest that within the crust, you have some unusual structures that kind of have a spiraling. Structures that kind of have a spiraling of the anisotropy, that will probably cause people some interesting late nights trying to figure out. Thank you. I also like to thank.
