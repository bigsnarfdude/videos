Great opportunity to talk. Thanks also for those of you who admitted being intimidated, because I definitely am. So I'll try to make this quick so we don't have to hurry through lunch. I'm going to talk about how thinning that starts at the margin of the Greenland ice sheet diffuses, makes its way into the interior, eats away at the ice, and draws down ice along outlet glaciers in Greenland. So, this is work. So, this is work that was mostly done during my PhD at the University of Texas. Jeannie Catania was my thesis advisor, and others had a great deal of input and helped me along the way. And so, and I want to acknowledge that this was funded by mostly by NASA, but a lot of the modeling runs that I'll show were done at the Texas Advanced Computing Center attack. Center attack. Okay, so this is a total intro slide that everybody in the room probably knows what I'm going to be talking about, but just to get our bearings here, looking at a map view of Outlet glaciers in Greenland, this is kind of how they're situated. So this is a view of 15 or so glaciers north of Jakobsavan. The ice flow here is from right to left. We know that the ice channelizes and starts. We know that the ice channelizes and starts to flow really fast through these narrow troughs. Okay, so what we also know is that a lot of the action in terms of ice loss has been happening around the margins of the ice sheet. So this is satellite gravimetry showing mass loss kind of bullseyed around the margins here. And thickness change of the ice sheet is also has been concentrated along the margins. So that means that these outlook glaciers are. means that these outlook glaciers are what have been changing pretty rapidly that we've seen from observations. So if I take a look again at the thinning rates of those 15 or so outlet glaciers in West Greenland, we see that thickness changes have been very heterogeneous. So as I said in my intro, I came from the world of observation, so this was kind of my intro into the Greenland ice sheet. The Greenland ice sheet, we mapped these thickness changes and then we started thinking about why different glaciers respond differently to climate forcing, both ocean and atmospheric climate forcing. So you can see here that some of these blue glaciers have thickened, dynamically thickened. Other glaciers haven't done much, and then the red ones have thinned quite a bit. Here's Yampro 7 down here. Hundreds of meters of thinning. So, how do these glaciers So, how do these glaciers lose ice, lose mass or thin? So, here we have a cartoon of a glacier flowing from left to right and ending in the ocean. If we have, oh sorry, I should have deleted that slide, never mind. Okay, here, so if we have, let's think of thinning in this one particular way. If we have a retreat of the terminus, then some initial thinning is initiated near the terminus. Initiated near the terminus. And that thinning can either diffuse up glacier, right, and continue to draw ice down further inland, or thicker ice can kind of overpower that thinning perturbation as it affects downstream. And so the thinning perturbation is kind of flushed out of the system, right? So in reality, both of these processes are happening at the same time. So what we're going to be looking for here. So, what we're going to be looking for here is places along Outlook Glacier Flow where the rate of downstream invection of a thinning perturbation is large enough to overpower its ability to continue to diffuse upstream. So, we're going to be doing this by looking at the Piclet number that comes from the kinematic wave equation, which many of you in the room are intimately familiar with. So, this Piclet number gives you a ratio of these two. Gives you a ratio of these two rates: downstream invection of thinning versus the upstream diffusion. So diffusion happens in both directions, right? But here, all I really care about is the ability to diffuse upstream. So where this Piclet number is large enough, thinning will be limited along an outlaw glacier flow. So this is kinematic wave theory. This is not something that we came up with. This has been around for a long time, of course. The way The way that this is derived is by linearizing, perturbing and linearizing the mass transport equation. And by throwing out a couple of terms, you end up with this nice advection diffusion equation. This is the kinematic wave equation that we all know and love. So these are the two terms that govern the downstream advection of a thinning perturbation and then the diffusion. And then the diffusion, how it spreads. So this goes back to the 60s with the work of John Nye and some others. I do like to show this movie of a phantom traffic jam because traffic jams can be kinematic waves. So you can see that what happens is in a constant flow, when one car kind of hits its brakes for some reason, you get this traffic. You get this traffic jam, which is a kinematic wave that's actually advecting against the flow of traffic, right, and causing the car behind him to slow down and behind that car, etc. So, around the same time that Nye was doing his work on ice flow, there was also work being done on traffic patterns and using kinematic waves to describe traffic flow. Anyway, that's just a fun part too. Okay, so back to ice flow. Back to ice flow, in order to actually calculate the Peclet number, we have to assume some relationship between the flow of ice and geometry. So that's our, here we're going to use a sliding law because we're looking at the trunks of Outlook glaciers, which are mostly sliding. So this is the Ordinance sliding law. But we've shown that the results I'm about to show rely on this. The results I'm about to show rely on this particular form of the sliding law, but you can choose your favorite one. And although the numbers are a little bit different, the interpretation is not. So the thinning limits exist in the same place no matter what sliding law you choose to use. So now that we've got our sliding law, we can just plug things in here and take derivatives and come up with an equation for the Peclet number. Peclet number. So the important thing here is without showing the math, the Pacle number using this sliding law is proportional to surface slope minus the gradient, the along flow gradient in ice thickness divided by thickness. So where surface slopes are large, the Peclet number is large and we're going to be advection dominated. Alternatively, where the ice is thick, it's diffusion dominated. So along thick ice, thinning perturbations can spread rapidly. Thinning perturbations can spread rapidly along places where ice is, the surface is steep or the ice is flowing over a steep part of the bed. That's where these thinning limits will tend to lie. So I'm sort of giving you the answer here, and I'll show you what I mean. If we look at, here's a cross-section view of one of our glaciers in West Greenland, right? So here, ice is flowing from right to left, terminating in the ocean. These are the two surfaces that make up These are the two surfaces that make up this DEM difference that I showed before. So we see that this glacier retreated and thinned by some amount. Here, by subtracting off thinning because of surface mass balance processes, we're left with dynamic thinning. So this is what the dynamic, this thinning profile of this glacier looks like. So you see that there's 50 meters of thinning here. It decreases as you move upstream, and then there's a point beyond which there's no more dynamic thinning upstream. So here's our Upstream. So here's our Peclet number that I calculated using that formulation that I showed before. Along the downstream portion of the glacier here where ice is thick and surface slopes are relatively low, the Piclet number is low. So this is exactly what we would expect. Here where the ice surface is steep, it's flowing over the steep kind of bed bump or bed drop-off. The ice is relatively steep, the surface is steep and it's a little bit. The surface is steep, and it's a little bit thinner, relatively thinner, and the Peclet number goes up. So, what the interpretation here is that any thinning that kind of originates down by the terminus because of retreat can diffuse along this thicker, flatter part of the glacier's flow. It'll diffuse upstream until it encounters this steeper, thinner ice, and then it cannot diffuse any further beyond that point. So, again, that's because of So again, that's because of the way that the Peclet number falls out of the equation. So this is kind of analogous to a steep portion of a stream flow, a river. So if you think about perturbing the gentler portion of a stream flow downstream of a waterfall, perturbations will diffuse here, but they're not going to be able to diffuse up the waterfall. So similarly, Waterfall. So similarly, the steep part of the glacier flow will kind of limit thinning as a perturbation from spreading upstream beyond those points. Okay, so that's one glacier. Now, we can actually compare our Peclet numbers that we calculate along a bunch of glaciers against observations of dynamic thinning to kind of empirically calibrate how high does the Peclano. How high does the Peclet number need to be to effectively limit thinning? So we've done that here. This is looking at all of Greenland's outlook glaciers that have thinned in this 1980s to present kind of time period. The y-axis here is the cumulative thinning from the terminus to every location. So the way to read this is that when you get to 100%, all of the thinning that we're measuring is happening downstream of that point. Is happening downstream of that point. So I've accumulated all the thinning from the terminus to that location. And the Peclet numbers are plotted, they're plotted against the Peclet numbers down here. So what you see is that as we move further inland and encounter these higher Peclet numbers at steeper parts of the bed, we have more and more thinning happening downstream at those locations. Or to put it another way, if you pick off one location here, like where the Peclet number is. Here, like where the Peclet number is 3. So, sorry, I should have said that in gray I'm plotting all of the data for all glaciers, and in black I have the medians and the 25th and 75th percentiles here. So, just looking at the black medians, if I pick off where the Peclet number is 3, statistically speaking, as a median, 90% of the thinning that we are measuring along outlet glaciers is happening downstream of where the Picclet number first hits three. So you can see. Hits three. So you can see that here with this glacier. For example, as an example, if the glacier is low, it's below three, then once we exceed that critical value, most of our thinning is happening downstream of that location. Okay, so now that we've sort of calibrated this thinning limit in terms of the Piclet number, we can actually look at Greenland's glaciers that have not yet thinned. Thinned. Because this Piclet number can be readily, easily calculated just from the geometry, we can map the locations of all of these places where the Pacle number first exceeds 3 and take a look at how far upstream along each glacier terminus-initiated thinning will be able to diffuse. So we've done that for all of Greenland, or most of Greenland's outlook glaciers, where we think we have relatively good beds. Where we think we have relatively good bed data, because this relies on both the surface topography and bed topography. One complication is that the kinematic wave equation assumes 1D flow, but geometry can be heterogeneous across flow. So what we've also done is we've sampled glacier geometry across flow along a number of flow lines to try to capture that difference in geometry across glacier flow. So here's one example. This is Helheim Glacier here in the southeast. For these different flow lines across the glacier's flow and for these two different tributaries, I'm plotting the Peclet number. And in the black diamonds, I'm showing where the Peclet number first exceeds 3. So remember, again, this is our thinning limit. So any thinning that happens as a result of terminus retreat can diffuse up until it hits our limit here. Our limit here. So for Helheim, the geometry across flow is actually kind of homogeneous. So these thinning limits are clustered together. So for both tributaries, the susceptible, the part of the glacier flow that's susceptible to thinning is along these, the deeper part of the trough here. But for other glaciers where the topography, bed topography is more heterogeneous across flow, you can see that sometimes you See that sometimes you hit this kind of empirical threshold close to the terminus, but for some flow lines, we don't hit this threshold until very far into the interior. So for these glaciers in West Greenland here, because they're not flowing through kind of these homogenous across flow troughs, some of the portions of flow can allow thinning to spread far into the interior. So let's take a look. So let's take a look at this ice sheet wide. This is for, I'm plotting these thinning limits for 141 glaciers around the whole ice sheet. And what I've done is I've plotted in red kind of the minimum distance to the first time we hit a thinning limit, and the black dashed lines show the maximum, the furthest inland distance where we hit a thinning limit. So we've also taken Thinning limit. So we've also taken into account here data uncertainty in terms of our bed topography, surface topography, and surface mass balance from RACMO. And what I've accounted for is the uncertainty in picking off this empirical thinning limit. So we kind of just chose Piclet equal to three as the place where, you know, as I said before, as a median, we have 90% of our thinning happening downstream of that. Of our thinning happening downstream of that. But you can argue that you can choose a higher Peclet number or a lower, slightly lower Peclet number. So we've accounted for that as well. So the interesting thing here is that there are kind of these two different glacier types. We have glaciers like the one I showed before in West Greenland, where some of the flow lines along across their flow can allow thinning to diffuse very far inland. Far inland. And it's interesting because the glaciers that do allow thinning to extend far inland typically don't hit that Piclet empirical limit until the very end of their flow, where you reach the ice divide. For other glaciers, like these kinds of glaciers like Helheim, that flow over very steep bed topography, none of their flow lines will allow thinning to extend into Allow thinning to extend into the interior. And so, you know, for these glaciers that are where you don't see any black or very small, short black dotted lines, that means that we're very certain that their thinning limit is in this location where they kind of flow over the steep bed to button. So, let's see. Yeah, that's what I just said in words. So, another interesting thing here is that they Another interesting thing here is that they, these, even though the thinning limits are heterogeneous around the ice sheet, they kind of correlate with gentle and mountainous bed topography. So if we look at portions of the ice sheet where glaciers flow through very mountainous topography, we have these very certain thinning limits at the location where the trough kind of begins, the submarine trough begins. And then in gentler parts of bed topography around the ice. Gentler parts of bed topography around the ice sheet, that's where we have all of these glaciers that can allow thinning to spread all the way into the ice sheet interior to the divide. So the ice sheet, this is kind of a takeaway, the ice sheet is much more susceptible to terminus-initiated thinning, spreading very far into the interior where we have gentle bed topography. Okay, just quickly in a few minutes, we also did some numerical modeling here to see whether To see whether a higher-order numerical model can sort of corroborate our kinematic wave and Piclet number approximation. So we used ISSM to model two glaciers, one of these two different glacier types. One glacier that flows over this very steep topography into its trough, where we should have kind of hard thinning limits where the flow enters the trough. And then a glacier from West Greenland. And then a glacier from West Greenland that should allow thinning to spread far inland. So we initialize the model and then we force, we just chop ice off at the front. So we force terminus retreat and then we see how the glacier evolves. So here's a movie of this type 2 kind of a glacier. So what you'll see is the terminus wiggles around a bit, then it stabilizes, and we have this thinning wave diffusing into the interior, but it does appear that it reaches. Does appear that it reaches this limit and doesn't diffuse much further inland. And this limit that we've found in the numerical model corresponds to our Piclet equal to 3 locations along these flow lines that I've plotted in black dots. Alternatively, the other West Greenland glacier, you'll see the terminus will retreat a few kilometers and thinning starts to spread far inland. Much more of the catchment begins to thin dynamically. And that's because this glacier does not flow over that kind of steep topography, and it can allow thinning to diffuse into the interior. So it does seem like our higher-order numerical model is showing the same thing that the kinematic wave theory would have predicted. The other interesting thing is that the time scales of response are very different for these glaciers. So because this Because this glacier that here is labeled KAK, this is the one that allows thinning to spread far into the interior. That's a slow diffusive process, so it plays out over a much longer time scale, whereas the glacier that thins quite a bit, but its thinning is limited, the response is much faster because that thinning doesn't continue to diffuse further and further inland. But the interesting thing is that this glacier that is plotted in green, That it's plotted in green. So, sorry, I should have said this is the mass loss versus time here. So, even though this is kind of a smaller system with lower ice flux, it responds more slowly, but eventually it does lose just as much mass as this larger system that responds much more quickly. So, I'll just leave this last slide up here. What we showed is that using kinematic wave theory through the Piclet number, we looked for these thinning lenses. Through the Vicle number, we looked for these thinning limits. We've mapped the thinning limits around the ice sheet and found that gentle bed topography can allow thinning to diffuse much farther inland than along glaciers that flow through mountainous topography. And that this kind of has a control on the timing of the response of these different systems as well. So, thanks very much. I'll take some questions. So the way this has been touched on us in the past is to look at the ratio Q value, which is the reduction in amplitude or distance equivalent to the wavelength of that relation. And the nice thing of doing it that way is that the Q value is actually a frequency tag, the wave has to be tagged. Yeah, much better as well understanding what's happening because what you're looking at here is the ratio between diffusion and wave proportion. And that ratio is the wave dependence. And if you normalize it like this, it's an idea by probably an ionizer. It's a clever idea. And it's the Q value of something that you have, it's I specs and so on. It's the same information. That's one point. The other point is how you arrive at this. Is how you arrive at this experimental value. It sort of might be okay with doing, but it sort of seems to be that whenever you perturb the muscle foundations, the muscle force is concentrated on perturbers. That just has to do with the general shape of the patients. You see it in Alps, wherever you go. And Charlie Raymond Parliament writes this to F value, which was the ratio of muscles for turbulence expected by them. Terminants by the average of passports and basically it's all concentrated out determinants. I'm not sure that's necessarily a function of these time scales. It's something that will happen when we go from one steady state to go another time. So if your value of 3 is based on where the muscles is concentrated, I got a little bit worried. We're always gathering. We'll always get that. It will always be concentrated close to the computers. No, it's not basically telling you where upstream diffusion valves. No, no, even if you had whatever rays you have, whatever rays you have, you always have the same sets, they don't really. It would take maybe a different amount of time for it to happen. I'd have to think about that. Yeah, I don't know quite not how to answer. Because sometimes when people talk about the game by base theory, they start talking about the wave speed. But you are emphasizing merely that it's when the diffusion is dominating, then you have a faster change. Dominating, then you have a mass response. Yeah. Yeah, and I guess what really the bottom line of what we're showing in words is that where glaciers, the glaciers that do flow over these kind of steep bed bumps, that's a control on any mass loss that's happening downstream. Right? It can diffuse in that area. Anyway, I'll have to think more about it. Yeah, we'll talk more about. More about, yeah, we'll talk more about. I'll give you an escape hatch with an easier question. Do you take into account the actual change in the thickness in the geometry as it evolves, or is it that that's just too small to matter? It is too small to matter on these time scales. So, that is a very good question. And you know, the kinematic wave theory, you're linearizing around some reference state. Around some reference state. So that we're not taking into account any change in that reference state to calculate. I mean, I'm mostly thinking that the thickness probably doesn't change that much, but maybe the slope is significant. Yeah, maybe, but for these glaciers that do have a very hard limit here, these kinds of geometries are so steep that you would have to. Yeah, you would have to do a lot to change the geometry to change the thinning limit there. So it may have some impact on those flat areas, but it's not going to change the final story. Yeah, and that's why we're really looking at like centennial kind of geometry changes, because once you go beyond 100 years and really start to change geometry, then this is not an appropriate way to do it. Alex, I think. I apologize if this. I apologize if this is similar to a question I've asked you before, but so it has to do with this timing question, where if I understand your interpretation correctly, the Peclet number looks something like the inverse of the time scale of the response time scale. Where the high Peclet number, I think in the orange case, it's all up front, so you have a very fast response time scale. Yeah. Yeah. So that setup for my question is: what is the implication for negative Beckley numbers? Oh, I so that what that would mean is that physically, I think what that means is that your thinning perturbation is a defecting upstream. Your wave is propagating. Your wave is propagating, is it vecting upstream? Is that a satisfactory answer? No, I'm just thinking about it. Because, I mean, so there is a sense of negative Peclet numbers in your formulation, right? Basically, where the bed is reverse sloped. Yes. And, yeah, so is that like it's so it's affecting the wave is affecting in the opposite direction of what? Effecting in the opposite direction of what we would normally expect. Right. But it's not just the linearization of random methods because it's solid population point of view. And it doesn't go anymore, that's sort of the notion of thickness and surface. Right. Since the definition was standard uses at definition for that for the record number, could you please go back to that expression? So it's not actually shallow x, it's the rapid sliding. It's the rapid sliding outer problem of the LLIs. Yeah, right here. Surface solves when it's thickness gradient is bad slope. So the denominator of that PE is the back slope. So when the bad slope is negative, that number is negative. That's it. Right. And that's perfectly fine. No, but and okay, I'm sorry to be on that. I'm sorry to be like that people person killing the whole fan. This is not a Peckland number because it's non-de uh it is dimensional. It is inverse thickness. Yeah, right. There's a length scale. Well by definition is non-dimensional. So this part is non-dimensional. This is just proportionality. Proportionality, yeah, just to explain the term. But yeah. But we are calculating the non-dimensional. The point in here is that you shouldn't really have this. In here is that you shouldn't really have this dd by dx in the numerator because actually you should keep the diffusion term inside the inside the diffusion term. So your equation now you can write dh by dt is c dh by dx and then d by dx of d dh by dx, that you should keep the diffusion term as a diffusion term. But in this equation, this coefficient is what's governing the effect. You should keep the diffusion coefficient inside the diffusion term because that's its physical. If you're concerned with flux, you do that, but not if you're trying to find advective wave speeds. So which would be the same equation, it's just how you interpret what you mean by the advective number. But I interpret that the blue box is an effective wave seem to be in this small diffusion, high diffusivity gradient. High diffusivity gradient. If you have a variable, diffusivity is not natural to extract it outside of diffusion term. For example, if you were solving this problem numerically, you wouldn't do that. If it's highly variable but small in magnitude, I think it is. It's an ebection-dominated problem, and you want to
