For the education, so uh, I think I should start for this quickly. Um, so let me introduce uh Lloyd Shapley's classical set of cooperative games. So, here, um, this set, just from one to n, this denotes the set of players. And then the set of cooperative games is simply defined by a value function. So, this notation is, of course, the set of all subsets of this player set. Player set, and V is just nothing but real value function with the assumption that V empty set is zero. So here, Vs just represents the value assigned to the coalition S, which is also just some subset of N. And then we further assume the non-coalition receives zero value. This is just the initial condition. Then the Lois Shapley considered the question of how to split the grand coalition. Split the grand collision value that is the V of N among the players for a given game V. So, if V is given, what is the fair share of each player of this grand correlation value, V of N? So, that was the question Lord Shapley had some 70 years ago. So, here is the result: the Shapley theorem in 1953. Unfortunately, Lord Shapley passed away in 2016, and he was a Nobel Prize winner in economics. And here, so you see that this is the given game. The phi I of V is the allocation for the player I. So this map, this allocation map uniquely exists satisfying this four. Satisfying these four conditions. So, of course, you can see what these conditions are, but this efficiency basically means that this grand correlation value over here is fully allocated to the sum of the allocation is equal to the B of N. And the symmetry means, you know, basically if I J, play, RJ are equivalent for symmetric, then their share is the same. And then the player property is. And then, third player property is, as you can see here, if the player I contributes no marginal value anywhere in the game, then the player I share is zero. And finally, linearity means that this allocation is linear in the games, V and W. And Shapley's result is that if this allocation map satisfies these four properties by now called the Shapley axioms. Now call the Shapley axioms, then it is uniquely given, and there is an explicit formula, it's just now called Shapley formula. Is there any questions so far? So, okay, this is very classical, but let me introduce another very well-known example, so-called globe game. So, here we have three players, only one has a left-hand globe. Player one has a left-hand globe, and the player two and three each have a right-hand globe. And the value function is also yes, yeah. So, should I think about this as there's this game, and players choose? I mean, I'm just questioning this vision of the value depends on the subsets. So, is the idea that players either choose to participate or they don't, and the value depends on how many players participate? Is that somehow um, so at the So, at this moment, we only consider the allocation of this grand correlation value denoted as V at the grand correlation end, the total set. So how to allocate this to the players, one, two, three, et cetera. When again, V is defined on all subset, all sub-coalitions, say. There is no, I mean, at this formula, at this formulation, we don't have a It is formulation, we don't have a strategy part or something like that. But I will. Does this answer your question or not? I'm not quite sure. I guess I was asking why is the value a function of the subsets? And so the only sense I could make of that is that the subset tells you which players are playing, or everyone has to choose one of two positions. So maybe this example could give you a partial answer. So here, Answer. So here, so the region is only when a pair of globe is prepared, that now has a value one. Otherwise, the globes has no value. And that's why in this case, the value function is one. If this correlation contains both the left and right group, that means that player one and at least one of the players two and three. So for example, V of one, two is one, but V of two, three is still zero. 2-3 is still zero because there's only right-hand gloves, and of course, at the grand correlation, that's all still just value one because we only have one pair of gloves. So that's the definition of this. We call this V as a as a as a game, as a cooperative game here in this context. And given this, what is a fair allocation to these players? That's the Shapley's question. This question. And the answer is: the value, the allocation to the player one is two-thirds, and the allocation to the player two and three are one-sixth. But before going further, when I saw this example, this is a fairly well-known example, but I found it pretty fairly interesting because I felt like the value, the allocation for play one, maybe it should be one half because this guy. Be one half because uh, this guy contributed the left-hand globe, and therefore, maybe the player two and three may need may better get uh one quarter. But the checkpoint values, um, or or I don't know, maybe a socialist might claim that it's it's gonna be one-third for everyone, uh, no matter what. But as far as I can think, there is no definite answer to this question. The question of what is a fair allocation. What is a fair allocation, or what defines a fair allocation? There's no definite answer to this question. That's why there have been lots of researchers on this topic, I believe. But the Shapely value turns out is not one-third. It's not even one-half, but two-thirds for the player one. And the rest of it is divided evenly to play two and three. And I didn't present the explicit formula for the Shapley principle here. Of course, you can find it anywhere on the Wikipedia and anywhere. But basically, the Shapley formula tells us that the value allocated the player I is totally based, determined on the marginal values that the player I contribute. So that's also reflected in this nerd player property. If the player contributes zero marginal value, then he or she receives zero. So let me, but let me explain in this case what's the Shapley formula. So this is the, so by the way, this game space is, of course, can correspond to a hypercube in Rn, right? So this vertex can correspond to empty set. This is say this is a play, one axis. This is say this is a player one axis, this is a player two axis, this is a player three axis. So this point represents the uh the player one alone, and this is the uh this is the grand course one to three in this picture, right? Um, and um shapely think about the all possible coalition order uh till the grand one. So that means that the player could join in this order, one, two, three, right, or one, three, two, or two. Or 132 or 213 or 231, right? And then 312 and 321. This disorder, right? So, of course, n factorial number of permutations the players can join. In each case, shapely think of what's the marginal contribution of each player. So, for example, this one can be seen as this correlation path on this hypercube or. Hypercube or just cube graph, right? And in this case, let's think about the player one, okay? The player one. So in this case, player one joins first. And at this moment, the value is just still zero because there's no paragraph. So in this case, let me denote this way. The player wants a partial contribution along the path. So let me write it in the integral. This is zero. So let me let me write it in the integral. This is zero, but the partial collision player two is one because once the player two joins, the value becomes from zero to one. So in this sense, we say player two contributes marginal value one. So that's the integral of the dv d2 v along the path. And similarly, d3v is zero. I mean, for this first case. But let's But let's now think of these four cases where the player one does not join at the first place. Then, of course, by definition of the game, as soon as player one joins, the value becomes one, right? So D1V, in this case, all sorry, it's all on one in this case. And on the other hand, the D2V and the D3V, on each of the paths, these four cases is a zero. These four cases is a zero, and so Shapley value is now defined by the average of this partial contribution. So for player one, that's going to be, you know, all the six cases. He contributes one for the four cases. So that's four over six. That's two-thirds. That's how this number two-thirds appears. And you know, the player one, player two only contribution margin value one in this single case. That's uh. Value one in this single case, that's why it's one sixth, and so on. Okay. So, this so I don't know if the Shaplet allocation is a fair or not, but it's just all I can say is that if one accepts these four conditions as we say, this determines a fair allocation, then that's going to be the allocation, the Sharpley formula. Okay, but at this moment, this moment the uh the question i have is um the shaplet formula or shaplet value considers how to you know how to allocate this grand correlation value so my question is why why is this grand correlation so special right there are other partial correlation here and there right and i and then this one this guy is this defined right the v is defined on every vertex here or every every correlation and chaplain And Chaffrif formula only tells me how to allocate this thing. But then, what about this? So, that's my question now. So let's consider finite graphs. So, V is a set of vertices, E is a set of edges. And we say that's oriented. So that means at most one of the edges is in E. But let's first, let's focus on this hypercube graph. Let's focus on this hypercube graph. That is, the vertices is nothing but this space of coalitions, so which can correspond to the vertices of the unit cube, right? And edges is just these things. So exactly the edges of this picture, right? And this one, for example, this one. And we say the positive direction is the direction of inclusion. So where the one player joins or joins the current coalition. So in this Current correlation. So, in this picture, this is, for example, this is the positive direction, this is the negative direction. Okay. Okay, so that's my say correlation gain graph. And now, L2V is nothing but space of real value functions on the vertex with this natural inner product. And L2e is also the space of functions defined on the edges with this another natural inner product. Natural inner product. But the crucial assumption is that I assume that this thing, F of B is negative F of A B. So F is defined always on the positive edge and the negative edge. And they have exactly the opposite sign. Okay. So at this moment, what I imagine is, so say this is the vertex S, this is vertex T. So and then I, okay. um and then i okay uh let's let's let me be uh just um coherent with the notation so this is vertex a to vertex b so f a b is basically i i imagine this guy this number as the allocate the contribution the player makes when the state transition makes transition from a to b and the assumption is if the state moves from b to a uh inversely then the player's contribution is exactly Contribution is exactly the negative. So that's basically what this means. Okay. And some simple operators. So first, the operator D of element V here, the DV on the edge, is simply defined by VB minus VA for every edge. So we see that DV is, of course, in the now L to E because D V of V A is negative of D V of N B. Of BA is negative of dv of AB, right? Of course, dv of AB is a negative of dv of BA. And then we can think of it's an adjoint and it has this form. So it's a divergence for negative because usually in calculus we have negative that or AB, have AB here, but let's say this is the divergence, D star. And then the D star D is, this is called. Is this called the graph Laplacian? And let us further introduce this simple operator di is nothing but D when this edge is the I direction, okay? But otherwise, it's zero. So of course, this is some natural definition of partial derivative on the graph. So dIV is equal to D V when the edge. equal to dv when the edge is i direction otherwise it's zero so di v which is also in l to e um now encodes a player i's marginal value contribution uh given a game b is there any question okay uh let me move on well so i i got the i got inspired uh uh by By this, the paper by Stone and Turton Horst. And then, in this paper, in their paper, which is now published in the Games and Economic Behavior, but Aristotle is a mathematician, and he was a student of Ariston. But given a game, they define a component game, which is also in the game space, means that Vi is empty, since also zero. But they define Vi as the unique solution to this Poisson's equation. The Laplace Vi equal to divergence over VIV, if I say in words. Okay. So of course, equation show indicates the Vi, the solution, is determined solely by this DIV, right? And I think they are inspired by the Shapley formula. Are inspired by the Shapley formula, which says the allocation to the player is entirely depending on his or her marginal contribution, the DIV. And then they went on to show, so of course, VI is now defined on everywhere. That's a game, in other words. But they showed that the Vi value at the grand collision coincides with the Shapley. Correlation coincides with the Shapley value. And therefore, they rediscovered the Shapley value from this. And they also show some explicit formula for the Vi. So this is possibly the simplest case. So let's consider this called pure bargaining game. It's just nothing but at the grand correlation is one, otherwise it's just zero everywhere. So it's very, very much a symmetric game. Much symmetric gain. So, what are the VIs? In their paper, they provide explicit formula for this VIs. But if you take a look, that's pretty complicated already, even though this game is very symmetric. So for two-player case, this is, as they show here, this is the Shapley value. So no surprise, that's one half for both, right? Because the game is perfectly symmetric. Both, right? Because the game is perfectly symmetric. But for other vertices or other coalitions, they appear to be one quarter or negative one quarter or something like that. And for three players, again, the Chapri value is no surprise, one-third for everybody. But for other partial coalitions, they exhibit many different values like 112, 124, something like that. So I feel like there might be. So, I feel like there might be some pattern appearing in these values, right? So, I tried to calculate it four player cases, but already, if you look at the formulas, this is already pretty daunting. This is not so much feasible calculating by hand, and I couldn't see any particular pattern. So, where is this lazy figure? So, this is the picture for two places. So, this is the picture for two players. This is the picture for three players. But I can hardly find any pattern in these values. But you can already see that this game, right? The game itself is no negative game, but these the component games, the VI, VI can surely take some negative values here and there. So, in this very simple two-player game, right, the VI. Very simple two-player game, right? The V is just defined by one only here and a zero everywhere else, right? And then the component game, V1, V2, is the Chapley value here, the one half for both. But here, it's one quarter and negative one quarter. It should be efficient. So it is the gain value zero. The sum should be zero. And then here it's negative one, one quarter, and one quarter, and this here is zero, zero. And this here is 0, 0. The question is: okay, we have pretty good understanding of these, but what are these, especially this negative value? Okay. So the question is the following. What is the, could there be any economic meaning of this Vi at the partial coalitions if S is a strict subset? But in this case, we already know that's the integral. Already know that that's the in the grand correlation is Shapley value, so we don't have to ask that. But what about what about all these numbers? So in my recent manuscript, I try to justify this in two different ways. The first one is I come up with a set of five properties or axioms, which now characterize not only this grand correlation value, but all the other values. The other values or all these things and try to argue that these axioms or properties are still just natural as the Shapeletes or other people. The second way, I present a value function, which is a certain stochastic path integral on this graph. And the definition of this is pretty natural representation. Natural representation, or I would say, a natural representation of the expected total contribution made by the player toward a certain terminal correlation S, which doesn't have to be the grand correlation. And therefore, this value can be seen as a fail allocation of that value, V of S, to the player R. And then I finally prove that this value allocation function, which is a stokest. Value allocation function, which is a stokier path integral, is actually just coincide with the component gain that Stern and Tetenhorse define. So, this is not, of course, again, this is defined by the solution to the Poisson equation. So, in other words, this VI solves the Poisson equation, Poisson equation of this form. So, I have to be. So, this is the first theorem. So, this is the first theorem. So, let me see this part. So, these five properties now characterize the solution Vi to this equation. So, of course, for every vertex or collision S. And I'm not going into the detail, but the first four property is a certain extension of the Shapelace ones. So they have the same name, expression, symmetry, linear prayer. Expicency symmetry linear prayer. But they are now somewhat strengthened because now I have to deal with all the older verses, not only this grand one, but so in particular, this nerd property is somewhat strengthened. However, their meaning is still, as far as I would say, the straightforward like Shapley's ones. And I tried quite hard, but I so these. I so these A1 to A4, right? They are extension of the Shapley, so they should determine the Shapley value that's the Vi of N at the grand quote. They will determine this guy. But as far as I can believe, they still not sufficient to characterize the Vi of S in other 4Cs. And with this A5, This A5, which is um, so I'm not so but that with A5, I verify that these five things now can determine this VI of S and every every sub-correlation. So, for more details, you may have the intuition behind this. You may have a look at my paper. Um, but this one may be written as a DJ, the partial derivative of the Vi, the player. The player i's game over S is a negative over dj V I over S union I. Maybe just simply written as this. But anyhow, so the change is sign exactly. So that's why I call it reflection. But okay, so that's the first way I sort of claim why these values. Why these values are also can be seen as a valid allocation to player I if the cooperative game ends up being in state S, not necessarily in the grand course. So as far as I have seen, most of the research in economics on this subject, cooperative games, they explicitly or implicitly assume that the coalition ends up in this grand coalition and players only And players only join up, participate. So, I mean, we saw this permutation, right? Player at each time, or each play, one player join the current coalition until they form the grand coercion, right? But here, I basically say there's nothing so special in this grand coalition, but every other coalition can be seen as the same. Can be seen as the same. So let me let me keep going why I say this way. Um can you give some intuition for your for this reflection? Yeah, that can be given once I introduce this path integral. Okay, so um yeah, I will definitely do that. So we already by Stone and Titan Horse, this is the Shapley value, and that was already in 1953, Shapley. 53 Shapley showed the path summation formula that's the finite sum over all n factorial of the increasing path, right? So my next question is, these guys for subsets, trick subs, can also admit a certain summation formula, right? So I found an answer. So let me consider markup chain on this taste space and starting at the origin and the four. Origin and the four with the following very simple and natural transition probably. So, in other words, the block of chain just moves with probability one half everywhere. And here, one third, probably with the probability one third. But the difference is I don't, you already see, you already see that I don't assume that the coalition must always increase, but I can also move backward. So, that means one player leaves the current coalition. Leaves the current coalition. So players can join or leave each time, and the probability is always the same, one over n. So in other words, Markov chain describes correlation process in which every player can join a leaf current correlation state equally likely at any time. That's what this one over n represents. Okay. And then I go on. And then I go on to define a natural contribution, the path interval. So let me do DIV at the state S. Okay, let me slow a little bit. The tau S is nothing but the first heating time, the Markov chain, visit S, right? So if this is now my S, right? This is my S, then if my path moves on like that, then I stop once I hit or once I arrive. I hit or once I arrive at this state S, right? That's the natural stopping time. And then up to that time, I integrate the partial contribution of the player I, right? And that's I define as di V of S. That's, of course, random object because I move along the Markov chain, right? And then finally, I define my value function as the expectation of that partial contribution along. Partial contribution along every possible path up to the state. So the definition basically tells us the Vi of S represents the expected total contribution made by play I leading to the state S along all possible collision paths and also allow somebody leave the current right I allow backward move. And therefore, this can be viewed as a fair allocation of the value V of S to the player I. of s to the player i the summation of vi of s will be equal to v of s by the way if i define this way but here you see the difference between uh the shapley's formula and uh this formula the shapley formula the finite sum over n factor over it does not allow a natural extension to other sub-correlations right i i i cannot easily think of uh it's it's um you know You know, its extension to other states, but this definition, of course, this is already defined for arbitrary coalition state, but not necessarily the grand coalition state, right? However, as I claimed, this value function defined by the stocket path integral is in fact the solution to this Poisson's equation and therefore uniqueness of the Poisson's solution to the Poisson equation. This is nothing. Solution to the Poisson kit, this is nothing but exactly equal to the component gain defined by Stone and Tottenhorst. And in particular, by their theorem, the Vi at the grand collision is now equal to the Shapley value. So the formulas look different, but this one naturally extends Shapley formula for now for every other state. So come back to the Ian's question. To the Ian's question, why the reflection axiom is natural? So let me let's just call, so this is the direction of the player I, let's say. You can imagine n-dimensional q, but and this is state S, let's say state T, and this is then S union I, and this is a T union I. And imagine any progress, any correlation path starting from S to T. So, like something like. T so like something like this, but you can imagine higher-dimensional cube, so it can be very complicated, but it started as and it ends up in. And then you replace, let's let me call this path as say omega. And then let's say omega bar is the inverted path, which is now exactly I flip this picture in the direction of I. So that means that the reflected path is now this guy. And then, simple observation here is: if you integrate the div the player i's partial contribution along the omega and along the omega bar, that's going to be negative, right? Because this satisfies the whole structure, right? DIV. If you flick the direction, then this guy changes the sign. And so, you know, now if you integrate over all possible paths from s to t, that's my definition. From s to t, that's my definition of the value function vi, right? And then it will also, because this happens path by path, its integration will also just exactly change the sign. And that's the motivation of the reflection axiom. So I really wanted to connect different states in a certain way. And that's the reflection property I present in A5. Um okay. Um so I know I should c finish quickly, but at the at this moment, I get the following question. What's so special to the hypercube? Why this stochastic integral solve the Poisson equation only on this graph? There's no way to that has to be, right? So what about other more general graphs? Let me just spend three minutes. So here I introduce completely general graph now. That's not no more hypercubal. Now, that's not no more hypercube one, but you have any arbitrary states, S T U blah blah, and some edges. And now, furthermore, each edge now can be weighted. So I have now weight. And so my inner product is now defined according to the weight. And but this is all still crucial. I assume that this function defined L to E has to change the sign if I move backward. Okay, but the weight is, of course, also. Okay, but the weight is, of course, just positive. Um, and I think of all the same can be defined the same way: uh, the derivative over gradient and then the adjoint, now weighted. And the Raplacian. However, I cannot think of this div thing anymore because I'm not no more on the hypercub, but arbitrary graph. So, this is now I cannot think of it. But here, the idea is: I don't have to define the partial. I don't have to define the partial correlation of the play i by di v. I don't have to define this way. So I just introduce arbitrary Fi, which is just arbitrary element in L2E. And I regard this as the player I's marginal contribution measures whenever I make a transition from certain state S to T. And then Fi of S T, I regard it as a player i's marginal contribution along this along this one step movement. And then I consider this Poisson equation. The Poisson equation where the data is an arbitrary element in the L2E, and I regard this Vi as the allocation function. And then, no surprise, this path integral and its average along this Markov chain with time-reversible transition rate. Transition rate defined by the weight given weight on the graph. I verify that this path integral to get this path integral again solves the Poisson's equation given any data f so the v and f ar lies in different spaces. V is defined on the verses, f is defined on the edges. But so this is a final remark. So this means we So, this means we can calculate the Stokes integral, which is the infinite sum, right? Because there can be infinitely many patterns from any state to the other. But now that can be calculated by just solving this linear equation and the vice versa. And the connection between the SDEs and PDEs established by many people has found many applications in diverse fields. And for example, we can think of financial mathematics as a representation. Financial mathematics as a representative example, the Black Shows-Morton equations and formulas, and so on. But now I hope that this result might initiate a similar link between Stochastic calculus and combinatorial PDEs on the graphs equipped with Hodge structure. And by the way, as far as I understand, the martingale property plays a central role in the, for example, Feynman-CAC formula and more general connection between the SDS and PDs. Between the SDS and PDs. On the other hand, when I prove this, I observed it with interest that the proof is purely combinatorial with the time reversibility of the Markup chain is now playing an important role while the martingale property is nowhere appears. Then I give a few questions. For instance, can I compute the value? Can I compute the variance of this path integral? Can I compute means? Can I come up with some equation which whose solution will represent, for example, variance? That's I would like to know. And other questions I have in mind, but and I present a certain example, which basically tells, shows why this setup is relevant with practical. Setup is relevant with practical problems, but you can take a look at this example in the paper. So, this talk is based on the this article, Stoke S Integral, blah, blah, blah. I'm afraid the title is too long that nobody will remember, but this now combines my preceding two articles, and they can be found on archive. So, thank you so much, and I appreciate your time. If you have any questions, please let me know. questions um please let me know we have time probably for one quick question otherwise the our coffee break here will be taken away um so um we have people online still uh anybody online has a question or yeah quick question is it um when you you do this sort of reversible so you allow your players to go back and forward up to the hitting time of the set x would it be possible to condition Would it be possible to condition on hitting S only allowing jumps into the set, or would that give you a very different solution? So I'm jumping. So I'm here for convenience or convergence matters, I just consider finite graphs. Just consider finite graphs. So, some of the edges. Sorry, in the case of the complete graph, so I say if lambda is positive, then I say there is an edge. If lambda is zero, then there's no edge. So, this way I can consider arbitrary graphs, but I assume it's connected. And so, you know, this is irreducible Markov chain and reversible. Reversible. So you start off with any state, let's say S here, and you just say S T, and you travel along through the Markov chain. And once you hit the T, then I stop. But the crucial fact of the Markov, this chain is, of course, this is very well known. And I found this in the book of Ross. So, I mean, this transition rate defines time reversal markup change. Time reversal markup chain. That means that if you travel along a certain loop and if you travel reverse loop, their probability of being realized is the same. And that's pretty crucial for the proof of this theorem that the path integral solves the Poisson's equation for any given.
