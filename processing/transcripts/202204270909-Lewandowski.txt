I usually give my affiliation in Polish, which sounds Universitet Varszavski Institut Physikitor Tichnei, but the reason is not that I'm so patriotic, but that it actually can be, I find it funny that I think it can be understood even in English where I am from. In my talk, I will present. I will present some results which were published in those three papers with Abbai Ashtekar, with Kara Kolanovsky, and also some results which are just about to be published with Dopkovsky Ryuko. What do we need to describe radiation? So to describe radiation, we need We need a surface through which fluxes and conserved quantities like energy and momentum are defined. We need some continuous symmetries and then for each of the symmetries there will be a conserved quantity. And we need a definition of currents and the charges. Okay, so let us start with. Okay, so let us start with the choice of surfaces. The very well-known surfaces that are used in gravity are asymptotic boundaries. This is not what I'm going to be doing in my lecture. However, let me just mention, well, let us start with the definition of asymptotic. This is actually a funny definition which I found in book by. I found in book by John Stewart. Can I interrupt you? Do you agree if we register? I beg your pardon. Are you okay if we register the session? Yes, absolutely. Okay, thank you. I'm not sure you are going to be okay, but I'm fine. I will survive. We'll do my best. So, Eta, under. Will do my best. So, Eta, did you register? Yeah, actually, I was recording since he started. Okay, this is perfect for Sergei Function. Please go ahead. Okay, it happened to me once that I was giving a talk. However, when I told a joke, then talk was interrupted. And then in the registered version, the joke was removed. The joke was removed. So, uh, so this is your risk, not mine. Okay, so here is the so I was talking about asymptotic boundaries. And well, we know that in the case of zero vanishing cosmological constant, there is asymptotic boundary is a null surface, and there is a very well-known BMS group of symmetries. And using the symmetries, we can uniquely define for momentum, and also energy, which we define in this way, is definite. It is bigger than zero, and we like this property. In the case of more physical case of the cosmological constant bigger than zero, then there is still debate about what is the proper. About what is the proper group of symmetries. However, if you do it in a rigorous way, then you find that actually all the diffeomorphisms of SCRI, which in this case is a space-like three-dimensional surface, all the diffeomorphisms are symmetries. So there is a lack of unique notion of energy or momentum. And if we define somehow those, then there is lack. Those, then there is lack of positivity. Our choice is for those surfaces, is non-expanding horizons. So non-expanding definition of non-expanding horizon was, well, I selected a nice paper because there are many, many co-authors in this. And the first one is Abai, who is, I guess, with us today. So, the first example of non-expanding horizon is a black hole horizon. Another example is a cosmological horizon. Well, both black hole and cosmological horizon are killing horizons, but it's not necessary. Non-expanding horizon is a locally defined local notion, so it is a generalized. It is a generalization of those two. So let me start with unembedded non-expanding horizon. So if for some reasons you want to consider just geometry defined on horizon and you can forget about surrounding space-time, then non-expanding horizon is a manifold. This manifold is This manifold is equipped with a symmetric tensor. We would call this symmetric tensor a metric tensor. However, it has signature zero plus plus plus plus. So it's missing. It has one degenerate direction. And it's also equipped with torsion free covariant derivative, which preserves the metric tensor. The metric tensor. Well, you could think that it's easy to define such torsion-free derivative. Well, certainly it's not anymore determined by the metric tensor Q. This is not surprising. However, what is surprising is that actually it imposes constraints on the metric Q itself. Namely, if we consider any section of this. A section of this bundle of the generic direction, meaning any null vector tangent to this surface, then this vector is a symmetry of the generic metric tensor. So that makes the surface non-expanding, because this means that both shear and expansion of this, so it's even not only non-expanding, but even it is shear-free. Shear free. So let us for a moment consider still geometry of this unembedded surface. So this geometry consists of the metric tensor and this covariant derivative. Now, if we choose any null vector, then we can use covariant derivative to define a rotation one form. Rotation one-form potential. This potential represents rotation in the sense that the exterior derivative of this one form is rotation, is invariant of the rotation. If it is zero, then the horizon is not rotating and it is not zero for rotating horizons that we know. We know L is not uniquely defined, and we can always rescue L by a function, and then this omega transforms in a quite familiar way. By using omega, we can define surface gravity by contracting this rotation one form with vector L. But another definition of surface gravity is that this is self-acceleration of L. Acceleration of L. So L has to be tangent to geodesics modular parametrization. So those paths which L defines, integral curves, can be parametrized in such a way that they are geodesic. However, L may correspond to a parameter that is not a fine, and then this kappa is not zero in such a case. We can always make kappa zero by Always make kappa zero by suitable choice of this, by using this ambiguity, this freedom. A usual assumption which we make and which I'm going to make today is about the topology that the horizon will be just r which corresponds to the null direction times some n minus one dimensional space which later will be just two-dimensional sphere. Now let us consider now embedded horizons. So, so consider space-time M and then in this if horizon is embedded in space-time, then it is a codimension one null surface. So, what is the relation between the Ricci tensor of metric tensor? Of metric tensor in M and the geometry of the horizon. One of the identities is this identity. So this is the space-time which it answer contracted with L and pulled back to this surface. On the other hand, this is the rotation one form and this is surface gravity. And you can see they are related by this constraint. So but now if we consider If we consider a Reichaduri equation, and then if we assume that this Ricci is related via Einstein equations with some T mu nu, and if we assume that this T mu nu satisfies some known positivity inequalities, some inequalities. Then we can show from each adura equation that actually this last term is zero. So we So we end up with this equation, which involves only surface gravity and rotation one form. Moreover, as I mentioned, we can make this surface gravity zero by using allowed transformations. So if we do it, then the one form omega will be Lie dragged by L, and also it will be. It will be annihilated by L. So, in fact, in this way, the geometry of this, at least this part of the geometry, can be projected to the, uniquely to a slice of the horizon, or if you want, more mathematically, to the space of null generators. And then we obtain a non-degenerate metric tensor and the projection of this rotation one form. We still have freedom. Still have freedom, so we can use this freedom to kill the divergence of omega. So, this is what we do. We are assuming that we choose this null vector L such that this rotation one form is divergence free and that the parameter of this L is a fine parameter. Here by D, I denoted the torsion-free metric connection defined by this metric on slice. Now, when I assume this condition, still the null vector is defined up to rescaling by constant. This is going to be one of symmetries of our Of our symmetry groups. So that's why I explicitly emphasize this ambiguity. Okay, so we already have a candidate for surface. This is going, surfaces will be non-expanding horizons. And so those non-expanding horizons in nature, they emerge either as They emerge either as black hole horizons or as cosmological horizons, but we will think rather about the black hole horizon. So more specifically, we will think of later about perturbed black hole horizon such that the perturbations in future infinity vanish, and in future infinity it becomes really a non-expand. Really, a non-expanding horizon. So, this will be our motivation in this part of the talk, which will be the most of the talk. Okay, so now what about the continuous symmetries? This is also important because they allow us to calculate the charges. Okay, so let us now stick to four-dimensional case. So, in four-dimensional case, our horizon. dimensional case our horizon has topology of two-dimensional sphere times times r now so in order to define symmetries we first define a universal structure of sort of background structure structure we introduce a structure which will serve as background structure well we we not really introduce it we actually Not really introduce it, we actually explain how to find it in the structure of non-expanding horizons. And then symmetries will be the symmetries of this universal structure. But what is the universal structure? Okay, so the first observation is that in four dimensions, when this two-dimensional slice is topologically a sphere, I can always. I can always rescale, I can always write my metric tensor as a metric of the round sphere times a conformal factor. Okay. Can I make sure that you are still there? Can somebody? You are there. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Okay. Okay, so this is the first element of this universal structure: this round sphere metric, which is conformally equivalent to my physical metric Q. Now the second element is in some sense put by hand. So now we just by definition, we promote L not. Promote L not defined in this way to be a part of this universal structure. Well, clearly it is uniquely defined, right? But well, it's a little put by hand because I could either not rescale at all or I could do something else. However, we want to have BMS structure, so for this reason, we So, for this reason, we do it. We do this like this. We define this universal structure like this. And now, our goal is to show that it can be consistently defined, and we can also understand what is the meaning of this, of such definition. Well, so if we look at this rotation one form omega, well, we remember that it transforms when we that it transforms when we change L. So this transformation of L leads to a new omega and then new omega satisfies certain constraint which relates the divergence of omega. So previously omega was chosen to be divergence free. But now the divergence, the scaling of The scaling of L is chosen such that divergence of omega is directly related to the Gauss curvature of this physical metric. So this is the two volume. Epsilon in my talk will always mean the volume element of a given geometry. So in this case, this is two volume physical two volume, and this is the two volume of the round sphere. So we can understand this choice as Understand this choice as fixing the divergence of omega such that it encodes information about the physical Gauss curvature of our metric. But there is still certain ambiguity. We know that identification of this Q0 is not unique. There are still, there may be still another Q0 prime. still another q0 prime which is conformally equivalent to our q0 there are not many conformal factors like this but but but there is a family of functions which which on round sphere which satisfy this and then it will be accompanied by rescaling of l and also we have to remember that there is this a0 that there is this a equal constant possibility of rescaling the possibility of rescaling out. So these are our ambiguities defined equivalence class of Q0 and L z. And the equivalence class is considered as this universal structure. Okay, so once we define the universal structure, it is clear what is symmetry. So here I repeated what I presented. What I presented before. And okay, but before going to symmetry, this A, this alpha, which I talk about, can be written explicitly. So it's given by this formula, and it is given by a constant function and three spherical harmonics, which have correspond to total angular. Correspond to total angular momentum one. And there is an extra normalization constraint on those constants. So, this is a general form of conformal factor, which is still an ambiguity in our definition. Could I ask? Hello? Yes, please. Hello, Jurek. He's Wolfdan. Could I ask a question now or? Yes, if organizers allow you. Thank you. So you said at some point that the first choice is, or the second choice is by hand, and the first choice is somewhat natural, that there is always this Q naught and any metric on on your null surface can be related conformally to Q naught. Conformally to Q naught. But then I wonder: doesn't the uniformization theorem tell us that actually there is more structure, namely Q is related to Q naught by an, yes, by an over-conformal factor, but there is also a diffeomorphism of the on the of the two sphere. So why d don't you allow for that? Allow for that? Or in other words, is there a fixing of some diffeomorphisms on the sphere that you don't allow anymore? Yes, yes. Isn't that somewhat of a problem? Because then you remove potential observables from your face space. That is the comma. Thank you. Your comment, thank you. Okay, yes, so yes, yes, there is okay. So, if I go in this direction, which in which I was presenting, this Q0 is defined uniquely up to this three-dimensional, so there's three-dimensional family of Q0s like this. But of course, if I considered a different horizon and did the same, then And did the same, then two zeros on my horizon and on that different horizon they would be related by diffeomorphism. So, so in this sense, I if I so when I say that I consider actually, you are right, maybe I should say I consider diffeomorphism class, but later I fix this Q0 and L0 only up to those transformations. So indeed I Transformation. So, indeed, I restrict the other diffeomorphisms. I agree. I don't know what are physical consequences of this, but I mean, I don't argue, but it's true that there could be still, we could still apply diffeomorphisms, and I'm going to restrict those diffeomorphisms just by fixing. So, every two universal structures have diffeomorphism. Structures are diffeomorphism equivalent. So I just fix one of them and consider only those structures which can be defined by using this one. Thank you for this remark. Okay, so all the symmetries which we will now consider are symmetries which preserve, which mimic this ambiguity. I mean, which Ambiguity, I mean, which preserve the equivalence class with respect to those transformations. And so symmetry will be any diffeomorphism, but which preserves this class. So a symmetry generator, if we now consider the infinitesimal version of this transformation, we can see that a vector field which is Can see that a vector field which is tangent to our horizon, when we calculate the lead derivative of q0, it will produce some factor which corresponds to this alpha square. On the other hand, if we calculate a derivative of L zero, it will produce a factor corresponding to one upon alpha. To one open alpha, that's y minus, and still some constant. Well, maybe that constant could be with plus sign, but it can be also written like this, which corresponds to this A. So this is a general form of, I mean, this is a general condition, which infinitesimal condition, which defines infinitesimal symmetries. K has to be constant, and phi zero, in fact, is a combination. Zero, in fact, is a combination of three spherical harmonics of angular momentum one. Now, if we consider k equal to zero, then it corresponds to BMS group. Then this is exactly the Bondi-Mazner-Sachs group of symmetries, the same as symmetries of asymptotically Of scry in asymptotically flat spacetime. But in our case, we still want to have freedom of k arbitrary. So it means that our group will be one-dimensional extension. Now, just a reminder, everybody knows this, who works with BMS Group. Works with BMS group that on one hand, we have very nice decomposition of our BMS group. So we have this. So if we choose coordinates such that L0 is dv, then we have a dilation which corresponds exactly to this symmetry defined by K. Symmetry defined by k. It can be written like this by using this affine parameter v and arbitrary k. On the other hand, we have super translations which are given by arbitrary function on a sphere independent of v times this L zero. We also have rotations, which are if we choose some parameter v. If we choose some parameter v, then this v defines a foliation and they are tangent to this foliation. And on each slice, they act as a rotation given by some function chi, but there is only three-dimensional family of those functions because they satisfy this equation. And finally, there are boosts, which are also given by some three-dimensional family of functions. So here is Lorentz trans. So here is Lorentz transformations, super translations, and dilation. But there is this ambiguity that if we change variable v, then our rotations and an important part is that our booths also have a vertical part because of our definition of symmetry. Our definition of symmetry because while rescaling the metric tensor, they also have to rescale this vector L. So, this is why they need to have. But this is exactly the same as in the case of Skry. And there is that ambiguity that if we choose a different foliation, then the new rotations will have different meaning because you can just. You can just see the difference between this and this. Clearly, they are different vectors. So, the embedding of Lorentz group is not unique. On the other hand, there are those translations here, which correspond to constant and to three first stretcher harmonics, which define an An ideal in this algebra. So, in summary, our symmetry can be decomposed in the following way, that this is dilation, super translation, rotation, and boost. And the last three set the BMS algebra, the algebra. The algebra of BMS symmetries, while the first one is this additional. But, okay, why do we want those dilations? Well, consider the example of the Kerr space-time. In case of the Kerr space-time, this is exactly the killing vector which develops the horizon. That is the dilation. And now, kappa is the surface gravity of Kerr. Surface gravity of Kerr. So, certainly, we want this vector to be part of our symmetry group. That's why we don't make any effort to get rid of it. Okay, there is some technical but important, quantitatively important extension. So, it turns out that for the charges, it is Charges, it is relevant in what way we extend our symmetries. So, actually, we introduce also some extra structure which comes from space-time, which and then the condition that extension of our symmetries preserves that structure gives the following rule. So, r equals zero is horizon. zero is horizon. So at the horizon, all those terms, those four terms vanish, and this is just our symmetry. However, necessarily this term, so here I introduce the Newman-Untig coordinates and R is this a fine parameter along incoming now geodesics. However, one of the components which vanishes to the zero. Which vanishes to the zeros order, but to the first order, it's important that this coefficient here is the same as here. But this is a technical remark which is relevant when we calculate the charges. Okay, so we can feel our form. We have non-expanding horizons and the one-dimensional extension of the BMS group. So, what about currents and charges? Okay, so to define currents, Okay, so to define currents and charges, we have this fantastic covariance symplectic formalism. One of the papers, which early papers which introduced that formalism was this one by Ashtekar Bombelli-Royla. So, in this formalism, Lagrangian is considered as a four-form. This is the volume element. So, this is the familiar Lagrangian. So this is the familiar Lagrangian with cosmological Hilbert Einstein Einstein Hilbert Lagrangian with cosmological constant. Now, if we take variation of this Lagrangian, then we obtain the Einstein equations plus some divergence or in this notation, exact part. It is exterior derivative of certain tree form, which depends on variations of metric tensor. And then this tree form is promoted. And then this tree form is promoted to some symplectic potential. It is not uniquely defined. I will turn to this at the next slide. But this form which I wrote here can be made unique if we assume that this potential contains the it contains the lowest possible derivatives of of g then then probably this is this this is this is a unique a unique symplectic potential from this potential we calculate symplectic current which is also a tree form in space-time and is obtained by by taking anti-commutator of second variations here i'm assuming that second the variations commute if they don't commute there is some obvious extra term what is the advantage of What is the advantage of symplectic current? This is a tree form in space-time. This treeform is built from metric tensor and two that satisfies Einstein equations and from two solutions of linearized Einstein equations. This tree form is closed in the sense that the exterior derivative is zero. So, from this tree form, we can clearly try to calculate some conserved quantities. And in the easy case, Quantities and in the easy case, if sigma is a Cauchy surface and we integrate that tree form, but now for one of the variations, if we take the lead derivative with respect to some vector field and a second variation is free, then after integration along a Cauchy surface. Along a Cauchy surface, it becomes a variation of some functional, and we call this functional Hamilton. But this is an easy case. However, if we consider a case with boundary, and this is our case, because horizon or any surface across which we want to calculate this radiation is actually a boundary, then we need more sophisticated. More sophisticated formula. So then we follow, okay. So suppose that sigma here is not anymore a Cauchy surface, but it's just a null surface. So it may be made a part of Cauchy surface, but it's a null boundary of space-time. Then there is a nice formalism by Walt Zupas and Chandra Sakaram, Flamagan Prambu, which Which I just outlined: that what we do is given this symplectic current, we consider just the pullback of the current of a given surface. This is the surface sigma here. And for this pullback, we find a pullback, preferred fullback, pullback of Of symplectic potential by using this Laud transformation, which doesn't change the symplectic current. And we impose some conditions on the potential we want to find. So one of the conditions is that this potential is independent, symplectic potential is independent of the background structure on sigma. So if sigma is a null surface, we can, again, this is something which I don't. Again, this is something which I don't discuss here in detail, but we can again define what is this background structure, a little similar to what I did for non-expanding horizon. And the second condition is that the symplectic potential vanishes for stationary solution to Einstein equations. And then it turns out, this is what was found in this paper. What was found in this paper that the correct term, this allowed term that we add, has this form where theta is the expansion of null vector, which we choose. And this expression here is independent of the choice of this null vector. So, given a null surface and null vector, there is a well-defined volume element like this, which is independent. Like this, which is independent of the choice of this L. So now what we do is we observe, if we go back to the previous transparency, that when we integrate this corresponding symplectic current, and if this symplectic current, we use this formula and we And we use the fact that one of variations is this dx, then we can see that one of those terms, this one, it becomes just the derivative of this symplectic current itself. That is, it is just the exterior derivative of x contracted. So then we So then we split it, we just integrated, and then this term accounts to the charges which are assigned to the two-dimensional slices at the beginning and at the end of this surface. So the result is that the flux along this segment is defined just by the symplectic potential. Potential while the charges that we alloted to the ends, they ensure that this balance is satisfied. So the integral of flux equals the difference of the corresponding charges. So what are the corresponding charges? So the flux is already written here explicitly. And what are the corresponding charges? There is also explicit formula for those charges. So, this charge is the nether charge corresponding to this vector field x minus this term. And the nether charge itself, well, it's well known for gravity, it has this form. So, these are the So, these are the charges which we obtain. Each charge is defined for a slice. And this is the flux, which gives the balance law. Okay, so in this way we accomplished the second point, which was the definition of charges and fluxes. Charges and fluxes. Now we have to combine everything together. However, now important extension. So we are not going to consider just a non-expanding horizon because that would be a little boring. Of course, we can use this formalism to define charges which just don't evolve or are just constant. But what we would like to use this formalism for is the following. So we consider Following. So we consider a space-time that admits a non-expanding horizon and the perturbation of the space-time. So lambda is the parameter of perturbation. And we allow only perturbations such that the surface, I call it sigma, because it's perturbed horizon, that all perturbations preserve the fact that the sigma is null and to the zeros order. And to the zeros order, sigma is a non-expanding horizon. Moreover, we are assuming that in future this every perturbation vanishes, in particular, the perturbation of expansion goes to zero. But now, if we take a look at the Reich Aduri equation, this is this, we can see that if this is zero and Is zero and we can see that to the first order the variation of expansion is constant. So if we want it to be zero in future, it has to be zero along all the horizon. That's why our expansion also vanishes to the first order. This is the consequence of this assumption. And however, still for the symmetries, we can use the background structure. So we can use this zeros order space-time and the symmetries of the non-expanding horizon. And so we can combine the general formula for a general null surface with x's which are now a symmetry. Which are now symmetries of background of the zeroth-order horizon. However, for metric tensor, we can take the perturbed metric tensor. Well, and so so even we even specifically introduce some specific coordinates and our our metric takes the following form in those coordinates. Form in those coordinates. How much time do I have? Well, you are in minus to question in the middle. Let's say five minutes. Okay. So we introduce coordinates and in those coordinates this null surface corresponds to r equals zero and this beta is related to this rotation one form. To this rotation one form to zero's order, our charge corresponding to dilation is as expected: this surface gravity times area, and the charge corresponding to super translation is just zero. We have some charges which correspond to rotation and boost, and we can check on cur that everything is. Everything behaves as it should behave. To the first order, of course, our flux to the first order is just zero. And our flux is also zero to the, I mean, to the zeroth order. Our flux is zero, but it's also zero to the first order. We are not surprised because it is quite. Not surprised because it is quite a usual property of perturbations of space-times that are stationary in some sense. That to the first order, the variation of energy is also, the flux is zero. And finally, we calculate to the second order, and most importantly, we calculate this flux of Of corresponding to dilation and supertranslation. And now you can see it's positive definite. Well, this minus sign here, but this is also minus one. I mean, this is minus one or is negative. Not necessarily one, this is v, but it is positive, it's negative. So together it gives positive. So it's just sigma squared as expected. And here are the expected and here are the corresponding yeah and here are the the corresponding fluxes and and there are also available fluxes for for angular momentum and for this quantity corresponding to to boost so in this way we um we calculated those charges and and fluxes of perturbation across across a black horizon A black horizon that in future maybe becomes a black hole horizon. Just so now I only very shortly mention that we can also consider a different scenario. So we can consider again a cosmological horizon, but now I'm making departure from the previous definition. So we consider cosmological horizon in the Citer space-time. So if it is in the Citer space-time, then the Sitter space-time has this background structure. Has this background structure which we can use so we have symmetries of the sitter space-time. So now we have a different symmetry group, so just the sitter symmetry isometries. And we can, again, using this symmetry group, we can calculate the so here is our part of the citadel space-time, and this is horizon, and there is some source, some Source, some matter source of gravitational radiation. And we can calculate instead of going to scry, as usually we can calculate radiation across the horizon. So when we do it, we obtain the formula such that, so H is the Hubble parameter, so it is very small. And if we expand in H, then In H, then the zeroth-order term looks like the famous quadruple formula, which we can find in Walt's book. And we also can calculate the first correction proportional to H. So we can have a generalization of quadruple formula. But I have to say that in the paper, that here we take advantage of this. That here we take advantage of this paper by Abbai, Bonga, and Cassavan. And actually, they calculated the quadruple formula by going to the horizon, to the scry. So they calculated by using scry, and we calculated by using horizon. Okay, so this is it. So This is it. So to summarize, we have studied, we studied a non-expanding horizon structure and then we I would say that we found a meaning for BMS symmetries. So by introducing properly some basic Some basic, some universal structure of this horizon, we discovered that BMS symmetries are the symmetries of this structure. This is a one-dimensional extension of the proper BMS group. Well, we calculated corresponding charges and fluxes. And fluxes, and we obtain positive definite flux for the second order for radiation in the second order. Well, it can be applied to the case when we have binary black holes coalescence and when common horizon has been formed, and when it approximately becomes our perturbed non-expanding horizon. Non-expanding horizon. So then our fluxes describe absorbed energy and momentum. And there is also another case which we can consider. This is gravitational radiation.
