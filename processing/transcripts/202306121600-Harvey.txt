I'm sad that I'm not in Oaxaca. I wanted to go, in fact, in 2017, but I suddenly found myself buying a house and had to miss out on that. So hopefully someday I'll be able to visit. But I do have my little dog here and she keeps me company. So, all right. So, I don't know. Jennifer asked me. I don't know. Jennifer asked me to give sort of an overview talk of something. And I, you know, obviously I'm very interested in concordance. And recently I've been more interested in link concordance. And I don't think as many people know as much about that. So I'm just going to give some sort of overview of stuff that's known, how to construct knots and links that are sliced, et cetera. And I'm probably forgetting a lot of people's work. This is not at all. People's work. This is not at all like an all-encompassing work by Richards. In particular, Ken Baker, Marty Charlovin, are the audience, and they've made a lot of contributions to this area as well. And I don't remember who else is at the conference in person. I can't tell, but I apologize if I don't mention some of the factors. So we're going to be considering knots and links. They're going to be in S3 primarily, and all of our And all of our months and lengths will be smooth oriented. We're not going to write orientations, and the lengths will be ordered. So this is a three-dimensional conference. So there are some three-dimensional things and some four-dimensional things, and there are lots of knots. So I want to consider, instead of isotopy of links or knots in S3, I want to consider a four-dimensional equivalence ration called concordance. Called concordance, which some of you might know. And the reason that concordance is important because it tells you a lot more information about the structure of topological and smooth four-dimensional manifolds, both compact and closed. And I won't go much into the details there because of time. So, first, I'm just going to start off with some basic definitions. So, we're all on the same page. We want to consider two links with each going to be. links with each going to be m components and ordered l1 through mlm that we say that l is smoothly or topologically concordant to l prime if there exists a disjoint smoothly or topologically locally flat oh i have a mistake here sorry um there should not be a smoothly here smoothly or topologically locally flat embedded annuli a1 through am A1 through AM that start at Li and end at Li prime. So in this picture here, this is what, I don't know, a lot of people call a cartoon picture. And so in the cartoon picture, we have L up top at time zero and S3 cross I, we have the middle of the annuli that are, they're not straight, they can be very messy, they just don't have any genus. They just don't have any genus. And at the bottom, we have L prime. And here, L prime, here I have the negative L, and that's always going to mean the reverse of the mirror image. And if you want, just ignore orientation. Okay, so one example of a link that we'd like to know is whether or not you given a link, is it slice? It slice so it can our link is it the same in the equivalence class as the m component on link? So we call this slice and an equivalent definition of this is that the link will bound disjointly embedded diss mb4. Okay, so in a lot of these places I'm going to be saying smooth top saying you know there might be slight different things in those conditions. Things in those conditions. And if I don't say smooth top or something in green, it means that it holds for both smooth and topological. Okay, so if you're not familiar with topological concordance and topological sliceness, it's the one that's like really hard to understand. Most of it comes from Friedman's work in the 80s on pushing surgery into four dimensions. Pushing surgery into four dimensions. And a lot of that's still unknown. I mean, it's still unknown for a lot of four manifolds. And basically, the idea is like I always tell students is if you're trying to prove something slice and you have some sort of geometric argument that doesn't involve limits or Friedman's work, it's smooth. Even if you have corners, you can smooth everything. Everything is nice. So smooth is the really nice world. So, smooth is the really nice world. Topological is kind of the strange world that happens in four dimensions. I mean, smooth is also weird in four dimensions as well. You know, for example, we have exotic R4s, ones that are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to R4, and that only happens in dimension four. All right, so this is our cartoon here being slice, and this is one of the properties we're going to talk about mostly. We're not going to talk about concordance in general. So, being So being topologically size is okay. Well, you have these little disks, and they're in B4 and they don't hit each other and they're nice. They're either locally flat or smooth. So here's a couple of examples. Probably many of you have already seen these. The first I'm going to show you is called the Stevedor knot. So this found something called a ribbon disc. Well, what it is, it's this. So here's the knot itself. So here's the knot itself, drawing it in white. And then I've drawn the knot over here, but now I've filled it in with a disc. This disc here is in S3. So this is a three-dimensional condition of having these ribbon discs. And well, what is it? It's nothing more than an immersed disc, and it has some singularities here, which are in blue. And in our cartoon picture over here, And in our cartoon picture over here, we see that we've drawn this sort of singular like that. And so, what we can do around each of these singularities is you can just pick a little disc, I guess I draw it in pink, around the singularity. And now that disc is in R3 or S3, we can just slowly push it into R4. Into our four in a nice way. We just push it down, and then we see that we don't have any intersections, but now our disk isn't living in S3, it's living in R4 plus or B4. And so, you know, so this becomes very different than a knot bounding to disk in S3. And that's, you know, we only know one knot that can bound a disk in, or know that there's only one knot that can bound a disk in S3 by definition. Three by definition. But if we allow ourselves to just move a little bit into the fourth dimension, then you can get lots of interesting knots that are slice. They bound some kind of disk like I showed you here in B4. So this is four dimensions. All right. So that's an example of a slice disk, and it's actually called a ribbon disk. And in fact, And in fact, so that's a knot. And I said I'm talking about links. So, well, not is a link, but you can get a link by just taking, for example, you can take N parallel copies of some slice knot or ribbon knot. And so I've drawn a picture here of where I took the stevedor and I took a push off of the stevedor in the cipher direction, so in the zero frame direction. Zero frame direction. And we knew that the K originally bounded some cartoon disc here. And so we'll just get in the cartoon picture two copies of the disc. Okay, so those are some examples. So I mentioned before that the link is called ribbon if it bounds m disjointly immersed disk with only these ribbon singularities. And what we proved before was that a ribbon link is actually smoothly sliced. Smoothly slice. And you know, there are, you have to work out the smoothing the corners, but that's fine. Okay. And it turns out that a smooth, I guess I didn't say this, but if a link is smoothly sliced, it bounds smooth disk inside of B4, and then it obviously bounds a locally flat topologically disk. So smoothly slice always implies topologically slice, but very Topologically slice, but very much not the opposite. And we'll see some examples. Yeah, so I mean, one of the big questions in topological, in sort of low-dimensional topology is what are the class of knots that are sort of topologically sliced up to smooth concordance? And that's a very interesting group, but I'm not going to spend much time on that. Okay, so we can also So, we can also view. So, in this picture here, a ribbon disc is something that exists in three dimensions. So, it's something that we should really have a good handle on because we understand three dimensions a lot better, although we do have this immersion, so things become more complicated. This also becomes a four-dimensional equivalent condition. And well, we saw that what we could do was if we had this ribbon disk. If we had this ribbon disc, we can get rid of the singularities by sort of pushing some stuff into our four. And so we're basically gaining some minima, and I guess a saddle maybe, or I don't know, I guess a minima we're creating. And but we notice that we don't have any maxima. There's no, we're not going like down and up, just going down. And so it turns out that an equivalent condition for a link to be a ribbon is if it bounds disjointly embedded disks. District and the embedded disks in B4 with no maxima. And what do I mean by maxima? Well, there's a height function on B4, which is the radial height function. And with respect to that function, it has no maxima. So this is, you know, this is like the cartoon picture of not ribbon. And this is ribbon, although this looks like a lot of max, but I'm drawing in the wrong dimension. Okay, so. Okay, so what are some properties? I mean, so ribbon discs are special examples of things that give you slice knots, and they have a nice property that if you have a ribbon disc, you can look at the exterior of the ribbon disc, and then you can look at the inclusion map from the boundary, the three-manifold into the four-manifold exteriors, and we see that that map. Exteriors, and we see that that map is surjective. And the reason is basically because you can make a relative handle-body decomposition where you're just adding two handles and three handles, and so it has to only kill pi one. I mean, this is this is, you know, there's work to show in all this, but they're not too hard. So that's in the smooth world. You know, if we're looking at handle bodies in the smooth world, that we can do that. But then in the topological world, In the topological world, we would like to have some sort of nession of ribbon. And it turns out, so what we can do is we can say a link is homotopy ribbon if you don't necessarily have this handle body structure, but you do get a surjective map on pi one. So a link is going to be homotopy ribbon if it's topologically sliced. And if you look at the map from the exterior of the link to the map on pi one of the exterior of the locally flat disk. The locally flat disk, you see that that map is surjective, and so we'll call that homotopy ribbon. You should sort of think of it as topologically ribbon in the topological world. So basically up to this point, we've looked at basically four different definitions. In the smooth world, we had knots that were smoothly sliced. We saw some examples. We have knots and links that are ribbons. Links that are knots and links that are ribbon. And we showed that this direction is true. If a link is ribbon, you'll get the ribbon disk. You can push it into as a slice disk, and we know it's a slice disk. So we just have more information. And then the other way is a very, very hard problem that many, many people have worked on over the years and are still working on. Still working on. And this is called the slice-ribbon conjecture. And in its most common way that it's stated, is a not a slice if and only if it's ribbon. And I don't know why my sorry, my iPad seems to have video on, and so I'm seeing the top of my head. It's very disturbing. All right. All right. In the topological world, there's a slice-ribbon conjecture that is also still unknown for knots or links of any sort, and that is if L is topologically slice, is it homotopy ribbon? Right? And homotopy ribbon implies topologically slice by the definition. And so, you know, a lot of people are interested in answering these questions, mostly because we like hard stuff. This seems pretty hard. This seems pretty hard. But also, there's relationships, you know, of the sort of ribbon and smooth slice to four-manifolds. That's another reason to be studying concordance in general. So, all right, so these are open. Some questions that you might ask yourself. So, we noticed that this, you know, this would be a really good theorem here. Theorem here. Why? Because it's really hard to tell if a knot or a link is smoothly sliced. It's, in theory, easier to determine if a link is ribbon. It's a three-dimensional condition, so you might ask, is there a 3D vert, sorry, is there an algorithm to detect if a knot is ribbon? And so you might say, oh, maybe you could use normal surface theory or some types of three-dimensional. You know, three-dimensional things. I don't know how to do that, but it would be cool. Another question is: in the topological world, things are kind of weird. They're not smooth. And all these examples comes from this disk embedding theorem, which talks about all these limits of things. Is there a three-dimensional version of homotopy ribbon? Is there some sort of thing you can talk about, surfaces or immersed, or things like that? Or Merstis or things like that. Now, I, yeah, I mean, I have no idea about that. I just wrote it down because I don't know. So, all right. So, yeah, so basically I kind of want to talk about examples of things that are open, some things that are related to slice ribbon, and just interesting things about non-link concordance. So, here's another example. Here's another example. If you don't like the example, we start with the ribbon disc and you sort of push it down. You can do a movie example of how to show that knots are slice. So for example, here's the 946 knot. Okay, and so we can think about that as on S3, we're sort of time zero going in radially towards the origin. And you start taking this guy over here, and you maybe push. Here, and you maybe push them together a little bit. And so, that's just an isotopy from time zero to time one-tenth. And so, what you have down here is some, you know, you have this is time zero, this wiggles around to time one half, and then we start, we keep isotoping here until we get to this point at t equals one-fifth, where now the knot is hitting itself. We no longer have an embedded. Itself, we no longer have an embedded circle, we have some sort of embedded graph. So we can take that guy and look at what topologically this is in the cartoon picture, right? And it's just this figure eight, and that's at that saddle point. Well, then we can smooth in the other direction. And what happens is this one component guy ends up being a two-component guy. And if you look at what this link is, it's just And if you look at what this link is, it's just the unlink. We can unravel it isotopy, and so we can bound it by two standard disks in S3, even. And so we'll put these down here. And so that will create topologically a disk, and this will be smoothly embedded. All the corners can be rounded. Okay, so a lot of people like to, you know, slice things that way. You do have to be very careful, and you certainly can't do. Have to be very careful, and you certainly can't do this in all cases. There may not be a place to start, okay? So, you know, let's go back like, I don't know, I want to say like 40 years ago, but it's not 2020. I mean, it's not 2000 anymore. So, I guess in the 60s or 50s, that's a very long time ago now. I guess it's classical because it's before I got my PhD. So, I think. So I think it's probably classical for most people here. Okay, so if we start with a knot, then like one of the first things you might learn about a knot is that a knot in S3 bounds a smoothly embedded or a two-sided surface called a ciphro surface. Right? And so here's not a cartoon picture, a real picture of, I guess that's the trefoil. I guess that's the trefoil, and it's one of its ciphered services. They're certainly not unique. And so this is in S3. What we can do is then find a basis of H1 of the ciphered surface. So this alpha 1 and alpha 2. So this is a basis for H1 of this surface. You can find a symplectic basis. This is a symplectic basis. They intersect once. And then once you choose this basis, you can look at the linking numbers of push-offs, right? So we can push alpha 2 up or down and get linking numbers 0 and 1 between alpha 1. And then this is like alpha 1, alpha 1 plus linking number. And so I think most people know. I think most people know this. So, this is very easy to compute. And then, once you have the ciphered surface, you get the ciphered matrix. And then you can get lots of obstructions to a not being slice. And these are very classical. So, the first ones, I don't know, I don't know what was first, like signatures or ARF invariant, but one of those. That if you take you take any. You take you take any. I'm going to talk about some more sort of generalized signatures. So, if you take any complex number that has norm one, and then you look at this permission matrix where you take the ciphered matrix V, and then you look at V transpose, and you scalar multiply by one minus omega and one minus omega bar. You get that that's now a Hermitian matrix, and so it has real eigenvalues. has real eigenvalues and so we can define the signature of k the omega signature of k is to to be the number of positive eigenvalues of w minus the number of negative eigenvalues and then it's it's you know any sort of standard not theory book you show that if k is slice then these signatures all have to be zero and there's a condition really we don't want omega to be a root Really, we don't want omega to be a root of the Alexander polynomial. There's only going to be a finite number of points where this is not defined. So it's defined on like a torus. Oh, sorry, this is for a knot, I guess. Anyway, for a knot, this is defined on the circle and it's defined everywhere except for a finite number of points, or it might change. Okay, and remember that the Alexander polynomial, which we'll use a little bit, is Polynomial, which we'll use a little bit, is just the determinants of V minus T V transpose, where V is the cipher matrix again. And if K is slice, then the Alexander polynomial splits as F of T times F of T inverse. That's called the Fox-Milner condition. And notice that the Alexander polynomial itself is not an invariant of slice-ness. It's, you know, it doesn't have to be the same as a slice knot. A slice knot can have, you know. A sliced knot can have, you know, almost, I mean, not any Alexander polynomial, but a lot of them, but they have to be of this form. Okay, so that's that's from a long time ago. And more generally, for knots, Levine studied the sort of the equivalence class of ciphered matrices for a knot. And then he defined a surjective homomorphism. Surjective homomorphism from the abelian group that's the concordance groups of knots modulo concordance classes of knots under a connected sum. And then on the right here is going to be a group of matrices. You should sort of think of them as a vid group, but now the ring is a little bit more complicated. So it's basically an equivalence class. So it's basically an equivalence class of matrices where the zero element looks like this. Okay. And it's well understood. Stoltzfuss sort of made this identification a little bit stronger. But essentially, this sort of algebraic group of matrices is isomorphic to Z infinity, Z mod 2 to infinity, and Z mod 4 to infinity. To infinity and z14 to infinity, and this uses number theory. Some of these use like the Hasse invariant and stuff like this. But you know, it's a little bit complicated to understand the actual algebraic concordance class in terms of these invariants, but it can be done. So, essentially, what this tells us is that we completely kind of understand things that aren't in the kernel. And so, if we really want to understand knots that are sliced, knots that are sliced we want to know what are the elements in here that are trivial and so in particular they have to be trivial over here I guess these are abelian groups um okay and so being trivial is saying you're in the kernel of this map right and so everything in the kernel of here is a matrix which is a 2g by 2g matrix and it has a half block of zeros so block of zeros. So this zero is g by g and that's for some, you know, it has the ciphered form has this form saying for some basis of h1 that we can get this form, not all of them. Okay, so when that's called, you know, such a knot's going to be called algebraically slice. And so these are the lots we, you know, links we really want to restrict to because we don't, you know, these are the things we don't understand. Okay. So. Okay, so what do we know about something being algebraically sliced? Well, there exists, so if we have algebraically slice, we have this sum and like a half sum and of vectors in H1 of the surface. Okay, vectors, you know, I'm pretend that it's not over Z or something. Anyway, so a half-dimensional basis. Anyway, so a half-dimensional basis in the Sabelian group, which realizes the zero. Ah, okay, sorry, that's my wife. Uh-oh. All right. So, yeah. So there's this sort of algebraic thing called a metabolizer, which is a basis for H1 of the surface that gives you this zero by zero sum end. And we can realize this. And we can realize this by some actual curves on the surface. And so we're going to look for some actual curves on the Seifert surface D1 through DG that are going to be called a derivative. So what do these things need to have? Well, they need to have self-linking zero, namely, they're zero framed on the surface, and they're going to have linking numbers. And they're going to have linking number zero between them. So if you have genus one, it's really easy. You just want to find one self-linking zero curve. So, for example, okay, here's a really easy example. What does this mean? So this boundary here is the knot, right? It bounds this ciphered surface. And here I wanted to make the examples like slightly more complicated. So, you know, you can ignore these J1 and J2. Ignore these J1 and J2, you just get the unknowns. It's kind of a dumb example. But you know, if you take this guy and you look at the curves going through here, so you have this little disc. And the curves going to the disk, you can just tie them into the knot J1 and you make sure that the two copies have linking number zero together. And you can do the same for J2. And so this guy here, D1, that's a derivative. That's a derivative. And here's another derivative. And those correspond to different, you know, metabolizers or different zero sum ends. But in fact, there's, you know, generally, if you have genus two or more, there's going to be like an infinite number of derivatives, maybe. So it's kind of hard to understand them all, but at least for genus one, it's not too bad. Genus one, it's not too bad. They can have at most two derivatives per cipher surface, and so Levine's observation is that if, I mean, okay, I guess I've been told this is Levine's observation, but he's not around to defend himself if people object. So, if k is an algebraically sliced knot, so it has these derivatives. Not so it has these derivatives. If the derivatives you find is actually a slice link, so you have a knot, maybe it has genus G, and you're going to find a derivative of curves. It's going to be a link with G components. And if those links are slice or ribbon, then what you can do is you can see that K itself was slice. And if you have such a ciphered surface with a slice derivative, Surface with this slice derivative. It's called the Levine Seifert surface. So, what's the proof of that? Well, you just do surgery. So, we're going to start off with this cartoon picture here. Well, it's not cartoon, it's just J1 and J2 or some knots we tied in. And here's our derivative: this green guy. And then what we can do is we can cut out a neighborhood of D. So now this is all cut out. This is all cut out, and now we have a surface with three boundary components. The outside is the knot, still, we haven't changed that at all. And then we have these two interior copies of the derivative. Well, each of these derivatives bounds by assumption, it's a slice link, or in this case, it's a slice not. If you take two parallel copies, it's still going to be a slice link, right? And what you just do. Link right, and what you just do is you glue one copy of the slice disk for D to this guy, and then another copy to that, and they're not going to hit each other, right? They're going to be parallel copies of one another. And so that's going to form an actual disk since now we've changed this genus one surface into a genus zero surface. Okay, so that's that's a sort of an observation that is actually really interesting. Really interesting. And then the question is: the sort of big question that we have no idea about is: can we go backwards? Right. If you have a slice not let's, you know, here I'm just writing slice. Really, I really mean smoothly slice because the white had double. So okay. If K is smoothly sliced. If k is smoothly sliced, can you find a ciphered surface and a derivative on that ciphered surface for which the derivative is a slice link. So, and that seems pretty hard to understand. So, one case where we do know very, we understand. Very, we understand the derivatives very well is a ribbon knot. And if you have a ribbon disk, then I'll show on the next page that you can always find a derivative that is actually an unlink. So it's stronger than being slice, it's actual unlink. Okay, so that was just his comment here, and I'll show you a picture on the other page. So Interestingly, this sort of point of view leads to the following equivalent condition to prove the ribbon slice conjecture. So in other words, the ribbon slice conjecture is equivalent to the following. If this is always true, so suppose you have a smoothly sliced knot. And you can show, and you can pick a cipher surface and show that it stabilizes to a surface whose derivative is an unlink, then it shows it's ribbon. Or equivalently, if you have a smoothly sliced knot and if you can ever find a surface where the derivative is the unlink, then you know you're actually ribbon. So that's kind of a way of viewing. A way of viewing sort of Levine's language on this sort of slice rhythm. You know, what kind of derivatives can you have as on the cipher surfaces of smoothly sliced things? Okay, so here is the picture of, okay, it's not a very good picture, but what I'm showing here is that if you take a ribbon disc, then this K here is ribbon, right? And it bounds this ribbon disc, which is this guy. And then, instead of sort of pushing things in the foreball to get rid of these singularities, what I want to do is smooth the singularities. And I try to draw a picture, it's really bad. So I probably should have copied someone's picture. And so, what I'm doing here is I'm going to take each of these singularities and then I want to. And then I want to connect this top guy with this back part and this guy with this front part. And so this was supposed to be this picture of, you know, the curve that went like that will go like that now. So it will be on the surface instead of sort of going from one part to the other. So when you do that, you're going to get a ciphered surface, and that ciphered surface And that ciphered surface is going to have genus the same as the number of the number of singularities, the ribbon intersections that we have. So, and what we can see is that whenever you have a ciphered surface of this form, that this orange curve here is always an unknot. And then we'll have a bunch of other unknots that are really local. Unknots that are really local and so they don't even hit each other and so we always find a derivative that's an unlink. So that is the proof of why you can always find an unlink instead of maybe just a slice link if you have a ribbon. Okay, so the question is sort of like, can you do this for slice after stabilizing or can you find such? Or can you find such? Okay, so now this sort of leads us into some questions that are related to sort of Libby's point of view. And so this was asked by Kaufman. I don't know, it's in the Kirby problem list. I did not have time to look up all the dates. But so he asks, if K is a smoothly sliced knot. K is a smoothly sliced knot and it has ciphered genus one, so it bounds a ciphered surface of genus one, then the ciphered surface has a derivative with arf invariant of d equals zero. Oh yes, so and and Cochrane and Davis disproved this I think in 2015. So what they did is they gave examples of smoothly sliced knots with whose With whose has a unique minimal genus one ciphered surface. I didn't write unique where all the derivatives have non-zero arf invariant. And so, yeah, but really, this is just saying, this is not really a counterexample to Levine's point of view, because really what we're saying is what, you know, in fact, in In fact, in their particular examples, they do actually stabilize to a ciphered surface with a derivative that's a slice link and maybe ribbon as well in these specific examples. So, part of, you know, part of this talk is like how do you construct, how do you show things or slice. I'm not working so much in the how do you show things. Working so much in the how do you show things aren't slice or not ribbon because that's like a whole nother bag of worms. Wait, I don't know what is the saying. The bag of worms, it seems like a weird saying. So yeah, so how do they construct these? So here's, you know, here's an example of how you construct. You start with some, start with some knot K that's smoothly sliced. So in our cartoon picture here, we have K. And now we want to change it to get another slice knot that maybe has different properties. And so, what we can do is we want to find two unknots, or we want to find an unlink eta one and eta two in the complement of k, such that if you look at the complement of the sliced disk, that this eta one and eta two co-bound a smoothly embedded annulus. Smoothly embedded anulus. So, this is the cartoon picture. So, this is in B4. You have the disc here. Outside of the disc, these eta one and eta two, they band at annulus. And then what you can do is you can just glue in, so you can take the neighborhood, take, you know, remove the neighborhood of the annulus, and you're going to get some. And you're going to get some boundary. That's in the interior part, not on the sort of. And then, anyway, you're going to glue the complement of a knot J, any J, to this exterior. And you have to do it in a precise way. And essentially, what it's doing on the boundary on the inside, it's giving you some new before and a new disk in before. In before, and it's giving you, um, you know, on the boundary, it's going to be basically satellite constructions where you're tying in sort of j to the eta one part and you're tying in negative j to the eta two part. So these were their examples and still kind of a cool way of getting interesting examples of smoothly sliced knots. Okay, uh so mostly I've talked about things that have to do with knots. That have to do with knots. But what about links? So links become quite difficult. You know, first you might say, well, if your link is slice, it balances surfaces that don't intersect. So obviously you're going to have all the linking numbers are going to be zero. Is there anything else you can say? Well, it will turn out that there's a bunch of higher order linking numbers called Miller's invariants that will also be zero. Be zero. But even if you assume that, it's quite difficult to even get started with links unless you're something called a boundary link. So, I mean, if you have a link, you have M component link, let's say, you can find, you know, a surface that they all bound, but it really doesn't give you very much information about the link. It's sort of giving you information about banding the link into a knot. Banding the link into a knot in some sense. So we want to start by just fixing a class of nice links. And these are links where we're going to have a ciphered form. Okay, so that's going to be called a boundary link. So what is a boundary link? Well, it's very geometric. A boundary link is, a link is about, I just drew the two case because I got tired of writing. Anyway, so a link is a boundary link. Anyway, so a link is a boundary link if each component bounds disjointly, disjointly embedded surfaces. So all the components bound disjointly embedded surfaces in S3. So this is a three-dimensional condition. And so an example is this guy, right? So we're going to have this L1 component bounds this guy and the L2 component bounds this surface. And this is just the white. And this is just the whitehead link, one of the whitehead links of the hoplink. So this is actually known not to be not slice, but anyway, so once we have a boundary link, we have ciphered surface, we can get a ciphered form. Now, the ciphered form is a little bit more complicated because it's no longer, it's the ciphered form on a direct sum of the On a direct sum of the H1 of the ciphered surfaces, so it has some sort of splitting, and we need to respect that. But once we, oh my gosh. Sorry, I guess my wife does not realize I'm going to talk. Okay, so once we have that, you can ask whether or not there's sort of a generalized Kauffman conjecture. Now, this is still open. open. So here's the conjecture if you have a boundary link or you could have this is unknown for knots as well. So for a knot maybe you'd have a genus one ciphered surface that's minimal maybe. If you have a boundary link with disjoint ciphered surfaces all of genus one it's just to make this conjecture a little bit easier to state. And L is algebraically sliced. Oh, did I say what that meant? Oh, did I say what that meant? Oh, no, I didn't. I got these pages mixed up. Okay. Algebraically slice is going to say that the surface, the ciphered form has, the ciphered form, my pencil ran out. The ciphered form now has a half block of zeros in. Zeros in sort of every quadrant or something. So, anyway, in the two by two case, we have two surfaces, and we have a ciphered surface for one, we have a ciphered surface for the other, and we have linking numbers between them. And so being algebraically sliced is really strongly algebraically sliced. It says that you have this half block of zeros for the whole matrix that restricts to half block of zeros. That restricts to half block of zeros on all these submatrices. Or, in other words, you have a metabolizer for the entire surface that restricts to metabolizers for the individual knots. Okay, so that's called algebraically slice. And so, if you have, okay, so the question is: suppose you have a boundary link and you have all these genus 1 surfaces. You have all these genus one surfaces, and you assume that it's algebraically sliced, so it has these half you have these derivatives that represent these zero sum n's. Then you can find, then any derivative, no, that's not the conjecture, the conjecture with there exists some derivative with Miller and zero, then there exists, sorry. Then there exists a derivative where the Milner's invariant is not zero. Or I guess Kaufman's conjecture was that for any derivative on the ciphered surface, that the Milner's invariant is zero. So I guess the original, I need to put then For all derivatives. So we have it zero. Okay, and there originally was a potential proof of this, but then there was a mistake found by one of my former graduate students, Jung-wong Park, who's at KAIST right now. And so what is this mu bar 123? Well, it's one of the Millerson variants. They have to vanish for slice links. And so this is sort of And so it's this is sort of like the basis case, basic case of the generalized Kaufman conjecture. But yeah, this is kind of, it's not too hard to, you know, compute these sort of Miller's invariants and stuff. It's sort of, you know, trying to construct such slice boundary links. Oh, um, I slice That is a very important thing to add there. If it's sliced, then you can have some derivatives that are zero. And this is probably not true. I'm guessing. I mean, it would be crazy for it to be true. Okay, so maybe an equally difficult, I don't know, question, maybe not. Suppose you have. Suppose you have a link, and of course, now you have to have a boundary link in order to even talk about the ciphered form. If a boundary link is slice, is it actually algebraically slice? Does it have a ciphered matrix of this form where you have these half blocks of zeros that are compatible? And so, interestingly, So, interestingly, you know, the problem with this, this is true for knots, right? A knot is sliced, then it's algebraically sliced. But we don't know for links, even boundary links. And, you know, why does this fail? Well, you might want to prove this because, you know, when you're like studying for your advanced exam, you're learning about knots and reading Rolfson or Lickridge's book, and you look up the proof. And you look up the proof for why the signature is zero for a slice knot, or why you get this half block of zeros. Well, what you do is you start with your knots and you suppose it bounds this disk and B4. Then you can look at the cipher surface in the S3 part and glue it to the disk, and you get this closed up surface of Genus G. And then what you can do is you can take the map from Uh, take the map from the not complement to S1 that gives you the ciphered surface when you pull it back a point, and then you extend it over, you know, B4 minus the disk, the neighborhood of the disk. And then you just take another point. Okay, you make it transverse, and then you take a point and you pull it back, and then you get the surface here, but inside you get. But inside you get this three-manifold M. So this is some two-sided three-manifold, and then you can use some sort of algebraic argument on homology, a half-lived, half-dies, and then that gives you some curves on the surface that are going to be, you know, derivatives. Now for links. Well, this basically comes down to an algebraic problem. Well, Well, for links, if you had a bunch of these disks, let's say you have another disk here, well, you have, if you look at the map, the inclusion map from the three mana, the x chier of the three manifold to the x tier of the disks in before, then that map will can you know be extended over like s1 cross s1 because you have. Cross S1 because you have a homology, you have an homology isomorphism or H1 isomorphism. And but yeah, I mean, that doesn't give you a three-manifold. Then you're kind of like, oh, well, what I really wanted, what you really want is a map to a free group that extends over the four manifold. And then you want to pick M different points and pull that back to get M different manifolds. And if you could do that, then you could get algebraic sliceness. Okay, so okay, so it turns out that a boundary link is exactly links that sort of have a map from the fundamental group to a free group. And in particular, a link is going to be a boundary link if and only if there's a surjective map from pi one of the link complement to the free group on m generators or pi one of the wedge of circles. Or pi one of the wedge of circles, such that the meridians here go to the generating set of Fm, or a generating set. And so that's the definition, that's an equivalent definition of a boundary link. And so there's another equivalence relation on boundary links that is sort of easier to work with, and that's called boundary slice. Slice. So a boundary link is called boundary slice if it's slice with slice disk, let's say delta, and that the map to the free group is going to extend over the complement of the disk. Okay. And so once we have that, well, then we're good, right? Then we can use the same sort of argument and show that a boundary link that's actually A boundary link that's actually boundary slice, so that's stronger than being slice, is algebraically slice. Now, unfortunately, we don't know if these equivalence relations are the same. So a very long-standing open question is that if you have a boundary link and it's slice, it doesn't extend over the free group or anything, is it actually a boundary slice? So can you find maybe another disks for which it extends over the free group? Bounds extend over the free group. So that's another question that's interesting. And, you know, and now, like, how is this related to slice ribbon at all? You might ask, since everything's sort of related to slice or ribbon here. Well, there is, I don't know who proved this theorem. I learned of it from From, I don't know, Cochrane, I guess. And there's a proof in Jane Kim Powell. That proof proves that if you have a boundary link and that boundary link is homotopically ribbon, not boundary homotopically ribbon, just ordinary homotopically ribbon, then it's in fact boundary ribbon. And so in particular, if you have a boundary link that's ribbon, If you have a boundary link that's ribbon, the L is always strongly algebraically sliced. So that kind of gives you an obstruction to being for a boundary to be ribbon. So okay. Okay, so that so and so another question is, you know, are So, are there any smooth or topologically sliced boundary links that are not algebraically sliced? This seems hard to construct, but maybe not impossible. Yeah. Or how to characterize, you know, when a boundary link is algebraically sliced. Can we characterize that? Can we figure out when that is? Well, for knots, it's easy. A knot is algebraically sliced if and only if it. As algebraically sliced if and only if it's something called 0.5 solvable. This is work of Cochran or Teichner using Capell-Shanisson. But what is this 0.5 solvable? I'll say in a second. But for links, we don't know. We don't have a classification, I mean, of when a link, a boundary link is strongly algebraically sliced. For example, you could have one concordance. For example, you could have one concordance class of this link that is algebraically sliced, and then you have another that doesn't. So this seems to be the problem. In terms of the classification of understanding when a boundary link is algebraically sliced or algebraically 0.5 solvable, this is an ongoing project with Connie Leidy. And we have some conjectures. And we have some conjectures and some things worked out, but I'm hesitant to say without knowing all the details. But one thing we do is we have this, so there's some interesting examples. For example, the Bing double of the trefoil. It's a very nice link with two components. It's a boundary link by the taco argument. I won't get into that. And it's so we showed that it. It's so we showed that it uh it's not strongly algebraically sliced. So, um, anyway, so with some ciphered surface. So, although if you are strongly algebraically slice, you certainly are 0.5 solvable. Okay, so 1.5 solvable is, it's a very simple condition that generalizes that general, I mean, that's the sort of a rest of the An easier condition to satisfy than being actually topologically sliced. And the condition is just that if your zero surgery bounds some four manifold, instead of having pi one equal to zero and having h2 equal to zero and be normally generated by the meridians like you would for a topologically sliced complement. You just have the condition you have an isomorphism on H1 from the three manifold to the four manifold. Three manifold to the four manifold. Its spin, namely the intersection form, is a sum of hyperbolics. In particular, they're generated by surfaces that they're sort of a dual pair. There's some LIs and there's some DIs, and the LIs are called Lagrangians, the DIs are called duals. The Li and DI intersect once, and otherwise, nothing. ones and otherwise nothing intersects. So they intersect geometrically just like the matrix says. And so that's something that's called like zero solvable or just bounding a spin manifold. Then we put the condition that all of the curves on the Lagrangian are actually going to lift to the infinite cyclic cover. Or in particular, all the curves on these Lagrangians are null homologous in W. Okay, so we also did. Okay, so we also don't know a characterization of links that are 0.5 solvable. Okay, so anyway, so all of this is sort of for boundary links. We don't really don't know all the answer yet, but what if it's not a boundary link? Well, if you're not a boundary link, what do you know? Well, first you have Milner's invariance, and that's kind of, you know, you have other stuff, but that's kind of You know, you have other stuff, but that's kind of all, you know, like if a link is sliced, then all the Miller's invariants have zero. And in fact, recently, work of Davis Park, so I guess this should be Davis Harvey Park, that if you have a link with energy millers invariance, oh, sorry. Is it 0.5 solvable equal? Is it 0.5 solvably equivalent to a boundary link? So, can we relate it to a boundary link in that same category? You might say, why don't we ask whether or not it's concordant to a boundary link or smoothly concordant? And well, that's because we know that there are examples of Cochrane and Orr from the 90s of links with all Vanishing Miller's invariants that are not smoothly concordant to a boundary link. So, Davis Park and I proved that if you do have a link with Vanishing Miller, That if you do have a link with vanishing Milner's invariance that comes by way of a sub-link of a homology boundary link, then L is 0.5 solvably equivalent to a boundary link. And here, sub-link of a homology boundary link is a giant bunch of words that I won't tell you. Essentially, that is the largest known class of links that have vanishing all value. That have vanishing, all vanishing Miller's invariance, and conjecturally is the largest class is, you know. So a theorem, so then for n solvable, if you know what that is, again, like concordance, you can't get a positive theorem. So your sort of last hope is doing 0.5 solvability. And then I get with. I get wait. Does this talk end right now? Yes, I guess. Okay, so I just wanted to maybe say if you open a few more constructions, you can do some sort of different end twist annulus modifications, get new smoothly sliced knots by doing Dane surgery. And maybe I'll say a couple things about topologically sliced since I haven't talked much about it. Haven't talked much about it. So there was Friedman's disk embedding theorem that implies that K is topologically sliced, so it has Alexander polynomial one. These are all known to be homotopy ribbons, so they're not going to give you some counterexample to slice ribbon. So Cha and Powell, in the last decade, they extended work of Friedman, Teichner, and Bunch, Quinn, forgetting people's names. Forgetting people's names, that if you have a knot that bounds a height for Castauer, then K is topologically sliced. And so these give new examples of topologically sliced knots. So here is a picture of one. And these are not known to be homotopy ribbon necessarily. So this is a potential counterexample to the topological slice ribbon conjecture, for example. If it is If it is smoothly concordant to a knot with Alexander polynomial one, it won't be a counterexample, but that's unknown still. Chaw, Hedd, and Ruberman gave an infinite number of examples that are topologically sliced, but not smoothly concordant to Alexander polynomial one-knots. But these are all known to be homotopy-Ribian for any of these kinds of constructions. Basically, they have some knot and then they tie in a knot with Alexander polynomial and they use some gauge. Alexander polynomial and they use some gauge theory to prove their, you know, not smoothly concordant to Alexander polynomial one. And then I want to say a couple of things that my student, Alex Manchester, who's graduating next year, has extended sort of our knowledge of topological sliceness in a couple ways. The first way is extending some result of Cochrane-Friedel-Teichner. It's sort of a technical extension, but you can look at examples. But you can look at examples where you have some curve that's null homotopic and the complement of a slice disk, smooth sliced disk, or whatever, or topological. And then if the members and conditions satisfy something that has to do with this null homotopy, then you can show that the new satellite construction where you tie this knot in is topologically slice. And in fact, you can. Top logically slice. And in fact, you can do this for links and not just knots. And then the other question that is sort of always entertained me is that if we look at the maser pattern, so this is exactly this knot that I've drawn here, where I just tied these strings into some k. Is the maser pattern connect some negative k topologically slice? So these are potential counterexamples. So, these are potential counterexamples to slice ribbon. I don't see why they're necessarily ribbon. And presumably, they're all topologically slice. So Alex proved that if you had some operators that are kind of homotopically related, these will satisfy it, then this not will be one solvable. So, in particular, they prove that MK connected some negative. Mk connected sum negative k is one solvable, just sort of on its way to be topologically sliced. And it's actually one homotopy ribbon. So so far we can't tell them apart. That's sort of at the first level, but it would be interesting to know more about them. And then, okay, I'm just going to leave this here and say thank you. Is there any questions? Actually, I hadn't seen this maser construction. Is there a motivation for that? Interesting properties. Yeah, so if you look at, well, the major construction is related to, I mean, this is like related to corks and things and four manifolds. And four manifolds. The reason that this example should be interesting is because if you take this kind of curve that you grab to tie the knots in, well, this is homotopic to, really homotopic to just this curve that goes around once. And if you tie a knot in there, it's just connected some with that knot. So basically, this operation should give you. This operation should give you the same not up to topological concordance as just connect summing. And that's not true in the smooth world. These are known. Oh yeah, I guess I should say these are not smoothly sliced. So these are examples of potentially topologically sliced, not smoothly sliced, not homotopy ribbon. They're going to be not ribbon as well, but whether or not they're homotopy ribbon. But whether or not they're homotopy ribbon, we don't know. Does that answer your question? Yeah, yeah, great. Okay, any other question? Okay, then let's thank the speaker again. Thank you for switching time, so it's apparently caused some. I switched two times. Well, it's okay. I'm on Oaxaca time actually, because I'm not in Houston. I'm in Durango, Colorado for the summer and fall.
