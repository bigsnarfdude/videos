Yeah, so I want to talk about modest ability for curved black holes. And this has been already, I think, very well introduced in the earlier talk by Lars. But okay, just to repeat some of what you've already heard. So the Kerr family of black holes are, of course, solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations, and they are characterized by two numbers, as we've already heard, a mass and a specific angular momentum A. And just to set the notation, And just to set the notation, if A is zero, I will call this a Schwarzschild black hole. If A is smaller than M, just like in Lars talk, I'm going to call this sub-extremal black hole. And if I have exact equality, then this is an extremal black hole. And these are the only cases where you can have a black hole. If the A is above the mass, then you wouldn't have a black hole solution. So a black hole solution is something that looks like this. Okay, so again, for the record, this again already appeared. The Spenrose diagram has already appeared. Already appeared. The Spenrose diagram has already appeared in the large talk, and it won't be as important in my talk. But this is what we think of when we say curve-black hole: this picture. And again, as he said, there's a couple of reasons why we're so interested in curved black holes. And basically, it is because we think that they have all of these nice special properties. So we think that they're unique in the class of regular stationary asymptotically flat black hole solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations in four dimensions. And we also have this end-state conjecture that. And we also have this end-state conjecture that tells us that they should be the only possibility. I mean, the combinations of black curve black holes should be the only possibility for generic gravitational collapse. But of course, this whole thing, especially this final stage conjecture, only makes sense if the black curve black holes are stable. And that's one of the reasons, one of the motivations for Lars' talk. And it's again the same here. So understanding stability properties of these scrub black holes is a major open problem. Black holes is a major open problem in relativity, which has been studied since the 50s. So it has a very long history. And I think what this long history has told us, and in general, what our experience in working in nonlinear PDEs and other contexts has shown us is that if we want to prove a nonlinear stability statement, we really have to understand linear stability very, very well. And fortunately, it seems that this is the best way that we have to understand nonlinear problems is to first understand the linear problems and then think of the non-linear problems. Understand the linear problems and then think of the non-linear problems as perturbations thereof. So, really, we have to understand the linear problems very well. And the key to understanding this linear stability problem, and this has again already appeared in Lars's talk. So that was a great introduction to my talk. I can be much faster now. The key is really this Tokolsky master equation, which Lars didn't write down, but here it is. I mean, now you could see why he didn't write it down, because it is not a very nice expression. It's not very pleasant. Expression. It's not very pleasant, but that's what it is. So, and here I'm thinking of the linear Tukolsky equation. Of course, if you were studying a non-linear Tukolsky equation, you wouldn't have zero on the right-hand side. You'd have some non-linearities. But again, I would argue that even if you want to understand that equation, you would really need to start by understanding this linear equation very well. So the Tukowski equation looks like a covariant wave equation together with a bunch of first order and zero. Together with a bunch of first-order and zeroth-order terms, which depend on this s parameter here, which is the spin. And when the spin is plus or minus two, this equation describes the dynamics of gauge invariant curvature components in the Newman-Penrose formalism. So you can think of alpha plus two as C naught in Lars's talk and alpha plus minus two as C4, I think, in Lars's talk. Okay, now for a current metric, alpha is zero on the Alpha is zero on the background. And so, basically, what you want to show is you want to show the stability of this zero solution. So, you want to show that if you perturb, then the solutions that you get to the Stukowski equation, they remain bounded in time. So, that's like saying that your perturbations of Kerr give you something which is close to Kerr. That's what being bounded in time would translate into. And also that they decay as time goes to infinity, which would mean somehow that you converge back to a Kerr solution as you approach. Back to a curve solution as you approach that I plus point that was in Lars' talk. And the idea basically, I mean, as Lars said, there's many groups working on stability of curve, but one thing that they all have in common, and that was probably clear from his talk, is that all of these approaches go through the Tukolsky equation in some way. And the reason is that basically the expectation is once you are able to show something for this Tukolsky equation, you can then control the rest by gauge. The rest by gauge. And there's a good reason to expect that. So, first of all, these equations correspond to curvature components, which at the linear level are gauge invariant. So, that's a very good thing. It means it doesn't depend on your gauge. And moreover, if you look at this, you'll see that these are equations which decouple completely from the rest of the system. So, when you're studying perturbations of Kerr in the Einstein equations, you're always going to have a very huge system. You're always going to have a very huge system of equations for, for instance, the spin coefficients if you use the GHP formalism or the Newman-Penrose formalism. But here, these equations, it turns out these gauge-invariant curvature components satisfy equations which are completely decoupled from that entire system at the linear level. So, really, if you want to understand the linear problem, which we do, you have to start with this. This would be sort of the key. This would be sort of the key. The key the first thing you'd look at is the two equations, which magically decouple from the rest. Now, I let I instead of choosing S to be plus or minus two, I put S here. And the reason for that is it can be interesting to consider other spins. For instance, spin zero would just give you back the covariant wave operator on the fixed curve background, which is an equation which is very highly studied. So just the scalar wave equation on a fixed curve background. If you take S to B. Curve background. If you take S to B plus or minus one, then you have something very similar, but now for the Maxwell equation. So this describes some gauge invariant electromagnetic quantities at the linear level again. Okay, so my talk is going to be all about the linear level. So I said that it's very important to show the stability of the zero solution. So here is a picture to tell you how far we've gone in that endeavor. So we have two axes here. So one is the black hole spin A here. Black hole spin A here. And in the vertical direction, we have the Tukolsky spin. So again, spin zero is just the scale wave equation. Spin one is relevant for electromagnetic perturbation. Spin two is the gravitational perturbations case. And obviously this equation, the Tukovsky equation, looks much nicer if we can delete all of these extra terms. So the first thing that people did was to try to fill out this picture in the horizontal direction. So the first results for So the first results for the wave equation in the Schwarzschild case were in the early 2000s. Then there were results for the perturbative case, very slowly rotating curved black holes. And then finally, there was a result of the Fermos-Rodnieski and Slapentock-Rothman in 2014, where they show that solutions to the scalar wave equation remain bounded and decay in time for the full sub-extremal range of parameters. Now, the extremal case is a bit more complicated, and there's a nice story. There's a nice story there, which I think we'll hear about in the next talk by Stefano Zaratakis. So it is more complicated, and we should not probably take for granted that we can expect such strong decay in stability statements as for curve black holes, if indeed we can expect stability statements at all. Okay, so you can think that more or less by 2014, we understood basically this horizontal line, at least in the sub-extremal sense. And so it was time to. Extremal sense. And so it was time to go back and introduce all of these nasty terms, which we had ignored by considering just a scalar wave. So that's so it was time to go vertical. And of course, you always begin in the easiest case. And the easiest case would be the structural black hole, because while Kerr is a rotating black hole, if you take the angular momentum to be zero, then you just get a non-rotating black hole, which is vertically symmetric. It has a lot of nice properties. So it makes sense to start as close to the axis as you can. And the first big result. And the first big result here was by the firm of Solzeg and Rodnansky in 2016, where not only do they show the statement that solutions to Koski equation remain bound in time and, in fact, decay, but also they show that the rest is controlled by gauge. So they show that this expectation, which I wrote at the end of the slide, is actually true. So they show linear, so they begin by doing this analysis of Tukolsky equation, and then they're able to improve that into a full linear stability statement for Schwarzschild. Statement for Schwarzenegger. Okay, and then very quickly after, as we heard in Lars' talk, the perturbative case where A is a very small number, is considered to be a very small number compared to M, followed by independent works of Ma and the Fermos Holzikol and Rodnyansky. And finally, my thesis, I have a result with Schlappentock-Rothman, who is at the University of Toronto, which settles, proves the same result in the full sub-extremal range for both gravitational perturbations and electrobinetic perturbations. Perturbations. What do you mean by the issues of gauge were treated in the spin zero case in the scalar? There's no gauge, right? No, there's no gauge. Yes, yes, that's true. This last comment here was more applicable for spin one and spin two. But you also said that the permos, et cetera, also tackled the issue of gauge. Was that for the spin zero? Yeah, so it was sorry, it was. Yeah, so it was, sorry, it was this DHR16. So they tackled the issue of gauge in the spin 2 case, yes. Thank you. And their approach was then used by Pasqualotto in a similar context for the electromagnetic preservations. Yeah. But you're right. To this horizontal line, I mean, the gauge comment does not apply. Okay. So last, as I was saying, so last year with Schlappen Tark Rothman, we were able to show that a solution to Tukolski equation remains. Solutions to Kovsky equation remain bound in the Key time for, in fact, the full sub-extreme will range with spin one and spin two. But this is not yet the full linear stability statement because we haven't dealt with the issues of gauge and we haven't dealt with the rest of the linearized system of equations. Okay, again, the extremal case is a little bit more fiddly, but I'll talk in this in this talk, I'll mention another result concerning mode stability. So this is more or less the picture for the Tcholsky equation, but the problem with this picture. The Tokolsky equation, but the problem with this picture is that there's a lot of things that don't fit here. So, one of those things, as I've already mentioned, is that this DHR work here is not just about Tokovsky equation, but in fact, it's a full linear stability state. There's other such developments that don't fit here. So, for instance, last year, the firm of Huddlesegel, Rodniowski, and Taylor showed full finite co-dimension stability of the Schwarzschild solution. So, that's in the non-linear sense. So, that's a major brick. Linear sense, so that's a major breakthrough, but it didn't fit in my picture here. Of course, it is very important to stress this. This is the first non-linear stability result for a black hole solution. So this is very, very, very impressive work. And there's also some ongoing work by Kleinerman, Sheftel, and Georgi to address lawn lane instability in the very slowly rotating Kerr case. There's also been, in addition to these works on the In addition to these works on the Tukolski equation, there's also been an attempt to upgrade that to the linear Einstein vacuum equations in the very slowly rotating case, Kerr case. So, this has been work by Anderson, Bach, Delbu, and Ma that we just heard about in Lars's talk. Very nice talk. And there's also work by Hafner, Hints, and Vajiv, both from 2019. And finally, as again, we've also heard in the case, for instance, of the Kerr-desitter family, which is a cousin of Kerr with positive cosmological constant. With positive cosmological constant. In fact, the outlook is much nicer in the sense that already in 2016 we had a full proof of non-linear stability in the very slowly rotating case. But in that case, WASI, etc., they don't really reach SCRI. It's really between the cosmological horizon and the cosmological horizon and the event horizon. Yes. So the issue of SCRI is still quite open, I think. Okay. open i think okay yeah i i'm not i'm not a big expert on curl the sitter so i i don't know exactly to to what extent um the region between the cause the cosmological horizon and sky should be should be what we consider so my impression was it is a bit more physical to remain in the region bounded by the two horizons um but maybe yeah the discussion period okay i'd be interested to know yeah what you think Be interested to know, yeah, what you think. Um, okay, so what I want to talk about today is really, um, a bit like Juan said at the beginning, to go back to the to the classics and the history of GR is not as old as some other fields, but there's still some works which are very classical. So, this work of Tcholsky, where he showed that there's this Tokolsky master equation, is a very classical work. And I want to really go back to that. And I want to really go back to that, to the 1970s, and put myself in their shoes. So, what Tokolsky first did when he derived his equation, he instantly noticed that his equation was separable. So, again, you can use the separability properties of Kerr. And so, informally, at least, the solution to the Kovsky equation, you can think of it as an infinite superposition of modes, and modes are solutions which look like this. So, they're separated. they're separated. So we have a time frequency omega and as a Mutton number little m. We have a separation between the R and the theta variables and this capital lambda here is the separation constant. So for instance, if we're looking at Schwarzschild, you can think of these angular functions as the spherical harmonics, and you can think of lambda as something like L times L plus one. So the spherical harmonic separation constant. Okay, here it will be a bit more complicated, and that's why I didn't. More complicated, that's why I denote it by lambda. Okay, and when you plug in this unsettled into the Kovsky equation, you get a Schrodinger type ODE. So something which looks like u double prime plus omega squared minus a potential u equals zero. So again, this is something that Lars didn't show, but here is the OD that he was mentioning that you get when you do the mole decomposition. So this OD, I've put this in a nice form by replacing the R variable. By replacing the R variable that we usually use for Kerr by some rescaled tortoise coordinate, which takes R plus the location of the event horizon to minus infinity and leaves infinity at infinity. Okay, so it's not important that you remember these formulas. I'm just showing it to you so that you have an idea. So these formulas are all perfectly explicit in the curve parameters and in the angular and in the frequency parameters omega m and capital lambda. So you can see them here. And capital lambda. So you can see them here. And also the Turkowski spin. So perfectly explicit functions, perfectly explicit potential. And you can see why this is very reminiscent of quantum mechanics. You have u double prime plus energy level minus some potential times u equals zero. And since we are, since this looks a bit like quantum mechanics, let me maybe consider with a quantum mechanical interpretation of this. So we can think about the scattering map. Think about the scattering map for each frequency triple omega m and lambda. So, this is a bit of a quantum mechanics idea. So, the idea is we are throwing in an ingoing solution with energy one, say, from square minus. We throw in a solution to this ODE, and there will be a piece of it which is transmitted to the event horizon. There will be a piece which will get reflected. Horizon, there will be a piece which will get reflected to future null infinity. Um, so now you see, if uh, if you now you can measure how much is, you know, you are sitting at future null infinity, and sitting there, you can measure how much of this of this ingoing wave that you that you put in is being reflected back to you. So you can measure how big it is. So if this reflection coefficient is, let's say, infinite, then obviously you have a mode instability because you Obviously, you have a motor instability because you ended up, you put in energy one or amplitude one, and you ended up with an infinite amplitude. So that's really a problem. Clearly, you have some kind of instability with the in this mode unsat. So there's a mode instability. Now, what usually prevents you from having this type of thing? What usually prevents you is the existence of a conserved energy, usually in a physical system, let's say. And this is indeed the case, for instance, if you're looking at a Schwarzschild black hole. So if you're looking at a Schwarzschild black hole, Black hole. So, if you're looking at a Schwarzschild black hole, the conservation of energy in waves tells you that the reflection coefficient squared plus the transmission coefficient squared have to be equal to the energy that you put in, which is one. And obviously, immediately from this identity, you deduce that the reflection coefficient cannot be bigger than one. And so, obviously, it's not infinite. So, you don't have a mode instability. Now, in the Kerr case, In the Kerr case, you still have a stationary black hole, so you still have a conserved energy naturally associated with waves or with the Tukolsky equation. However, when you look at the rotating case, the conservation law looks a bit different. So suddenly you don't have r squared plus t squared, you have r squared plus some factor times t squared equals one, equals the input energy. And it turns out that this factor is not always nice. So if you have that this factor So, if you have that this factor is positive, again, you can conclude in the same way that r has to be bounded by one, and so you don't have a mode instability. But it can happen if that you satisfy that you have the opposite sign, so that you have this coefficient be negative, and then you only know that the reflection is competing with the transmission. So, reflection coefficient minus transmission coefficient equals one. It doesn't tell you that they are bounded in any way. So, you can see. Are bounded in any way, so you can still have them both be going to infinity, but the difference between them being equal to one. Um, so whenever you have the super radiant condition, this really opens the door to superadient instabilities, to instabilities associated with this super radiance. And notice, of course, that the reason why you didn't see this in the case of Schwarzschild was because the super radiant condition is related to the azimuthal number m, which needs to not be zero for this to happen, and also the angular velocity. Happen and also the angular velocity of the event horizon, which is zero if you're looking at Schwartzhield, and it only becomes non-zero into the rotating Kirk case. So it's really only in the rotating Kirk case that you are potentially threatened by these super radiant instabilities. And in fact, I think again, since the 70s, it is more or less expected that super radiant instability should be the norm. And there's these papers about black hole bombs and how you can use this super radiant mechanism to exactly produce. Mechanism to exactly produce instabilities. And yet, and this was already in Tukolski and Press's work from the 70s, from the early 70s, no unstable modes seem to be detected for the Tukolsky equation on curve. So this is their paper, I think, from 1973, which says we looked at for instabilities in the dozen or so lowest angular modes, and there seemed to be none for any value of. None for any value of sub-extremal rotation. So these results add credibility to the use of the currentric in detailed astrophysical models. And we do know that since then, the current metric has really been widely used in astrophysical models, all of it coming from this work. So of course, in the 70s, I don't think that they were using very good technology to test for these unstead. To test for these unstable modes and for these potential mode instabilities, but this survived even the development of better tools to handling these kinds of numerics. So, for instance, this paper of Lever from 1985. Okay, so superior indensibilities aren't the norm, but apparently the massless-Dchaukowski equations are the exception. And you can ask why. And the question of why, you cannot address it, I don't think, by doing. Address it, I don't think, by doing numerics and verifying numerically that there doesn't seem to be any unstable modes. So you can ask a computer: are there unstable modes and do numerics and try and be very persuaded that there aren't any, but it will be very hard to understand why that is the case. What are the structures in Kerr that make it possible for this mode instability, for this, for us for Kerr to quash these mode instabilities, which are supposed to be so ubiquitous? And I think. Ubiquitous. And I think I would argue that the way that you might be able to answer that question of why is by coming up with a proof, because a proof is going to highlight the mechanisms which exist in this space-time, which allow for this to happen. And that's really important if you want to then study a completely different problem, maybe a black hole in higher dimensions or something like that, and try to see whether it is modally stable or not, try to show the same results. So you really want to understand why, what are the mechanisms that allow for this to be true. That allows for this to be true. And a proof, in fact, only came much, much later. So, Tukolski and Press's numerics were from 1973, 1974, and it took until 1989 for proof of what they were hinting at in their numerics to come to light. And this was done by Whiting, as we heard also in Lars's talk. So, what Whiting did was he showed that if A is sub-extremal, Is sub-extremal. And if you take omega m lambda, so frequency parameters with positive imaginary part of omega, so this would be a solution which is exponentially growing in time if you go back here, which obviously would lead to an instability. Then the only solution to the Turkowski equation, which has boundary conditions compatible with physical boundary conditions, so I'm going to call this good boundary conditions. These are in Boundary conditions. These are ingoing at the event horizon and outgoing at future null infinity. So, the only such solutions, the only such solution to Tukovsky ODE is the zero solution. Okay, so that's the statement. This is exactly what Tukowski and Press wanted, were trying to say was true, that they could see it numerically. And this was what Whiting proved. And now let's go to the question of why. So, why is this true? Well, let's look at Whiting's proof to see if we can understand why. We can understand why. So, the way that Whiting proved this was to show that the Chupolsky ODE, which I'm showing you again, so you again don't need to remember any of this, but the ODE looked like this: u double prime plus omega squared minus potential times u equals zero. He showed that this ODE actually has the same spectrum, so its isospectral has the same quasi-normal modes as some other ODE, which now I denoted by where I now put tildes everywhere. So I have u tilde prime prime. u tilde prime prime plus omega squared minus v tilde u prime u u tilde equals zero. And it turns out, so why is this useful? Why is it interesting that they have the same quasi normal? So the reason why it's interesting is because this new ODE actually has no super radiance. So if you look at the conservation law associated with it, the conservation law looks not like the Kerr one, but actually it looks a lot like the Schwarzschild one. So basically, this new ODE, because it has no super radiance, it's very easy to see that it has no unstable modes, that that reflection coefficient has to be bounded. It can't be infinite. And then you can use the fact that they have the same quasi-normal modes, that they have the same spectrum to show that if this guy, if this new OD doesn't have unstable modes, then neither can the Tukolski OD. So that's how he proved this. And now you can ask, okay, but how. And now you can ask, okay, but how did he prove that the Tchukolsky ODE is isospectral to this new ODE? So, the way that he did this was by explicitly writing down a map, which showcases that isospectrality. So, this is the map that he wrote. This is an integral. So, he takes the solution to the Tukoski ODE and he integrates it against the kernel. Basically, that's what's going on here. So, this is the kernel. You can ignore much of the rest. You have U and then you have a kernel, and that defines your U. A kernel and that defines your u tilde. And now, from the fact that you know that u satisfies some ODE with some boundary conditions, then you can deduce that u tilde satisfies another ODE with other boundary conditions. And that other OD is precisely this one here. So you can check this by hand. And the other thing which you can check easily by hand is that this map is injective. So the map that takes your original solution to the Tokoski OD to a new solution of a new OD is an injective map. And the reason for that is because the And the reason for that is because the kernel that you're integrating against looks a little bit like a Fourier transform. Okay, it's sort of strange Fourier transform, but a Fourier transform nonetheless, and Fourier transforms are injective. So this is an injective map, which means that your previous, the Tukowski OD and this new OD are going to have the same quasi-normal modes by the injectivity. Okay, so it's easy to see why in Whiting's result he needed to consider the positive imaginary part. Consider the positive imaginary part of omega, it's because it is this. This all that I said is a little bit hand-wavy, and to make it precise, to even make this transformation precise, it is very convenient if you have some exponential decay coming in in your kernel. And if you have omega in the upper half plane, you have exponential decay given to you by this kernel. On the other hand, if you have omega on the real axis, then this kernel is just an oscillation. So, in order to show that this map is well defined, Show that this map is well defined, it requires some regularization argument or some complex analysis argument. And the first person to do this was Shapitak Rothman in 2015, but there's also an alternative proof by Anderson, Ma, Paganini, and Whiting from 2017, which goes about this in a complex analysis kind of way. Okay, so another thing you can note here, in addition to this being very strange, that you can just write down this injective map. Write down this injective map. Another thing you can note is that this transformation breaks down in this extremal limit. And the reason why you can see that is if you look at again the kernel, the only important thing here is the kernel and that you have u and that you're integrating. If you look at this kernel, you see that in the denominator, you have r plus minus r minus. So these are the two roots, the roots corresponding to the event horizon and the Cauchy horizon. I'm sorry, I should have written the explicit formulas, but R plus is. formulas, but r plus is m plus square root m squared minus a squared. R minus is the other root, so with a minus sign. And so when you are in the extremal case, both r plus and r minus are equal to m. So this denominator blows up. So this whole transformation becomes completely ill-defined in the limit where a goes to m, in the extremal limit. And yet a similar strategy works. And so this was the result that I mentioned that I The result that I mentioned, that I mentioned in passing. So, you can still, the idea of writing down an injective map that you can check by hand gives you this isospectrality between the Tukolsky ODE and the new ODE with no super radiance. This argument still works. You just need a new idea of what that map should be. But here is a map which works for extremal curve. So, again, this map, what it does is that it takes your, it maps. That it takes your it maps your U solution to the Tukolski equation to a solution to a new equation, Tukolsky equation tilde, if you want, which now has no super radians, and so it has no unstable modes, and so it is modally stable. And since the map is injective, if u tilde vanishes, so if u tilde is modally stable, then you also has to be modally stable. So that's the idea of the proof. The idea of the proof. Okay, hopefully, this is clear. Please interrupt if you have questions. Okay. So, just to sum up, what we know is that if omega is in the upper half plane, or if it's on the real axis, and we have to exclude some frequencies, for instance, the zero frequency. And if you were in the extremal case, you have to also exclude this other funny frequency for similar reasons. Then the only solution to the Kowski equation was. The only solution to the Kowski equation, which has good physical boundary conditions, so ingoing at the event horizon, outgoing at infinity, the only solution is the zero solution. And this is true in the sub-extremal case and also in the extremal case with this caveat here. Okay. So does this answer the question of why it's true that modestability holds? I'm not completely certain of this, just because we have these proofs. We have these proofs. You write down this explicit map, you can check by hand very easily that mode stability holds once you know these maps. But the question is, how do you come up with these maps? And just from what I've showed you here, you can see how fiddly this all is. So first of all, you write down this map, and now you need to have a different approach for the upper half plane and for the real axis, because in the upper half plane, it's easy to see that the map is well defined, but on the real axis, you need this whole. But on the real axis, you need this whole regularization argument. So, a lot of technicalities going into it. Furthermore, I change the space-time by a little bit. I mean, I go from sub-extreme occur to extreme occur. And from the point of view of outside the black hole, it kind of looks similar. I change the black hole just a little bit, and suddenly I'm back to square one. The transformation that I had blows up, and I need to come up with a different transformation. So that's a little annoying. And moreover, what isn't And moreover, what isn't clear at all is how do you even go about wanting to write this such a map? So why should it be the case? Why should it be the case that you have these two isospectral equations? And why should there be an injective map which corresponds to a strange Fourier transformation between them? So that to me at least is not clear. And if you want an example of why this isn't clear, that you can see easily is. That you can see easily is, for instance, there is no known map like this for the Kurd-the-Sitter family. So, for Kurd-the-Sitter black holes, we have no mode stability statement, and we know, I think, of no transformation like this that would allow us to prove mode stability. Okay, so we, with Mark Casals, we set about trying to understand these proofs a little better. So, the overarching Proofs a little better. So, the overarching question was: why should the Tukolsky OD and this new OD that Whiting finds, why should they be isospectral? Okay, you told me that there's this map that I can write down, but is there some way that I should know that I could derive this a priori? And what we saw is that, in fact, the answer might have been in the literature already. And again, I'm going back to the classics here, so I'm really going back to the, let's say, 80s. So, this is a paper. Let's say 80s. So, this is a paper that I mentioned already at the beginning by Lever about quasi-normal modes in curved black holes. And this is a paper where he says that he finds a condition for the existence of a non-trivial mode solution. So he says a non-trivial mode solution exists if the frequency omega solves a certain continued fraction equation. Okay, and to me, this didn't really look like a continued fraction equation at first, but this is a continued fraction equation. If you take This is a continuous fraction equation if you take this second guy, alpha one, gamma two, and you place it after the minus sign, and so on and so forth. Okay, so he says there's a continued fraction equation which defines your non-trivial modes. And these numbers here, beta, alpha, and gamma, they're all explicitly determined in terms of the index n and in terms of the black hole parameters and the frequency parameters. And the frequency parameters. So you see appearing here omega, m, the black hole parameters A, the mass is normalized to be a half, so you don't see it here, but it is hiding here. You see the Tchovsky spin S. You see the separation constant lambda, which he calls A, et cetera, et cetera. Okay, so how does he do this? So the way that he does this is by saying, well, most solutions have to satisfy certain boundary conditions. Boundary conditions. And when I expand into a family of special functions around the event horizon, say, and then I impose, that gives me a recursive relation for the coefficients of this expansion. That's these Russian coefficients right here. And then the condition that I have the boundary condition at infinity, the outgoing boundary condition at infinity, allows me to say that I must be a root of this continued fraction equation. So that's how he goes about that. And hopefully that explains. Goes about that, and hopefully, that explains all of the words here: the recursion coefficients, etc., etc. Okay, so one way when you look at this paper, one way that you could try to prove mode stability would be to say, okay, so I have this explicit construction of modes. There's only a non-trivial mode if this equation is satisfied. Maybe I can just show that this equation has no solutions in the upper half plane or on the real axis. This determines. This determines my modes. If I can show that there are no solutions in the real axis or in the upper half plane, then I get an alternative proof of mode stability. So that's the idea. Okay, but on the other hand, when you look at this, you might get very easily, very discouraged because you see that the dependence on, even if everything is very explicit, the dependence on the coefficients, on the black hole parameters and on the frequency parameters, it's very complicated. So these intermediate constants have quite complicated. Constants have quite complicated expressions. So, one thing you can try, however, is to say, well, maybe with lever that maybe lever didn't write this with the correct set of intermediate constants. Maybe there's a better set of intermediate constants, which makes this a nicer problem. So, what we did was to introduce some other intermediate constants, which I'll call masses. Again, perfectly explicit in the black hole parameters and the frequency parameters. And the frequency parameters. And when you rewrite the coefficients in terms of these new intermediate constants, you see that they simplify considerably. So suddenly you just have three lines of expressions. But actually, this isn't just a cosmetic improvement. This is more. Because if you notice, what I've written here is that now the recursion coefficients, they depend on these intermediate constants in a very special way. Media constants in a very special way. They depend on them only through symmetric polynomials. So sigma 1 is the symmetric polynomial of degree 1. So M1 plus M2 plus M3. Sigma 3 would be M1 times M3 times M2 times M3. Okay, and maybe you'll notice that I've only written alpha times gamma instead of alpha and gamma separately. And the reason for that is since I'm only interested in the continued fraction equation, I'm really only interested in the products of the alphas times the gammas. I'm not interested in each of them separately. So that's why I wrote. In each of them separately. So that's why I wrote it like that. Okay, so what does it mean now that the dependence is only through the symmetric polynomials? Well, what this means is that there are certain these recursion coefficients, obviously, are going to be symmetric under exchanging these masses, the intermediate constants M1, M2, M3. If I exchange them, then nothing happens because it depends only through symmetric polynomials. So obviously, now the continued fraction equation. The Dow, the continued fraction equation is going to be symmetric under is going to be invariant under changes exchanges in the mass parameters and the intermediate constants. So, basically, the condition for the existence of a mode is invariant under swapping these mass parameters. And that's something very interesting. And the reason why it's very interesting is if you now look again once for the third time at the Tukolski OD, again, you don't need to remember this potential, but here it is again. If I now write it in terms of the If I now write it in terms of the intermediate constants that I chose, this is what it looks like. So we have M1 plus M2, and then you have M3 here. And you'll notice that this formula is not invariant under swapping any two masses. For instance, if you swap M1 and M3, you get a different equation. So what I've just told you is that the condition for existence of a mode has certain symmetries, but the equation doesn't have. But the equation doesn't have those symmetries. Okay? So that's very interesting. So the condition for a mode has symmetries which are sort of hidden. So they're not symmetries of the equation. They're just symmetries of the quasi-normal modes, of the point spectrum of this ODE. So because we generate different ODEs, we can try to exploit these symmetries to see what they give us. So if you swap M1 and M3, If you swap M1 and M3, you can see from these formulas, basically you're just swapping the sine of the Tukowski spin S. And the invariance of the spectrum under swapping S to minus S, this is basically what the so-called Tukowski-Serbinski identities tell you. So they tell you that the quasi-normal modes of the plus S solution and the minus S solution are the same. So that's one thing. Now we can also try to change M2 and M3. So it's obvious here that M1. So it's obvious here that M1 and M2 is actually a symmetry of the ODE, but M2 to M3, exchanging these two, is not the symmetry of the ODE. So you will generate a new equation. And it turns out that the equation that you generate is exactly Whiting's equation, Whiting's OD. And that's very, very special. So you've just managed to recover Whiting's punchline without needing to do that integral transformation. So now you can, now that you have this new equation, you can again. That you have this new equation, you can again go through the same argument. So we know that this symmetry preserves the quasi-normal mode. So we know that this gives us a way of proving that the Tchukoski ODE and this new OD, the whiting ODE, have the same spectrum. And since the Whiting ODE doesn't have any super radians, it has no unstable modes. And that means then that mode stability must hold for the Tokolsky equation. Yeah. Just to I guess I'm just a logo. Just I got a bit lost or confused. The Telkovsky-Starobinsky identity is by swapping M1 and M3 or M1 and M2. So the Tchovovsky-Slovenski identity corresponds to swapping M1 and M3. So you can see it here in the definition. But the potential changes in this case, right? Yeah, the potential changes, but actually you can work it out and see that it only changes. So, you know, you see here M1 and M3 corresponds to swapping S to minus S. S to minus s. The potential is going to change. Yeah, yeah. Those are the bits symmetric. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. So the potential changes, but in this very simple way that it changes. Yeah, no, it's okay. Okay. Right. So finally, I should just point out that these, the existence of these symmetries, this was something conjectured by Aminov, Grassy, and Hatsuda in 2020. So we didn't come up with the idea by ourselves. So they conjectured this by comparison with supersymmetric quantum. With supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics, which is a nice story. But one thing which they didn't conjecture, but we managed to extrapolate, is actually their reasoning for the existence of these symmetries in the Kerr case actually could be extended to the Kerr-de-Sitter case. And so we managed to show that in the sub-extremal Kurd-de-Sitter family, we also have a set of symmetries, discrete symmetries similar to this. Similar to this. So we need to introduce a different set of intermediate constants. Now we do m1 to m4, so we have four masses, and we have a symmetry by interchanging these masses, which is not a symmetry of the ODE, but again, a symmetry of the spectrum, of the quasi-normal modes. So we can try to, again, see what exactly these tell us, and again, we'll find the Tokolsky-Serbensky identities. Unfortunately, we'll not find. Unfortunately, we'll not find an analog of the Whiting equation. So, we can use these symmetries to rule out mode instabilities for some super radiant frequencies, but not all of them. So, it remains an open problem to prove or disprove mode stability for the superradiant frequencies, which we left out and which are a big chunk of the super radiant range. So, I should, of course, point out that the blue region goes all the way to zero. Region goes all the way to zero, basically. But here, in the very slowly rotating Kerr case, there is an alternative proof of mode stability by, I think, first Dyatlov and then, of course, Hints and Vaji in the process of their non-linear paper, also show mode stability here. So it's really a large rotation problem to understand this mode stability. this this this uh mode stability statement so and to try to to to show whether it holds or not in this blue region so you should think it starts here let's say somewhere here okay so just to wrap up um so what mode stability tells us now is that we have this whole uh huge uh infinite superposition of modes for the tokolsky equation so you can think of omega as being in r so very uh from minus infinity to infinity and through mode stability what we've managed to do is just Remote stability, what we've managed to do is to say, well, fix a box, fix some omega large, whatever you want it to be. And in that box, I can tell you that there are no modes, except in the regions which I had to exclude from my statement. Okay, unfortunately, when you're dealing with an infinite superposition of modes, it's not enough, you know, as usual in infinite sums, it's not enough for you to tell me that the partial sum is bounded. If I know that the sum up to some... If you know that the sum up to some n large is bounded, that doesn't mean that the sum up to infinity is going to be bounded. For instance, think of the sum of one over n, right? So if you fix a large n, it's obviously there's some bound. But if you want to go sum all the way to infinity, that's series diverges. So actually to know that you have no modes in a box, no matter how large that box is, is not great. We want to be able to show that, in fact, you don't have any modes coming in from the high frequencies, that you have no modes at the very high frequencies. You have no modes at the very high frequencies, no modes at the very low frequencies, which we have to exclude from our mode stability statement. And if you're interested in extreme occur, you would also need to show that you have no modes coming in from this hole right here. And I just wanted to end by saying that showing this statement that there are no modes coming in from the high frequencies and no modes coming in from the low frequencies is exactly the point of my work with Shalapan Takra. Of my work with Schlop and Tok Rothman. So we do this in the full sub-extreme range of A smaller than M. And it's really by combining. So, and this uses very different techniques, which would require a different proof. But it's really only by combining this work with the mode stability statement, for which we have no proofs other than the ones that I showed you, no alternative proofs. It's really only by combining my work with Yakov with mode stability that we are. With mode stability, that we are then able to show that solutions to the Tukolski equation are in fact bounded and in fact decay in time. So I think that's a good place to stop. Thank you very much for listening. Okay, so thank you very much, Rita, for a very nice talk. Are there any questions from the audience either? Essential, virtual? Well, everything is virtual, in fact. So again, Hita, when I was questioning back then, you showed the potential with the M1, M2, and M3 on the slides. I'm still a bit confused there because the potential is symmetric under M1 and 2, right? Yes. But the lever-continuous function is not. I guess what you're trying to say is it's. I guess what you're trying to say is it's not obvious from the definition of M1 and M2 that there should be symmetry between M1 and M2. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So my question is, what happens at the lever side, the exchange between M1 and M2? Well, I mean, in the lever side, exchanging M1 and M2, I mean, it is a symmetry. Right. So when you rewrite the coefficients, you see that it is a symmetry. That it is a symmetry. Okay, then there is some when you write the Tukolsky equation, and so when I write this formula here, I need to choose, since there is actually, since it is a symmetry of the ODE, not just of the spectrum, I need to choose what I call M1 and what I choose to call M2. Because I could just, you know, I could just, right? So I could call this expression M1 and this expression M2. Okay, okay. Right. Okay, okay. Right. But I decided to give them these names because these are the names which are in the in the work of Aminov, Grassi, and Hatsula, where they conjecture the existence of these spectral symmetries. So, you know, I could call, I could have changed the names. I could have called this expression M1 and this expression M2. And then I would say that swapping M2 and M3 would give me the Tukolsky-Sorbinska idencies and swapping M1 and M3. Urban scheduling season swapping M1 and M3. Yeah, exactly, exactly. Thanks, Rodrigo. Any other questions? Yes, I have a question. Can you hear me? Vaguely. You have to get closer, Jose Luis. Can you hear me now? Yes. Okay, so my question somehow connects with. Somehow connects with the third talk tomorrow. So, in these heat asymmetries you are discussing with Marcassals of the point spectrum but not of the equations, do you know if this can be recast in terms of what in quantum mechanics called Lamoux transformations? If you start in this radical type equation with a given potential, and this provides And this provides by choosing some generating function, you introduce a transformation that transforms simultaneously the potential and the wave function, so to speak, such a way that the new system has the same spectrum. And this is part of the key in tomorrow's Carlos Obuertas talk. Carlos, you are there, so you can correct what I'm saying. So do you know or you have an intuition of what or have you considered to recast to understand? To request to understand these hidden symmetries in terms of that move those? So I'm not familiar with that at all, with that literature. However, I mean, there is a way to recast these symmetries. So in the Kerr case, for instance, there is a way to recast these symmetries in a different light. So for instance, the second symmetry, which I mentioned, M2 to M3, one way of generating this symmetry is by doing Whiting's proof, which I mentioned. Is by doing Whiting's proof, which I mentioned earlier, which is about integration against some kernel. So it might be related to the literature that you're mentioning. Although I can't say for sure because I really don't know about it. So I haven't checked to see whether when you consider these functions, these generating functions that you said that do some transformations, whether they correspond or not to Whiting's integral transformation. But there is a way to express this symmetry. There is a way to express this symmetry in an integral transformation form, and that's exactly Whiting's proof. So then there's these other symmetries that I mentioned: M1, 2, M3. And I mentioned that the statement that these symmetries exist is a well-known consequence of the Tukolsky-Sorbensky identities. Again, the Tukosky-Sorbensky identities are a map.
