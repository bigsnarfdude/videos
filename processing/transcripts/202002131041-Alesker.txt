The goal of this talk is to introduce some complex analog of the algebra of even translation and variance relations in complex sets. Complex analog is in some formal sense, in some informal sense, just new algebra which imitates some properties, known properties of valuations in complex sets. And the reason The reason why I decided to present this conference is that on one hand, as I said, the motivation comes from convexity, operations and convex sets. On the other hand, the proofs are based on some integral geometry, properties of Radon and cassine transform on complex Grassmanns, which is somehow one of the tools of It was complexity and geometry. And I realized that in this audience there are only very few experts in evaluation theory and probably there is no reason why they should care about complex analogues of something they don't know. So most of the talk I will spend Talk, I will spend describing the original structures on relations of convex sets, and then in the form they can be generalized as a convex relations. And then I will indicate how it generalizes to complex and some other settings. So and I want to emphasize that the main result is just. That the main result is just construction of some non-trivial object, some algebra with interesting properties, with integral geometry behind those rules. Okay, so in order to describe, and now let me introduce some notation, remind some background from the valuation theorem. So let V be finite dimensional. Dimensional, real vector space. So far it is real, but for new results it's going to be complex. Script kind of demonstrate of all convex compact sets and definition. Uh definition evaluation is a complex valid functional on this family of four complex compact sets such that it has the following additivity property phi of A union B equals phi of A plus phi of A plus phi of B minus phi of the intersection. Whenever A, B and their union are convex and compact. And uh we denote by Y V the space of all translation invariant Translation invariant invariant continuous valuations The continuity is understood in the Hausdorff sense with respect to the Hausdorff minimum This is an infinite dimensional space This is an infinite dimensional space. Uh uh let me uh remind one important property uh uh one more definition before so I'm going to remind me remind you Macmoulin's decomposition so one more definition so valuation phi is called k homogeneous K is a number if phi of lambda k equals lambda to the power k phi of k for any non-negative scalar lambda and any convex for decay. And I do not standard notation by standard notation. By now, while k of v is the subspace of all k homogeneous variations. K homogeneous. So it is a linear subspace of all translation variant continuous variations. And there is the following important result of Macmullen. That space of translation of variant relations is direct sum of k homogeneous subspaces where k runs uh between all integers from zero to n their n is dimension of v. So, okay two facts about this decomposition. Zero homogeneous variations, relations of minimal degree of homogeneity, are all multiples of the earlier. Of the earlier characteristic. It is one homogeneous, one-dimensional space. And it is an easy fact. I remind that earlier characteristic by definition, its value on any quantities compact body is equal to one. And valuations of maximal degree of ingenuity, it is also one homogeneous, one dimension. Homogeneous one-dimensional space spanned by the Lebesgue measure. It has less trivial fact due to Hartpegger. But the other summons are infinite dimensional. I will need also the notion of even and odd valuation. So we have other decompositions with respect to Peritia. Composition with the scripted period. Even valuations plus odd valuations for any degree of homogeneity. No, even valuations. Just if we multiply any convex body by symmetric, origin symmetric, and okay, here that means this equality for any body k. Equality for any body k and here accordingly you have change of sign. These are also linear subspaces of the space of valuations. And for these two cases of degree of homogeneity of zero n Of 0n, odd value odd part vanishes, but for any other degree of homogeneity k, both summons are infinite-dimensional. Moreover, this topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of this family, the space of valuations, is a Banach space. And all this And uh all these uh subspaces are closed uh closed uh subspaces okay this um uh they are complemented this is the three states they are comple they are complemented uh substrate the uh three dimensions uh three dimensional one dimension. What do you mean complement? This is direct sum decomposition as Banach space. Yes, direct sum decomposition. Banach off ratio. Banach. In this case, it is Banach. It is not immediately obvious that this is Banach space, but from Macmoulin's decomposition, one can deduce that it is actually Banach. It's a direct sum of the it's the direct sum of norms, right? Of monox spaces, norms. Yeah, of the norm. The norm is also direct sum. Yes, yes. What is the norm? Okay. Norm of phi is supremum phi of k where k runs over all compact subsets inside Inside a Euclidean ball. You fix some Euclidean norm, and no matter which one, topology is going to be equipped. And this norm actually induces topology. And it follows from McMullen's decomposition. The principle you should take balls of any regulus, but from this property, it turns out that it suffices to fix one more fixed regulus. You exclude somehow constant oblations? Constant. Constant, because they don't show up in this theory. Constant is Euler characteristic. And it corresponds to k equals zero. So it's there. Okay, so now I will need one more subspace. Okay, so this space has been studied. This space uh have been studied uh quite uh a lot for many years in convexity. For instance, various uh subclasses of uh subspaces of relations have been classified. There is the famous Hardwiger theorem, which classifies all rotation invariant uh elements from this space. There is um Klein-Schneider's theorem, which characterizes all simple translation of valid relationships. Simple translation of variant variations, and actually, which is very important. It was a breakthrough 25 years ago, almost, and it is used quite a lot in this theory. I realized some years ago that on some dense subspace of variations, so-called smooth variations, there is a canonical product. Product with several interesting non-trivial properties, and which turned out to be useful for several problems of integral geometry. So some important applications to integral geometry and study of this multiplicative structure. It is in over the last maybe 15 years. Last maybe 15 years obtained by a few people like Bernik Fu, five Mansellanus, one art. And so I will denote by val infinity as a subspace of smooth variations. Let me not define what is Not define what is smooth variation in full generality, it is not really important for the rest of the talk. But what is important to know about this space is that, first of all, it is dense. And second, there are many geometrically interesting examples of smooth variations. For example, mixed volumes with bodies with smooth, strictly convex boundary. And on this space, And on this space there is a multiplicative structure, and I will formulate the following result, two results, which I will try to generalize, which I will generalize to new setting. So, first theorem, shape of Monte Cosmo. First part. There exists. Ah, one more remark, excuse me. So this space carries Carries a fresher topology, also canonical, but which is stronger, the topology induced from here. I will not define it precisely, but it becomes a fresh air space, already not above X space, and a product is going to be continuous with respect to the standard topology. Okay, so there is this continuous bilinear map. Comproduct value infinity times val infinity to y infinity, which makes this space bar infinity a commutative associative algebra. Algebra with a unit. When the unit is a unit in this algebra, second property. MacMullian's decomposition gives a gradient in this algebra. Y infinity is graded. Only val i times val j is contained in val i plus j. So degrees of the homogeneities are added up. And the third property is infinite-dimensional version of Poincar√© duality. For any i between zero and m, Between 0 and n, n is the dimension of the vector space. Let us consider the following bilinear map: val i times val n minus i. We take here complementary degree of homogeneity. Product, this map is just product, while M which is by this half figure C. By this Hartweger theorem is one-dimensional. So, this map, this bilinear map, is a perfect pairing pairing. Which means for any phi I homogeneous variation, which is not zero, there exists psi which is ten minus i homogeneous. N minus i homogeneous such that phi times psi is in zero. Property two, what is i plus j when i plus j is greater than n? It vanishes this space. Zero. Such product is zero. Okay, so I don't describe again explicitly the product due to lack of time. But let me this property I will indicate how it works works in even case and complex situations. And one more property which I would like to generalise. I would like to generalize. So, the following theorem with which the credit goes to Bernick, Brocker, and means combination of several results. For any i less than n over 2, the map From val I infinity to val n minus i infinity given by phi goose to phi times product. This is a product in sense of valuation, in sense of previous theorem. First intrinsic volume to the power n minus 2i. Minus 2i. So the claim is that this map given by product by appropriate power of first intrinsic volume is a Xamorphism. Okay. In fact, uh the proof of this, the only known proof of this theorem is embarrassingly complicated, but uh most of complications Most of the complications are in odd case or odd valuations, but also in even case it is not trivial as well. Okay, so even valuations form a subalgebra in all smooth valuations. And now I would like to give a little bit more details about even valuations and because Because they are directly relevant for generalizations to other situations. Okay, so we have, so there is a useful method, general method, to construct even valuations using so-called Crofton measures on Grassmania. In other words, consider the space of smooth functions on k dimensions. Smooth functions on k-dimensional Grassmannian for any such smooth function, and we fix Euclidean nuclei, Euclidean space. It is not necessary, moreover, unnecessary, but simplifies the notation. We have Crofton operator which is a map to smooth, k homogeneous, even Even valuations. And this Crofton operator is as follows. If you have a smooth function on the Grassmy end, then Crofton operator of this function is going to be evaluation whose value on convex body k is equal to integral over the Grassmannian F of E volume on k dimensional. K-dimensional volume of orthogonal projection to E of body K dA with respect to Charmiaga. So indeed it is K homogeneous with this integral, this K homogeneous even valuation and it was shown by Joseph Bernstein and me that this matters on top. This matters on top. Every smooth, even valuation can be obtained by some Crofton measure. But this map has a big kernel in general. For k different from greater than, strictly greater than 1 and strictly less than n minus 1, there is an infinite dimensional kernel. Furthermore, Furthermore, we have another okay we have client map again to functions smooth functions on Grassmannion k-dimensional Grassmannion so the client map is as follows if you have evaluation phi that for any we can restrict it on k dimension K-dimensional subspace. Okay, let's take it F. By Headwiger's theorem, so as k homogeneous variation on k-dimensional space, by Headwiger's theorem, it is multiple of volume on F. It is multiple of volume and the coefficient is called Klein map of V evaluated at F. Variated at F, at subspace F. Okay, so we have thus we get map from p1 variations to functions on the Grassmannian and the important result of Klein that this map is injective. It's really a very important result. Okay, so and now I would like to consider this picture. Like to consider this picture without somehow. Okay, so what is the composition of this map? Crofton map and Klein map. It turns out, it is easy computation that the composed map is the so-called cassine transform of the k-dimensional Grass mark. With a k-dimensional Grassmannium. It is again something well known in convexity, in actual geometry, and in fact in representation theory in different language. And hence, image of Klein map coincides, because this map is old, coincides with the image of the Cassine transform. And it gives a way. It gives a way to think about to identify valuations, even valuations, with the image of the Cassine transform. But the point is that the Cassine transform can be considered independently of relation theory. And this is exactly the observation which I'm going to use in the complex situation. Because if we think of If we think of evaluations as image of Gassine transforms, some functions of the Grassmannian, then you don't for some properties you don't need this geometric interpretation of this space. And in particular, one can try to imitate multiplicative structure and some of these properties. Um okay, and uh now um how much five more minutes five okay seven more minutes and now uh let W be a complex space Of diminution L of complex dimension L. Then we consider Cassine transform on complex Grassmannian of k-dimensional subspaces of W. This is complex Cassan transform. And we define this complex version of valuations, k-homogeneous valuations, smooth, if you wish, I don't know. And even. Also, it doesn't make, just to emphasize the analogy. This image of this Caucasian transform And complex version of even variations. This just direct sum from k from 0 to n of this k homogeneous intervals. Okay, so this space one can define a version of multiplicative. A version of multiplicative structure, which analogous to the real situation. If we replace valuations, think about valuations in the real case as range of the Cassine transform. You can translate the construct one of the constructions of product, but one of them can be translated to this language. It can be generalized to the topic of the language. To this space. So if we get a commutative, exactly the same properties you have. So this theorem works for this algebra. You have commutative associative algebra. It is unit. It is graded and satisfies point correctuality. Regarding, also, it satisfies a version of this what is called. A version of this, what is called Hart-Leipschutz-type theorem, this one, where the version of first intrinsic volume is just unitarily invariant function on the Grassmannian. There is only one such function, up to proportionality. This is like a cl uh image under Klein map of intrinsic volume are invariant functions on real Grassmann under Zorthobian growth. Resort of the model. Similarly, we consider unitary group and first intrinsic unit as invariant function on one-dimensional complex Grass Manuel. And we have this problem. And just one more last sentence, that to prove, say, this theorem, proof of this theorem induces to study of, of course, Cassandra transform on Grass-Mannion and Radon transform on Grass-Magnion. And Radon transform And Radon transform uh one uses that Radon transform between uh Grassmannians of complementary dimension is um isomorphism. Okay, and uh actually okay this is what I wanted to say about the complex case, which was the main one. In fact, this construction can be generalized even a little bit further for a non-Archimedean log. Non-Rachimedian local fields and you can get algebra fields, non-trivial properties, also for more general fields, Nichimedian fields. All these properties you have, and the proof is based again on Radon and Cassine transform on over such more other fields, locally compact. Okay, let me stop. Questions? So this mapping there, this is, I guess, it's not an isometry. Isometry? Yes. No. No, it's not an isometry. Do you have any, I mean for these spaces, do you have something like basis? Basis? Yes. Uh I don't know. Uh Um I I have never uh seen it. No questions? Let's thank the speaker again. We will start in six minutes. You said he's named because it's different.
