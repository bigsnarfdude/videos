Okay, so thank you, Martin, for being with us from your kitchen in London, speaking on Sherlin's conjecture on binary groups. Okay, thank you very much. So let's see if this works. Here we go. I've got all sorts of stuff off across the top of my screen. Right. Okay, so as I've written here, As I've written here, a binary group is a type of permutation group with a property motivated by the study of model theory and relational structures in model theory. It's a definition introduced by Gregory Cherlin in the 1990s. And let me tell you the definition and then I'll show you some examples and we'll move on from there. So here's the definition of a binary permutation. Of a binary permutation group. So we take a permutation group G on a set omega and an integer r at least two. And we say that the two arguables, omega and delta, are two equivalent. So I'll write twiddles two. If I can map any pair from omega, omega i, omega j, to the corresponding Omega i, omega j to the corresponding pair in delta by an element of g. Okay, so that's some kind of funny two-equivalence relation on R tuples. And then Sherlin's definition of a binary group is this, that G is binary if for every R, at least two, and for all R tuples omega and delta, equivalence implies that omega and delta are in the same orbit. Delta in the same orbit. So somehow the action on pairs is heavily influencing the action on R tuples for all R. So it's a kind of funny sort of definition. As I said, it's motivated by Churlin's work in model theory. And I'll explain the connection a bit later. Naturally enough, there's a more general definition of replacing this two by Replacing this two by an arbitrary positive integer k, and it's just the same definition with a g has complexity k, relational complexity k, if for all r tuples, or at least k, k equivalence of r tuples implies that those r tuples are in the same orbit, right? K equivalence is just the same as 2 equivalent with 2 replaced by k. So we can map any k subtuple. K subtuple in omega to the corresponding k subtuple in delta and k is the minimal such positive integer. So there's a reminder of the definitions and the first thing to do is to look at some examples to get our heads around these definitions. So the very first example is kind of a trivial one. So we just take the natural action of the symmetric group, Sn. Group Sn you can see it's binary, and there's a tiny point to note here that you, you know, if we just had one equivalence, if we had a one instead of a two, it wouldn't work because I could have omega ri equaling omega j, but delta ri not equaling delta j. I need the two equivalents to assume to show that if omega has two equal coordinates, then delta has equal coordinates in the same space. In the same spot, which is needed to get them in the same SN orbit. Well, you might think the alternating group is also going to be binary. Why on earth not? Well, it's not. It's far from binary. It's as far away from being binary as possible. And here's just a moment's thought. I'll show you why. So, if you take the alternating group, here's a couple of n-tupals, one up to n, and then I just swap. To n, and then I just swap one and two. So these are two equivalent under the action of a n, because I can obviously map any pair of symbols on the left-hand side to the corresponding pair on the right-hand side by an even permutation. But obviously, I can't map the n pupils to each other under by an even permutation. In fact, the same if I replace this two equivalents by n. Two equivalents by n minus two, the same would still hold. So a n has complexity bigger than n minus two. In fact, it has complexity, the maximum possible, which is n minus one. So that's that's kind of a nice thing. Groups are at the opposite ends of this spectrum. What next? So an observation which I'll mention again later is that this is the same kind of consideration tells you any transitive group is not going to be binary as long as it's not the top symmetric group, simply because I can write down a couple of n pupils that are not in the same orbit of g but they're certainly going to be two equivalent because we have a two transitive group so So there we are. Among all the two transitive groups, only the full symmetric group is binary. So I guess the next simplest actions to look at are the action of a symmetric group on pairs, unordered pairs of points. Easily, you can easily see this is not binary, because here's a couple of three-tuples, which are obviously which... Three tuples, which are two equivalent under the action of the symmetric group, but obviously not in the same orbit. And this is complexity three, this action. Interestingly, if we change from unordered pairs to ordered pairs, we do get a binary group. So if we take Sn acting on ordered pairs of distinct elements of our set of size n. Simple little argument shows you that you get a binary group. Okay, so it's sort of a delicate little definition here. You can slightly change the group and it'll go from being binary to non-binary or vice versa. And you can slightly change the action. The same result. Here's a big family of binary groups, just the regular. Binary groups, just the regular permutation groups, so transitive groups where a point stabilizer is trivial. They're all binary, and here's the reason. So, suppose we have a two equivalent couple of R tuples, omega and delta, then by two equivalents I can map omega one omega i to delta one delta i. And the point is, since there's a unique, since the unique unique unique A unique since the group is regular, there's a unique G mapping omega one to delta one. So the same G is going to have to work for all these pairs. And so that means G will have to send omega to delta. So they'll be in the same orbit. Okay, so we have a whole class of binary groups there. Right, so now we have another class of binary groups, the The imprimitive wreath product of the metric group. So SK wreaths SM preserving a set of a partition of the binary condition just tells you that two points in omega are in the same block if and only if the corresponding points in delta are in the same block. And of course, that's exactly what you needed for omega and. For omega and delta to be in the same orbit of the wreath product. In fact, I thought I'd mention here that there's a whole class of groups called generalized wreath products, which are, I won't go into the definition, but this was introduced nearly 40 years ago by Rosemary Bailey, Cheryl Prager, Chris Rowley, and Terry Speed. And these are all And these are all, this is a very nice family of groups which are also binary, as Rosemary told me last time I gave a talk on this topic. Right, so the final example, set of examples, I'll give an affine group. There's a family of, a couple of families of binary affine groups. So here we take V. So here we take V, a vector space, semi-direct product of V with the orthogonal group on V. And here we insist that V is an anisotropic orthogonal space, which means to say that there's a quadratic form on V and only the zero vector has the quadratic form evaluate to zero. And then we take the corresponding affine group where V acts on itself by translations, and the orthogonal group is the stabilizer of the zero vector. It's the usual thing. So I claim that these are affine groups. It's basically, and this would apply whether V is finite or infinite. It's basically an application of Fitt's lemma. So I think I've got a proof. I think I've got a proof. Yes, here we are. So here's the proof. So take a couple of, I guess, R plus one pupils here, and we may as well start with the zero vector. Assume they're two equivalent. So I can map zero UI to zero Vi for all I, and that implies that the quadratic implies that the quadratic form q of q of u i is q of v i and then since I can send ui u j to v i v j that easily implies that the bilinear form of q agrees between u i u j and v i v j so we're in prime place to apply Witt's lemma but we do need to apply Witt's lemma we need the dimensions of these the spans The dimensions of these spans of the UIs and the VI's to be the same, and that's where the anisotropic condition needs to be used. If Q was not anisotropic, then you could map it, for example, a triple of vectors spanning a two-dimensional space to a triple spanning a one-dimensional space. Equivalent triple, equivalent triples with that property. Anyway. With that property. Anyway, so we get some binary affine groups here. In fact, as we'll see, these are in the finite case, these are all the affine groups that are binary. And so, of course, in the finite case, we only have one-dimensional and two-dimensional and isotropic spaces. In the one-dimensional case, we get an example with a FQ, one-dimensional space extended by the. Space extended by the orthogonal group, which is just generated by minus one. And in the two-dimensional case, we have FQ squared extended by the O2 of minus type. Okay, so I think that's all the examples for the time being. You'll notice that rather few of these examples are primitive. The affine groups are primitive. Let's go. Affine groups are primitive. Let's go back. Examples four are imprimitive, then we have the regular groups. They're imprimitive. In fact, I'm about to list the primitive examples. This is Churlin's conjecture, going back to a paper he wrote in 2000, that there are hardly any primitive binary groups. In fact, we just get the very first examples, the full symmetric group. We have these regular groups, regular primitive. Regular groups, regular primitive groups are just cyclic of prime order, and then these affine anisotropic orthogonal groups. And Chirlin conjectured, I guess he made his conjecture quite a bit before 2000 because this was written in a survey paper published in 2000. He conjectured that this is everything. And at the time, And at the time, as far as I can see, there was basically no literature that gave any evidence for this conjecture. I think his conjecture was based on lots of computation. As I'll mention a bit later, the topic, there are some very powerful computational methods for studying binary groups of quite large. Binary groups of quite large degrees, and I think Sherlin did lots of computations and then made this rather bold conjecture based just on computational evidence. And quite a few people over the years have worked on this conjecture. It's a very attractive conjecture to me. It's kind of a very It's kind of a very simple property of this binary property. Why should there be so few primitive binary groups? Well, it turns out that there are, this is it. Perhaps a bit disappointing, but anyway, following all this work by quite a few people, we've managed to finish the proof of Churlin's conjecture. Finished the proof of Churlin's conjecture earlier this year. And this is Nick Gill, me, and Pablo Spieger. Okay, so I'm going to talk a little bit about some ideas in the proof a bit later, but as I promised, I want to explain the motivation behind Chirlin's definition of a binary group and his theory of complexity. It's a sort of It's a sort of nice and it's an attractive kind of theory, which is quite easy to explain. So let me just have a digression on Chirlin's theory of relational structures in model theory and its link with these binary groups. Okay, so a relational structure is just to set. Set with some relations. And these Ri's, these relations just subsets of omega to the Li, the various Li's greater than or equal to two. And the type of the structure is the maximum value of these Li's. And naturally enough, if these types are all equal, if type is two, so in other words, all the Li's. Two, so in other words, all the LIs that are equal to two, then we call our binary relational structure. So, for example, if we just have one relation, then it's just a bunch of pairs, ordered pairs, and we just have a directed graph. And in general, if we have an arbitrary k, then we can think of our relational structure as a directed graph, well, as a graph. Well, as a graph with colours for the edges, directed edges. Each of these RIs represents the colour. So that's all a binary relational structure is. It's an edge-colored directed graph. Okay, so we want to bring groups into the picture. We do this in the usual way. So an automorphism of our relational structure is Of our relational structure is just going to be a permutation of the set omega which preserves the relations, and so of course we get an automorphism group. And I want to introduce the concept of a homogeneous relational structure. So for this, I need to tell you what is a substructure. So if you have a subset of omega, you get a substructure, which I'll You get a substructure, which I'll call R gamma, just by intersecting everything with gamma. So the relations of R gamma are just the relations of Ri intersected with gamma to the Li. And we call R a homogeneous relational structure if whenever you have two substructures which are isomorphic, then every isomorphism Then every isomorphism between them extends to an automorphism of R. Quite a kind of familiar sort of definition in this kind of combinatorics. So for example, let's go back to the case where we have a directed graph. So a homogeneous directed graph, that means any isomorphism between subgraphs extends to an automorphism of the whole graph. Extends to an automorphism of the whole graph. So these have been completely classified, these homogeneous graphs and directed graphs. Let me tell you the result on the undirected graphs. So this goes right back to Tony Gardner in 1976, and there's hardly any homogeneous graphs. There's the Pentagon. Well, you may want. Again, well, you may want so just a moment's thought tells you, tells you that that's going to be the only homogeneous polygon. Because if I take, say, anything bigger than a pentagon, then you'll have two types of pairs of non-adjacent points, right? There's a pair which are distance two apart and a pair which are distance three apart. Obviously, I can map any such pair to any such other pair. To any such other pair by an isomorphism of substructures, but that won't extend to an automorphism of the graph. So only the pentagon works. Then we can take the three by three grid where each row and column forms a complete forms a triangle. And I could take disjoint copies of the complete graph. Joint copies of the complete graph. Easy to see that, homogeneous, and then complements of these. And that's it. That's Gardner's list. So very few homogeneous graphs exist. When you look at directed graphs, there are actually quite a few infinite families. I won't go into those. These were classified by Alistair Lachlan and And then 1982. Rather lovely piece of work. Okay, so the homogeneous binary relational structures with only one relation are under control. They are classified. If we ask for homogeneous binary relational structures or edge coloured directed graphs in Directed graphs in general. Well, there are many more examples. And I've got a beautiful picture which I spent many hours drawing. Look at that. So here, as I said, the hexagon is not homogeneous for obvious reasons. But if I add another colour, a blue triangle there, that is homogeneous. Okay, the kind of Kind of you can see that it's going to be homogeneous. So there are many more examples of homogeneous edge coloured graphs. In fact, I'm not quite sure why I've said this, but unlike the case of one relation where Lachlan produced this quite complicated classification, it Quite complicated classification. It seems it's hardly conceivable where to start classifying all the homogeneous diagraphs with many colours. Doesn't mean it's impossible. It just means I can't see how to do it. Right. So there's a lot of stuff in model theory on homogeneous relational structures. Structures. Admittedly, not. Most of it is for infinite structures rather than these finite structures. But anyway, this is Churlin's area of interest, which motivated his definition of these lovely binary groups. And here's the fact that links the binary groups with these structures. Pretty basic fact, easy to prove. Basic fact, easy to prove that if you have a permutation group with complexity k so remember that means any two R tuples that are K equivalent must be in the same orbit of G. That's the same as having G being the automorphism group of a relational structure, which is homogeneous with underlying septomic, again, the set the same area of total. Area of type K. I mean, the relations are all on Li tuples where Li is the maximum of the Li is K. And in particular, we recover our connection with binary groups that we have a G is a binary permutation group if and only if it's the automorphic group of a binary homogeneous structure or alternatively of a Alternatively of a homogeneous edge-colored digraph. So that's where Cholin's definition came from. So let's go back to the group theory. This is Churnin's conjecture that we have only these three classes of binary primitive groups. And as I said, this is now a theorem. Let's briefly. Let's briefly go back to the binary homogeneous structures and see what this means for the classification of at least the primitive binary homogeneous structures. There are hardly any of them, as this theorem shows. What are they going to be? So, corresponding to the symmetric group, we'll just, of course, have the complete graph. A very boring example. A very boring example of a binary homogeneous structure. For the cyclic group of order P, we're just going to get like a P cycle with some colours added. So there are quite a lot of ways of making a homogeneous structure by adding colours. You don't have to add all possible colours, but anyway, it's a coloured piece cycle, whatever that means. And then for the And then for the affine examples with the anisotropic orthogonal spaces, we make colors from the orbit on pairs. And these are just the orbit on pairs VW, where Q of V minus W is some fixed scalar lambda. Okay, so these are the primitive binary homogeneous structures as a consequence of Cholin's. A consequence of Chirlin's conjecture. Okay, so now I think I'm going to, oh no, here's some remark that. So this primitivity assumption is very restrictive. It basically kills off almost all the homogeneous structures. And it would be very nice to drop the primitivity assumption in Chinese conjecture. Conjecture and pick up a lot more examples. As I said before, I don't see how on earth to even get a conjecture on the structure of general binary permutation groups, but maybe one could put some nice natural con. Oh, sorry. Oh no. Sorry about that. But maybe there's some interesting class of imprimitive binary groups one could study. Anyway, that seems like an interesting development from the primitive case. So yes, so now I'm just going to offer some remarks on the proof of Chirling's conjecture. Of Cholin's conjecture, which will give you some insight into why there are hardly any binary primitive groups. Okay, so for many decades, the standard way to analyze properties of primitive groups is to try and use the Onan-Scott kind of reduction theorem to get down to affine. Affine groups, an almost simple group. And in this case, that was done by Joshua Witcoms, 2016. And it's not at all easy. It's a very lovely, quite short, but very nice paper full of ideas of Joshua from 2016. Anyway, so we reduced to the affine and almost simple case, and then I mentioned I mentioned in the affine case, we just get these anisotropic orthogonal groups. That's another pretty difficult paper. This was done by Sherlin himself, also in 2016. So we're in the happy situation of being in the almost simple case, and here we have to prove that there's almost no groups. The only almost simple. Almost simple primitive binary group should be just the full symmetric group. So basically, we have to prove that every primitive group is non-binary, or primitive almost simple group is not binary. So how do we do that? So I'm just going to show you three methods from the proof, three very different types of methods. And I'm starting off with kind of the oldest. With kind of the oldest methods. As I mentioned, this was Kerlin's original conjecture, it was kind of based on lots and lots of computation. You have to be a little bit careful, a little bit clever about doing computation here because you're looking at R pupils. And even if you have a permutation group on GAP or MAG. Group on GAP or magma or whatever of kind of reasonable degree of million or I don't know. Some reasonable number which GAP likes. And then the moment you start looking at R tuples, that number becomes not good, too big. So you can't afford to be too naive in your computation. But there is actually a very effective method. Actually, a very effective method for dealing with quite a lot of small groups using characters. I'll show you that method, one among quite a few different methods of computation. So it's based on this very simple observation here, that if we let TR be the number of orbits of our permutation group gene on omnipoles at distinct points. Points. Then, well, not to, of course, the binary condition here tells you that kind of the orbit con pair restricts orbits on R tuples for all R. Just a very vague statement, which can be made quite precise in this inequality here. The number of orbits on R tuples. R pupils is less than or equal to the number of orbits on pairs to the power r minus one over two. Of course, that's just the number of ways you can choose two spots in your R tuple. So as you can imagine, this is a pretty easy thing to prove. Is this useful? Well, in fact, it is. Yes. It turns out that this inequality gives you faith. Fails for lots of primitive groups. Well, first of all, how do we describe the theory? Well, of course, if we know the permutation character of our group, then we can easily work out the number of orbits on our tubes just by taking the signal in the product. Well, you may say, well, I've got some massive action of the monster. I've no idea what the permutation character is, but we know the character thing. We know the character table. If we know the character table of the group, we can simply say, well, I don't care what the permutation character is. Let's see, let's just compute all the possible ways of putting together irreducible characters to make something that has the properties of a permutation character, right? Takes non-negative integer values on all classes. And then we find that this inequality is violated. Violated very, very frequently. In fact, if one wants to rule out sporadic groups, this rules out almost all actions of sporadic groups. Not all of them by any means, but very many actions of sporadic groups. This was done by Nick, Gil and Pablo in a previous. Another in a previous paper. So, there's computation quite an effective tool for dealing with small groups. And, of course, as we all know, who work in finite group theory nowadays, it's very, very handy to be able to get rid of lots of small cases to avoid getting other things. Good idea. So, the second method is the method invented by Nick and Pablo. Nick and Pablo, the method of beautiful sets. And if you haven't seen this method before, it really is a beautiful method. So let me tell you what a beautiful set is. Well, first of all, a beautiful set is the definition is based on this lemma here. It's a very simple lemma. What does it say? So suppose we have a permutation group G on delta. G on delta no assumptions at the moment and suppose we have a subset of delta such that the group induced by G on that subset well say the order of that subset is not the full symmetric group then it's kind of similar observation to the one I made along right at the beginning we don't the group is the whole group is not binary and the Group is not binary, and the proof is very simple. That since we're assuming we have a T-transitive group that's not a symmetric group on delta, there'll be a couple of T-pupils, where T is the size of delta, which are not in the same orbit. The T-transitivity implies that they are two equivalent, and so if we assume G is binary, they'll be in the same. Is binary, they'll be in the same orbit of g, but they're not in the same orbit of g because they're not in the same orbit of g delta. And delta one up to delta t is the set delta. Okay, so if we can find like a two-transitive set like this, we're happy. The group is not binary. And such a set, delta, on which we induce. Delta on which we induce a two-transitive group, which is not the whole of the symmetric group, was called beautiful by Naked and Pablo. Well, that's all very well, but if we take, we're interested in these primitive, almost simple groups, there's a whole lot of them, do we expect there to be these beautiful tests? Can you somehow find two transitive sockets for an arbitrary primitive? For an arbitrary primitive, although simple group? Well, in fact, you can. This is their great insight. And in fact, when they did, they wrote a paper on the alternating case of Sherlin's conjecture, and they showed that for almost all actions of alternating groups, these beautiful sets exist. It's quite amazing until you see their proof, and then you say, Well, of course, it's obvious. So, all actions of alternating groups have these beautiful cutsets, apart from, of course, the natural action, the action on pairs, and then the two other very explicit families of actions which don't have them. So they deduced terminals detected by this lovely proof for the alternating groups. So Groups. So we would like to copy their idea for groups of lead type. And while their proof for alternating groups was very specific, it used kind of cycles and all sorts of combinatorial ideas specific to symmetric and alternating groups. But here's a way of Working in groups of leaders producing beautiful sets in the case where the point stabilizer has a nice big special linear subgroup. So here's a lemma, a very simple lemma, that if we had a prototype of the type, and suppose a point stable eta G alpha has an SLR Q subgroup, which happens to be contained in a happens to be contained in a SLR plus one which is not contained in the point stabilizer so if the point stabilizer is a something like a parabolic subgroup of a group of lead type is over the field of Q elements then you can imagine such subgroups will exist well in in this situation we produce at least a two transitive subgroup with an affine group With an affine group acting on it. And the proof is very simple. Yeah, I've still got a few minutes. So the proof is simply to take, there'll be a parabolic somewhere between A and B. Okay, the Q to the R times SLRQ. And we can choose this parabolic not to lie in G alpha, since B doesn't lie in G alpha. And then if we take the And then, if we take the cosets of our FLR, our group A in this parabolic, they will correspond to cosets of G, alpha, and G, and we'll get the affine group induced on that set delta. So it's pretty simple. And often you can choose this. So I think I've got a couple of applications of this method. So as I said, it will apply in cases where the point stabilizer. Apply in cases where the point stabilizer contains an SL subgroup, so parabolic case, for example. So in the case of simplest cases, PSLN acting on K subspaces. So here the point stabilizer is a parabolic, unipotent radical extended byproduct of SLK and SLN minus K. And we can obviously choose our A to be the bigger of the two N. The bigger of the two SLs, SLK, let's say, that'll be contained in an SLK plus one inside our group G, which is not in the stabilizer. So we'll get a beautiful subset of cos Q to the K. Easy. And now I wanted to show you my picture expertise here. So here's a lovely E8 extended thinking diagram. I've got, so in this case, I've got, so in this case, my point stabilizer is got by cropping off the blue node, so I get an A1E7 subgroup. That's my point stabilizer, and here I can just take my SL, my group A to be this A6, and my B to be the A7 with the blue node in it. And there we go. And we get two transitive pubsurfaces. Two transitive subsurpes of size Q to the seven, which is easily seen to be a beautiful subset. So, in the case where point stabilizers are big and contain these SL subgroups, this beautiful method applies. But of course, there are lots of actions of groups of lead type where you don't have a great big point stabilizer. So, you need another method. So, I'm just going to tell you about the method here, which I call stabilizer actions. And this is based on yet another very simple method. If we've got our point stabilizer, and suppose we can somehow find an orbit of the point stabilizer, which is non-binary for the action of the stabilizer, then the whole group will be non-binary. And the proof is another one-line proof. Another one-line proof that what is it? So if we had when we were in delta equivalent articles in one of these orbits of G alpha, but not in the same, so I'm assuming G alpha is non-binary, so we'll be able to find such an omega and delta, which are not equivalent under G alpha. Then if we add alpha in front of both of them, we'll still have two equivalent. We'll still have two equivalent tuples and they won't be equivalent under the action of G. So G will be non-parametric. Okay, so here's an application and what I've called a C9 case. So C9, as I'm sure all of you know, refers to the case where we have a traffic group of Leep type and the point stabilizer is in the family the point stabilizer is in the family which we call C9. So that's almost simple groups in an irreducible action on the module, on the natural module for the classical group. So a whole huge family of subgroups where all you know is it's a simple group in an irreducible representation. You know nothing more. So I just a case where the point stabilizes an alternating group inside PS. Alternating group inside PSLN, just to illustrate. So I want to somehow show you we can build a non-binary orbit of G alpha in this situation, no matter what the representation is. It's based on a... Okay, so there's the A. We try and find a non-binary orbit, and of course it will be the orbit of G alpha or the alternating group on the coset of an intersection of two conjugates. Of an intersection of two conjugates in the big group G. So, how can we find a nice action of the alternating group on an orbit? And it's a very simple idea. We take a three cycle in our alternating group, so that will correspond to a matrix of order three in our group G. Let's make some functions so that this is a diagonal matrix where omega is the cube root of unity. Moment goes the cube root of unity. So I guess I'm assuming cube is three here. So our three cycle maps to a diagonal matrix of order three with A omega and B omega inverted and C1. Then the centralizer in our classical group of this element X will be basically GLA cross GLB cross GLC. Cross GLC and that will have a central torus, right? If I just take a scalar multiple of the identity, the IA, and another scalar multiple of IB, and a scalar multiple of IC. They will, all those diagonal matrices will form a torus which is central in this centralizer here. And unless Q is very small, Q is very small, this central torus T will not be the element of order 3. Okay, that torus there I just described will be of order bigger than 3. So I can pick an element in the torus which is not the power of X. Then that element little t has centralizes, and it's central in CGX, so it centralizes. is x cross a k minus 3, the centralizer of x. And so in my intersection, I produced a pair of conjugates of my alternating group which contain, whose intersection contains this three cross all k minus three. And so this this orbit, so now I get an orbit of G alpha on the project. On the subject of the top containing three cross k minus three, that's pretty much the alternating group acting on three sets. It's a very concrete action where we can easily prove that this action is non-binary. And hence from our lemma, we deduce that the whole group is non-binary. So that's the third method. Okay, do I have anything else? No, that seems to be yeah. So that seems to be yeah. So thanks very much, Costa.
