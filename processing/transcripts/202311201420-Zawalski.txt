uh certain characterization of uh uh complex bodies of of revolution. Uh I will start with uh some historical background and the origins of the problem because it's it's just a theory, not the whole theory with its history. Of course I will have to state some definitions and basic concepts. For most of the time, however, we'll focus on bodies of revolution in R3, which is something we can Which is something we can already imagine and work with it geometrically. The theorem I will outline works, is general and works in arbitrary dimension, so as not to overshadow the main idea of the proof with some technicalities, we'll focus today on R4. And of course, after investigating certain properties of bodies of revolution in R3, we'll proceed. Of revolution and are free, we'll proceed to the proof of the theory. Okay, so the whole story begins with the celebrated conjecture of Stefan Banner, who asked the following. Okay, suppose that we have a symmetric convex body in RN such that every two its co-dimension one planar sections passing through the origin are affinely equivalent. So we have so we have a convex body, okay? So we have a convex body K which is symmetric and every two tan are sections passing through the original affine equivalent, meaning that there exists an affine map between the hyperplanes of those sections, such that one section is mapped to the other section. Okay, so this means and for every pair of sections we have such a map. Of course, for example, if k is an ellipsoid, If k is an ellipsoid, that it enjoys this property, yes, because every section of an ellipsoid is an ellipsoid, and every two ellipsoids are finitely popular. Yes? And Banach conjectured that ellipsoid is the only convex body that enjoys this property. It was in 1935 and the same year Albert Bachmaso and Dulam proved the conjecture in R3. They used a very smart topological trick. topological trick because they they suppose that the the section of of k is not an ellipse then it uh then it admits some distinguished point because ellipse in in this affine setting is perfectly round every point is is that the points on the ellipse are indistinguishable yes but if if the section is not an ellipse then it admits at least one distinguished point and using One distinguished point, and using all this structure of affine maps on the sections, we are able to construct a non-vanishing vector field on the unisphere S2, which we know that cannot exist. And their argument was vastly generalized by Gronov in sixty seven, who proved the conjecture uh for odd uh for every odd dimension. For every odd dimension. But again, he used the same topological fact that there is no non-vanishing vector field on the unit sphere in odd-dimensional Euclidean space. And basically since Gromov, there were no contributions to this problem. And people already knew that proving the conjecture Proving the conjecture in any even dimension will be a real breakthrough, yes, because we cannot use this topological fact. And very recently, I mean last year, Bor Hern√°ndez La Moneda, Jimenez de Santiago and Montejano Painberg proved the conjecture for all dimensions of the form 4k plus 2, with one possible exception. With one possible exception, doesn't matter. So this was a real breakthrough, indeed. But they somehow managed to divide the dimension by two. So this is exactly two times odd number, and this odd number is exactly what is needed to apply this topological. So uh so uh okay, they they they they proved they proved the conjecture in in in those uh even dimensions. Those even dimensions. And along the pro is summary in the proof, they managed to show that under assumptions of the conjecture, this convex body K has the property that every section of K must be a body of revolution. So once they knew this, they were able to finish their proof of Banach's conjecture, but they found the question itself interesting. So they asked in in the in the in the this very paper. In this very paper, they ask the following question. Okay, so let us forget about this Pana setting and suppose that we have a convex body such that every codimension one section passing through the origin is a body of revolution. Does this mean that the body itself must be a body of revolution? So that was the original question. Original question, it is not hard to see that the reverse implication is true, meaning that if we have a body of revolution, then it's every section of potentially one is again a body of revolution. So this implication is more or less easy. So they asked about the reverse implication so that this may become a characterization of bodies of revolution. Revolution. So that is what they ask. I'm missing something, sorry. If you consider like a cylinder, a home cylinder, you can have a section that's a reach then value. Yes, so that is why we have this n bigger or equal than 4. And this is crucial because in our free, being able, okay, when we don't want to get into details because I don't have time, if I have time at the end, or we can talk about. At the end, or we can talk about after the talk, I can show. But this assumption then n is bigger or equal than 4 is crucial, exactly because of what you see. So, this is what they ask, and that is what we will prove. So, this is more or less the answer to their question. But we assume that the boundary of K is sufficiently smooth. Is sufficiently smooth, meaning called class C3. And this is because our approach was completely different from what they did, because what I told you was all these approaches were global. I mean, they consider a section, a group acting on this section, and somehow they analyze how those groups acting on different sections go together and interplay, and what does it mean? Interplay and what does it mean about the global geometry of the convex body? Here we will do something completely different because we will look at an infinitesimally small cup of our convex body, we will look how the group acts on this infinitesimally small cap, and then we will check what does it mean when it comes to serious expansion, and then somehow from this series. And then, somehow, from this series expansion, we'll be able to infer something again about the global geometry of the picture. Okay, so what do we mean by body of revolution? If we are in an R3, then we already know what is a body of revolution. So, this is this base-shaped thing. We have axis of revolution and we have a convex body which is invariant under rotations along the axis. In other words, we have a convex body which is invariant under action of the orthogonal group. So if we are in R3, then Are in R3, then it is invariant under action of orthogonal group O2. And generally, in Rn, it must be invariant under O n minus 1. And this means to be the body of revolution. But our problem will be affine invariant, and we'll consider bodies of affine revolution, which simply means that the body of affine revolution is an affine image of a body of revolution, or it is, or in other words, Or it is or in other words, it is a complex body which is invariant under action of oh not under action of the the orthogonal group, but a group that is affinely conjugated to the orthogonal group. So still we have action of some group which is isomorphic to this, but the matrices are not no longer orthogonal. Okay, and if we additionally assume that k is symmetric, which we do, then of course Which we do, then of course the center of symmetry must be a fixed point of n symmetry, and in particular the axis of revolution must pass through this center of symmetry. Okay, because our problem is a finding invariant, we may choose some convenient coordinate system. So from now on, we'll assume that. Okay, so we pick some point on the surface. We pick some point on the surface, we assume that the tangent space is horizontal, that the origin is directly above our point. Okay, so in this coordinate system, we may represent the surface as a graph of a certain function of class C3, and after additional change of coordinates, we may assume that this function. function, the serious expansion of this function looks like this. So we don't, it vanishes at zero, all the first order terms vanish, and the second order terms is just the canonical quadratic form. So we'll call this the canonical parametrization. And from this we already see that in in the affine setting second order terms are uh completely meaningless, because we can make them any anything we want just by changing the coordinates. We want just by changing the coordinate system. So that doesn't tell us anything about the geometry of the picture. So that is why we need to assume that our surface is of class C3, because if we want to work with Taylor series, we need to use at least third-order terms. So we will call this polynomial, which consists of first-order terms, by the cubic form of F, and we will denote it by Cf. Okay, so if we restrict our canonical parametrization to any plane, then we obtain the canonical parameterization of certain section of the surface that is passing through our point P. And now, because we are in R4, our sections are in R3, so this is a genuine picture. So we have a convex body in R3. Have a convex body in R3, so the surface is two-dimensional, the tangent space is two-dimensional. Here we have the origin, the axis of revolution passing through the origin. Okay, and now we'll consider the very important group, which is the isotropic group of point P. Yes, because we know that this surface, by assumption, We know that this surface, by assumption, is invariant under action of some group affinely conjugated to O two. Yes, so now we consider the subgroup of this group, which consists of those symmetries that keeps this point P fixed. And it turns out that this isotropy group GP is, in our case, it is either O2 or O1. And moreover, in our coordinate system, this isotropic group is no longer affinely conjugated to the orthogonal group, but it is exactly the orthogonal group, meaning that this group consists of orthogonal matrices, which is fairly easy to see. Okay, and now, once we know this, we okay, so So our surface is invariant under this isotropic group GP, and moreover, this group keeps this point P fixed. So in fact, we may define the action of this group on the tangent space. And thus, the tangent space may be viewed as two-dimensional representation of the isotropic group. And if the group is If the group is O1, so this is just a reflection group, then this tangent space admits the composition into the two eigen spaces. I will go back to the picture and show you in a minute. And if the group is O2, then the whole space is irreducible representation. Okay, so once again, if we are here, we know that our, in the first case, when the isotrophic group is just a reflection group, we know that our surface is invariant under reflection with respect to this vertical dashed plane, which contains the axis of revolution. Yes, so of course the tangent space is also invariant under this reflection, and we have this line V on This line V on which this reflection just identity, and we have this line H where this is minus identity. And observe that because the surface is invariant under this reflection, then the third order terms must vanish on this time. That's because basically there's no third-order polynomial which is invariant under x go to minus x. To minus x. And if the group is the whole O2, then the cubic form must vanish identically on the whole plane, not only on the line, but on the whole plane. And this is necessarily the case when our surface is an ellipsoid. Okay, so for now we know that the cubic form must vanish on a certain line, which is basically nothing because every cubic polymer. Every cubic polynomial vanishes on certain homogeneous cubic polynomial of third order vanishes on certain line. This is nothing. But what we know is that line is very strongly connected to the geometry of the picture. And now we will prove something even stronger about the cubic form of the whole surface, namely that the cubic form vanishes on a certain plane. And the proof of this layer. And the proof of this lemma will be the only complete proof I will show you. Okay, so how we do this? So suppose that there exists a section of M passing through the point B that admits more than one axis of revolution, then if a body admits more than one axis If a body admits two uh more than one axis of revolution, then it is an ellipsoid, it is easy to see, so uh so so we know that the cubic form must vanish on the tangent space, on the two-dimensional tangent space to this section, so we are done. So now we may assume that every section admits at most exactly one axis of revolution, and if this axis of revolution passes through P, then again we are done. So we may assume that every section passing through P admits exactly Passing through P admits exactly one axis of revolution, and moreover, this axis of revolution does not pass through P. And knowing this, we are able to construct a non-vanishing vector field on the unit sphere, which cannot exist. And this is the proof of dilemma. Okay, so now we know that our cubic form vanishes on a certain plane, which means that it can be factored as this linear factor without. As this linear factor, without also generally we may suppose that this is x3 times some cubic form, which may be zero, maybe not zero. We don't know yet. And this is already something very strong because a generic polynomial cannot be factored. And now we investigate the zero set of this cubic form, which consists of this plane, X three. This plane X3 and the zero set of this quadric. But okay, in our free, all quadrics are classified, so we may just prove the claim case by case, but we'll see it in the most representative case when the quadratic is just x squared plus y squared minus z squared. So the zero set of this quadrant is simply a column. Yes? Yes, and if we take any plane that is very close to this horizontal plane, passing through the vertex of the cone, then this plane doesn't, the intersection of this plane and this cone is just a single point. And from our previous considerations, we know that the cubic form That the cubic form must vanish on every plane, on a certain line, which is somehow defined by the axis of revolution. And now, if we restrict ourselves to the plane such that the intersection of the plane and the cone is just a single point, we know that the zero line cannot come from this cubic form. So, this must be exactly the intersection of our plane with this. With the zero set of this first linear factor, which already fixes the geometry of the whole picture. So now we show that there exists an open set of planes, such that for every plane in this set, our surface is invariant under action of O1 with the line of reflection, which is perpendicular to the. To the intersection of the plane and the zero set of this first linear factor. And now it may be seen that in fact this we may use some geometric continuity argument to show that this set is, that either this set is the whole, the set of all planes, or the cubic form must vanish. And this And the first case is the most important one because now we will show something about the global geometry of the picture. For now, let us take any point A in this three-dimensional tangent space. So now we know that our surface and also its parametrization is invariant. Is invariant, is invariant under certain inflection. Okay, so we restrict our parametrization to this plane, and we know that the parametrization is invariant under reflection with respect to this line V, which is exactly perpendicular to the intersection of our plane with this horizontal one. So, in this situation, we know that F. we know that F of A is equal to F of A prime. And we may define this point A prime in a global manner because we may say that A prime is the image of the point A in reflection with respect to the plane spanned by this line V and this vertical axis. Vertical axis. Yes, and we may repeat the same argument for point A prime and define a point A double prime, which again satisfies this. And now A double prime is the image of A prime under composition of two reflections with respect to planes that contain the vertical eye. Contain the vertical axis. And the composition of two reflections with respect to two planes is just a rotation by some angle around the axis which is exactly the intersection of those planes. And those two planes, by definition, contain the vertical axis. So A double prime is just the rotation and rotation along along the axis E three of A by some. Of A by some angle. And now, because we were free to take any plane we want to perform this construction, then it follows that this angle alpha here may be completely arbitrary. So it means that the function is constant on the whole circle around this. Around this vertical axis, which basically means that our surface is invariant under action of the group O2 around this vertical axis. So we are almost done because we showed that our surface is invariant under action of O2 and we want to show that it's invariant under action of O3, which is a bigger group. But it follows But uh but but but it's it follows easy from the following dilemma. So I already told you that if a body admits uh two different axes of revolution, then it is an ellipsoid. So a similar thing holds, namely if a body is invariant under two different actions of O and minus two, no three different actions, sorry, if this invariant under three different actions of O and minus two, then it must be invariant. Minus 2, then it must be invariant also under action of O and minus 1. So using this lemma, we are able to show that in fact this case where we are able to construct this group acting on the whole manifold must hold on a nowhere dense subset of our surface. So we cannot have So we cannot have a lot of points, a lot of different actions of O2 on our surface. So basically, recall that one of the claims stated that at every point we have either the first case when we are able to construct the action of this group, or this quadratic form must vanish, which means that also the cubic form. Which means that also the cubic form vanishes. Okay, but it follows that the cubic form must vanish on an uh open dense subset. So again, by continuity it vanishes everywhere. And now we can use the theorem of Maschke-Picke and Berwat, which state basically that in this situation our body is simply an episode. Okay, this is contains some some some quadric and and uh this uh and this concludes this concludes the proof. Okay, so this is uh this is all I wanted to say. Uh how much time do I have? Three minutes. Three minutes. Okay, so so uh no, you you maybe do you have any questions or you Maybe do you have any questions or you want me to elaborate on that? No, thank you. We resume at three twenty. Okay, turn on my internet. Okay, terminal microphone is a little bit more than a million. I think the one position is the optional, but we yeah. I didn't have a chance to talk about this when I was in Kent, but so I was working with two collaborators at one time.
