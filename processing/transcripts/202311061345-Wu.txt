So let me start discussing data correspondence and other parameters. So let me first emphasize what I work on is the so-called global case. This is a joint work with Di Hua Jang. I'm going to introduce some notation first in order to state our main theorem. Now I'm in a global case, f is a number field, and I will introduce a quadratic extension of that. So, our result actually works for all classical groups over F and also the metaplectic group. But I think I should really focus on one of them. Focus on one of them, so I'm going to choose the unitary group. That's why I picked a quadratic field extension. So this is a unitary group, and X here it doesn't really matter whether I use a skew permission or hermition form. Form the situation is completely symmetric. To fix notation, I will get a skew conversion vector space. Maybe let me also say non-degenerate vector space now. I will take a hospital automotive. Hospital automotive representation and a character. So this is an automorphic. So there are several ways of writing it. I'll just write GL1 of AE. Or if you prefer, you can, if you want to make everything is over F, make sure everything is over F, then you can do this restriction of scalars of GO1 of. Of GL1 of AF. Have I introduced what these A's are? So these are adelic rings. Adele rings. So this is Adele ring for F and this one is the Adele ring for E. And I think I will use this more often. So let me give it a shorthand. I'll just call it A. All right, there's extra containers. All right, there's some extra conditions that I need to put on chi, namely conjugate self-due. By which I mean if I apply this Galois conjugate and then I take contragradient. And take punch agradient, that should be chi. Maybe I put C here not non-trivial since I do the correspondence. I will always need an additive character. I think I'll squeeze it in here. Oh, non-trivial non-trivial additive character and I'm pretty sure you're not going to see this anymore. So, with this, I think I can just draw a diagram to tell you what our main theorem is. After stating this, I'll say a bit more about the history of this theorem and The various people who contributed to this in various cases. So I have my pi and my chi, right? So, one thing you can do is to construct an Eisenstein series attached to this data. So, if you are familiar with the setup of Eisenstein series, this is the inducing data that I'm going to use. To use. And if you are not familiar, I will say a bit more later. So, one thing you can do is to construct an Einstein series, and then I look at the rightmost positive poke. And I'm going to call it it as zero. So it pre-oriented due to the condition we put down that chi, this is going to be a real number. And actually, we can show this is a half integer. There's a proposition in our paper that shows that this is a half integer. And another thing we can attach to pi and chi. And chi is the so-called lowest occurrence index in theta correspondence. So we can consider the theta lift to various theta towers, width towers, and we can consider the thing called the lowest occurrence index. And this depends on pipeline. And this depends on pi and chi, of course. Well, of course, it's an integer, non-negative. So I'll just denote it by LO here. So our main theorem is a precise relation between S0 and LO. It's as follows. We know S0 is actually half of dimension. Half of dimension of x over e plus one minus L O so this is the unitary case. Also, since it's not very hard to also put in the result for other groups, let me tell you what needs to be modified. Just change the thing. modified just change the thing here change it to either zero or two where zero corresponds to o looks obvious to me and sp and m p here So I think the original idea originated from Red Van I think O even. Actually, her result, the equality in her result relates a different Eidenstein series. So here our data is chi and pi. Her data is chi composed with determinant of some G L A. So technically, her result is different. Her result is different, and I think our result is more clear-cut because we don't need to enlarge our Einstein series. So, what she proved can be used to show this side of the inequality. Just a remark, she uses a different Einstein series. Of uh attached to this data. So, in our case, A is just one large enough. So, this somewhat, it's somewhat different from our. What it's somewhat different from our result. And later Ginsberg Jean Sujring proved this result for odd orthogonal groups. Groups. I think the result also generalizes the O even case. For the symptomic group, this is work by Jiang and me. And I generalize this later to the metaplectic group case. The unitary group case somehow causes the most trouble. We made some progress. We made some progress in 2016 and then finally I figured out a technical issue and resolved the problem. One application of this result is that we can get a constraint on the other parameter of pi. Probably a very important part of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city. So, next, I think I'm going to explain more what these objects are and sketch the proof of this main theorem. After that, I'll say a bit more on the application on the data, on the A parameter, alpha parameter of pi. So, I think I make it more precise on our Azerstadt series. Later, I will also make use of similar notations to introduce the width power. So, this is just X adjoint with one hyperbolic plane. The sub one means that thing has dimension one. It's just a line. Maybe I also add that these two are in duality to each other, and this hyperbolic plane is orthogonal to X. So I can. So I can consider this parabolic subgroup of u of x1 that stabilizes L1 minus and I'm going to call it Q1 Let me also specify the levy decomposition. The M1 is standard, and I haven't decided what to call the unit for the part. Okay, and one. So this levy part just looks like this. Maybe you use a basis. So this part. This part restriction of scalars GL1 times ux. So I'm going to put my representation pi here and put my character chi here and I can shift it, twist it to some power here. So I'm going to take a section. I'm using notation from McLean Watspruges book. So this is just like. So, this is just like induction from this representation to u of x1 these are functions on u of x1 a that's invariant by this and the m one a part. M1A part acts like this. So once you have this, I can associate an Eisenstein series on the group U of X1. So this is a a very standard construction. Construction. And this is absolutely convergent when the real part of S is large enough. Otherwise, you do Meromorphic continuation. And we know that there are finitely many poles in a part where. Pose in a part where real part of S is positive. So we're going to study its rightmost pose. Oh, by the way, we also know the poles are all real. Maybe I'll state our proposition on this Eisenstein series over there. Oh, yes, I I forgot to write camera. Thank you.  So it's of the form. Just use some arbitrary letter like A here and tell you what A is. First, it's an integer, and I know a bound for this. Oh, so this is just for the unitary case. I think I can say a bit more on A about its parity. A is odd, A is even in the following cases. That depends on. That depends on my character chi. Since I require that it is conjugate self-dual when you restrict to AF cross, there are only two possibilities. One is it's this quadratic character attached via class field theory to the field extension, or it's trivial. Oh, it's trivial And I can improve I can actually improve this bound here to something else via data correspondence So I use this to denote the width index of x. You just look at how many hyperbolic planes you can get rid of from x. If you just stick with Einstein series, I can only get to zero. After applying theta correspondence, I can improve this to width index. Most often, this is a strict improvement. So the question is: what is A? And the answer is: well, I already told you, actually, A is just the lowest occurrence. So, next, I'm going to say a bit on theta correspondence and tell you how you can see. How you can see that this A is the lowest occurrence. Before doing that, I think I need a bit of notation. This is just going to be one or zero in these two cases. If I mean this case, I set epsilon chi to be one, and if I mean the trivial character case, I just set epsilon chi to be zero. Epsilon pi to zero. This will be useful later when we write down certain formulae. The recording of my X, which is skew commissioner. My x, which is skew commission. To do data lift in this unitary case, I also need to introduce a Hermitian space. So I'm going to call it Y. So here's my group U X, here's my group U Y. And then I also need some self-dual characters. Self-dual characters like chi x and chiy that I require that epsilon chi x to be of the same parity as dimension of x and similarly for chi y such that I have this and such that I have something similar. Oh, I forgot to say more too. And later, you will see my chi is just chiy, and chi sub x is not important for. X is not important for our result. As long as it is compatible with dimension of X like this, so for theta correspondence, in the global case, what you do is to use this theta correspondence. Use this data kernel, it's a data series. And it depends on loads of stuff. First of all, you have these two vector spaces, skill permission and commission. And this thing depends on, so this is a data series that I'm not going to define precisely. Not going to define precisely. And g is idyllic points of ux, h aredylic points of uy, phi is a Schwartz function. It's automorphic in both G and H. So if I integrate against G, I will get a function in H. So this is, I do global theta lifts. Maybe I squeeze it in here. So I have my pie. Whatever it is, it's a function in u of x adylic points. So I can take something like a function in the space of pi and integrate against theta. I will put a complex counter get here to make things. Complex counter get here to make things nicer. G H phi dg. So this is a function in u of y adelic points. H is not integrated yet. So it's a Schwartz function. More precisely, I need to look at y tensor x over e, and then I consider it as a vector space over f. It has a symplectic structure. Then I take a polarization, take a maximal isotropic subspace. It doesn't matter which one you take, I just take one and then. Technically, I need restriction of scalars here. So, this is a Schwartz space on a certain vector space. The span of all such things as this little phi varies in pi, and this capital phi varies in my Schwartz space. The result I get is called denoted by theta or pi. I forgot to mention that this theta series. This data series depends on my chosen characters. But I suppress these from notation. So, in this way, I can also consider the same construction, but I replace y by y. Replace y by y1, where y1 has a similar construction to x1. Or maybe I can also do y2, just keep adjoining hyperbolic planes to this permission space. Yeah, this I forgot to write. G I integrate over the integrate over the automorphic quotient u of x of a model u of x rational points the small h lies in u of y of a of g is here Yes, this is a representation, an automorphic representation of your Y. So I go from this side to that side. Yeah, thank you. So this is global data correspondence. And the point is that now I keep changing y. I adjoin some hyperbolic planes to it, keep adjoining. So I can do the same thing and get a bunch of theta lifts. It's a bit small here, sorry. Without loss of generality, I would just assume that Y is anisotropic, so that this is at the very bottom of the width tower. So now I can introduce the theme that I mentioned at the beginning: what is LO.  Okay, not yet. First of all, what is FO? And here FO means first occurrence. So where do you get the first non-vanishing data lift? So I take minimum all those dimensions. Y sub r. Y sub r theta I lift to the thing adjoined with r copies of the hyperbolic plane. Just look at the smallest one. Here, without loss of generality, y is assumed to be anisotropic. Then I keep looking at the smallest thing, and I will call that the lowest occurrence. And the notation is like that to indicate its dependence on chi. So I minimize my first occurrences, which depends on my Which depends on my y. Here, I just require that y and chi are compatible in terms of that parity condition and the dimension. Oops, chi Y oh, just Kai. I want Y to be compatible with my Kai. Oh, so Y sub R is a similar construction to X sub something. X sub something. So LR and LR plus LR minus are of dimension R. So R is an integer, positive, maybe non-negative. And they are in reality to each other. Make sure they form a motion space, a hyperbolic. Information space, hyperbolic. Okay, I hope it's okay. So I think I have introduced all the notations. So let me just recall our theorem just briefly. So S0 is related to Now I'm going to sketch the proof. There are two steps. The first step, you deal with this part. I hope I got the direction right. I hope I got the direction right. Anyway, if this is wrong, I just change at the end. Okay, so I'm going to start from my Eisenstein series. So this has a pole. This has its biggest pole at S0. So the idea is to relate this. So, the idea is to relate this Eisenstein series to a Ziegler Eisenstein series. This one is non-zigal. Once you go to the Ziegler-Einstein series, we have the face. Series, we have the famous Dic Govet formula, and I use that. So residue at S0, the same S0 of this Ziegler-Einstein series. Einstein series. Roughly, the Siegelweight formula says this is a theta integral. And due to some convergence issue, you regularize that. So I get a regularized theta integral. Theta integral. And I have to cheat a bit here because S0 may not be a pole of this Eigen, this Ziegler-Eidenstein series. And here we have to use an idea of Mergland to enlarge our original Eisenstein series to a larger, to one on a larger unitary group. And it's okay, this will work out. So let me cheat here. And once you get this, And once you get this, using the relation between our Eigenstein series and the Ziegler-Eisenstein series, we can see the residual of our Eisenstein series. You can just read off from the theta integrals. You can see a bunch of contributions. One each contribution from the theta lifts of appropriate sizes. So let me be a bit more precise on what y is. So what am I summing over? I will need to sum over all those y's of appropriate dimension. This dimension. So from this, you immediately see that the lowest occurrence must be less than this size. So I get this inequality. So, the Ziegler-Eisenstein series basically just needed data from chi. And here I have my pi as well. So, basically, I want to integrate this Eisenstein series with functions in pi. Yes, and then you can split that into more things. Well, if I write down things more explicitly, I think you will see, but I haven't set up enough notation here. Maybe we can discuss. Enough notation here. Maybe we can discuss later. I guess I can talk about step two to prove the other direction. Maybe I go there. So, step one, that direction is basically my glance idea, and how to construct the Our construct contribution is mainly in this part. So I start from the lowest occurrence part. I will assume that my lowest occurrence is realized by something, by YR. And here, Y is another tropic. And R is some non-negative integer. So I'm going to focus on this number and look at the pole at that number. Oh, I don't mean half. This number, plus, one, minus dimension of. Dimension of that. And actually, even more strongly, the thing I consider is this integral of the residue of my Einstein series at that particular point. And a certain Eisenstein, sorry, a certain theta series that's related to X1 and Y. Think of some letter. Should I still use G? Maybe call it G1? No, because it's for X1. H some Schwartz function. Some Schwartz function. Actually, it's bigger. Maybe I also put a subscript here. DG1. I need to remember to write where I'm integrating over. I'm going to integrate over a subgroup of UX1. Complex conjugate. So this is the period integral that I want to consider. So what is Z1? So first, Z is a sub-non-degenerate scale Hermitian space of X. Of X. So I make X larger by adjoining a hyperbolic plane to that. So for Z, I do the same thing. And that is my Z one. And apparently, this is not going to be absolutely convergent. The idea is to use other truncation or a variant of it. I have tried both. They will give you the same result. Let's say that again, yes, yes. Since I considered I need to require. I need to require that this is positive. S1 needs to be positive. In our theorem, we only consider the rightmost positive pole of the Eisenstein series. We do have some results which can see negative poles, but it's not so clean. It's not an equality result. So, with Eisenstein series, one common technique that we use is unfolding. So, this Eisenstein series is a series over my group modulo, this quotient of this parabolic subgroup. Here I'm integrating over this uz1. Z1. So I need to consider orbits of this. I'm not going to unfold right now. I don't think we have enough time for that. So it turns out after unfolding, you will get four types of orbits. So this thing called a star will become four things. Actually, due to truncation, I will get eight things, two for each of the Two for each of the types. And after you use this result, I mean a result from theta correspondence, since we assume that the lowest occurrence is given by YR, it turns out the four things, four pieces we get from this will mostly vanish. Only one piece can contribute. Piece can contribute. So, since I don't have a lot of time, I'll just write down the piece that will contribute. It's a compact integral outside, and I integrate over u z oops, not uz one. Oops, not use that one after unfolding and stuff. What I get is integration integration over uz quotient of some theta. And this time the theta is associated to x and y, not x1. And I put a one here and a certain One here and a certain Schwartz function that's related to the original one. I don't want to specify what it is, it's just related to that by one. And F S G K because there's a outside there's a compact integral. Let me also put a K here because my phi depends on K. Because my phi depends on k. Okay, this is the only part that can contribute to this star thing. And it's very technical to show that under the assumption that this LO is realized by YR, we can show it's actually non-vanishing. It's quite technical. For some choice of data, this is non-vanishing. It's a very technical result. All right, I think at this point you can see that this thing is non-vanishing. Therefore, we must have a pole at there. And so we have shown that the pole here and the largest pole, of course, has to be greater than or equal to this. That's how we showed. To this, that's how we show this side of the inequality. But in the remaining minutes, I think I can say something about application to other parameter.  Since I only consider cospidal representations, I only need to introduce the so-called elliptic global alpha parameter. So this is much simpler. It looks like this. If you reply, it's elliptic. Oh, by the way, I hope you don't remember my additive character. I have never used psi before. This is an outer parameter. I think it's more common to write S now, but I prefer. Now, but I prepared new that this is a B one-dimensional irreducible representation of SL2C. Maybe I use T because I somehow use my R like this. The point is that these tau i's are Tau I's countergate self-deal, cospidal representations. With some parity condition. And you can read about the parity condition in Mach of course, the size should be dimension of. Dimension of X elliptic, so I need the pairwise distinct condition. So In the unitary case, Mock and Peleta, Meningus, Sheen, and White generalized Arthur's result so that we have this decomposition of the discrete spectrum of L2 for my U of X. So these elliptic things. So I will use psi sub two to denote elliptic global author parameters for u of x. X. Okay. So this is decomposition. And I would just call L2 subside to be my global author packet.  Now, if I assume my pie lies in this, my pie is always assumed to be hospital, okay, if it's in this other packet. So if psi has a factor like this, where chi is a self-dual, sorry, conjugate self-dual character, like this. Then our previous result can show that we have a bound on B. So the idea is to read off the partial L function attached to pi and chi. So, my point is to say that if you look at the other parameter of pi. Other parameter of pi. And if it has a factor like that, then B has a bound. The other parameter of pi has some constraint. So if your psi has a super large B larger than this, then Larger than this, then there's no caspital member in the global outlet packet. I can't say anything. This is actually our future work. We want to replace chi by an arbitrary contradictory self-deal, caspidal representation of Gia. So, I'll just mention a little bit how to think about this. So, I start from my pi, I look at its else, partial function, and then I can relate the pole of this to our Eisenstein series. So So the B factor will give me some information on the pole of the L function. And then this pole will correspond to a pole here. And then we make use of our theorem to get a bound on the pole. And that's how I get the bound on B. So I think I have run out of time. Let me stop here.
