Recording. Never mind. Anyway, you have 25 minutes plus five minutes of questions, as usual. Cool. All yours. Okay, so this topic is going to be somewhat different. Some of you may have heard me talk about this at a conference a month ago, an Italian-organized conference. For those of you, I hope you find that I have at least sharpened my arguments a little bit. Okay, so. Okay, so why is quantum gravity so hard? Well, clearly, general relativity required abandoning some deeply held beliefs about the absoluteness of space and time. And also when quantum theory came along, it required the abandoning of other deeply held beliefs about the kinematics and dynamics of matter. Now, quantum gravity is very hard. Could it be that some of the Very hard. Could it be that some more deeply held beliefs need to be abandoned to make way for developing that theory? Now, what kind of belief could it be that we have to challenge? And since general relativity is concerned with the stage that space-time provides and quantum. And quantum theory is concerned with the dynamics of the matter that lives on that stage. And since quantum gravity is about unifying the two, maybe let's play a little with the idea that that picture of a stage and actors on it, that picture of a space-time as a stage and matter as actors on it, might need to be challenged. But what picture could supersede it? But what picture could supersede it? For example, at the Planck scale, we know that at low energy, this is a perfectly workable picture, but at the Planck scale, we can only speculate so far. And the indications are that it's not going to be a picture of a space-time stage on which particles of the usual intuition move around. So, what picture could supersede the picture of a stage spectrum? The picture of a stage, space-time, and matter actors. Do we have any hints towards such a theory? Well, let's start by looking at some odd features of the stage and actors picture that we usually use. When you read Einstein in the original, you will find that he took great pains explaining exactly how the mathematics of general relativity is to be. Mathematics of general relativity is to be translated into an experimental procedure. How coordinate systems are to be built using rods and clocks and how they are to be synchronized, how the clocks are to be synchronized and how the rods are to be moved around without changing their physical length and so on. But the trouble with rods and clocks is that they are not canonical, they are not provided by nature naturally. We have to make them. Naturally, we have to make them. Nor are the rods and clocks anything that's covariant. And there are no rods or clocks that we can make at subatomic scales. Another curious thing that questions the idea to use rods and clocks to build physics on is the observation that space and time. The observation that space and time mathematically are very similar, of course, right? They differ only by a minus sign in the metric or by a factor of i. But if you compare rods to clocks, rods and clocks are very different. They seem to differ by more than just a minus sign or a factor of i. And then what do we use rods and clocks for? We use them to build coordinate systems. But coordinate systems have some odd features. But coordinate systems have some odd features too. Coordinate systems are completely ignorant of the drama on the light cone. Two points could be arbitrarily close in coordinate distance, but one of them is inside the light cone and the other one is outside the light cone of another event. And that makes the difference between having an alibi and not having an alibi, between causal connection or not. And the coordinate systems don't know about it at all. At all. And fundamentally, at the end of the day, quantum gravity requires us to mod out coordinate systems. And that whole shebang with the clocks and rods and coordinate systems we want to get rid of if we want to, for example, path integrate over metrics. Then we only want the geometric information in the metric to sum over in the path integral, but we don't want to sum over the human choices of coordinate systems, of course. Of course. So I suggest to give it a try and see if we can abandon rods and clocks for something more natural, something more canonical, and maybe also abandon coordinate systems and manifolds altogether to get a framework that's more stable, a framework that can be used at low energies, but that also persists perhaps to the Planck scale. Now, one first question that one early question that has to come up then, of course, is what That has to come up, then, of course, is what happens to diffeomorphism invariance, which plays an important role in general relativity. And just to mention already, what I'm suggesting there is I'm suggesting to lift it to basis independence. You see, diffomorphism invariance is great. It means that the laws stay the same when we change coordinate system. But we know from quantum mechanics that more than that is possible. In quantum mechanics, we can not only change Mechanics, we can not only change coordinates, for example, from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates. In quantum mechanics, we can do this. It's a change of basis in the Hilbert space. But in quantum mechanics, we also have the freedom to do more general transformations. For example, a Fourier transform from position space to momentum space. That's not a diffeimorphism. That's not a change of coordinates. In other words, the unitary group of the Hilbert space is bigger than the diffeomorphism group. Is bigger than the diffeomorphism group. So ultimately, what I'm suggesting is to upgrade from diffeomorphism invariance to the unitary group. Of course, that comes with all sorts of issues, and I will address them. So, but let's start from the beginning. How can we contemplate abandoning rods and clocks and replacing them by something more natural? And then I will move on to coordinate systems and then finally move on to. And then finally, move on to replacing manifolds themselves. So, what I'm suggesting is here to use tools that can replace rods and clocks that are nature-provided. Nature provides us with a tool to determine space-time distances. And how does nature do that? Well, there may be many ways, but one way that I know of is that we can use the correlation strength of quantum vacuum fluctuations. In the vacuum, quantum fields fluctuate, and these fluctuations. Fields fluctuate, and these fluctuations are the more correlated, the closer together they occur. At faraway distances, the correlation is weak, at close distances, they are very strong. Consider, for example, the two-point correlator here. In the lowest order, that will be just the Feynman rule for the propagator. So consider the two-point correlator. We know that it grows the closer. The closer x is to y, the closer the two events are. And in fact, it diverges on the light cone and in the coincidence limit. And because it is the larger, the smaller the invariant distance is between x and y, the two-point correlator can serve as a measure of space-time distances. Now, if it is really a good measure of space-time distances, then, well, Well, then it should be sufficient to calculate the curvature from it, but is it? And it is actually sufficient to do that. We can replace in general relativity the metric by the two-point correlator. In other words, the curvature is not only impacting the two-point correlator, the two-point correlator knows everything about the curvature to the extent that the curvature can be reconstructed from it. So, concretely, this means that if you're given the final propagator or two-point correlator more generally, the two-point correlator on a manifold, on a spacetime manifold, then you can calculate what the metric is from it. That shouldn't really come as a surprise because what does the metric do? It tells us how to calculate infinitesimal distances. And the two-point correlator tells us. And the two-point correlator tells us not only about infinitesimal, but even about finite distances. So, this means that in general relativity, we can describe space-time not only as a manifold with a metric on it or as a manifold with an affine connection on it, but we can also describe it as a manifold with a two-point correlator on it. That's exactly equivalent. Now, in this way, we have replaced Way we have replaced, we can replace rods and clocks by the two-point correlator. In principle, we just need to have some means to detect whether a quantum fluctuation happened at a certain location or not, and then counter those correlations. And then the correlator gives us, well, the correlator from which we can then, if we want to, reconstruct the metric. Now let's move on and try to replace not only rods and clocks, but also the coordinate systems that Coordinate systems that we usually build with them. Now, why would we want to do this? Why is there a need to replace coordinate systems? Well, the two-point correlator, just like the metric, depends on the geometry, as we just saw, it determines the geometry, but it also depends on the coordinate system. If we change coordinate system, then the functional form of the two-point correlator would change. It's the same story with the metric. If we change coordinate system, Story with the metric. If we change coordinate systems, the metric still describes the same space-time, but differently, in a different functional form. And if you wanted to do a path integrate, a path integral over all geometries, well, then we want to only path integrate over the geometries. We don't want to path integrate over human choices of coordinate systems. That would be nonsense. So if we have to mod out by the choice of coordinate system, we have to do this path integral. We have to do this path integral somehow in a diffromorphism-invariant way. But how can we do this? Are we in any better shape now? It is hard to path integrate over metrics for this reason. Why would it be easier to path integrate over two-point correlators? Well, two-point correlators are operators. Operators on a Hilbert space are functions. And that can help us, as I'll show now, when we want to. When we want to extract the coordinate system independent information from the two-point correlator. So, remember, the two-point correlator I just showed you in the previous slide can be used to calculate the metric. But there is this superfluous information of the coordinate choice in it. That's what we want to get rid of. So, let's try to extract from the two-point correlator what the geometric information is in a pure form, coordinate system independently. Now, what we can try here is this. We can start with the observation that the spectrum of an operator is invariant. Its base is independent. In particular, its coordinate system independent. This is nothing new. We know that, for example, the two-point correlator or based on wave equation, in the simplest case, the wave operator is just the Dylan-Berschen. And we know that the spectrum of the Dahlum-Berschen, or the spectrum of the two-point correlator, The spectrum of the two-point correlator, that these spectra are independent of the basis in which you calculate them. They're independent of the coordinate system in which you calculate the spectrum. So it seems we found a way to do it. We just used spectral geometry. Remember, spectral geometry is the discipline that asks to what extent can you hear the shape of some vibrating object. So it would seem that we arrived at spectral geometry. It would seem that we arrived at spectral geometry here as the solution. We could simply suggest that, well, instead of the two-point correlator, just use its spectrum. That should be consisting of the geometric information without bothering with any coordinate systems. But as you may know, spectral geometry does generally not really work. If you just know the spectrum of something vibrating, then you can't completely tell what shape it has. Tell what shape it has. Sometimes you can, but it's a small class of scenarios where you can, and you certainly cannot when the metric is Lorentzian and you have three plus one dimensions. But that's weird, isn't it? Because I just showed you a formula that showed that from the two-point correlator, you can calculate the metric and therefore you get the shape of the space-time. But now I'm telling you that if you take the basis invariant information, the coordinate system invariant information. System invariant information of the two-point correlator, then you can no longer do it. That alone doesn't do it. So, how is that possible that by condensing the information to just the spectrum, which is certainly coordinate system independent, we somehow lost some geometric information? Where did it go? Ultimately, this is the question, why does spectral geometry not work? What's the obstruction here? What's going on? Well, the reason why spectral geometry Well, the reason why spectral geometry doesn't work can be seen from this perspective. The two-point correlator we showed can be used to calculate the metric if you know the two-point correlator in a position representation in some coordinate system. But the spectrum of it does not, right? And the reason is that the spectrum of an operator is invariant under the full unitary group of the Hilbert. The full unitary group of the Hilbert space. You can change bases whichever way you want in the Hilbert space. The spectrum of an operator doesn't change when you do this. This is overkill. You see, we were interested in geometric invariance, not in the invariance under the entire unitary group. Remember that the geometric invariance are the invariants under the diffeomorphism group. And these are only the changes of coordinates. But the unitary group is way bigger. But the unitary group is way bigger. It contains not only changes of coordinates, it also contains Fourier transforms, Hermit transforms, all sorts of basis changes in the Hilbert space that go way beyond any coordinate transformation. So we modeled out too much by going to the spectrum and therefore the spectrum alone doesn't contain all the geometric invariants. The spectrum alone doesn't allow us to reconstruct what the space-time is. What the space-time is. Now, can we fix spectral geometry? We can. And here's how we can do it. This is really the new result that I want to present here and that just very recently, like a week ago, appeared in Frontiers in Physics. So, how to immense spectral geometry so that it works? Well, what we can do is Well, what we can do is we can consider not only the two-point correlators, but also the higher-point correlators. In quantum field theory, we have them. As soon as the theory is interacting, we have not only the two-point correlators, we also have end-point correlators for n larger than two. Now, let's look at these end-point correlators for n larger two in any basis. This could be a coordinate system basis, it could be a positional basis, or it may not be. It could be momentum space or any. It may not be. It could be momentum space or in curved space-times. It could be just any arbitrary basis you want in the Hilbert space of fields. Then nature helps us here. It's a combination of physics and math. You see, the physics tells us that we have microcausality, which ultimately means that the vertices of the theory are diagonal in preferred bases, in the positional basis. If in all of the Herbert space you choose a basis, You choose a basis which is a positional basis, then and only then are the vertices diagonal. They are products of direct deltas, indicating that particles can only interact if they are exactly sitting on the same point. This means that if we know what the endpoint correlator is in whatever basis in the Hilbert space, then we can determine, we can go through the Hilbert space and Go through the Hilbert space and find bases in which this thing is diagonal because of microcausality. We're guaranteed that such a basis in the Hilbert space exists, which means we are guaranteed a positional coordinate system. But that means that we can now take our two-point correlator and write it in a position basis. And that means that we can calculate the metric from it and therefore get the curvature and the manifold and all of that. That. So, what happened here? What happened is that we augmented the information that is in the two-point correlator in its eigenbase, it's just a spectrum. We augmented it by also assuming that we know a higher point correlator. And the higher point correlators carry one very important information, namely in what basis in the Hilbert space they are diagonal. And then, once we know that basis, we can take our two-point correlator, transform it in such a positional basis. Transform it in such a positional basis, and then we have the Green's function, then we have the two-point correlator from which we can then calculate the metric. So, the trick is to assume not only the two-point correlator, but the end-point correlators, or at least one n larger than two correlator, and then we can reconstruct the entire manifold. Now, the higher-order correlators, of course, describe a non-linearity in the theory, and intuitively, you can think of it as saying that spectral geometry doesn't Saying that spectral geometry doesn't work as long as you're only in the linear regime of the oscillations, but if you also have the oscillations large enough so that non-linear oscillations kick in, that gives you extra information, which can then be used to reconstruct the shape of the manifold. And the argument that I just mentioned also works, equally works for the Lorentzian signature or the Euclidean signature case. So we arrive at a picture without rods, clocks, or coordinators. Without rods, clocks, or coordinate systems. And if the GN, if the endpoint correlators are indeed correlators, then as any correlators inside of physics, but also outside of physics in engineering or social sciences or whatever, wherever you have a correlator, it must be of this form, because that's what a correlator is. It correlates these random variables with some weight function w. Now, of course, we know that in physics, this is also the form it takes. This is also the form it takes, and we know what the w of phi is in this case. It's simply e to the power i times the action. Now, can we write down an action in a basis independent? So not only in a diffeomorphism independent, but in a basis independent way? Yes, we can. For example, the Klein-Gordon action can be written as a trace. It's one half, the Danum version phi, phi. But phi is not states. I used the Ket-Brand notation here, but these are simply fields. But these are simply fields in the Hilbert space that we sum over in the path integral. And if you like, you can just write out the trace as a sum over a positional basis, and then you recover the usual form back of the Klein-Gordon action. Well, and if the vertices are indeed local, and our physical theories seem to be having a micro-causality, if the vertices are local, then they provide the positional basis and that we can therefore write and that we can therefore write our propagators in the positional basis from which we can then calculate the metric and therefore obtain the geometry. But remember from the beginning of my talk, the ambition is to be able to go beyond the picture of matter moving like actors on the space-time that provides the stage. Now, how could this be providing that? Can we go beyond the stage? Can we go beyond the stage and actors picture, for example, at the Planck scale? Well, in principle, yes. You see, the diagonalizability of the endpoint functions for n large and two is not guaranteed mathematically. Just like an operator, which would be a G superscript 2, a two-point correlator, an operator is not guaranteed to be diagonalizable. The spectral theorem tells us exactly when it is diagonalizable and many. It is diagonalizable, and many operators are not diagonalizable. So, similarly, the endpoint correlators, in principle, have no reason to be diagonalizable. For some reason, nature does it. We have that the vertices of the standard model are all diagonalizable. They are all describing extremely local interactions. But what if we are mistaken in thinking that these vertices are truly exactly local? Could it be? Exactly local? Could it be that if we probe towards the Planck scale, we find that no, those endpoint correlators can't really be diagonalized. They can be approximately diagonalized, but not really diagonalized. When that is the case, then the endpoint correlators, if they can no longer be exactly diagonalized, then they cannot exactly tell us what positional bases in the Hilbert space would be, which means we can no longer exactly obtain the propagator in a... Obtain the propagator in the position basis, which means we can no longer exactly calculate the metric. And therefore, the very notion of a space-time with a metric on it becomes merely approximate. In other words, we still have a stable structure. We have the set of the endpoint correlators. We just lose the ability to represent them mathematically as field correlators living on a space-time manifold. So we still have this endpoint correlator. So, we still have these endpoint correlators. It's just that the ability to represent them as fields on a manifold, that fails then. At low energies, the abstract endpoint functions, I'm just reading here, I already said what I wrote there, right? So at low energies, the abstract endpoint functions mathematically are representable as quantum field correlators on the curved space-time. But at high energies, this representation could become at best approximate. Could become at best approximate. And that would be one way in which, at the Planck scale, the notion of space-time could fail, which is of course a very common idea. But what's new here is that the very notion of space-time providing a stage on which matter then moves, that entire notion would then fail. Because while we still have the abstract endpoint correlators, they just can't be represented as fields. As field correlators on a space-time in that case. So, to summarize, we started by upgrading diffimorphism invariance to unitary invariance. The diffimorphism group was replaced by the unitary group of the Hilbert space of fields that we sum over in the path integral. We started by replacing rods and clocks by the correlation strength of vacuum fluctuations of a field. And then we And then we saw that this correlator can actually replace the metric. It can be viewed as the primary object, in which case the metric is only a derived concept that may not even exist in certain circumstances. And then we saw that as long as the metric does exist, the metric can be replaced by the two-point correlator and the higher point correlators. And the higher point correlators, that's an exactly equivalent description. If you have the two-point correlator and you have the vertices, then you can reconstruct from that the quantum field theory on its curved space-time. It's just that sometimes these end-point correlators simply don't have such a representation. So the stage and actors picture then arises and can be viewed as being not quite stable in the following way. In the following way, if the higher point correlators are diagonalizable, if and only if they're diagonalizable, then we get the stage and actors pictures of space-time and matter moving on it. But at the Planck scale, these higher point correlators for n larger than 2 may not be exactly diagonalizable. Therefore, they may not be representable as field correlators on a manifold. And nevertheless, these abstract These abstract correlators would always be well defined, even if they lose this representation. Maybe there is another representation that could be found for them, but they can no longer be represented as quantum field correlators on a curved space-time. And at the very least, since they are correlators mathematically, the structure of them is that of correlators, they can always be studied. They're begging to be studied information theoretically, of course. Now, I think I'm out of time, but I think I'm out of time, but I do have two more slides if anybody's interested later with an example that's calculated through. How am I doing with the time? Yeah, you are in the question time. Hakeem, it's a very interesting talk. I'd like to let you proceed, but yeah, we only have four minutes for questions. Yes, thanks. Very, very interesting talk. Um, any questions? Okay, um. Okay. Um yes, I have a question um Arkim. So it's a very nice talk and nicely presented as well. Um so my question is um so your G2 corresponds to vacuum, it corresponds to the vacuum state, so it's correlated correlation function in the vacuum state. So what happens if your fields are not in the vacuum state? So it's sort of different from the case with the metric because Are different from the case with the metric because the analog would be in the case of GR demanding that using some other fields to measure the sort of causal structure, but demanding that they be in some particular state. But in general, they won't be in the vacuum state. Yes, that's right. I think the best way to I think the best way to think of it is to see the endpoint correlators as in the lowest approximation the Feynman rules, and then in high approximations they are the Feynman graphs. And so if you actually want to calculate something, it's at low energies just the usual. It's just, you know, you have your Feynman rules, except that you have them slightly quite because it might be happening on a curved space-time. And it's only at high energies then where things change. So let's put it this way. The final propagator and the endpoint vertices can be viewed as vacuum expectation values, but they are, of course, used then in order to calculate actual interactions. So I'm basically expressing things here in terms of the tools, the endpoint correlators, and then Point correlators, and then for actual calculations, you can work with excited fields. Okay, I need to think about that. Thanks. Yeah, I have an example, as I said, I have an example, it's only two slides, where I outline how gravity could be included in this. I suppose what you might have in mind is how is the interaction between the matter and the gravity implemented in this case? So, that's my concern: is that you sort of want something to be carrying the causal structure, and yet all you have are physical fields that seem to have a different role. I didn't catch the beginning of it. You want to have something to carry the causal structure, and yet what you have are physical fields whose purpose is different. Maybe you can show the example. Maybe you can show the example. Maybe it's clearer if I look at it. Yeah, but regarding this particular question, remember that at the beginning of the talk, I complained that coordinate systems are ignorant of the drama on the light cone. Two-point correlators are not. Two-point correlators blow up at the light cone. They diverge there and they change from being correlated. They change from being correlators to anti-correlators as you cross over the light column, which means you can distinguish what is time-like, we can distinguish what is space-like, and what is light-like. And that's ultimately also the reason why the two-point correlators carry the information about the curvature of the space-time. Because remember that there is a theorem by Hawking and I think Penrose, where they showed that if you know at every point of the manifold where the light cones are, Manifold where the light cones are, then you already know the metric up to a conformal factor. And if you know the propagator, then you know the causal structure of your space-time. Because if you know the propagators, you know where the light comes are. And then you only need to worry about the missing conformal factor, but we showed that that comes along as well with the propagator. And that's ultimately because the propagator doesn't just tell you where the light cones are, it also tells you the decay of this finite. Decay of this finite amplitude decay of the propagator to the left and to the right of the light cone. And the actual amplitudes there encode what amounts to the scalar, what amounts to the conformal pre-factor that's still missing from the Hawking-Penrose theorem about the light const determining the metric. So the causal structure is built right into it in the singularity structure of the propaganda. Okay, thanks. Thanks. So there is one more question that I'd like to take before we take a small break from Maximilium. I don't know if you want to, Max. I don't know if it's a brief question. Hi, yes. Thank you. Yes, I hope it is a brief question. Would you say it is fair to say that the two-point correlator encodes the information about the metric because it is the expectation value, basically, the expectation value. Value basically the expectation value of a product of two fields at two points in, let's say, a Hadamard state, and the Hadamard state itself encodes basically information about the metric because you have some terms that have the geodesic distance between these points there. Well, yes, mathematically, but I think there's also a nice physical intuition as to why the correlator encodes the space-time distance. Correlator encodes the space-time distance. There are two cases to consider. One is the time-like, one is the space-like case. In the time-like case, it's simply this. If you tickle the field, if you excite the field at one point, then that will create a ripple effect and that excitation will propagate through the field. And so, any quantum fluctuation at one point will ripple, will cause a ripple effect around it, and at another point will lead to an impact on the Will lead to an impact on the quantum fluctuations there. And depending on the dimension of the manifold, this effect is smaller or larger. And it also depends on how far away the two events are from each other. So it's simply propagation, it's causation that creates the correlation between the kind of fluctuations at one point and the other point. Now for space-like distances, it's a different reason why you still have a distance dependence there. A distance dependence there. And the reason there is that you can view the quantum field as consisting of one harmonic oscillator at every point. And these harmonic oscillators are coupled to each other because of the Laplacian term. And that means that the ground state of the field, the vacuum state, is an entangled state. And that entanglement is decaying over distance because you couple to one oscillator, which couples to the next, which couples to the next, and so on. And therefore, there is some correlation. Is some correlation, even quantum correlation, because of the entanglement, between quantum fluctuations at one point and another space-like separated one. I guess what I'm worried about is how universal this correlation is. It's basically separated distances, let's say, and how independent it is of the state with which you start. I agree that in the vacuum, you will have these correlations, but it could be restrictive to say, well, the only thing we want to consider is the vacuum, in particular, if you go. Is the vacuum, in particular, if you go to general curved space-times where the notion of a vacuum might not make sense? So, yes, that's a very good point. Yeah, that's a very good point. Can I suggest that we take it a discussion though? Because we are fighting into 10 seconds. Okay, okay, go through it. It points out that in that formula, where is it? This one. This one, in this formula, you get the two-point correlator to a negative power, which means that i epsilon prescriptions and other homogeneous solutions that you might add to it, depending on your choice of vacuum, drop out of it. Because you can take the epsilon going to zero then at the W. Which is how it should be, right? It shouldn't be sensitive to that. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks again. I think it was very interesting. I think it was a very interesting talk as well. So I think now what we can do, we can spend five minutes in Gather Town.
