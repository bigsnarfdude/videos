So and on a joint work with Fyodor Nazarev and Yuval Perez. Fyodor is my collaborator and good colleague and friend from Kent. And Yuval Perez, he is currently at BIMSA. It stands for Beijing Institute Mathematical Science and Applications. And so the And so, this work is relatively old. So, it's a COVID baby. So, when COVID hit, we had a few discussions about this problem, but not much. And then we continued for like a year and a half from each own basement. So, it took quite a while to talk about. Okay, so the story. Oh, good. So, the story I'm going to tell you about Pila Plashan, and if you You about P-Laplacian, and if you haven't seen this creature, here it is. So you take a function u, so you take a length of this gradient to a certain power, multiply by gradient u, and take diversions of that. And if you look at that, so it looks fairly unattractive in the beginning, but being unattractive is not necessarily meaning ugly, so I have. meaning ugly. So I have several examples as being unattractive is not necessarily means ugly. So that comes from my daughter's library. So and for you know so for frog you need the keys. For p Laplacian you need the variational principle to look it nice. And once you write it down so you realize that p Laplacian is simply Euler Lagrange equation of a function also where you take a grade Of a function, also where you take a gradient to a power piece and try to minimize it over appropriate admissible class. So it's a very, very natural extension of Dirac to integral, and it just has this property of producing an Euler's Lagrange equation, which does not really look that nice. So the next story, so what I'm going to talk about, so we About so, uh, so we need to introduce a p capacity, which is some object which is like an energy. So, you have to put a restriction that your p, so this where p Laplacian stands for, so is strictly smaller than the dimension. So, it's not very difficult to see that only with this restriction. So, the problem kind of makes sense in the entire R D. So, and you define capacity, which is in the theme of integrals of Of integrals of fine psi compactly supported in Rd, so such that they're sitting on certain compact G, and on this compact G they are not below one. And then, so clearly, so it looks like an energy, so you can write down an Euler-Lagrange equation. And so to make things work nicely, so you have to think about a Perron solution. Think about the Perron solution for this problem. So you're trying to solve the problem outside of this compact G. So you prescribe U to be one on this compact, and you want U to go to zero at infinity. And this function U, so this is this Perron solution of this boundary of this problem, so called p potential of a compact gamba in Rd. Compa Gamba in RD. Okay. So the problems, so the setup which we were interested is to look at the following situations. So you take a unit sphere in Rd, and then you put a finite set of points on a unit sphere. And each point, so you associate with each point. So you associate with each point, so you associate a compact subset of a unit ball, so which you describe as Ks. And then you construct this compact gamma in the following way. So you attach a compact Ks appropriately scaled. So it's scaled with parameter alpha and epsilon. They all go to zero very soon. So then you just translate them from point to point. And the question is that, so you want to say something about solution of About the solution of p-potential for this problem. So, in other words, you look at a compact g, so you make epsilon relatively small. So, your points on the sphere, which we call anchors, gets closer and closer together. And you're trying to figure out how this p-potential looks like. Okay, so oops. There is essentially one major assumption here that if you take this small parameter epsilon to zero, so you want it to be uniformly distributed over the sphere. So another assumption is that you want to be compact sufficiently. Want to be compact sufficiently strong, so which means that if you look at them in non-scaled versions, so the capacities are positive. And then you want this scaling limit to behold, so it's just sort of in a scaling argument. And if you want a picture of what to think about, so so the easiest thing you think about uniform distribution of points, and then you attach the same compacts, possibly rotate it. Same compact, possibly rotated. So it doesn't have to be the same. So the only thing you want is that capacity of each one is the same. So it could be a whole bunch of different objects. And so, and I mean, so the study of homogenization for this problem is absolutely no news. So there are plenty of literature. Some of them are presented here. So there's a book of Martin Kant Khruslov. Marchenko and Khruslov. There is a fairly famous paper of Kiranovsky and Morazi about this, and there are a bunch of others. But all of them are talking about kind of boundary, so effective boundary condition, behavior on the bulk, and limiting capacities. And so let's start with what the bulk behavior looks like. The bulk behavior looks like. So, if everything is sort of uniformly distributed, so on a sphere, so what you would expect that outside of the sphere, you will have some kind of an effective solution, so which is radially symmetric. So what you would expect is that your behavior outside of the sphere will be some kind of a constant multiplied by potential of a ball. By potential of a ball. So, potential of a ball you can write very easily. So, it's one is inside, and then it decays with a certain power gamma, where gamma is related to, so let me try to so for a gamma is something like that. So, it's a certain power, so which is just the difference of dimension on p divided by p minus one. one okay so uh so and so what what you think is that so if if compacts are relatively small uh so then you will have essentially zero solution if it's a relatively large then you will have a solution which is just the potential of a ball and so now you need to quantify what is large and what what is small so the best What is small? So, the best quote I have about this comes from an about 100 years old Yiddish play called Einstein Weinstein. So, that's several hairs on your head is a little, and several hairs in you soup is a lot. So, now we have to figure out, so what's little, what's a lot. And for this, you can do, you know, so at least heuristically, you can do very simple computations. So, because capacity is subaditive, so you just write it capacity of a. So, you just write that capacity of a compact is bounded from above by capacities of the sum of them. So, and then the basic scaling arguments tells you that that capacity is bounded from above by some constant alpha divided by some alpha critical, where critical stands for epsilon to power one over this gamma. And then you can see that if you just take, you completely ignore this compact, so the capacity. Completely ignore this compact, so the capacity will be just bounded by a constant. So, what is suggestive is this critical scale is just epsilon to the power of one over gamma. And indeed, you can prove, and this can be done by a whole bunch of different methods, so that if you have all the hypotheses are satisfied, if you send epsilon to zero, then your solution will converge to zero. Your solution will converge to zero when tau equals to zero. So, this tau is basically measures. So, you have this window of critical regime. So, so, so, so, zero means and infinity means here outside. And clearly, this is the most interesting situation when the star sits between zero and infinity. So, you will converge to zero or potential of a ball. So, if you're at zero and infinity, and you converge to a certain value, so with some specific selected A star, so which you can explicitly compute. You can explicitly compute. And your capacity will be either zero capacity of a ball or something in between. So, in many ways, this result is somewhat unexpected. But I mean, so if you know what's been developed in this field for the past 20, 30 years, so this is some kind of a reflection of so-called term coming from nowhere. So, you have a certain effective boundary condition. Effective boundary conditions, so which makes this second term appear. So, in other words, so this is the price from the bulk, and this is the price from the sphere. And of course, this convergence is not uniform because supremum of solution is one on a sphere. So, the normal, so the question to ask is what's happening near the unit sphere? And it turns out this is something which can. Is something which can be done, and this is you know, so I will look through the literature quite carefully and been trying to figure out what's been done, but it doesn't seem to be people been asking this question. So, now what we are trying to figure out, so what's happening with the solution, so when you're sitting right on the sphere, and turns out that you can construct an ansat, so which approximates solutions in L infinity, and I will try to describe you how this. And I will try to describe to you how the sounds art is constructed. So you take a ball of radius R, so you remove a compact, and then you prescribe that on a compact, U R1. So, and then outside of the ball of radius R, so you potentially zero. So you have this function, so which, you know, so if it's, if the compact is not too ugly, you can construct relatively easily. Easily numerically, so if it's ugly, so that requires a little bit more work. And then you take a potential of the ball and shift it a little bit, and then you obtain an answer UA, so which is just the potential of a ball multiplied by this A, and then the sum of all these potentials associated with each compact. So if you want to try to look how this object looks like, how Object looks like how the sensors look like. So you really have something which is essentially radial, so but on its fear, which is, you know, so it's a two-dimensional, so which is just a circle. So you have a certain peaks, right? So if you look from, you know, from the bird point of view, that's what you would see. So you have this kind of peaks here, so and then becoming essentially radial. And if you And if you see what's happening within the critical windows, so this is what you see. So if you change tau, so you go from essentially a peak to something like a flat thing. So that's what's happening when you change, when you're sitting with this critical window. So you have something which is essentially zero, and then you have this tower, and then some intermediate thing, and then something which is barely not. Something which is barely noticeable. And the main result is the following: so that suppose all hypotheses are satisfied, then when epsilon goes to zero, then you have convergence of gradients of a solution with an ANZATS with appropriately chosen amplitude A star, so which comes from the first result. So, and the most importantly that you have a convergence of an ANZATS and solution in L infinity for the whole space. And L infinity for the whole space, which is kind of it looks hard, so it looks less approachable than it actually is. So let me, you know, so the proof becomes fairly technical, very fast. So let me, is there a question? Okay, the proof becomes very technical, fairly fast. So I just want to give you a little bit of a flavor how you prove this type of things. So we will see it in the So, we will see it in dimension two. So, we will be strictly in the critical window. So, we're not considering borderline cases. And compacts will be nice. We will talk about, you know, solutions are as good as you can possibly think about. And the first kind of ingredient here is some sort of a neck lemma. So, the neck lemma says the following, so that you take relatively small epsilon. Relatively small epsilon, so some delta, so which is much greater than epsilon, much smaller than one, and here alpha is an about critical thing. And then you are looking for a potential in the following way. So you're looking for a domain, so where you remove balls of a certain radius, so which is indicated by the psi, right? So you prescribe that on this. On those balls, on those boundaries, are so your solution is one, and there is a ball located at one plus delta distance, so your solution is so your solution is zero. And then the claim is that the supremum of this solution on a ball of radius one over 10 is going to be bounded by some constant on epsilon. So it's quite incomprehensible without picture. So let me just give you an idea of what's going on. So you take. What's going on? So you take a ball of radius one, right? So you stick points here and there. So, and you take a ball of radius one plus delta, you prescribe zero boundary condition over here, you prescribe w equals to one on those balls of radius alpha epsilon, and then the claim is that so that on the balls of radius about epsilon over 10, your solution is small. So that's that's a So that's a certain computation which you can do. And so, and the application of the Net Lemma can be used by comparison arguments, as it's the best representative of that is a quote from Salomon Walkner, which said that in algebra, A equals to B is tapedology, and therefore, uninteresting in analysis, it's a result of two deep inequalities. Deepen equalities. So you use comparison principle, and that gives you the story. So, what you can do, so you're saying that suppose that your solution on a ball of radius one plus delta is essentially constant up to a small correction, then you can construct and sub and super solutions so that your solution will be squeezed between. Will be squeezed between a constant and within a small correction. So, and therefore, in the whole story, so your solution will be bounded by an ant that's up to the small correction delta. So, that's basically the idea. So, the question is: so, this is what, I mean, so again, it's an application of the story is so that, so if you prescribe one. So, if you prescribe one here and a constant here up to a small correction, then so around the obstacles, so you have around the compact, you have a solution which is essentially constant. So, you kind of can separate every single compact from each other. So the thing which reminds to show is that if you know that on this relatively large, I mean, so small, but much bigger than epsilon. But much bigger than epsilon deviation from the unit ball. So you have, your solution is essentially constant. So then you are fine. So you have this beautiful property. But the only thing is to figure out how to know that this is indeed the case. And here you need to do a little bit of. A little bit of energy estimates. So, and so if we're sitting on a plane, so that becomes very, very easy. So, you associated energy with domain is just a gradient of the function v to the power. So, and you take kind of, you know, I don't know how to call it, it's a pizza slice, so a slab, so of opening angle lambda. Of opening angle lambda, and one of the key observations that if you have a sector lambda with an opening angle delta, so then you have that the energy of this piece can be bounded from below by an energy of anz with. With a small corrective factor. And so, if you also know that you can bound the energy, the actual energy of the solution with an energy of an odds that's from above, then you are done. So, then you realize that your solution will be within that, so within the slap of probably a little bit smaller opening angle. Opening angle. So, in other words, if you have those two inequalities, you essentially done. So, I should stop at 25, right? Okay. So, again, so this is the story. So you have this type of pizza slice. So you reduce this pizza slice and you see that your solution will be essentially what you want. Will be essentially what you want. Okay, so again, so just to give you a little bit of a flavor of how you do that, so you can, so let's just, you know, something which is doable within a minute or so. So you can show that this inequality, that's the energy of the solution. Oops, good. That's an energy of the actual solution can be bounded by, from above, by the energy of. Above by the energy of an anzat, so with appropriate scaling. So the idea is very simple. So you take any slope of this kind, and you take a complement of it and split into pieces of delta to some appropriate power m, so which will be sufficiently large. And then you just play the game that the energy of an ANZ is clearly. And unzaz is clearly greater than an energy of a true solution, so which is an energy of a true solution on the slope, so plus energy of the complement. But the second term can be bounded from the first inequality, and then you do a little bit of algebra and you realize that that's all can be achieved. So, and then finally you. You combine all the results, so you take a couple of lemmas, so and those two lemmas tells you that you are essentially constant on the boundary of a balls of radius one plus delta one minus delta. So that lemma tells you that within the sensitive region of a sphere, so you're close to true ansats, and finally, it's a behavior of the bulk is also clear. Here with the bulk is also clear. So, if you combine all this stuff, you're going to get precisely what you want. So, the technical difficulties erase for two things. So, the first one, so we have absolutely no assumptions on the regularity of compacts, with an exception of that they must be of positive capacity. So, there is no even continuity of solution and the energy level. And the energy lemmas become substantially more involved if you get into higher dimensions. And that's, I think, my time is over, and thank you for your attention.
