So perhaps the subtitle, can you see my shared screen? Yes. So this may be a more accurate subtitle is just some questions about the chromology of SLFP. So thank you very much for inviting me. I view myself as really living in an adjacent field, and so. And so I thought perhaps the most useful thing I could contribute is simply to raise a few questions that I don't know how to solve, but that I feel that experts in the audience might be able to do, maybe even in real time. Maybe by the end of the talk, you'll have answered all my talks. So I'm going to start off with some of the motivation or the question. So my motivation, well, well, I'll So my motivation will be more global, related to number fields, but the actual questions will really be very basic ones, basic, I don't think easy, but just simple to state, about the topology of SLFP, or even just SLNFP, with quantifiers in the correct way. Okay. So let's start off by talking about congruent subgroups. So the congruent subgroup The congruent subgroup of level M is by definition the kernel of SLNZ mapping to SLNZ mod map. Various things I say could be discussed more generally for number fields, but let's just stick to the problem of set. All right, so here's a set of problem. All right, so here's a set of problem. So let n be very large and relative to, say, some integer i, then compute the cohomology group. Group H pi of say gamma n let's even say P R with coefficients say F R. So we've had some discussion already about the cohomology of SLNZ, and of course that's stable in this range, but N is big compared to I, and so that has a nice answer. So that has a nice answer, which is described at least indirectly in terms of K-theory. But when you take congruent subgroups, especially where the level is divisible by labels of the characteristic, you don't have stability. But yet there are various ways of addressing this that some of you certainly know and some of you certainly are experts about. So let's give another example, or rather an example of this. Or rather, an example of this, which is simply the case when i is equal to 1. So cohomology, h1 with trivial coefficients is simply just the homomorphisms. So h1 would just be the homomorphisms from gamma mv to f. Okay, so you just would like to compute the ability. Would like to compute the abelianization of this group. And what one knows is if n is at least free, and let me also say p is at least free, well if n is at least free, this group has the congruence subgroup property, and so all finite index subgroups are congruence. If p is near equal to 3, then you can compute the abelianization of this explicitly, and you can identify this. And you can identify this with the group gamma n mod gamma n p squared F p and now this one can compute explicitly. Let me just call it some explicit abelian group M. I guess it has, it's literally its abelian group of Zp to the probably n squared minus. To the probably n squared minus 1, but it also has an action of this quotient, which is SLN FP, which identifies M more or less with the adjoint representation, or the dual of the adjoint representation. I don't want to get my student tell too both that. Okay. So again, I think that this works for the prime 2 as well, doesn't it? It does work for the prime 2. Perhaps what they need. It does work for the Prime 2. Perhaps what maybe is not literally true for the Prime 2 is that this year is not, that's not literally the ability to say it's 2. I think I didn't know for other groups it's not so. Okay. Well, I'm happy to assume. I don't think I said anything wrong, Jeff, but anyway, they just said it wasn't true for that. Okay. And so here, so morally from maybe was originally in the context of Church and Father. Church and farm, but developed by many of you. Even though this M is certainly not stable, the description of it as the adjunct representation is, of course, a consistent description as n varies. So here's another example. If you take i is equal to 2, then Then H2 of gamma N P F P is isomorphic to F P plus wedge squared of N, where here P is now bigger than 3, and here N is big enough. I think at the end of one of yesterday's talk, there was a question raised about exactly what the stable range or the stable is the right word, but the representation stable range of the congruent subgroups. I don't know why you guys haven't answered that question yet. But that's something that should be done on. Okay. But I'm allowed to give myself the answer. Giving myself the NSP. Okay. So let me now say some further expectation, which are somewhere between a conjecture and an informal guess, is that if I take H3, this will be. This will be FA plus um no this will be m plus squared q of m. And again, here p is sufficiently large, and n is also sufficiently large. I'm always going to kind of eliminate a few small primes p, and I'm going to put myself in a stable range. And I'm going to put myself in the stable rate. And then H4 gamma n p f p will be equal to fp plus w squared m plus w to the 4m. Again, I'm going to win it as if n is large, but now I'm only going to claim this is probably going to be true for Going to claim this is probably going to be true for most people. So, what do I mean by most people? Well, let's first say p is bigger than 11. And then, if we sort of insist that, for example, p is less than 10 to the 9, we have to rule out p being equal to 1, 6, 8, 3, 4, and the following photo. And the following phone number, 2124675. And so here the point is that there are going to be some issues related to non-regular primes. So the cohomology of SL and Z, stable cohomology, of course, is related to K-theory, and therefore it's related to stable And therefore, it's related to stable to irregular primes. That gives you sort of interesting torsion. Now, if you just look at the cohomology, if you take a particular k-group and you look at its torsion, since it's a slightly j-rated group, there'll only be finitely many prions that turn up as torsion here. But in this situation, there are going to be infinitely many primes because it's not coming from a single group, but rather it's coming from a map between various groups. That might become clear in a little bit. And so the expectation. Expectation, expected number of bad primes should be approximately log log x for p less than x. But even proving anything like that is sort of completely impossible. Okay. So what I'd like to do is kind of talk about a framework for thinking about this. Thinking about this? There is a question in the chat. A question in the chat. Yeah, yeah. 163 is probably number 10 crime there. Okay. Frank? Yes. So I think it's probably not hard to prove one container that you contain these. That you contain these modules, that they're non-zero, I mean, that you contain these. Or is that not obvious to you? That is not obvious. Oh, good, okay. I'll tell you how to do it later. I rather would say that, like, as P gets bigger, it's not going to be the gener the most general state. I mean, I'm not just going to be talking about eight. I mean, I'm not just going to be talking about eight, about three specifically, or about four specifically. I've got about three and four, but you need n big enough, yeah. Okay, but you don't mean five or six, which I haven't written any. Well, I do mean the containment there, I think. Yeah, I just don't think that's good. I'll come back to Venice's comments. Okay. Okay. So here's. Okay. So here's how I do this. So as remarked before, if you just, let's just talk about H1. If I take the first cohomology with coefficients in Fp, and again I assume N is big, I get this non-trivial coefficient system M. System M, but there's a natural map between this cohomology group and the cohomology group at some congruence level. If I do the same calculation now, I also get M, but now the corresponding map, which give me a second to work out the right direction, I guess it's probably this way. This is simply just the zero map. I mean, all the cohomology. All the cohomology that I'm coming from here, it's coming from the idealization for which this group here is trivial. So if I take the direct limit, or the inverse limit of the system, at each stage I'll simply get m and they reduce to the inverse limit of h1 gamma n p to the k over k with coefficients of fp. Coefficient of F is equal to zero. And so here's a way of kind of viewing that statement. There's the cohomology of this group SLNZ, which is a kind of complicated group, but there's also cohomology of maybe these various finite quotients, which are just related to SL of a finite field or SL of a local field. And they interact in a way. And they interact in a way, and by taking this inverse limit, I am somehow stripping away one might say trivial classes. And then in the end, even though we have some complicated m that certainly depends on n, this inverse limit is, in fact, independent of n, and in particular, step n. So, more generally, I can define, some people don't like this notation, but what is what it is? But what is what it is? That we defied this. Perhaps I'll put in an N for now as the inverse limit. Now, not just as H1, but if Hi But if h i, I've gathered n3 to the k over k with coefficients in f3. So what we saw if n was big enough, because n is at least 3, that this h1 is equal to 0. And so now one has this theorem that I proved with that, is that these groups are Groups are, on the one hand, independence of n, if n is sufficiently large, and they're also finite, I mean they're finite-dimensional F3 dimensions. Sorry, can you just ask? So you really want the maps in this direction? Are they transverse? Did I just get the value? Did I just get the map on cobalt wrong? Probably died. Probably I did. What if God did what kicked it right? Yeah, so I told you I was thinking, and I had like 10 seconds to get it right. I'm mathematically dyslexic. There's only a 50% chance that I'll get any map the right way. Right, so I'll take the. Is that Is there a restriction? Yeah, yeah. A restriction? I'm not trying to get you anything sophisticated here. So I usually think about, I mean, the direct limit in both directions is zero. Maybe I wanted to say Yes, let's let list do it like this. I sorry. Maybe I was thinking ships. It's just a map and this and the natural homomorphism we use. Yeah, it's great. It's not some, don't know if fancy maps going on. Right. That's about it. Okay. Okay. The independent end. Yeah. Then it's going to be even more natural here. Of course, when I pass to the kernel of the organization, this goes to this decision. Okay. All right. And uh so for what For algebraic topologists somehow I mean one of the morals of this story is supposed to be something like this. If I take this map between groups SLZ to SLZ mod p, then I can take corresponding maps of classifying spaces, I can take corresponding maps of liquid. Take corresponding maps of the plus construction. And then I might hope that the homotopy fiber of that is something whose covology groups are giving me the cohology group of the kernel groups. Here is something kernel. I might hope I can consistently do some nice construction here to get a homotopy vibration for which the cohomology of the object on the left is the cohomology of the magneticity. But that doesn't happen, and But that doesn't happen. And this is so-called failure of excision in kick theory. And the moral of the story is that when you take this inverse limit, that this failure of excision goes away, and you get somehow the best possible situation. And so when you take this limit, this is more or less here. Here you have some, say, something that's telling you about the K-theory of Z, maybe kind of only looking at the P part, maybe to the K-theory of ZP, and then here, this turtle is something whose, on the one hand, you can think of as being a homotopy fiber here, but something else whose But something else is homology groups or homology groups are exactly now these nice finite dimensional vector spaces. Okay. And the literal statement that that's true, so in a paper I proved something approximating this, but I think Blumberg, there are, I don't, I now, this is the old boys' embarrassment of being recorded and then realizing you don't remember the names. Realizing you don't remember the names of people who actually proved the better version of the theorem. Let me see. Mandel and Blumberg, I think. You must know those things. Anyway. All right. So they proved. Yeah, so if you take the homotopy groups of these. Groups of these, then by the quilt-liquid bond trajectory, you can understand this in terms of Galois cohomology of the global fields, this in terms of Galois cohomology of the local fields, and then you get some nine-term exact sequence, just because the cohomology of these number fields have finite homological dimensions. But then this you can also interpret, you get some nine-time exact sequence, and there's another nine-time exact sequence called the Poitier-Chain exact sequence. And the homotopy groups of this are exactly the corresponding things that I can expect. Okay. But all of this is some sense more complicated than the actual question that I want to ask. So let's just think about the case what happens if P is regular. So So on the one hand, we know what the K-theory of Z is. So on the one hand, this K-theory of Z, well, maybe let's even just say look at the cohomology of SLZ is given in character C0 by this exterior algebra. This exterior algebra in degrees four and plus one, where since I'm taking SL, I've eliminated those degrees. Similarly, if you take the cohomology of SLZP, you get something for which you have cohomology in all odd degrees, except here. And now let me kind of put myself on the following range. I want to imagine here that, of course, n is very big. Of course, n is very big, so I'm in here, but I also want to just suppose that the prime p is also bigger, is also much bigger than i. And so in this range, these statements for regular primes, not only are they true somehow over q, but they're all somehow true over fp. Once you get to high enough degree, some degree around p, Some degree around p, things are somehow start to be a bit messed up in this super explicit way. But this is somehow true of fp. And then what happens also for a regular prime, in this sequence here, you get a corresponding map from this global thing to the local thing that is exactly what you expect. It somehow takes x5 to x5 rather than some multiple of x5 and x9 to x9. And so what that says is that the cohomology of this Commonology of this fiber has now something in the missing degrees, which is F2, Fp. Again, I'm doing small degrees. But now, because it's shifted by 1, it's now, this x3 becomes something in degree 2. And so now it becomes a polynomial. X6, X10, etc. Which is another way. Which is another way of saying that these completed homology groups of Fp, so P regular, well, this algebra is just literally equal to this, at least if you stay in degrees, somehow smaller than me. So for example, the fact that there's no H1 is reflecting of the congruence of a property, and so it says the completed cohomology of H2. So it says the completed cohomology of H2. Well, I told you it's bi-dimensional vector space, but here I'm telling you it's actually just FP. All right. But now with this information, you can try and go back and compute these co-emerging groups at level P by an off-child step. So let's suppose that GP is the kernel of SLN SLN and let me somehow eliminate the N's. S L Z P to S L Z O P. So it's the congruent subgroup, but now of the local group. Then you get an exact sequence, or rather a spectral sequence, is this cohomology group, this completed cohomology in a degree of j. Mapping now to h i plus j, this classical cohomology group with coefficients at A. And so now we have the following situation, is I've just told you exactly what these groups are, at least if you have a regular prime in small degrees. We know how to compute the cohomology of this group by Lazard. And these groups are somehow theoretically the interesting groups, or some groups we might be interested in. Or some groups we might be interested in computing. So, first of all, the cohomology of this group, well, this is just the exterior algebra on this m. So in h1, the abelianization of this group is just the set of n's that we had before, but the h2 is just wave squared of m, h3 is just wave p of m. So if I write down the spectral sequence, It starts to look something like this. So here I have FP M with web m with cube m, then 0, 0, 0, 0. Then this h2 is just fp again, and then m, w, which cube m, and then there's another 0. And then And then so on, like this. Okay. So, of course, this doesn't tell you how to compute this, but at least gives you a spectral. So, of course, you can start computing the terms. You know, Fp, not surprising that H0 is Fp. H1 is M, that we already somehow u by the conquered separate property. H2, already you have some work to do, because now you actually have some map that you have to say something about. But the theorem I told you. But the theorem I told you was that for H2, this is the comalt. And then my suggestion is for this H3, this is the comalt. And so more generally, what I have is the polar mix. So here's the expectation. If P is regular, then the spectral sequence is Just collapses completely. All these maps on this page, too, and all higher pages as zero. So the expectation then is the cohomology of this gamma p, Fp, well, it's just a tensor product of these two guys. So it's the exterior alpha on M tensor F P X two x six dot dot dot. Dot, dot, dot. And again, here I made it small degrees. I have a quick question. Doesn't Giff put an upper bound, and Benson was barely claiming a lower bound? Yes, that's why I said that I didn't believe Benson in general. Because I mean, no, actually, that's. My argument breaks down if you start getting too big. That's true. I just thought about it. Okay. I mean, maybe Venus would. I mean, maybe Vensel was more or less to say, argue that if you have a small pattern spectral sequence, you can start to see because of these zeros, you have to kind of get injections. All right, so this is sort of question one. This is kind of a global version of this question. And one thing about One thing about this is that it's a sort of simple enough answer that there could be sort of more structural or sort of easier reasons for why it's true. I kind of wanted to mention, I don't know if this guy, Ryogui Iwasa, who I'm not quite sure if I pronounced that name or if he is around, he actually gave a completely. He actually gave a completely different, well, I mean, completely different, but another argument that showed the stability of these completed cohomology groups using a language of I have to write it down. Yes, because I didn't really understand it. Some stability for Tor unital programs. So, but something that it seemed like, first of all, it seemed much more general. It seemed much more general than some of the kind of ad hoc arguments that we used. And it just, what always happens if you approach a subject from a different perspective, you end up with some argument, but it just might be you understood the subject well enough. Things could somehow be easy. All right. So one way to kind of test this calculation here. Calculation here is then to start to see: well, I know the cohomology here. I also know that if I take the cohomology one step further, SLFP and then HJ gamma p Fp, this should converge to Hi plus J of gamma itself with coefficients in Fp. And so And so I've somehow told you what a guess to this is, at least for kind of regular primes. And I also know what this is for regular primes. And these things are both very explicit in small degrees. So can I check a consistency check by doing this computation and somehow guessing what this spectral sequence will actually be? But in order to do this, I somehow need to say something about what the chromology of SLFP is. What is the chromology of SLFPs? And that somehow led to some of the speculations that might even be more basic and that might be somehow more approachable. Okay. But before that, I somehow want to do a little detour on a little bit of a trick. As we've also discussed in this talk, instead of taking the columnology Instead of taking the cohomologies of SLZ with coefficients in Z, I can also take it with respect to some compatible family of very algebraic representations of the group. So let me just label them. Let me call it L. So L, for example, the adjoint representation, the standard representation. Again, you need to be a bit careful to say exactly what these things are. So the first remark is that. So the first remark is that what are these groups actually going to equal? So if L is irreducible, and any irreducible willing tensor with R, kind of a system of alphabetic representation, these are somehow more or less going to be, I mean, they're finite. Once you have a non-trivial local system, there's no cohomology in characteristic zero. But therefore, if you suppose that I is small, and you If you suppose that i is small and you suppose that p is big, you literally get that these topology groups are all zero in degree bigger than zero. And well, I guess it's irreducible, so maybe we can get that in degree zero as well. So the cohabology is somehow, you don't see any cohabology even in somehow, until your degree is somehow big with relation to either P or to the local system. To the local system. Okay. But on the other hand, I could also take the completed cohomology, which is somehow this limit now of gamma p to dec of this local system. So of course, once I start introducing congruence level, it will no longer be zero. But the point is that once your level shrinks to zero, this local system now becomes trivial. And then you can run. And then you could write this as the completed homology that we computed before, tensor with L. Okay. But now, well, I also have to have an exact sequence, HI of, say, GP, HI of 10 to L, I can now start recovering this of what's happening at finite level. Of what's happening at a finite level, and you start writing down cohomology sequences that give you information about the cohomology of these local systems that have to be true if you're taking a distance system. So let me kind of give an example. Okay. I have page one of my notes I mean maybe it might even be be easier just to kind of talk about Easier just to kind of talk about already if I talk about the cohomology of this and the reduction of this mod p, already l has become trivial here. So this is somehow equal to hi of gamma. Of gamma p tends to L mod P. Okay. And I just gave a guess for what that was. But now, right, so I mean, let me go a sec. So H1 was equal to M, H2 was say equal to FP plus M, H3 was equal to dot, dot, dot. And so now I've computed. Now I've computed what these things should be, but now I can say. Width 3 is 10 plus width 3 squared, I huh? And so now I want to compute Hi of S L F T but now H of J of Of gamma p within L mod P. Okay. And this should be converging to the co-module L that I've more or less said would have to be zero in this range. And so then, so what is the spectral sequence going to be? So on the bottom, I should have. I always have to remember. Yeah. Remember, yeah, great. So on the bottom, I have this. I have 80 of SLFP L. Sorry, why does that converge to zero? So it should converge to the cohomology of gamma with coefficients in this local system L, which I basically said if P is small and L is irreducible, there just isn't anything. Right, but you don't know in this case that... No, I'm sorry. In this case, oh, I'm sorry, okay. Yeah, I'm talking about it. Yeah, so let me write this SLMZ. Yeah. That's that. This is this one. Okay, so let me write down what the spectral sequence is. H0 of SLFPL, H1 of SLFP L. H1 of SLFP L H2 of SLFP L and then here this is H0 of SLFP but now it's L tensor M and it hits H1 let me just leave it out of L tensor M H2 of L tensor M and now here I force And now here, I cause this, it's L plus L tensor web squared M dot dot dot. And so I end up with this spectral sequence that has to, and of course I'm assuming L is irreducible, that this has to be converted to zero. So somehow the first statement is that this is equal to zero. All right, but I'm assuming my local system is irreducible, so it has no invariance. But what I immediately But what I immediately get, for example, is that H1 of SLFP L is equal to 0. So somehow the claim is that the co-model of SLFP of any irreducible local system, I mean, rather the mod P reduction of some algebraic lattice appropriately normalized in some local systems should be zero. And of course there are In some local systems, should be zero. And of course, there are quantifiers that you have to bet. If I really wanted to write, say, SLNFP and Lu, so of course I would have to have P is sufficiently big with respect to 1, but I would also have to have P is sufficiently big with respect to how I'm labeling this local system as well. And so I should. And so I should get the cohomology of this is equal to this. Okay, so great. So this is zero. This is zero. So for it to continue being zero, I have to have this map here essentially being isomorphous. So I also get that H2 of SLFPL is equal to H0 of L. H0 of L tends to L. Okay. But if L is irreducible and M is also irreducible, that also means that the H2 is equal to 0, unless I have the adjoint representation. So the other prediction then is that H1 of SLFP, now H2 is equal to 0, unless L is the adjoint representation, in which case it should be F2. In which case, it should be F2. Okay, so it's not so hard. The edge of the representation, it should have an H2 because SLZ mod p squared is some central extension of SL2. Well, not central, I mean rather the obstruction for lift to splitting at is a class inside this group here. And this is equal to n, right? It could be n dual. I think it could be. I think it could be m digital. You have to be slightly careful even when you write down m, especially if m is digital by p, to get to write down the right. Because it won't be irreducible. The trace zero matrices of p by p matrices of p are not irreducible. And you have to write down the one that is coming from the correct way of writing things stably to check and get the right object there. So that one. Yes. One, yes, but if n is prime to n, you get that. So you can continue these games and you can sort of see exactly what you'd expect. And kind of here is guess one, which is wrong, is that to compute the cohomology of any irreducible, you get zero if star is odd. Star is odd, but in other degrees, you would just get h0, but now of L tensor sim, maybe I should just say 2n plus 1 is equal to 0, and H2N And H2n is equal to sim n of n. So for example, this literally is agreeing with what we did last time. If n is equal to 0, it's h0 of l. If n is equal to 1, you get it if it's m dual, and so on. But this is somehow wrong for a stupid reason, is that if it gives the wrong answer, if L is equal to FP, then certainly this is going to have lots of. This is going to have lots of invariants for larger enough n, but we know the cohomology of the stable cohomology of Fp is by Quillen just trivial, because the K groups of Fp are prime to be. So you do the next most stupid thing, which is just to get rid of those classes. So let's let R just be this metric algebra on M, but then let me quotient out by all the individual parts. By all the invariant classes, right? But there are going to be classes. So these are just the SL invariant classes. And now the conjecture is that H2N of SLFP, well, SLFPL is zero and H is twon SLFP L. SLFP L is equal to H0 of L tensor R. Okay. And so all this is coming exactly from several layers of sort of kind of speculation, I mean, that you can prove in small degrees, and assuming things are true, and then kind of assuming you have some consistency here. And of course, I'm being sloppy here, right? I'm being sloppy here, right? For these things to be true, I certainly, if I literally want to make statements here, of course, let me put an n here, an n here. And then I certainly want this to be true for p, it's much bigger than n, n is much bigger than 1, maybe n as well. And then finally, if I kind of take any way of measuring this local system, this algebraic system. This algebraic system with respect to, say, various partitions, that also C should be big with respect to that as well. Okay. So these calculations, so I'm now out of time, so I'm not going to write anymore. If you look for calculations of this labor, the only place I've seen them is Dwyer and Friedlander a long time ago were trying to compute the KP. We're trying to compute the k-theory, even small degrees of z mod t squared. And so exactly, even in my paper, when I'm trying to do these calculations, you end up trying to sort of exactly compute these things to, I mean, they come up in a natural way. But this is sort of almost going backwards. I sort of feel that I mean this is sufficiently simple that it it may well be true for kind of quite possibly quite trivial. Quite trivial, but I certainly don't really kind of my field of expertise, but maybe someone will kind of be able to instruct that in a better way. Apologies for going away in time. My talk talk. I think we can take questions both over Zoom and Questions both over Zoom and in the meeting room, so please raise your hand and/or just type up if you have a question for Frank. I have a couple of stupid questions. I am afraid, but well, maybe. But well, maybe going backwards, where did suddenly the system of M come from? I thought we had X of N M or N M. So in these kind of spectral sequences? I mean I think that's what I did. Yeah, I'm confusing myself I mean Let me just I think that I'm not telling you a lie, but I it's a bit hard to do since the only example I kind of did is the case where in which n is equal to 1. It's hard to kind of verify from this example. I thought it came directly out of the spectral sequence and there it looked more like you would get an exterior power than a symmetric power. That's why I was concluded at all. Well, so what's happening on one row is you're getting What's happening on one row is you're getting these exterior powers, right? But it's not the case that the spectral sequence that's degenerating by saying that everything in the middle is zero and the thing up on the left. Right. If it were the case that the spectral sequence is degenerating and like this is all zero and so therefore this is equal to this, like here you have interior powers, but there's a bit of a less. But there's a bit of a mess going on in the middle. So it's roughly the statement that if the fiber is exterior and the total space is attractable, then the basis is phenomenal. Something like this is. That would be a fancy way of setting it. No, okay, I understand. I've seen that before. Thank you. Thank you. But uh so I had a question about the uh nature of this second guess. So the first guess that the manager took is that in your complete multispectral sequence, like differentials are zero. And is the second guess I mean is that basically equivalent to like in this other spectral differential criteria? I don't want to claim it's equivalent, but But I mean using it you can kind of guess using it you can say you can guess what that's what the spectral sequence from from level kind of gamma p down to gamma will be. And it's in fact quite far from being quite zero. It's something that in fact these differentials are In fact, these differentials are in fact all it's almost the kind of the maximal transgressions in which it's finally killed, like something on line one and something like this. I mean, I think that exactly this picture that you're saying of kind of taking this total space and doing this thing, this is a model for what you have. I'm not sure how serious this would take to take the. It's not like I feel the path to get to this guess is sort of the right way of looking at it. But it's a bit more like... If you're trying to compute something and then you come up and the answer seems to be very simple, then it might well be this just a kind of simple way of kind of doing it. But my access to understanding the problem I do SLFP is just it's a bit, you know, it's sort of It's a bit, you know, it's sort of. I'm doing it in a backwards way by kind of, oh, let's compute the code model to some very complicated mathematicians using K-theory and to do some local statements. So of course that's a secret way of doing it, but I don't know a better way. I mean, I tried to look at how Quillum computed the cohomology of FP and say, well, can you use those arguments to compute the homology of F? And I didn't get anyone. But then I don't. I mean, the co-modern SLSP is something that's a bit weird. I mean, statements in the literature are kind of addressing almost the opposite range of the question, where you're sort of looking not in a range. So here the point is that this N is really, really big. As opposed to P being B compared to N, N is somehow really big compared to P. And so I haven't. I haven't really observed the considering this group before. So of course it could be really hard, but maybe it's also low-hanging fruit. Someone you have to kind of think about and work out. That's why I put that high basis. Are there any other questions? I'll have room for a bit. Twelve o'clock note and ask this question. The next talk is at 2K0 Mountain Time, which I guess is a half an hour. Yes, we're in half an hour.
