The third speaker to this morning this evening maybe is afternoon. Unless it is morning. So anyway, the third speaker is Professor Ke Yuxin from University of Toulouse. His title is unconformally combined enzyme variables. So please. So thanks the introduction of Jia Yu. So today I will talk about some on the conformal compact engine manifolds. So it's some joint program with Alice and I will present some new results. Present some new results with Alice and Qing Ji and Jing. So first I would like thanks for the invitation of organizer. Let's begin to the topic. I try to give some example. So we consider the hyperbolic space with Hyperbolic space with the unit ball model. So, this matrix can be written as a conformal factor 4 over 1 minus norm of x squared times the Euclidean matrix. So for this hyperbolic space, we can define a function R and closure of the unit ball. This function is given by the This function is given by the formula 1 minus norm of x over y plus and the norm of x. This function is infinity on the closed ball except the zero. And this function is positive in the open ball and vanish on the boundary. Moreover, Moreover, if we time R square with the hyperbolic matrix, we can get a compact manifold with boundary. This matrix just gives by this formula. Moreover, for this defined function R, we know that the gradient of R for this new matrix G bar on the boundary On the boundary, this gradient of i is equal to one everywhere. So, in some words, for the hyperbolic space, we call this is a conformal compact enzymatic. So, I will give the more general definition for the conformally compact manifold. So, we consider X d bar is D bar is some compact differential manifolds of dimension D. Its boundary is just naught by m is d minus one manifold. So Riemannian metric G plus in the integral of X is said to be conformal compact if we can find a regular We can find a regular function r defined on the closure of x, which is positive on x and vanish on the boundary of x. Moreover, the gradient of r is different to the zero on the boundary. Moreover, g bar may G bar matrix equal to R squared times G plus. This matrix is compact manifold with boundary. So for the G plus metric, we compactify with some defined function R, which defined function R is related to the boundary of X. Of X. So for the conformal or compact manifolds, we know that the compactification G bar is restriction on the dungeon boundar on the boundary is invariant of G plus. So this conformal class, it doesn't depend on the choice of defined function. Defined function. So, this conformal class on the boundary we call the conformal infinity. Moreover, for the G plus matrix, we can calculate the remaining curvature. This remaining curvature is just minus the gradient R is normal square with respect to G bar metric times norm is Q. product the G plus with itself plus some high order arrow so the gradient of R this quantity is norm for the G bar metric in fact this quantity is independent of choice of the defined function r or for example for the standard hyperbolic space Standard hyperbolic space with the compatification that we conceived before is conforming infinity is just a standard metric on the unit ball up to a constant. So we called a conformity compact manifold is a conformity compact instead manifold if is a Manifold if is a conforming compact manifold and moreover is an Einstein matrix. That means the rich curvature is constant times the matrix. So for the conformal compact answer matrix, automatically we have the gradient or gradient of R is norm on the boundary is equal to one everywhere on the boundary. Boundary. So here we consider a mapping from the set of conformal compact asymmetric to the conformal class on the boundary. That is each conformal compact asymmetric way relate to the conformal infinity. So this The motivation to study such a manifold comes from the correspondence between the theory of ADS and the conformal fuse theory. Moreover, for the geometry point of view, we try to understand the structure of non-compact asymptotic hyperbolic Einstein metric. So we here we are interested in the following question is just the map concept before we want to know if this map is proper or not. That means if we have the compactness for the conformal infinity, we try to know if we have the compactness for the C. Compactness for the cis conformal compact anti metric. So, before the give the results, we try to give some definition and the proposition. So, for given a conformal compact einstein matrix and the h is one of the representative for the conformal infinity, we can find. We can find a unique defined function r in the neighborhood of boundary such that the restriction of g bar is just this given on the boundary is just h and moreover the norm of gradient of r is equal to one in the neighborhood of boundary m so for such So for such defined function R, it's called the spatial defined function or the geodesic defined function. For the geodesic defined function, we are very nice expansion for the G plus matrix. That means in the neighborhood of the boundary M, G plus can be write as D R square plus G R over R square. Over R square. So G R is just a family of metric on M, the boundary of X, is a family of metrics which depend on the parameter R. For example, for the standard hyperbolic space, so R of X given before is a geodesic defined function. For this geodesic defined function, the define function, the family of metric GR can be written as one minus R square or square times the standard metric on the unit ball, unit sphere. So for the expansion for the GR so we have this nice expansion so when the dimension of X When the dimension of X is even, this family of metric GR can be written as the first term is just a metric H plus the even order up to G D minus one times R times R with power D minus one. So all this even coefficient G two up to G G2 up to G D minus 2 is locally determined by the H and G D minus 1, this matrix and boundary is a non-local term, which is trace-free and division-free, but it cannot be. Determined locally by H. For the D order, the expansion is similar. So we have the even power up to order D minus one. From D minus one, we have tensor K times R times power D minus one. D minus one times log r. This k is anonymy tensor. We have also g d minus one times r d minus one. So as for the even case, g two up to g with d minus d minus two is locally. Two is locally determined by H. K is also determined locally by H. The choice of this non-local term is determined by H, but the choice-free part is not determined by H locally. So So I will first present the result in the four dimensions in the dimension four. So let's X4 is a conforming compact einstein metric with boundary M. So we consider some compactification G bar such that the boundary is totally geodesic. In such case, we define some S tensor on the find some S tensor on the dungeon bound of boundary. S is just the normal derivative of Squirton tensor on the boundary. So we have also another non-local curvature is Q3 curvature. We suppose that compactification G bar is Q4 flat metric. That means Q4 curvature is zero. Uh, curvature is uh zero, so that means the scalar curvature satisfy and the rich curvature satisfies this second elliptic PDE. In such case, the q3 curvature is just a constant times the normal derivative of scale curvature on the boundary. So for the CC conformal come back instant, Uh, conformal come back and stand metric X4. Uh, we have that the S tensor we define is just after a constant, it's just the non-local time G3. Moreover, this S tensor is also a local conformal invariant. So we have several global conformal invariants, the integral of S tensor, integral of where tensor X and And integral of Q3 curvature on the boundary. So we define some special compactification. That means for the defined function, we suppose it serves this second PDE. That means the minus Laplacian of log rho is equal to 3. So for this special defined function row, we have the We have the metric GE is just rho square times G plus is a metric with Q4 QR 3. That means the Q Q4 QA is equal to zero. So this metric we call the fifth man grams competitive. Our MAM presult MAM result in four dimensions is the following. It's a result with Alice and in Result with Alice and improve later with Alice and Qingjie. So we suppose the conformal infinity topologically is S3. We have the family of conformal compact Einstein metric and Gi is a fifth man grams competition. We suppose a topologic condition is just a second homologic group of X with coefficient Z is trivial. That is trivial. We suppose that conformal condition on the boundary is just the Yamabe invariant is uniformly bounded from below by some positive constant C1. We have some extra boundary condition. It's just the S tensor is weakly compact in L1, or the negative path of Q3 curvature. path of Q3 curvature is weakly compacted in L1. In such case, if the conformal infinity Hi is bounded in CK alpha Doblush, when we suppose that S tensor is K is bigger than 3, or with the condition for the Q3 curvature, we need to suppose K is bigger than C. Suppose k is bigger than 7. In such case, the fifth man grams complication as compact in Goromov, Hostov sense in the space CK alpha prime with alpha prime smaller than alpha up to the gauge. So we try to because we have some Because we have some extra condition on the non-local time, so the second result is we try to remove non-local time, non-local time condition. This is a result with Alice and Qingjie. We suppose the boundary is S3. We have a family of fifth micrograms competitive G. I. If we suppose If we suppose conformal infinity is very close to the Yamabe invariant on the standard sphere S3. Then if the boundary metric is compact in CK alpha toblosh, with k is bigger than 3, then we have the compactness result for the 5 grams compatification. So, as the application, we try to prove some global uniqueness results. It's a result with Alice Qingje. So, we suppose that we work on the unit ball with the boundary S3. If H is a metric in S3 of the in class C K R. In class C K alpha, with K is bigger than 3, if the H is very close to the standard metric on S3, then the field metric inside with the conformal infinity H is unique in the class of CK alpha prime, with alpha prime is smaller than alpha. Prime is smaller than alpha. Now I present some news results in the high dimension. So this is a recent result with Alice, Qingjie and Jin Xiao San. So we consider some special defined function row which serves this second out PDE. A second odd PDE in X. So from this compactification log square times G plus the Q4 QR chain is free. So we call this metric is generalized fifth man grams competition. So our result about compactness result is generalization. A generalization for the dimensions for we suppose the Xd is of dimension D and the boundary is just a sphere of the dimension D minus one. We have a family of conformal compact Einstein metrics or Gi is just the fifth man gram compatification. We suppose We suppose conformal infinity condition is just the Yamabay invariant on the conformal class H I is very close to the standard, the Yamabe invariant and the standard field. If the metric HI on the boundary is bounded in C5 gamma, in such case we can prove that the fifth man gram computation is compact in is compact in C3 alpha up to a diffeomorphism with alpha is smaller than gamma. Moreover, even if we suppose the dimension D is even, we can improve the regularity. That means if Hi is regular in CK gamma with K is bigger than D minus 2, we have the The regularity of Gi. Moreover, this family is compact in CK alpha with alpha is smaller than gamma. So this improved regularity in the odd dimension is not possible. So as the application, we prove that some uniqueness results that means Uniqueness result that means if the conformal infinity the Yamabe invariant is very close to the Yamabe invariant on the standard sphere or the where tensor in L D over 2 norm is small, then the field metric of conformal compact answer metric with conformal infinity H is unique, is growth. Unity H is unique, is a global uniqueness result. So I gave some idea of the proof. The difficulty to prove this result is about is a critical problem. We have also the non-local time and also we have the gauge invariance. So to overcome this came this This came this difficult. We use a regularity result and we do the blow-up analysis. So the main step is the following, the seven. So here I will give some idea for the regularity result on the boundary in the high dimension. So the boundary regularity we use in the papers. Papers, Chu Shoe Deny, Lear Skinner, and also in the Olivier Picard Echnis paper, we use some gauge-Einstein equation. That means after a diffeomorphism phi, G plus serves this second old elliptic PDE. So here, this condition is just a gauge fixed condition. The first part is just a Einstein equation. So we suppose that Hi, the bottom metric, is compact in C5 alpha space. And we suppose that we have the G G I is a fifth man gram competition. We consider also a We consider also a possibility metric Ti is just we have the first two terms of the expansion of CC metric. So we solve that we take Ti is just approximate metric. So the first step is to prove some existence some local gauge. So that means we can find a C2 alpha diffeomorphism around some neighborhood of P, P is on the boundary of X, which serve the gauge-Einstein metric. Moreover, we have a control of C2 alpha norm of the diffeomorphism. The second step is about the epsilon regularity. We prove that. Gravity, we prove that after the diffeomorphism, this metric rho i square times the phi pullback of G plus times Ti, which in C3 alpha norm is bounded. So the last step is that we will go back to the fifth man grams compatibility. We prove that for this for initial For initial Fifth Man Gram metric, which is C3 alpha norm is bonded. So here we compute the regularity of the fifth man gram confidentiation on the boundary. So this is the main step in the recent work. So thank you for your attention. So, thank you for your attention. Thank you, Professor Yushin. Thank you. So, any questions?
