Okay, great. So, hi, everyone. My name is Celine Jessa. I'm a PhD student in Dr. Claudia Kleiman's lab at McGill in Montreal. And today I'll be talking about our work to use data-driven approaches to identify the origins of pediatric brain tumors. So, switching gears a little bit to talk about the application of some of these methods. So, what makes pediatric brain tumors unique from adult brain tumors is two key things. Brain tumors is two key things. One is that their driver mutations are often related to epigenetics and development. And so these tumors can be stratified into several molecular subtypes, and each of which is basically universally characterized by one or two mutations, frequently in developmental pathways or epigenetic regulators. The second interesting thing is that these tumors have very distinct spatial and temporal distributions in the developing brain. So different subtypes of mobile. So, different subtypes of molecular brain tumors occur in specific brain regions and in specific windows. They present in specific windows during development. So these together point to the idea of cell of origin or the cell from which each tumor originates. And so I'm going to make a bit of a simplification here, but I just want to introduce some of the main cell types in the brain. At the top of the heart hierarchy, we have our most primitive cells, the radial glia. These are basically the stem cells of the brain. Are basically the stem cells of the brain. They give rise to lineage-restricted progenitors that are often cycling, and those in turn give rise to all of the differentiated cell types of the brain. So we have our neurons, which are our circuitry-forming cells, and then we have glial cell types, which include oligodendrocytes that produce myelin, and we have astrocytes that contribute to homeostasis in the brain. So, our model for the origin of pediatric brain tumors is that there are spaces. Tumors is that there are spatio-temporally restricted cell types in the developing brain that are uniquely susceptible to specific genetic alterations, which alter normal neurodevelopmental gene expression programs. And ultimately, that's what leads to tumor formation. But the challenge is that for many types of pediatric brain tumors, this cell of origin is unknown. And the reason it's important for the study of these tumors is really for three main reasons. One is to understand Reasons. One is to understand tumor biology, to understand how these tumors form. Second is if we know the cell of origin, we can inform the design of animal models so that they more faithfully represent what we see in patients. And third, if we know the cell types from which these tumors originate, we could identify therapeutically targetable programs and pathways. But the challenge is that identifying cell of origin is typically very time and labor. A very time and labor-intensive process that involves experimentally scanning different progenitor regions and possible cell types for tumor formation. So the focus of our work and of my PhD has been to devise a strategy to use data-driven approaches to systematically identify cell of origin in pediatric brain tumors. And so this has two parts that fit together like puzzle pieces. The first is to assemble a reference data set. To assemble a reference data set at single cell resolution for all of the brain regions where these tumors actually arise. And the second is then to computationally integrate patient data, patient transcriptomic data with this reference to identify cell of origin. So I'll jump into the first part. Over the last few years, we've been working on generating a reference of gene expression in the developing brain at single cell resolution. So we've profiled two time points, the forebrain. Time points: the forebrain and the brainstem. Sorry, two regions, forebrain and brainstem. These are regions where the tumors we study arise, and we've profiled them at nine different developmental time points. And we've chosen these time points because they span many major developmental events that are relevant for these tumors. So as everyone knows, what we get by doing single-cell RNA-seq on these tissues is basically an estimation of the expression of every single gene in thousands. Every single gene in thousands of individual cells in each sample. And from there, we can cluster these into distinct cell populations and perform a number of other downstream analyses. So here's an overview of our reference. It comprises about 100,000 cells from 300 different cell populations. And so in this tree, every leaf is one single cell population, and they're clustered by their gene expression similarity. And so you can see that. Similarity. And so you can see that these single cell populations then cluster into major cell types that we find in the brain. We can also infer additional information from the single cell expression data, like the activity of transcription factors. So in this plot below, every row represents one transcription factor, and the colored bubbles represent their activation levels. So you can see that for many transcription factors, there's very cell type-specific activation. Activation. These are also really rich data sets where we uncover a lot of not only distinct cell states, but continuous transitions. And so as an example, this is one neuronal lineage from the brain. And what we've done is used the method monocle to reconstruct pseudotime. And pseudotime is basically an inferred variable that represents each cell's progress along some continuous biological process. Some continuous biological process in this case, it's differentiation. So, in these plots, these are TSNE plots of cells from the mouse cortex. Every point is one cell, and we're highlighting the cells that belong to this neuronal lineage at each time point, and then the inferred pseudo-time. And we can also confirm that gene markers of this lineage in the literature have their expected expression patterns. And then finally, we can model the expression of different genes along this continuum. Of different genes along this continuous differentiation process, so that we not only know which gene is expressed in which cell type, but we also have their dynamics over time. Okay, so now I'll switch gears and talk about how we're leveraging this reference to then identify cell of origin in pediatric brain tumors. So, having assembled this reference, we next profiled pediatric brain tumors using both single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq. RNA-seq. And we start here from an assumption that these tumors, even after transformation, will retain some transcriptional features of their cell of origin. And so based on this assumption, then we can turn this into a computational problem, which is to quantify the tumor similarity to cell types from the normal developing brain and also to extract the common transcriptional features. And so we've used a number of different methods. Used a number of different methods to do this, to answer this computational problem, including enrichment approaches, machine learning, matrix factorization. And we've applied these really successfully in several different questions for cancer biology. So first off, to validate the use of this reference atlas to study brain tumor biology, we first ask whether the cell type specific information in our reference is really informative for tumor biology. informative for tumor biology. And so we started from a data set, a bulk RNA-seq data set of almost 200 brain tumors and profiles of the normal brain. And the way we used our reference here is from every single cell cluster from the mouse brain, we derived its gene markers through a differential expression analysis. And then we filtered these down to signatures of 100 genes. So now we have a collection of cell type specific gene signatures for hundreds of cell populations in the normal developed. Of cell populations in the normal developing brain. And then, using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis applied to our bulk gene expression from the tumors, we can evaluate the enrichment of every cell type-specific gene signature in each tumor or bulk transcriptome. And that essentially can act as a similarity score between cell types and patient samples. And then we use these scores as input for a dimensionality reduction like TSNE. So in this figure, TSNE. So in this figure, every point is one sample. And what we find is that based on these cell type features or cell type similarity scores, we can separate samples both by age. So we have adult brain and fetal brain. And we can also separate samples into various types of pediatric brain tumors. So at this point, this tells us that the information contained in these cell type-specific signatures is actually relevant for tumor biology. Tumor biology. So, I'm going to talk for the remaining of my talk about three specific cases where we've applied this approach. The first is WINT subtype medulloblastoma. So, medulloblastomas are typically cerebellar tumors, but this particular cell type is thought to arise in a progenitor domain of the brainstem. It's called a lower rhombic lip. And the lower rhombic lip gives rise to three different neuronal populations that all could be the cell of origin of wait medulloblastoma. So, our question was, So, our question was: What is the cell? What is the cell of origin? And for this problem, we had bulk RNA-seq data for 10 medulloblastoma samples. And for each, from our single-cell atlas, from our reference, we calculated the mean transcriptome of each cluster. And so, in this case, we framed it as a deconvolution problem where we assume our tumor bulk transcriptomes are mixtures of pure cell types and that our pure cell type is a type of type. Of pure cell types, and that our pure cell types are present in this reference data set. So, we can then use a deconvolution method like CyberSort, which will estimate for each mixture or each bulk tumor sample the cell type fractions in that sample. And Cybersort does that using a linear support vector regression. So, these are the results of Cybersort. In this heat map, every row is one tumor sample, and every row is a Is one tumor sample and every column is one cell type from our reference. And what we found is that Cybersort estimated almost all Wayne-Mitchelloblastoma samples to have a really specific match to this MOSI fiber neuron population in particular. And when we looked at transcription factors that are known from the literature experimentally to regulate development of this population, we found that they were highly expressed by bulk RNA-seq in Wint Medgiloblastoma compared to other brain tumors we looked at. Other brain tumors we looked at. So, in this case, our cyber sword analysis allowed us to exclude two of the possible lineages that could have given rise to these tumors as the likely cell of origin. Okay, so the second case I'll talk about is high-grade gliomas with G34 R and B mutations in histone H3, which is a histone protein involved in chromatin regulation. The main things to know about this tumor type is that they occur in the brain. About this tumor type is that they occur in the brain cortex and they're very histologically heterogeneous. So, even though they're called gliomas and thought to arise in glial cells under the microscope, they're very heterogeneous. They have a glial component and also a neuronal component, and so they're frequently misdiagnosed. And so, in this tumor, we were trying, in this project, we were trying to resolve this and understand what is the cell of origin. So, here we had bulk RNA-seq data for 56 samples across different gliomes. 56 samples across different glioma subtypes. And because many glioma subtypes can be quite transcriptionally similar, we focused, we tried to use a comparative approach where we focus on the strongest differences between these G34 gliomas and all of the others we were considering. So we performed a differential expression analysis between G34 gliomas and each other glioma type, and then we used our cell type-specific gene signatures as input for a gene strain. As input for a gene-spread enrichment analysis. And so this then tells us the enrichment basically of each cell type-specific signature in G34 gliomas compared to each other tumor type. So in this figure, every row is going to be one comparison, G34 gliomas versus several related glioma subtypes, and every column is one cell type from our normal developmental reference. And what we found is that G34... And what we found is that G34 gliomas had this enrichment of signatures from radial glial cells, neuronal progenitors, and inhibitory neurons, and a depletion of signatures from other cell types in the brain, including excitatory neurons and olivaglial cells. And this particular cell type, inhibitory neurons, is very well studied. There are transcription factors that are well known to regulate its differentiation. And again, when we looked at the expression of those transcription, And again, when we looked at the expression of those transcription factors, this is Bulkar NASIC, G34 gliomas highly and exclusively express these neuronal transcription factors. And so I have gliomas italicized and underlined here because what was surprising about this result is that these tumors were thought to arise in glial cells, and yet the transcriptional signatures reflected this origin or similarity to a neuron cell type in the brain. All right. All right, so the last case I'll talk about is high-grade gliomas with K27M mutations in histone H2.1 or H3.3. It's the same gene I just talked about, but different mutations. These tumors are postulated to arise in a glial cell type, oligodendrocyte precursor cells. And even though we have the same mutation occurring in genes, in two different genes that occur in encode similar proteins, they have very distinct. They have very distinct spatial and temporal distribution. So, our question in this project was to understand if tumors with H3.1 mutations versus H3.3 mutations have a different cell of origin. And in this study, we profiled samples by single-cell RNA sequencing. So in single-cell RNA-seq, the gene expression variation could relate to cell type identity, but it could also ostensibly relate to other biological and cancer-related pathways. Related pathways. So we started with an unbiased approach here, where we use a matrix factorization algorithm called consensus NMF, which decomposes the single cell expression matrix into a matrix of variable gene expression programs and a gene scores matrix, like a loadings matrix. But there's no input here that's related to cell type or cell identity. And we ran this for each individual sample. And then we computed the pairwise similarity between all of the sample. Computed the pairwise similarity between all of the variable programs from all of the samples, did some clustering, and that resulted, that allowed us to identify metaprograms, which are basically sets of recurrent variable programs across samples. And then at that point, we can incorporate external information like gene sets from databases or our cell type-specific signatures to annotate these programs and figure out what is their biological relevance. Okay, so in doing this, we identified 10 metaprograms. And so at the top annotation here, every column is one program from one sample. And the heat map is showing the NMF score or the loadings for some of the top genes for each program. And then in the dot plot below, I've correlated the amount of ribosomal gene expression or the cell cycle score for each program. And what that allows us to do is identify certain programs. us to do is identify certain programs that are highly related to quality or cell cycle. So program one is related to high ribosomal content, program three related to cell cycle. And then we calculated the overlap of all of our cell type specific gene signatures from our reference with these gene expression programs. And we found that most of the other meta-programs actually related to cell identity. So even though these are transformed tumors, most of the variability Tumors, most of the variability within each sample, most of the gene expression variation within each sample, was actually related to cell identity and cell differentiation. So finally, to confirm this, we used a supervised analysis to investigate tumor heterogeneity. And so we used our single cell reference atlas as our labeled reference matrix. So for every cell, we have the annotated cell type, and our tumor gene expression matrices are our testing matrices. And we're looking to figure out. Matrices, and we're looking to figure out for each single cell what is its most similar cell type in our reference. And for that, we developed a pipeline with three methods, SVM, a correlation approach, and CYBET, which uses maximum likelihood estimation. We took a consensus of these predictions. So now for every tumor cell, we have its most similar normal cell type or a no-consensus. And we did this for all cells in our tumor data set. Cells in our tumor data set. So these are the results. In this figure, the UMAP is a dimensionality reduction of all of the tumor samples of the H3.3 mutant gliomas. Every point is one cell, and they're colored by their cell type prediction. And at the bottom, the bar plots are a breakdown of the cell type predictions for each individual sample. And what we found for this tumor type is that the cell type prediction pipeline indicated a high similarity with the olive. High similarity with the oligodendrocyte lineage, which is pretty consistent with what was expected for this tumor type. However, when we looked at the H3.1 samples, in many of the samples, we found a similar profile with these lime green oligodendrocyte precursor cells, but our cell type predictions also indicated a small subset of samples that contained ependymal cells, which are another glial cell type, which have a totally different function in the brain, lining the brain cavities. So in this case, So, in this case, the cell type predictions at the single cell level indicated different distributions of cell types in each tumor type, which could be consistent with a different cell of origin. And so, I won't go into it here, but in the remainder of this study, we tried to focus on which specific subtypes of oligodendrocytes could be related to each of these tumors, and we could show that they did indeed have distinct cells of origin. So, overall, what I've talked about today is developing I've talked about today is developing an annotated time course single-cell RNA-seq atlas for the developing mouse brain. It's a really rich data set with discrete cell types, continuous cell transitions, and we've also inferred transcription factors and regulatory networks. I also presented a strategy for how to systematically identify the cell of origin in pediatric brain tumors using transcriptomics data and how we're leveraging a number of different computational methods. Different computational methods. And I mentioned three specific cases where we've identified or refined the cell of origin in tumor types using this approach. So everything I presented today was focused on transcriptome data, but we also have a large collection of epigenome profiles, so ChIP-seq for histone marks and so on on these tumors. And so we're also working on incorporating epigenomic data to expand the type of features. Data to expand the type of features we can consider in this strategy. The second thing we're doing is now that we've identified cell of origin in certain pediatric brain tumors, we can go the next step to figure out why those tumors are vulnerable to the specific drivers that initiate those tumors. And then finally, with our collaborators, now that we have refined cell of origins, we can also use these to design better animal models where we target the specific populations that Where we target the specific populations that we hypothesize to be their cell of origin. And so, with that, I want to thank my supervisor, Dr. Kleiman, and all of the members of the lab. And all of the work I presented today was done in really close collaboration with Dr. Nada Chabato, also at McGill. And yeah, I'll be happy to take any questions at this time.
