Thank you so much. Okay, so A, for telling me down as scrollers. All right, well, let's go. So this is to work with Vince and Miriam. Here they are at Tasson U in Maryland on a sunny day in November. And we have a free grant on archive, products with classes and final searches. I apologize about my voice. My voice, I got sort of three or four viruses in a row, none of which were COVID. I didn't even know there were that many. I do now. And yeah, because they have to be different, right? If you get one after the other, so like you can sort of deduce. Anyway, I'll just try to pretend. Okay, so this talk is very much an overview. It looks like a lot of slides, but I think they go pretty quickly. So just a little history of partition properties that we'll be talking about. That we'll be talking about. And the prior work that Vince and Marian did, so I kind of jumped on this project sometime during the pandemic, and they had already had a paper together, and we were sort of expanding on those results. And then lastly, the things that we did. So all structures I'm going to talk about are going to be in a relational language. And when I say homogeneous, I mean ultra-homogeneous. So there's this notion of indivisible. So I guess this word is from the theory of relations, but Theory of relations, but related to another word defined by labor in 73. Okay, maybe it goes back further than that. But what we mean by indivisible is that if you partition the structure into two sides, so one side contains an x-ray cosmic. And then El Sa Har and Sauer approved um some equivalent conditions for something they call age indivisibility. Again, it's their word, but the notion was previously studied. Previous studies. And so I think if this definition, S is A to indivisible, if you partition the structure into two sides, one side, again, relational, right? So you can think of each side as a substructure. One side has the age of the original structure, which is equivalent to the notion that had been used previously, where, like, sort of, you take the structure and look at its age, and every element of the age. Every element of the age has a rounded structure for it. So these two in blue are equivalent. What that means is this other finite structure who's a bit bigger, if you partition that one, one side will embed a copy of A. So let's take this second one as our definition of indivisibility for a class. Because really you can state it for a class that isn't an age. So I'll give you an example. So, I'll give you an example. Consider the finite language, right? We have a red edge and a blue edge. And we're going to take the class of all graphs. So something is in the class if it only has red edges or only has blue edges. It fails joint embedding because you can't take red and blue and put them together. Nothing political. You can't put them together. And there's no actually infinite structure with this as an H. Still, you. Still, you can make this work out, right? Because given an A, A sort of, because it's party affiliation, a letter blue, and then because the class of graphs is indivisible, there is P. That works for A. PR ease PR. Oh, such a, oh yes, I'm sorry, P. So A embeds into one side of B. So some examples. So, some examples. So, the K and Free Henson graphs were shown by Henson to be weakly indivisible. I won't define it, which implies age indivisible. And meanwhile, the triangle-free Henson graph was shown by Rudol and Comyat to be indivisible, structured itself. And then that was extended by Elsa Harris to all the HN. You can look at the case of the rational order. It can easily be shown to be indivisible. In fact, there is an extension of. In fact, there is an extension of this notion, symmetrically indivisible, studied by Hassan, Kodjer, and Munchus. So I won't be talking about that kind of indivisibility, but I do need to mention that there is a composition structure that was defined in this paper that was further studied by Nada Maire. And we actually considered this product not for structures, so Mare is doing it for structures, but we did it for classes. So Mare had she. So, Mare had shown that the Lex product of indivisible structures is indivisible. So, we're looking for that kind of result, but for classes of structures which may not themselves be an age. Okay, so in the meantime, more definitions. So, an indivisible structure, you can see from those two blue equivalent conditions, it's quite clear that an individual structure would be age indivisible. Aging at this point, but not so vice versa. So I think this is kind of nice to think about. These equivalence relations, what I like to think about is they're giving you the columns and the rows of a grid. So I guess the first coordinate maybe is the columns, and then the second coordinate is the rows. So the age of this infinite structure is indivisible. Actually, the structure itself is not indivisible. Actually, the structure itself is not indivisible. You can color it according to the diagonal. So color red above the diagonal and colour below. And you'll have a hard time finding infinite structures that's all red and all cool. And this leads to a lot of other sort of pleasant questions and thoughts. And I had been asking Bill Desart at Maryland like what he knew about bigger grids, right? Like continuum sized grids. Continuum size grids. Use countably many colors. Can you get a countable copy inside? So, anyway, there's been a lot of work on this, so they had directed me to some papers. Well, anyway, if you're interested, but I thought it was nice to just thank Yusuin Chu, who recently did a PhD with Hindra Zapoto and extended these types of results. Of results. So, this idea of using a grid is very much not new, and there's a lot of new exciting stuff happening. Okay, so another notion, so this word definable self-similarity is something that Vince and Miriam used, and it give a definition here. So, a structure, like an infinite structure, is definably self-similar, and you could modify that with quantifiers. Similar, and you could modify that with quantifier free for any finite set of parameters and complete non-algebraic type over that set, or add quantifier free if that's what you're talking about. And the realizations of the type are actually isomorphic to the original. So for example, you can do this in the random graph. And so I think this property hasn't been studied. hasn't been studied, has yet to be explored when you don't eliminate quantifiers. So maybe why don't we think that the usual application is quantifier elimination. So and that's what they were studying classes of structures in a finite relational language, a strong malignation of property, and looking at the force limits so that the algebraic closure of a set was solved. So they call that algebraically trivial k. So actually in this context, So, actually, in this context, with S the limit of this class, just definingly self-similar is equivalent to a property of the infinite structure that Sauer stated in the appendix, which implies that S is infinite. So it looks like this property is related to indivisibility. That's a bit stronger. So, okay, so all definably self-summer, for self- of the algebraically true. Limits of the algebraically contributed classes are indivisible. It includes familiar structures that we know to be indivisible, like the rational order, the radograph. But then, if you want to look at the gaps, this is not an ethnomia. The triangle-free Hansen graft is indivisible. We stated it's not definably self-similar. So in fact, Sauer has a paper on the archive where he gives lots of great examples. And one is: like, look at this type of just being related to an element. Being related to an element, all the people related to the element, not going to have any edges in this type. So it couldn't be that the realizations of this type are isomorphic to the original. Okay, so lots of nice properties. Why were they studying this? So they had this notion of configuration, which is sort of generalization or simplification of something that Vince had done with Cameron Hill previous. So the context is a relationship. So the context is a relational language L0 and a class of finite L0 structures closed under isomorphism. And you actually don't need much more, which is kind of nice. I'm not saying I need the RAMSI property. I'm not saying I need amalgamation embedding. Just starting with a class, the configuration is what it would mean if sort of the elements in this class were. The elements in this class were definable, or definable in your model N, but not that it's interpretation. So for anybody in the signature, you send it to a formula, maybe over parameters, maybe in some power, and that formula will tell you what the original finite structure was. Finite structure was saying about the relation R. So for T, a theory in maybe some other language, L not L naught, we started with T admits a K configuration if for some model you have this family of maps. And it's for all the finite little pieces. So, okay, yeah, if you. Little pieces. So, okay, yeah, if you have a force class, you can put together the forse limit at a palette. Okay, so now, okay, we have a notion, and this is all leading to an open question that we didn't solve, which is either a sad or happy face. Happy, because we can talk about it later. CK is a class of all complete theories with SF models that admit a K, I don't know what happened to me, configuration. It was one of the four or five viruses, I think, took configuration. Five IRS, but I think it took configuration I thought there would be another slide there. Okay, that would have been the next one. Yes, okay. So in the previous paper with Vince and Cameron, that they showed that actually K is a friend. That actually, if K is a first A class with the Ramsey property and then gamma is the limit, then this CK is something we knew about. The class of complete theories with infinite models with a non-collapsed gamma generalized indiscernible sequence. So the thing is, when you have a generalized indiscernible sequence in some model M, the model is affecting some kind of reduction on the indiscernible. And to go. And so the idea is that if you can't do that, then that's a non-collapse. Another is indiscernible. So by these collapse results, Shalas, Gao, Chernikov, Palace, and Tikochi, then we know what these classes are for finite linear orders, finite graphs, and K-uniform hypergraphs. And if you kind of look at them, they're in this chain. And if you kind of look at them, they're in this chain. So why not ask, is there a class K that witnesses that this partial order is not linearly worked? Cannot come up with one. So it's a little bit more free than talking about indiscernibles because typically to show that you can't get that reduct right, you'll use the Ramsey property for the age of gamma. But say, okay, you don't even need that. We're making, we're totally opening the field. We're totally opening the field. Give us a class K where it deviates somewhere from this J. So we started working together, hoping we could answer this question, and we just didn't succeed. So let me also give some motivation in terms of these ranks. So this was also something that Vince and Miriam had worked on. So what are these little stars going on here? This is the free supersposition of two classes. Three superspositions, two classes. So I'm just thinking, what on earth would this mean if you don't have the hereditary properties? So I probably should have put, let's say we have something nice going on here, right? Even a first A class. Okay, so an element in the free superposition is one that reducts to an element in this class and also reducts to an element in this class. So take the two signatures and take their district. So take the two signatures and take their disjunction. This was studied by Podirski. And so in these papers I'm citing from 2012 and 2015, he was also looking at something called the full product of structures. It's also something we considered in our paper, but I'm not really discussing it in this talk. We were kind of hoping, like, okay, so if you take two classes, maybe what you need to do is take the product, and then you can get a CK that's out of the And then you can get a CK that's out of the linear order somehow. And that was sort of the hope. And so these are two products that we consider. Okay. And then another thing you might want to know about these products is do they preserve indivisibility, do they preserve definable cells and what areas Vince and Merriam had shown a lot of nice uniformity properties for these configurations. Properties for these configurations that would rely on those partition properties. And that's something we considered right now. So let's define the rank to sort of show some motivation for why you'd want to know. Okay, so let's say K star N is you're just, you're putting together like lots of independent copies. So if these were, if K was the classifier orders, then it would be K star N. k star n would be n independent linear orders, right? So an element in that class has n relations on it, each of which is a linear order. And so they defined a partial type to have k rank n if you could put a k star n configuration into the type, but not the k star n plus 1 configuration. And so again, they had all these calculations in their prior work that were much simplified when K was either defined we self-similar or individuals. So remember, this is a stronger property, and with this one they were able to get quite a bit more. For example, things like when you're mapping from the finite structure into the power of the model, to be able to say, okay, for that n-tuple in the model, the coordinates are either always distinct or constant. You know, always distinct or constant throughout the sequence. And this comes for free, right? In this article sequence. It's a bit harder and it gets better. So if you haven't seen their work on this, they had calculated, for example, E ranks. So E is finite equivalence relations. So one binary relation symbol. But this is always bounded by dE rank. ITP rank. But then they can get quite a bit wide apart. So competing the rank of this partial type, that's what they mean by rank was actually founded in the random graph. So they're not always the same. Or how about ranks with the classical final linear orders? And so in an NIP theory, it's equal to OP convention. It's equal to OP dimension, something that Vince and Cameron had worked on prior. So that's kind of the motivation that, okay, well, maybe we can extend these results if we can learn more about these partition properties that were so important in doing these calculations. And they had an open question actually in their previous paper. Given this result in minimal series for the covalence. For the equivalence relation ranks, is that going to be true for all partial types? I think this is just using the bounded above and the subadditive. I'm not sure if I'm going to. Okay, so that means we did. I thought this was a nice one. So let's just take any class K. Let's just take any class K of L structures of closed under isomorphism. So we're using this notion of disjoint n of optimization from Alex's paper, but stated for finite structures. So here we have it for n equals 3. What that would look like is that you could extend this sort of disjoint system, right? So these two there to the top of the cube. The cube. So we have a notion that definably self-similar for classes when you might not have a limit implied by distributed 3 amalgamations here. So we have this kind of hierarchy now of properties, right? The display 3 amalgamation, then a definably self-similar, and the agent that is believed. So that was a nice thing to think about. And remember, I had said nut out where I had been looking at these lex products of class. Been looking at these lex products of classes. So, just to be less mysterious about that, we have this little wreath going on here because then, like, you're looking at the force limits and what does the automorphism group look like, and it's a wreath of morphism groups of each. Okay, but even if they don't have for seal limits, what I'm saying is that K1 is sort of like a spine. So, for B and K1, every element of B has like a little equivalent. As like a little equivalence class. And an equivalence class is this element, an element of case of like lots of graphs next by a structure from K1. And so one thing that we thought would help us solve our open question was what happens when you put two classes together, right? So if K0 is age indivisible, and so is K1. Visible, and so it was K1. Sort of taking out the age because it's just a class, it's not the age of anybody. But I still mean that notion of I have a Ramsey structure for every structure in my class. Then, okay, so this age indivisibility is preserved. And actually you do need that, please go ahead on your embedding because it it doesn't work. Yes. We're kind of hoping, like, okay, we'll have some traction on these new products. Have some traction on these new products. And oh, maybe I should say, right, so I think we had these other preservation for the other products that were stated, the Free Superposition, Budirsky's full product, and this one. For the three products, we're asking questions like: when is age indivisibility preserved? When is definable self-similarity preserved? What about disjoint animal? What about disjoint animal condition? What does that present? So we have like a little table you could look at in our paper on archive. So, you know, again, hoping we could deviate from the order. So this is sort of the end of the discussion, which is we didn't really get far. So for example, look at this result. To give some background. Consider what it would be like to take the lex product of two structures. So, I hope you sort of know what I mean from talking about the classes. Basically, you have one structure in each coordinate. These coordinates are themselves a second structure. So, you can do this with the random ordered graph. And I was sort of wondering about other characterizations of NIP because I had worked on this. Because I have worked on this on my thesis, but he's generalizing the circles for the outside characteristics of my piece. So it's like, okay, well, about the wreath, right? So what I mean is take the signatures and make them disjoint two-edge relations. A random graph index series of random graphs. Luckily, you still have the rounding property, something Sokit showed in 2013. And I have a more finitary argument in my paper. Argument in my view, but apparently, what I did was something, it's kind of general, right? Because it turns out that if you take two classes and you look at the flex product or the wreath of them, you're not really getting anything new. So if you had graphs and graphs, you would be characterizing the same classes. That was a bit of a disappointment because if you have all these classes that are linearly ordered, then the intersections are just Intersections are just a larger and border. So you're not getting anywhere else really from the known classes. Similarly, these other products were kind of a bust. So like the free superposition or the full product. Again, under some mild assumptions like here, we needed to contain a singleton structure because these are very wild classes sometimes. We still got that taking the product in some way. But taking the product in some way would just give you the intersection of the two classes. So, anyway, I hope that gives a little bit of a kind of a history of why we were looking at the partition properties being preserved under the products, because we were really hoping to find a new class in that layer ordering. And in order to make the SETI tractable, we needed these partition properties to be preserved. So, maybe that's the happy side of the story, that in a lot of cases, That in a lot of cases, the partition property is preserved. So you can use it, but you're not necessarily, with these K configurations, you're not necessarily defining a new class of theories. And I think, you know, and if the answer is no, there isn't, and it's just a linear order, the way I think of it is, and we all love Gabe's map of the armwork design. Like, so this idea of admitting a cake configuration, it's a certain kind of dividing one, and maybe it just shoots a little. Dividing one, and maybe it just shoots a little linear order through that map. It just can't talk about everybody on that map, and that might be true. But in any case, I think it's very nice, this notion that they had in Cameroon. It's a way of talking about this specific kind of dividing line where you admit this definable configuration, which is different from some of the other defining lines. So, yeah, I think that's about it. Yeah, I think that's about it. So thanks very much. Any questions for you? So I want to make sure I understand the question that you mentioned correctly. So the situation is you take a, let's say, a RAMC class K and you look at basically the situation where you have an uncollapsed My linear order, and I don't know where it is. Yeah, here, there is a light. There it is. So, basically, you're sort of looking at the things that don't collapse a certain kind of generalized indiscernible, and you want to say are there incompatible? Yes, except, okay, so what you said, you're assuming more. So, to be able to say that indiscernible doesn't collapse, I think you would need that K has this RAMS property, right? As you said. So, we're saying, How about any K, maybe not Ramsay, maybe just indivisible? But okay, if you had it for Ramsy, that's the name. But okay, if you had it for Ramsey, then the next question. Then then that's yeah, that's the right understanding of this question. But it presumably if you dropped the assumption of Ramsey, you you would have more directions that you could go in. So I remember at the Bedroom Ho meeting, there was some discussion raised by Nadal. Maybe it was about this kind of question. So I think the situation there was you were looking at things that eliminate ordered C relations. So you have this ternary C relation. Sort of codes. Codes, you know, the C relation. And any binary structure will sort of have collapse of ordered Z relation in the terminals to the linear order. But then there are both NIP and IP examples of binary things. Like you have a random graph and then a DLO. So I mean, assuming this works, then that would be an example. But if it's breaking the albums. But it doesn't break the linear order than necessary. I mean it doesn't. Why not? Oh, it will be between, it will be below here too. And am I wrong? Sorry, too. So yeah, N NIP is if you're not in this class. But I don't know, is that part of the question, right? Just because you're not in that class, does that mean you're up here for the K configurations? Well, if I give you two, neither of which is contained in the other, then that's what I'm doing. Yeah, yeah, that should work. Right, okay. So that's what you're saying. Yeah, okay, very cool. Yeah, so so uh one suggestion was looking at ordered C relations. C relation? Well, and you have collapsed in any binary structure. Talk more about it so we get all the details. Sounds right? I have a related question. So first of all, let me just ask, what is the characterization? Do you have is there an existing characterization of the class CE, like stability and IP? Oh, oh, what do we have here? I think I um okay then do I is this E for equality or E for equivalence relation? I think I messed this up. You better be on the call. E for equivalence relation. And it's the same thing as just, you know, all theories with infinite models, right? To be able to admit. Okay. Yeah, any theory with an infinite model can admit an E configuration, right? You just make all the... No, I was like, this is divine intervention for me. Data six lacking up. Right, okay, because we just say like distinct points are in equivalence. Is that it? The equality, okay, so phi, okay. The phi. So phi, okay, the phi that d gets, the equivalence binary relation gets sent to the quality thing. So I guess my actual question is: the first three classes there are with binary relations. X ones require binary relations. Do you know, this is related to something I was talking about, do you know any other classes defined by binary relations other than those three? Is it what we tournaments, partial orders, but they weren't different, right, Vince? Right, Vince? We tried some other ones, but it turned out that all the other binary ones that were, you know, interesting turned out to be like equal to one of those three, right? Yeah, so graphs was the same as characterized by partial orders, by tournaments. Yeah, it wasn't. Maybe maybe it's 'cause the notion is kind of weak. You know, I mean, I guess we were trying to go full generality, but maybe maybe that's a drawback. Maybe that's a drawback. So everything else, everything you looked at in binary relation language was equivalent to one of those for you, but you don't know. I don't know, yeah, yeah. Great. All right, let's thank the V and ten plus four. Thank you, Miriam and John.
