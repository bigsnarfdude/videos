Is being recorded. I should have known that was coming. So, first, I guess thanks to the organizers for pulling this all together through. It sounded like different iterations of different plans. Now, when I guess we got our charge to speak about someone else's work, I thought this would be a good opportunity to kind of, I don't know, incentivize my. I don't know, incentivize myself to learn a little bit more free analysis since I've been to a lot of these sort of, oh, what happened? I don't need that. Non-commutative free function theory talks, but haven't really done research in the field much myself. And so I thought if I submit an abstract, then I have to go learn the paper and put together a talk. So this is, you know, somewhat successful. And I just want to share with you guys today what I've learned so far. And in particular, the paper. And in particular, the paper that I chose to kind of try and dive into is this paper by James Pascoe about the monodromy theorem in the non-commutative or free setting and some interesting applications. And this, I don't know, felt like a nice paper to dive into because it's a free version of kind of a classical complex analysis result with some unexpected twists and some interesting applications. All right, so. All right, so before kind of getting into the free setting, I just want to start very gently with all of the kind of basic complex analysis connections that I'm sure we've all taught and many of us have seen. But, you know, it's the third, it's the last talk of the day and it's the summer, so why not? All right, so in kind of the one variable situation, the ideas that we have some domain omega, you know, you could have holes potentially. Could have holes potentially that contain some smaller domain D, and we have a function that's initially analytic on D. And a natural question to ask is what conditions can we impose on our function so that we can extend it to be an analytic function on omega instead? Well, as we all know, one of the natural ways that we try and kind of extend the domain of our analytic functions is through analytic continuation along curves. Analytic continuation along curves. So throughout my talk, gamma is just going to be a curve mapping into whatever our domain is. In this case, I just put C because this is kind of the definition of analytic continuation. But oftentimes, the curve will be mapping into either a specific domain or into later on a non-cummutative domain. All right, so here's the definition. So we're going to start with a function. Definition. So we're going to start with a function that is analytic on some open set containing the beginning of our curve. So say our curve begins here at gamma of zero, and it goes to some gamma of one, and our function is initially analytic around gamma of zero. Then, I mean, kind of, as we all know, an analytic continuation along this curve is just a collection of pairs of functions and of pairs of functions and domains parameterized by our t values from 0 to 1 so that they start at our initial function and initial domain. For each value of t, we get a domain dt that contains gamma of t and a function that's analytic on that domain. I guess typically a disk. And these definitions are consistent. So if we pick t values that are close enough then these corresponding disks overlap. Corresponding disks overlap, and the associated functions agree on the overlap of the disks. So, more early as we move along our curve, we have all of these overlapping disks where our functions are analytic, and because they agree at the overlap, we basically get a way to analytically extend our function from the initial domain along the curve. All right, so. All right, so let's work through, or at least mention briefly, kind of the canonical definition that we discuss in an intro complex analysis course. So let's look at the principal branch of the logarithm, maybe starting at a little circle around z equal to zero. And let's say that our curve is just the top half of the unit circle mapping from one over to negative one. 1 over 2, negative 1. Now we can't immediately take the principal branch of the logarithm and use its formula to analytically continue all the way across the curve because the principal branch has its discontinuity along the negative real axis. But then all we need to do is pick a different branch of the logarithm or equivalently the argument function so that it agrees with the principal branch near z equals one, but shifts the discontinuity. But shifts the discontinuity away from the negative real line. So we could pick this branch of the argument function and then basically use that to analytically continue along this curve. And the idea is that this analytic continuation, so when we end at negative one, it's going to return. It's going to return i times pi. And of course, we could do the same thing if instead of going along the top of the unit circle, we wanted to go analytically continue along the bottom of the unit circle. Then we would just need to pick a branch of the logarithm that agrees with our definition near z equals one, but then But then doesn't have a discontinuity along the curve. So we could pick, say, this branch of the argument function and so put the discontinuity along the positive imaginary axis. And the point is that when we do this analytic continuation, we end up with the value of kind of the analytic extension of our function along this curve at negative one to be. Negative 1 to be minus i times phi. So the point is that even when we're in a situation, of course, where we can analytically continue along a curve, the curve that we choose sometimes matters and we can get different behaviors at the endpoints. And so there goes my pencil. Kind of the situation of the monodermy theorem is how can we impose certain condition on our curves so that as we analytically continue our function along Analytically continue our function along the curve, we get the same behavior at the endpoints. Well, the key definition here is allowing two curves to be fixed endpoint homotopic. So we say that two curves are fixed endpoint homotopic first if they begin and end at the same point. So here gamma 0 and gamma 1 are going to be our two curves. And let's just say that they begin at a point A and they And they ended a point B. So we have some gamma zero and some gamma one. And I'm drawing them so that they don't intersect each other at other points, but of course that's not required. Well, we say that they're fixed point homotopic basically if we can continuously deform one curve into the other without leaving whatever our ambient domain is. So these are both mapping into omega. And saying their fist point homotopics. And Sangerfist point homotopic says that we can find this function, you know, capital gamma that depends on parameters t and s. So that for each fixed s value, we get a curve. And if I fix s to be zero, I get the curve gamma zero. If we fix s to be one, we get the curve gamma one. And then any other value of s in between there also gives us a curve. But the point is that we require them to always begin and end at the same point. Begin and end at the same point. So for any S, the curves have to begin at A and they have to end at B. So in terms of our picture, we have this whole family of curves that continuously deform from gamma 0 to gamma 1. And this is exactly the context of the monodermy theorem, which looks like it's cutting off a little bit at the bottom. I'm not. Oh, never mind. I'm not. Oh, never mind. It's just on my end in the slides. Okay, so the monodermy theorem basically tells us that if we have a function that's analytic on some smaller set D, domain D contained in some larger domain omega. And if we also impose the condition that our function analytically continues along every curve that starts in D and goes to omega, so maybe we have some. Omega. So maybe we have some curves here. We can analytically continue along all of those. Then, if we pick two curves that are fixed point homotopic, so let's say here is some gamma zero and here's some gamma one and they're fixed point homotopic. We can deform one to the other without leaving gamma. Then if we analytically continue f along these two curves, we these analytics These two curves, we these analytic continuations have to agree in a neighborhood of the end point. Now, I mean, that's that's a local property that tells us about analytic continuations along two specific curves. But if we impose the condition that our domain omega is simply connected, then of course there's kind of no obstruction to taking any two curves that begin and end at the same point and continuously deforming one into the other. Into the other. And so we can conclude. So, this is kind of the second version of the monodromy theorem. We can conclude in the simply connected case that there's actually going to be a global extension of our original little function f to an analytic function on the entire domain omega. So, maybe just to be really clear, let's actually, you know, maybe I'll walk through the second monodrome E theorem because this is the one that we're actually going to be. Because this is the one that we're actually going to be looking at in the free setting. So we're starting with a simply connected domain omega, a function f that's analytic on some smaller domain contained in omega, so that we can analytically continue along every curve that starts in D and goes out to omega. Then immediately we know that there is a globally analytic function, say capital F on omega, that extends our little f. Little F. Kind of the crucial point is that being simply connected is, of course, a key requirement. So, you know, the example we saw with the principal logarithm already illustrates this. If we start at z equals one, we can always analytically continue along any curve that stays away from the origin. But we know that f doesn't extend to a globally defined Doesn't extend to a globally defined analytic function because no matter what branch of the argument we pick, kind of to try and globally define it, it's going to have a discontinuity along an entire array. And really the obstruction is that because we have this singularity at the origin, we can have analytic continuations that just don't agree at the places where they end. So, kind of the goal is to try and generalize this monodermy theorem to This monodermy theorem to the free or non-commutative setting. But before I get to that, I need to tell you what the main objects in the non-commutative free setting are. They've popped up in a number of talks before mine, so feel free to kind of zone out at this point, but I just want to review what our basic domains and what our basic functions are. All right, so for the purposes of my talk, I'm going to fix some. My talk, I'm going to fix some positive integer d and consider the d-dimensional matrix universe. So, this is just going to be the collection of all d-tuples of matrices of the same size. So, here this notation just means that I'm taking d-tuples of n by n matrices with complex entries, and we're going to take the union overall sizes of matrices. Of matrices. And of course, there are more general ways to kind of define these non-commutative kind of matrix universes, but I'm going to stick to this one for the purposes of this talk. All right, so within this setting, a free set contained in this d-dimensional matrix universe is one that satisfies two properties. So we need it to respect direct sums. So if I have two So if I have two d tuples of matrices of the same size in my set, and I take the direct sum of them to get another d-tuple of matrices of the same size that still has to be in the set D. And similarly, the set has to be closed under unitary conjugation. So if I have, say, a d-tuple of n by n matrices in my set, and I conjugate each matrix in that tuple by a specific n by n unitary, that new tuple. That new tuple still has to be inside of the set. So, here are some kind of straightforward examples. So, certainly the d-dimensional matrix universe itself is a free set. A set that's going to show up later that's certainly a free set is the non-commutative annulus. So, here I'm just taking matrices and imposing the condition that both the norm of the matrix and Both the norm of the matrix and the norm of its inverse be bounded by two. And it's easy to see that because taking norms and taking inverses are well behaved with respect to both unitary conjugation and direct sums, that this is a free set. And similarly, I mean, it seems like free sets are often defined via polynomial inequalities. We've already seen some of those in previous talks. So here's just one example of. One example of picking pairs of matrices of the same size that satisfy a particular polynomial inequality. And again, because everything here kind of behaves well with respects to direct sums and unitary conjugation, this will certainly give us a free set. Now, I'm particularly going to be looking at functions and analytic functions, and so we really need to restrict further to the type of domain. The type of domains that we see in that context. So, I'm going to be restricting to non-cummutative domains. So, basically, what this means: so, if you take a non-cummutative set, it comes equipped with a bunch of levels. So, you have a level for every associated size of matrix. And I'll generally call these levels, whatever our set is, be it omega or d, the levels will be omega n or dn. So, the restriction to d-tuples of matrices of a D-tuples of matrices of a particular size. So being a non-cummutative domain means that if we restrict to any level, we have a connected open set of d-tuples of n by n matrices, just using kind of the standard notions of connectedness and openness in those sets of matrices. All right, so those are our sets. Now let's just review what it means to be a free function, although we have seen this a couple of times. Free function, although we have seen this a couple of times already, at least in the context of polynomials and rational functions. So, the functions I'll be considering, they're free functions. So, this means one, that they're graded. So, if you plug in a tuple of n by n matrices, your function is going to return a tuple of n by n matrices. The size of the tuple might just change. So, the function doesn't change the size of the inputs and the outputs. The size of the inputs and the outputs is consistent. Similarly, the functions respect direct sums, and a free function respects similarity. So if you take an element in the domain and conjugate it by an invertible matrix in its inverse of the right size, as long as that new element is still in the domain, your function has to be well behaved with respect to that conjugation by s. So, again, kind of throughout the talks this week so far, we've already seen some examples of free functions. So, certainly all non-commutative polynomials are free functions. They kind of clearly respect direct sums and respect conjugation by similarity matrices. And if you plug in an n by n matrix or d-tuple of those, it's going to output. Output an n by n matrix. It's also easy to check that if you have a non-cummative rational function, so again, something that looks like a polynomial in terms of using algebraic expressions like addition and multiplication, but then allowing for the use of kind of inverses and parentheses as well. Then these will give us free functions as long as they're well defined. All right, so those are kind of our base functions. So, those are kind of our base functions, but because we're going to be looking at the universal monodromy theorem, we really need our functions to be analytic. So, in this setting, a free function is analytic if, well, more or less the simplest possible thing holds. We require that if we restrict our function to any level of the non-commutative domain, that restricted function is analytic, say as a function of n squared times d variables. Now, because of the additional structure. Now, because of the additional structure that free functions inherit from their definition, they are kind of almost already analytic. So, for example, it's worked out, say, in a paper by Helton, Clepp, and McCullough, that a function is analytic, or a free function is analytic, rather, if its restrictions are continuous. And it actually, you can weaken that a little bit. And a free function is analytic if its restrictions to the levels of its non-community. Restrictions to the levels of its non-cummutative domain are actually just locally bounded. Okay, so now we have kind of the class of functions that we'd like to study as along with their associated domains. And so now I have enough information to switch over to the non-commutative monitor me theorem and eventually get into some applications. Okay, so. Okay, so the pieces of information that I still need to tell you are that since we're in the free non-cummutative setting, our d and omega are going to now be non-cummutative domains. But you can kind of still think about them in the same way. We have some domain D now non-cummutative living inside some larger domain omega. And we're going to be looking at analytic continuation along curves. Continuation along curves. And here, a curve in a non-cumutative domain omega is really just a standard curve because these are curves that are restricted to some level of the non-cummutative domain. So our gammas will always just be curves of d-tuples of n by n matrices. And for us, they'll typically start in the level n of the domain D and map into level n of the domain omega. n of the domain omega. All right, so now I have enough information to tell you Pasco's, I think, is a really surprising and pretty extension of the classical monodermy theorem. So what James was able to prove is that if you have a free analytic function on our smaller non-cummutative domain D, and if f analytically continues along every curve that starts in D and goes out. That starts in d and goes out to omega, then this free analytic function little f can actually be extended globally to an analytic, a free analytic function on all of omega. And really the critical point in this theorem is that this non-commutative domain omega no longer needs to be simply connected. So moving from the commutative to this non-commutative case allows us to drop or allow Allows us to drop or allow James to drop the condition that the domain is simply connected. Now, I'd like to spend some time today talking about his proofs of this result. And he actually has three proofs. The first two I'm highlighting, so the first and the third are in his paper. And the middle one is one that he told me in private communication that's a little bit. Communication that's a little bit quicker than the third one, but encodes some of the same ideas. And really, the point is that this free proof uses a lot of kind of the identities and arguments that feel kind of like kind of classical free analysis, but doesn't necessarily encode like geometrically or topologically why we can drop this simply connected assumption. Connected assumption. Whereas the second two proofs, the disk bounding and sphere embedding, give a little bit more intuition as to why the condition that omega be simply connected isn't required anymore. Okay, but before I jump into those proofs, I just want to give a little bit of kind of information about how analytic continuations behave in the free setting. So So to start off, let's take two curves, gamma one and gamma two, in our non-cummutative domain omega that start in the non-cummutative domain D. These live at a particular level, so they're really starting in dn and going to omega n. And the critical thing here is that because we're living inside non-commutative domains, we can kind of combine these two curves. We can take their direct sum to get a new curve that's living at levels. Get a new curve that's living at level 2n. So you can bump these curves up. And by our assumptions, we know that the free analytic function we started with has to analytically continue along all three of these curves. So I'm going to slightly abuse notation and just call the formulas for these analytic continuations F1, F2, and F hat. Even though, of course, as kind of as you move along the curve, it's possible that somehow that domains of the analytic continuum. Somehow, that domains of the analytic continuations for t that are far apart overlap, and then the function definitions maybe don't have to agree in that overlap. But assuming that we're kind of keeping in mind where we are on the curve, I'm just going to denote the formula for the analytic continuation using a letter instead of trying to deal with T. Okay, well, that aside, I just wanted to. I just wanted to tell you a little bit about the properties of these analytic continuations. The first is that they kind of respect the sizes of the matrices. You know, they're graded in a sense. So in particular, if we move along, say, the analytic continuation of f along gamma 1, because on d, if I plug in, say, a pair of or a d tuple of n by n matrices. A d tuple of n by n matrices, f will spit out a d tilde tuple of n by n matrices. The analytic continuation has to do that as well. So as you move along the analytic continuation, if you plug in a d tuple of n by n matrices, the continuation will still spit out that same size tuple and same size matrices, because really we're just analytically continuing the coordinate functions of f. Of f, and we can't change the number of the ones that we have. All right, so similarly, analytic continuations preserve direct sums in a particular way. So let's just walk through this thing that I just highlighted. So this is saying that if I take the analytic continuation of f along the curve gamma hat, which is the direct sum of gamma one and gamma two, and then plug in gamma hat, then this has to be the same as taking the analytic continuation of that phalanx. analytic continuation of f along gamma one and evaluating it at gamma one and direct summing with the analytic continuation of f along gamma two and then plugging in gamma two. So this is basically saying that these analytic continuations preserve direct sums in a particular way. And it's not so hard to prove this using the fact that on the initial domain D, our function preserve direct sums. And similarly, the analytic continuum And similarly, the analytic continuations have to respect similarities. So if you have any invertible n by n matrix and conjugate your analytic continuation with that invertible matrix, you can actually pull it inside of the analytic continuation. And again, the point is that our function, the initial function on the initial domain satisfies this property. And so you can propagate it along. Can propagate it along the curve, in this case, gamma one. So that was just a lot of words to basically say that our analytic continuations are going to respect kind of the properties of the initial free function. So they're going to be well behaved with respect to direct sums and similarities, and they're going to be graded. So what this tells us morally is the thing we need to show is that if we analytically continue That if we analytically continue along two different curves that end at the same spot, the analytic continuations have to agree there because then that will give us a global way to define a function on omega. And this global function will be analytic at each level. And by the properties of the analytic continuations, it will actually give us a free function. So, really, the actual setups for the So, really, the actual setups for the proof. Everything I just told you before is morally trivial, you know, just coming from kind of what people know about free analytic functions already. The setups for the proofs are we're going to start with two curves, gamma one and gamma two, that live at a particular level. And without loss of generality, we're going to assume they start at the same point, which is always going to be in dn our initial domain. And we're going to assume that they end at the same point. And we're going to assume that they end at the same point, which could be anywhere in our final domain, omega n. And we're going to let f1 and f2 denote the analytic continuation of f along these two curves. And we want to show that these analytic continuations agree at the final point. Okay, so here's the free proof. So kind of as I mentioned earlier, we can always take two curves at level n and direct sum them to get a curve at level 2n. To get a curve at level 2n. So we're going to do that. And f is going to denote the analytic continuation of our function along this curve. Now, Pascoe's really interesting trick here is a good way to perturb this curve, gamma hat. So he perturbs it to get this curve gamma by appending this entry here in the upper right-hand corner. So epsilon there is chosen to be very So, epsilon there is chosen to be very small. So, this is a kind of a small perturbation from the original curve. And we have kind of the difference of curves divided by this length to the one-half to guarantee that, well, that term in the upper right is always bounded and in particular, it goes to zero as t goes to one. We're also going to pick epsilon very small so that these two curves, gamma hat and gamma, are very close together. Are very close together, specifically so that the analytic continuation of f along gamma hat also gives us an analytic continuation of f along gamma. We also need to notice that, I mean, we didn't, James didn't just get gamma by perturbing gamma hat. This new curve is actually obtained by taking the original curve. And multiplying it by an invertible matrix and its inverse. And we know that analytic continuations are well behaved by conjugating by invertible matrices. All right, so now let's just look at the analytic continuation of F along this curve gamma. So if we compute that, the first thing we should notice is that by the fact that these analytic continuations respect similarity, Analytic continuations respect similarities, we can pull the invertible matrix and its inverse outside of the function f. So here we're really just now evaluating the analytic continuation of f along gamma hat. But gamma hat was the direct sum of gamma 1 and gamma 2. So this is really just the direct sum of the analytic continuation of ethyl on gamma 1 of ethanol. Of ethyl on gamma 1 evaluated at gamma 1 with the direct sum of ethyl on gamma 2 evaluated at gamma 2. And then we can take these three matrices and multiply them back together to get this final matrix here. And really the point is that, well, we know that this formula gives the analytic continuation of f along gamma. And in particular, it has Gamma, and in particular, it has to be defined as t goes to one. Well, if we look at that term that I've highlighted, as t goes to one, its numerator or its denominator goes to zero, which means that its numerator has to go to zero as well, which means that the analytic continuation of f along gamma one has to be getting close to the analytic continuation of f along gamma two as t goes to one, which is exactly what we wanted to do. Which is exactly what we wanted to show. So that's the first proof of the monodromy theorem that uses a lot of kind of the structure of free functions and ideas like the non-commutative sets being closed under direct sums, but it doesn't necessarily give an indication of where we lost the need to use the simply connected assumption or kind of how that came into play. To play. And so, because of that, James provided kind of a different proof. So, kind of the goal is the same. We're still starting with two curves, gamma one and gamma two, that begin at A and end at B. And we want to conclude that the analytic continuations along these two curves agree, you know, at the end point. But now we're going to, you know, build things up a little bit differently. So, I'm going to build up gamma. So I'm going to build up gamma hat again to be gamma one direct sum gamma two. But now the new curve gamma is just going to be gamma two direct sum gamma one. And the critical idea is that when you take these two curves and move them up to this level 2n in your non-commutative domain, these new curves are actually fixed point homotopic to each other. And this homotopy is just given by this function. By this function gamma here. So let's walk through what we're doing. We're taking this curve gamma hat and we're composing it on, or we're conjugating it by unitaries that depend on the parameter t. And we know that these non-commutative domains are invariant under unitary conjugation. So we're not leaving omega when we do this. If we plug in the parameter s equals zero, these unitaries just collapse. They're just the identity. Carries just collapse. They're just the identity matrix. So when I plug in s equals zero, we recover gamma hat because we're just multiplying by the identity on both sides. Now if I plug in s equals one, well these unitaries turn into zero, one, negative one, and zero. And zero, negative one, one, zero. If you apply that to gamma hat, all it does is kind of rotate. Does it kind of rotate the gamma 1, gamma 2 matrix to now a gamma 2, gamma 1 matrix? And in particular, when we plug in s equals 1, we get back the curved gamma. Finally, gamma 1 and gamma 2 both begin at a and both end at b. So if I plug in p equals 0, this interior matrix just becomes a times the identity. And then the unitaries don't come into play at all. Unitaries don't come into play at all. And so any of these intermediate curves always have to begin at A. And similarly, if you plug in t equals one, the interior matrix is just B times the identity. So everything collapses and all the intermediate curves end at B. So this is kind of called the disbounding proof because we have these two curves, gamma hat and gamma, that live in our non-commutative domain at level. In our non-commutative domain at level 2n. And because they kind of continuously deform into each other, you can kind of think of them at least intuitively as giving kind of the boundary of some region, some disk in our non-cumminative domain at level 2n. Well, at this point, we're basically done because these two curves are fixed point homotopic. And so if we analytically continue F along gamma and gamma, Continue F along gamma and gamma hat, by the standard monodromy theorem in the multivariate setting, the analytic continuations have to agree. Well, if we think about their components, the first component of the analytic continuation along gamma gives us the analytic continuation of f along gamma one. And the first component. And the first component of the analytic continuation along, I don't know if I said gamma hat or gamma one or not. So you go along gamma hat, the first component gives you the analytic continuation along gamma one. If you go along gamma, the first component gives you the analytic continuation along gamma two. These two first components being equal tells you that the continuations along gamma one and gamma two agree at the end point. Gamma 2 agree at the end point. I didn't realize how hard it was going to be to say all of these gammas. I hope it's all making sense on your all's end. But the key point is that when you move to this like upper level of the non-cummutative domain, then somehow even though these curves gamma 1 and gamma 2 weren't necessarily fixed point homotopic at level n, when you lift them up, they somehow become parts of curves at a higher level that now are fixed. Curves at a higher level that now are fixed endpoint homotopic. And because of the kind of free structure, the fact that these continuations respect direct sums, this tells us actually stuff about how they were behaving at a lower level. Let me just maybe briefly mention the sphere embedding proof. So the idea here, again, is we have these two curves beginning and ending. These two curves beginning and ending, beginning at A and ending at B. Instead of looking at how we conjugate by a unitary, and it's conjugate that depend on these parameter, real parameter C and D. So we just kind of take this out of all of these conjugations of gamma hat at once. And of course, this lives inside of the non-commutative set at level 2n. The crucial thing here is that this set G is actually homeomorphic to just the three-dimensional sphere, which is simply connected. And then again, we're pretty much done because the two curves that we care about, gamma hat and gamma as defined on the previous slide, both live inside this edge. And so again, the monodrome E theorem says, in the classical setting, says that if we Says, in the classical setting, says that if we go along them, the analytic continuations have to agree near the end point. I just wanted to mention this sphere embedding proof partially because you can actually modify this to get a circle embedding argument that gives a really slick proof of the inverse function theorem in the free setting, which looking at the time, I'm not going to have time to go into, but. But I should at least mention it as an aside that James has this nice application of the proof of the monodrome E theorem. So in my time remaining, I think I have 10 minutes. Okay, thanks, Alan. I just want to touch on some of the applications of this universal monodromy theorem in the free setting. And in particular, I want to talk about how it connects to. I want to talk about how it connects to the existence of pluriharmonic conjugates in the free setting. But in order to do that, let me just remind you what the commutative situation says. So if we say have a domain in C D, then a real valued function is called pluriharmonic. Basically, if whenever we restrict it to a line inside of our domain, we get a harmonic function. Another way to say this is that if I pick any point in the domain, This is that if I pick any point in the domain in any direction b and form this one variable function, take the z Laplacian and evaluate at zero, we get zero back. The important thing about these pluriharmonic functions is that they're the real parts of analytic functions. And if our domain is simply connected, then they're actually the real part of a globally defined analytic function. Defined analytic function. Now we can basically extend this definition to the non-commutative or the free setting as follows. So now instead of real valued, our functions are self-adjoint valued. So they spit out self-adjoint matrices. And we say these functions are free pluriharmonic if, well, some of the properties we've seen earlier hold. If they're graded, so they respect the size of. So they respect the size of matrices if they respect direct sums. And well, in this setting, you really don't expect the functions to respect conjugation by similarities, but they do have to respect conjugation by unitaries. So a function satisfying these three properties, I'm going to call real free. And then to kind of tie And then to kind of tie in the pleuriharmonicness of them, we basically require them to be pleuriharmonic at each level, which is this condition here. If you fix a point at each level of your non-commutative domain and a direction at that level, and then do exactly the same thing. So form this one variable function, take the z-Laplacian, and evaluate it zero. Then we get back the zero matrix. All right. All right, and then the question, of course, is when are these free pluriharmonic functions the real parts of free analytic functions? And so James basically showed that just as in the case of the monodromy theorem, we can relax the condition that the non-commutative domain be simply connected. So basically, if you have a pluriharmonic free function on a non-commutative domain omega, Commutative domain omega, then there's a globally defined free analytic function whose real part is u. So without going into kind of any of the details, just kind of due to time, the basic idea is that you can solve this problem locally, you know, around say each point in omega, you know, looking at how kind of your solutions kind of connect to the structure of free function. Kind of connect to the structure of free functions. And then you can use the monodermy theorem to patch these solutions together to get your globally defined function f. And basically, the monodermy theorem kind of allows you to kind of circumvent any requirement that the domain be simply connected. Now, this kind of leads to This kind of leads to an open question because, of course, finding a function, a free analytic function whose real part is you is really equivalent to solving a system of PDEs. And so what the monodromy theorem here is kind of saying is that in some situations, if you can locally solve a PDE in the free non-commutative setting, then you can get a global solution. And so one problem to kind of throw out to the audience is what are some other important PDEs in the non-commutative setting? Because maybe In the non-commutative setting, because maybe this universal monodromy theorem would be useful in those contexts as well. I also wanted to talk about how this connects to maybe our intuition, because certainly initially when I was thinking about this, I was like, well, you know, in the community setting, we know there are harmonic functions that are not the real parts of globally defined analytic functions if we're on a non-simply connected domain. So, how does this free result? So, how does this free result kind of connect to what we already know in the non-commutative setting? So, maybe the simplest place to make sure that you know this is consistent with our intuition, the easiest place to look is then maybe on the annulus. So let's let A be the annulus with inner radius one-half and outer radius two. Well, we certainly know that the function log of z is harmonic on the annulus. Z is harmonic on the annulus. And we also know that because it's the real part of the logarithm, but there is no log function that is globally defined and analytic on the annulus, that it's not the real part of an analytic function defined on the annulus. So how does this kind of match what we've seen in the non-commutative setting? Well, we can certainly take our commutative annulus and bump it up to get Commutative annulus and bump it up to get a non-commutative annulus. This is the set that I mentioned earlier. We just take matrices and impose the condition that both their norm and their inverse be less than two, or the norm of their inverse is less than two. You can similarly bump up the absolute log of the absolute value of z to be a free real function simply by plugging in. By plugging in Z conjugate time Z into the log function and evaluating that in the typical way. That'll be a self-adjoint, you know, a positive self-adjoint matrix, so there's no real issue with that being well-defined. And it actually does satisfy the conditions of being a real free function that I mentioned when we walked through the definition of a pluriharmonic function. But it's not pluriharmonic at every level. Pluriharmonic at every level. So it gives back, you know, log of the modulus of z on level one. So it's harmonic on level one. But when you go up even to level two, it's no longer pluriharmonic. And that's what this computation here is showing. So if you take, say, your point in your non-cummutative domain to just be the identity and move in this direction and compute just the z Laplacian at zero, well, then you actually get this matrix here, which Get this matrix here, which is certainly not the zero matrix. So, really, the takeaway is that we simply have fewer free pluriharmonic functions than we do typical pluriharmonic functions. Some of these non-cumutative restrictions are more. So, then this does at least allow us to identify pretty easily all of the All of the free Pleuriharmonic functions. So, for example, if we're hanging out on the non-commutative annulus, one can pretty easily show that all the free analytic functions come from convergent Laurent series. That happens at the commutative level, and if you only have one non-commutative input, the ground level kind of completely determines the structure of your function. Well, then because of the connection between Then, because of the connection between free analytic and free pleuriharmonic functions, all of the free pleuriharmonic functions on the non-cummutative annulus are real parts of convergent Laurent series. So I thought that was an interesting application that James gave in his paper. One of the reasons he developed the universal monodromy theorem was to get a nice realization. To get a nice realization formula for what are called pluri subharmonic functions, he proved a local version of a realization formula and used the monodromy theorem to extend it to a global realization formula. But I have two minutes and I don't want to spend any time on that. If you're interested in pleuri subharmonic functions in the free setting, I just heartily encourage you to consult his paper. Because the thing I wanted to end on. Because the thing I wanted to end on is this open question. So we know that, again, in the commutative setting, or you know, the one variable setting is it's written here, if you have a simply connected domain and a function that maps that domain into the punctured plane, then that function always has an analytic logarithm. So there's always some analytic g so that g equals the log of f. But it's an open question now. But it's an open question as to when you have, if you have a non-singular free non-commutative function, when does it have a logarithm? This is an open question. You can, for example, write down functions that are always non-singular, but do not have globally defined logarithms. And then the question is: well, this is kind of also, you could formulate this as a PDE question, and why doesn't the monodermy theorem help you here? James. You here. James talks about this some in his paper as well. But one of the points is that you can maybe, even when you can find local solutions, say to this logarithm problem, I think it looks at particularly one local solution for this function. You can show that the solution doesn't always analytically continue along curves to the larger domain. So in the monodrome E theorem, this Kind of assumption that we have analytic continuation along curves at kind of every level of a non-commutative domain is a really strong assumption. And so, you know, it applies to some problems, but it doesn't apply kind of to other problems. And so kind of, I'll end with my takeaway that, you know, what I've learned is the non-cummutative situation is sometimes simpler. You know, our monodromy theorem no longer has the condition that. Longer has the condition that the domain be simply connected, but it's also more complicated in other situations. For example, we don't know when non-singular free functions possess a logarithm. So thanks for listening. And I should just mention again that this is all based on James's paper about universal free monodromy, pluriharmonic conjugates, and pleurisubharmonicity, which you can find on the archive. The archive. And I'll stop there. Thanks very much for this introduction to James's paper. The recording has stopped. Do we have questions for Kelly? Comments? Okay, I'm sorry, John, go ahead. No, you have a real question, go ahead. Well, I guess I was just wondering about the logarithm itself. So the log of Z, you could make it a NC function of one variable in a disk, right? It's centered at one, say, and can you extend it analytically at all then in this sense? In this sense, in the non-commutative sense, from the disk. I mean, so I mean, I think so. I mean, if we think about well, that's uh hmm. Yeah, I mean, I was just, I guess, with your very first example, I was thinking since we, you know, obviously. Obviously, somehow something goes wrong either with the region or with, I mean, the free region. Maybe there's no free, what was it called, the domain that at the first level has this slit plane, or the logarithm is just not analytically continuable? That's a good question. I think I'd have to sit down. That's a good question. I think I'd have to sit down and think about this a little more to think about how those kind of ideas exactly combine. So you're right, even general. Yeah, I'm still learning some of this, so I think I need 10 seconds, a little bit more time to say something. Very interesting. Thank you. Very interesting. So is it perhaps that the free version gives, at least in this particular question that you're asking, gives some sort of an encoding of the universal covering of the in this case, you know, the I don't know. It's a sort of a vague idea, but So I have a more naive question. Why is log of z star z real free analytic? I thought they were supposed to respect a unitary conjugation to be real free. Is it not going to factor out in the right way? Well, because of the Z star Z, I get two U stars in the middle. Oh, shoot, you do. So that's a fair point. That's a fair point. Don't you get a U star? Doesn't the so you're taking like U star and then the star for the Z is going to cancel out. So you're going to get a U star on one and then a U, and a U on one and then a U star on the other, I think. Yeah, it flips the order. It canceled, but yeah, I think it's the flipping the order, maybe. Well, I've replaced Z by U star Z U. star z u and I replace z star by u z star u star and so then I get two u stars in the middle don't I? No, you don't. Oh you don't. Oh okay. Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah. I told you the stupid question. Well, I was ready to be like, okay, it's John. So clearly, there's an issue on my slide. Any more questions? All right. In that case, let's thank Hillary again. And that was the last talk today. So tomorrow is Wednesday, so it would traditionally be the excursion day. So I encourage all of you to embark on some form of excursion in a location close to where you are. You can tell us all about it on Thursday when we reconvene for another two days of talks on Thursday and Friday. And the timings should be the same as these last two days. So, hope to see many of you at the first talk on Thursday. Thanks. Thanks, Alan. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye. Halfway there. Yeah. Yeah, going to be the well, I think. Well, I think. Yeah. And people don't seem to resent us for making them do that extra work. Yeah, that's good. Who knows how much they were cursing us when making their talk? Yeah, that's right. But I think we selected people who were sort of who would be good at this, really. But I think there is a danger that you commit to talking. I think there is a danger that you commit to talking about some difficult paper, you know, two months out, and then eventually you realize now you have to understand it. But at least it's somebody else's paper. I've also heard the theory you should commit to a talk about the proof of a theorem that you haven't yet proved. That can embarrassingly backfire. Yeah, yeah, okay. That's even more dangerous. Well, I mean, I think. Well, I mean, I think it's actually somewhat unusual in mathematics, right? That you typically announce talks where you know you have some results, right? Whereas I think in experimental sciences, it's more common to say, well, you know, I'm giving a talk in three months. I'll have run all these experiments and our findings will show that this intervention is particularly useful. And then you basically hope for the best, right? Well, I guess you can talk about the results of your experiments either way. I mean, I guess there are more exciting results than, but you can say something, presumably. But if you go to the math conference and say, well, I tried to prove this theorem, but it didn't work. They're really good. You can say, I tried this strategy and it didn't work for this reason. Yeah, okay. That would be somewhat helpful. Yeah. They're too often I think are reduced to, I tried this strategy, it didn't work, probably because I was too. This strategy didn't work, probably because I was too stupid to see how to make it work. Yeah, sometimes there are instructive failures, I guess. Maybe you realize that, I don't know, if your method worked, then it would actually prove something stronger and you know this stronger statement to be false or something like this. So that can be instructive. Yes, that's true, but rare. Yeah. So, somebody once told me that there's apparently a semi-famous paper in topology called something like, you know, seven ways to not prove the Poincaré conjecture. I guess in computer science, for P equals NP, I think they have all kinds of no-go theorems. And I think they now use them to discard papers that claim to prove P0 equals NP by just saying, P0 equals NP by just saying, well, this proof cannot possibly work because of such and such a theorem. Right. Apparently, the last math talk Andrew Gleason ever gave was it was a proof of the Poincaré conjecture. And so he was giving this at Princeton and he started writing the board and he says, it all boils down to this lemma here.
