And so I want to start this with a great introductory one. So for experts, I apologize. Okay, so I want to start out with what I actually believe is the main motivation for symplectic geometry and that's a whole big areas of geometry, which is the n-body problem. So given a group of n celestial bodies, of n celestial bodies predict their orbital motion and I'm doing classical not relativistic so in order to talk about this I need to introduce the notation so let little So let little M1 to little mn be their masses and q1 to qn, which is each maps from R to R3 over time, their position. So this is their position at time t. So, like I said, introduction going back to your high school physics. Introduction going back to your high school physics. So we have Newton's second law, which says that F equals MA. And we have Newton's law of gravitation, which tells us that any two objects attract each other along the line between them proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional. And inversely proportional to the square of the distance. If we put that in, it tells us that MI, the acceleration of the ice, so I'm thinking of it sometimes as particles and sometimes planets. It doesn't matter. J is the sum over all of J not equal I. not equal I, the product of their masses, the constant of gravitation. I divide by the square of the distance between them. And then they're attracting. So this is a long unit vector between them. That's simple enough for our caution. And we can rewrite this. As Pi dot equals minus del V del Qi, where, so this is a second order differential equation. We're always happy to reduce it to a first order differential equation, which is as follows. And where, so Pi equals the mass times the velocity, so the momentum is the mass times. So the momentum is the mass times the velocity. These are the momenta. And V is minus the sum of i equal to j, g m i m j over the distance between i and j is the potential axis. So now, if I had a board on a side, I would write this on the side, because I need to come back to this. Remember, this is the important equations in the square. Okay. Any questions about the stuff? Like I said, this is high school physics. Okay. So, of course, n-body, we can look at different mods. We can start with the two-body problem. Problem. This is just, like, for instance, a sun and a planet. This was solved by Newton in 1687. So this is a very, very old problem, right? And it was a big part of his motivation for his laws of motion and for the calculus, right? And for the calculus, right? So I'm saying this problem historically really is one of the problems that drove huge areas of mathematics. So, great, so that's easy. So you're like, okay, next step, three bodies, no problem. Right, but so on to the next case, the three body problems, which is, of course, could be any three, but the important ones are the sun plus moon plus the earth. Plus moon plus the earth. This problem turns out to be, well, first of all, it was incredibly important. And the reason why it's incredibly important is because if you have a lunar position against the stars, you can use that to calculate grenades mean time. And you can also calculate local time just by observation on ship with the cell. by observation on ship. So this is all ship navigation plus local time into longitude. You probably heard of the problem of longitude. For the ships, finding their longitude was incredibly important. And at the time that this was all going on, they did not have chronometers which were good enough or affordable at all. So there was actually a very important problem. There was an approximately no There was an approximately million-dollar prize. I mean, depending on how you count inflation. And it was for approximate solutions. 1763. So my perturbation was not actually a solution. Of course, the yeah. So and uh Um and uh in fact it was later proved that you sometimes cannot solve it. So this system is chaotic. And that was proved by Poincaré in 1910. And there were later prizes by other kings. And I this was just a very important question. Is Poincaré chaotic in the sense that small initial errors lead to Initial errors lead to larger errors. So, in some sense, there just will never be a completely satisfactory solution. I mean, there's been a lot of work. I mean, I don't want to, a lot of people have done very interesting things, but there is just a lot that will never be known about this case. And so what's the difference? And worse, four-body problem is just worse. So, why can we solve this two-body problem so well, but not this three-body problem? And basically, what it comes down to is integrals of motion. So, an integral of motion, I'm assuming my potential energies are all time independent. Integral of motion is a quantity That doesn't change over time. So, for instance, position or I mean typically like momentum or energy function on the system. So I'm going to claim that sort of the first major goal of symplectic geometry and as I said a number of other fields of mathematics is a major goal is to solve dynamical systems like this. Predict the future behavior based on the current position and velocity. And what's a key strategy is to find enough intervals of motion. Someone's got a first integral of motion, but I don't feel like shortening it. Of motion to reduce the solution to quadrature, just solving animals. Typically people are very happy if they can reduce the problem to just solving an integral. Even if the integral they can't, doesn't have a closed form solution, which is kind of fine. Okay, so we have enough integrals of motion. For the two-body problem, but not the three. So if you think about the two-body problem, they have six degrees of freedom, right? Because there's three positions for each one. For the three-body problem, we have nine degrees of freedom, so that just works. Of freedom, so that just was bigger. Right, and you can sort of see how informally, if we know that we're on constants of a bunch of functions, that's great, that helps us solve it, right? And I'll talk a little bit more about exactly what we mean by math and what properties they have to have later. But really, what we're looking for is something called completely integrable systems. And I'm going to uh oh, there's a call. Okay, so I'm gonna back away from this problem a little bit, and then I'll return to it as I talk about the general brain. Okay, so I want to give a little background on some plastic geometry first. So we're going to have an M. It's going to be 2M, a bunch of mathematical. Two add an eventual manifold. And we're gonna, the next thing we're gonna have is omega, which is a two-form on M, a symplectic form. So it eats two vectors and spits out a real number at each point. It's anti-symmetric. And it has two properties. And it has two properties. So first of all, it's closed, which means that d omega equals zero. First property, and the second property is that it's non-degenerate. There's two ways of thinking, well, there's a number of ways of thinking of non-degeneracy. The tool I will use is that for all non-zero. Is that for all non-zero vectors, there exists another vector such that omega c of theta is not equal to zero. So I would say every vector has a friend. Remember that? The pelt and the proof. And an equivalent formulation is that, well, we can always give an any two form. Always given any two form, you can define a map from the tangent space to the cotangent space by just setting your vector c to i x c omega, which is just you take the two form and you first feed x c, and now it's only once one more vector. So it's a one form. And this map is isomer. We know something very important for us because we're going to. You know something very important for us because we're going to go back and forth between these two spaces all the time. And then I need some phlectomorphism from omega to M prime, omega prime is a diffeomorphism. F from M to M prime such that F star the coba of omega prime is equal to. We will call this symplactic diffeomorphism, but anyway, I'm calling it symphalactic morphism. So this is the basic category that we're interested in, and I wanted to start by giving And I want to start by giving some examples. So the example one is M is equal to R to Mega. Omega is the sum of dpi foot. So it's obviously closed, so it's straightforward to check it's not a general. And a theorem due to Darboux is locally, this is the only example. So supplied manifolds have no local invariance. They are more like complex manifolds than they are like Ramanian manifolds. So analogies to complex manifolds in many ways. And example two is we could let m be the cotangent bundle of n for m. I don't magic. Then, if we have coordinates Q1 through Qn on N induce coordinates Q1 through Qn, P1 through PN, T star of N. So essentially, PI. So essentially, Pi is the coefficient of dpi. Pi is the coefficient of dqi. You write out your one, your form, your one form. So this, in fact, there exists a tautological one form such that, sorry, I should say chord is a new subset of n. Of n. It's on the open set that will be global generally, such that theta can just be written as the sum of p i dqi t star u. So you need to check that that's the competitive coordinates, but it is. And then d beta is a syphilactic form and that's straightforward to And that's straightforward to check because we can see that d theta is the sum of dpi edge dqi on d squared. So we have a canonical symplectic form on the cotangent space. Cotangent bundle of any manifold. This is the central thing that we're looking for in physics, and this is called phase space. Or we're going to be doing all those physics. And the third example is the Pagini studiosymplectic core, which if I have time, I'll talk about how to define it. But for today, we can just accept it. There's a symphalactic form on CPN, or any n. And the important thing about this form for today's purposes is that it's Taylor. So, what does that mean? So, we have a natural complex structure on CPN. So, if there's an almost complex J on the tangents. Complex J on the tangent space. And we have that this involution preserves the symplectic form. And it gives rise to, if I take omega x j x, it's positive because x is not negative specifically. Because x is not x is zero. So this gives rise to a metric, the Maudian metric. So one thing we will notice about this that's very important is therefore every complex submanifold of CPN is symplectic. And this is easy to see because obviously you restrict this form as closed, nothing to check. We need to check if it's non-degenerate. But if we have any x, jx is its front. We're assuming it's a complex submanifold, that's still a change model. What's jx? A j. Just the map from TM, sorry, T C P N T C P N J squared is minus 1. So this is the, all of this is the, yeah, this complex structure basically. I'm not tangential. And in fact, in fact, these are actually all K. Actually, all calories, all complex submanifolds of scalar. So, every algebraic, every smooth algebraic variety is a symplectic manifold as a scalar. Okay, so this is it for my lightning introduction to symplectic geometry. Are there any questions? So we need a few more notions, so that atom is outside of Adam be a sub-manifold. Submanifolds. So I'm going to say that n is isotropic if omega d to n equals 0, which implies the dimension of n is last them are equal to n, which is half the dimension of n. So isotropic submamples could be at most half the dimension. And this comes back from the fact that omega is not degenerate. comes back from the fact that omega is not degenerate. It's easy linear algebra. And n is Lagrange, if it is at this extreme. So for instance, the zero section of phase space is a logic. So now before going on, I want to do just a brief things you may or may not have forgotten from, well, just a big statement of a few facts we'll need from differential manifolds. Let X in chi of M be a vector field on M. So chi of M will be the space of vector fields. So Assume that X is complete. For example, this is true if M is compact. We will always be assuming our vector fields are complete. It just makes things easier. And the ones we care about will be. So there exists a unique flow. This is just a one parameter. Group of diffeomorphisms psi t with m to m such that d dt of psi t is x composed with psi t. So this is telling you the flow at every point is this vector field. So it's just like throwing your pebble in the stream and letting it flow along the vector field. Unique solution. Unique solution to that. The lead derivative is by this curly LX of alpha, and it can be defined to be d dt at t equals zero. Where is it? Sorry, T star of alpha for all k forms on M. So you just pull back the form and you compute how. Pull back before and you compute how it's changing. And the important thing here is that this implies that alpha is invariant, so it's preserved under the flow if and only if the lead derivative of alpha along x is 0. And since we're caring about invariants, we're going to be caring about computing lead derivatives, sort of our main Thanks. Okay. All right. So now I'm ready to get into the heart of issue, which is basically Hamiltonian formalidum. We're solving dynamical systems. So fix H from m to R. So we're going to have some function. And obviously whatever we need to do. So to have a function, I got a one four. I get a one form. So this implies, I get a one form, and I told you that one forms are the same as vector fields, right? That's the key issue. So this implies that there exists a unique vector field in chi L which maps to dH. This is chi L. This is coming from a non-degeneracy, both the existence and the uniqueness. And this is called the Hamiltonian electric field. Why is this important? Well, so the thing you need to remember is Cartan's magic formula, which is if a lead derivative which is that the lead derivative is always equal to ixd plus dix. And this is pretty straightforward to check that claim, but it's just always true. And now that I see that importing a vector into a function does nothing, so I can kill this term. So this is equal to Ixh of dh. But remember, by my definition, dh is Ixh omega. So this is I. XH omega. So this is IXH, IXH of omega, which is equal to omega XH, which is equal to 0, because I form an antisole. Similarly, I do the same thing with omega instead of H. And again, I use my magic formula. But now it's a little bit different. I remember that omega is closed, which means d omega is zero. So this term vanishes. So this is d i x h omega. Now I again go back to my definition. And I get dh. But of course if I take the external differentials. But of course, if I take the external differential, apply it twice, and I always get zero. This implies that the flow psi t is a symplectomorphism. So we'll often say this as x of h is a symplectic vector p. And psi t star of H is H. So the symplectic form and H are both invariant under this flow. So we're getting things from preserved. And since our main goal was to get preserved quantities, we're very excited by that. So, what does that look like in our example? We're going to apply this to the M-body problem. This is the M-body problem example. Here, our phase space is R3, and copies of R3. Copies of R3. So our symplectic form is dpi by dqr on the cotangent valve and copies of R3. And we can write H as a sum over 1 over 2mi normative PI squared plus VQ. Remember, VQ is potential energy. Vq is potential energy. And this is one half, this is one half mv squared, right? The velocity. And so this is total energy. Everybody happy with this? So this is a familiar total energy. So we can compute dh is very straightforward. It's 1 over m i. This one over Mi Pi d Pi plus the sum over I del V del Ri d Pi. But now we want to solve for what is X H. And the basic rule is if you want to get a dpi, you've got to put in a del del Qi. If you want to get a dd QI, you've got to put in a del del Pi. And so this is And so this is equal to the sum Pi over Mi del Qi. So we see dpi became del Qi. And then we have a sine minus the sum of del V, I'm sorry, it should have been Q, I apologize, del del QI del del Vi. Well, I can rewrite this. I can rewrite this. If I'm flowing along this, this tells me that on my flow, I have Pi equals m Qi dot and P i dot, this tells me how Pi changes, is minus del V del Qi. This is the equations of motions I started with, but I put in the box and I said I come back to you. So this already tells me. So this already tells me the total energy is an inner rolling function. So great. My whole idea was to collect integrals of motion, and I've got one. So, not enough, but it's a good start. Okay. Okay. Any questions on the general framework for this particular example? And I will say in this particular example, you can replace this V by adding potential energy, which just depends on position, and you get the exact same result. So it's actually more it's more general than just this V. It's more general than just this. Okay, so the next thing I need to do is define the Poisson bracket on CBM by setting the Poisson bracket of R and G to be able to take Ng. So we got to take omega of x f x g f. So if I have functions f and g, I've got factor fields x f and x g, I can beat them into omega. Big function. Then I can do a computation, which is what happens if I take L. Lxh of a function g. Like I want an invariant function, right? That's my goal. So I'd like this to be zero. So this is Ixd plus D, sorry, so my H is D plus D IXH G. But again, IXH doesn't include things with functions. So this is IXHGG. This is IXH. This is phi xh phi xg of theta, which is just equal to the Poisson bracket of h g. So I can see that g is preserved exactly if the Poisson bracket is 0. And this also tells me, I can continue, that this is equal to minus Ixg Ixh omega. x h omega, because I could just switch the order, is it minus, but equal to minus L X G of H. So G is an integral of motion if and only if the flow of X G preserves H If and only if H and G was not. So this is what I'm looking for. And in practice, this is great because it's hard to know if a function is invariant along your flow in some sense because you don't know the flow. But often it's much easier to find the flow of the Hamiltonian with a cheat. So let's give an example of this. So this fix A and R3 and let F be the sum of A dot Pi. So I'm just looking at the A component of the momentum. Then DF equals the sum of H. equals the sum of A dot Pi, which implies that x of F is the sum of A dot del del Qi, which implies the flow takes Q P to Q plus T A. So if I let my function be um The integral of motion, the associated, sorry, let my flow be momentum, a component of momentum, then my flow is just translating in that direction. Look at my V, which I erased, but if you see if I take all the particles and move them, it's just not going to change my potential energy. So this flow preserves H. implies that f is an integral of function. So it's awesome. We have three more integrals of function. We're really adding up there. But I'm going to define still more integrals of function. So another example, which I'm going to read about the details, but they're not much more complicated than that, is that V is rotationally invariant. The same thing, if you rotate all the particles, it doesn't change the gravitational potential. So this applies angular momentum. is an integral of motion. There's three composites to angular momentum, so that's three more. So far I've got seven intervals of motion, which seems awesome. I'm making good progress. So now I need a fact, which is not too much harder than this computation, but I'm just going to omit it, which is. A minute, which is that f and g plus i commute if and only if the vector fields xf and xg commute under the lead bracket. And why do we care about this? Because it's not enough to have lots of controls of motion. You need them to play well together too. So essentially what we want them to do is pause on communes. Poisson can use. So a completely definition of F Yeah, that should be a DPF. Oh, thank you. That helps. That's better, yes. So we get a P, because if you think back to your physics, this momentum which is preserved, right? Momentum which is preserved, right? So this all should go back to something like I guess it's most recorded. Yeah, waiting on what she wants. Right. Which is the direction that she wants, and she probably goes this direction. Yeah. That's this way, right? Yeah. Sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry? That is what I want. That's what I care about. Can't. I apologize, you write it's a constant. Right, it's a constant. Okay. So, a completely integrable system is a symplectic manifold M omega and a function f F sorry, F equals F1 to Fn from m to Rn. So each is a function, but I'm putting it together. Such that two things happen. The first is that they cross on commute for all i and j. And the second is f is regular. Is regular on a dense set. So these are going to be the enough invariants of motion. And this confused me a little bit from the physics point of view is we have a dynamical system that is completely integral. It is completely integral. Oh, sorry. A dynamical system M omega H is completely integral. So this is sometimes called in the sense of Louisville, but the only one I care about. Well, if there exists functions, and the first one has to be And the first one has to be H so that I'm going to get F is completely answerable. So you want to find your, take your H and extend to it. Find lots of things which commute with it and commute with each other. So Why is this so good? Well, first of all, commuting is lovely. Because because our functions pass on commute, the vector fields commute, which means they generate an Rn action. That's just easy to check. So note X F1. XF1 to XFN induce an Rn action on M because they can do. Explain that. And we also note that omega restricted to O equals zero for each regular orbit. So I will call orbit regular if f is regular, like all its orbits in this dense set. And the reason for this is why we show that when this is true, remember that this is true if only omega xf xg equals 0. So this is going to be spanned by these vector fields in omega directions. So it's going to be an isotropic orbit. Be an isotropic orbit. But in fact, it's n-dimensional. So this implies that E is Lagrangian. So each of the regular orbits is Lagrangian, and N is the maximal number. So you can say, well, why at most n? You can't have more than this. This is the upper limit for functions that behave this problem. Um, but I'm doing okay on talking. So the example is the n-body problem has six such functions. So I had seven integrals of motion, right? But um only six is going to work here. Is going to work here. So I can do energy. That's great. That always works. And I can do the three components of momentum. So I've checked that energy commutes with each of the components of momentum. I haven't checked that the momentum commute, but that's pretty easy to check, right? Translate one, it's not going to affect... Translate to one, it's not going to affect the other components. But the problem is: what about the angular momentum? So, angular momentums corresponds to rotations. So, it's generally like an SO3. If you check SO3, it's not a commutative group. So, that's not going to work that well. There's a classic fix for this. So, I can take I can take add one component plus the norm squared of the angular momentum about the center of mass. So, if you think about it, if I take like the z component of the angular momentum, it's going to generate spinning around the z axis, so that messes up the x and y components, doesn't mess up the normal space. So that's why this is the correct thing to do. And we will see this, this is the essential trick behind the alphabet. Is this kind of cleverly looking for the affiliate in? Looking for the allele inside the module. So the two-buddy problem is okay. Right? I need six functions. I've got six functions perfect. That's why the two-body problem is so easy. The three-body problem, not so much. I've got I've got six functions, I need nine. So it leaves me quite a bit of work left to do. Of course, I'm not proving there are others here, but anyway. Okay, great. So now I want to go back just to the definition of the completely integrable system. I'm going to erase. So let me give you an example of a completely integrable system. So here's a nice example. We can let m be t star, the cotangent bundle of s1 to the m and of course we have our standard And of course we have our standard omega, but now I'm going to write the coordinates on S1 as theta i, instead of qi, because they're thetas. And I can define fi of beta 1 dot del theta n, p1 through pn is equally pi, and then the vector field is del del theta i. So great, it's easy to check that this satisfies these. Easy to check that this satisfies these conditions. So, our main, what I, it's not usually phrased this way, but like what I like to think about that is the main theorem we have is a theorem by Louisville and Arnold, which tells us, again, that locally, this is the only example over regular points. That's very important. Zero points. That's very important. So with zero, million deal on mold. If phi is a compact regular orbit, again, since F is regular at all the points. Then Then there exists a simple organism from a neighborhood of all to a subset of T stars. T star plus 1 to the M taking the orbits in M to the orbits in T star and L star. So it preserves, it's a diffeomorphism, it preserves the symplectic form, doesn't preserve the functions, but the fibers of the functions are the same. Functions are the same. Oh. And the coordinates theta 1 is theta n, p1 pn are called action angle coordinates. So this puts coordinates. Put a coordinates in it, maybe we'll hike it up. Okay. So I have five minutes left, so I'm not going to go too much into more detail. To say a few things, I'll go ahead and write this. So if h is a function of T one to T n. To N, then DH is equal to the sum of AI DPI for sum AI in R. And XH is the sum over AI del A del I. So if we have some function on the base in the action variables, then we look at the function. Then we look at the flow of it, it's going to be a flow on a torus, but it may be an irrational flow. So, in general, our actions are not going to be periodic, they're going to be quasi-punt, what things look like. So, what you can general expect. So, the fact that the two-body problem was periodic is a little bit of a miracle. Another thing I sort of mentioned. Another thing I just want to mention quickly is there's still problems remaining. This doesn't mean that once you have a Capoleon integral system, it's trivial, there's a whole bunch of work done on these. For instance, near a singular point, you can have local problems and semi-local problems with classification. Those can be hard and deep. The fibers may not be connected. So you have a nice structure. It's actually, you don't have too many automorphisms of this. How too many automorphisms of this are like in like SLNZ. So you get a structure of an alpha manifold on the base of regular orbits, but that may get complicated. And then when you have holes, you can have monodroming around the holes of the global classification. So anyway, this is great. This is very powerful. But it's not like an interval system. This is an interesting subject, basically. But I wanted to go on and just say. But I wanted to go on and just say a tiny bit about church degeneration in like three minutes left to preview what I'm going to talk about. So we started like a few minutes late, so when I heard quite stop at the bell. Okay. So I wanted to introduce two important facts that some potatoes may object to, but we'll see. But we'll see. So, fact one is almost all symplectic manifolds. So, the truth of this is that, like, both of the ones you can think of are killer. But for a long time, there was not only non-skills on the ones. Non-Killer wands that Gump discovered the first non-Kaler example in 1971. G-O-M-P-Golf. Oh, what? Golf. Oh, yeah, I said app. I don't know where the F came from. It ran up over Discovery. So, is this the analog of non-projective alpha great writings that people didn't know examples? So, this would be Thurston? Yeah, Thurston. Fantastic examples, but sorry, I was this from Gilman Sternberg's paper. Goth has all these examples. So, sorry. But the other fact, which is also important, is that almost no symplectic manifolds are killer. And this is part of the fact that we've created so many, and that if you have restrictions, usually, unless they're just really incredibly restrictive, what you can just say, hey, there's only a few. There's two guys, and they're both Caleb. One will be able to find. Tailor. We're not being able to find out. And so the first major goal of symplectic geometry is solving the dynamical systems. And the second major goal of symplectic geometry is to reconcile these statements. Which, I mean, it's obviously sensible as a joke, but really it's the line between the Kaler and the non-Kaler where so much of the important work in symptom geometry is done. Important work that somebody geometry is done to be inspired by the algebraic picture, say, what happens, what goes wrong, why does it go wrong, what remains. And it's so much of, I won't really have time to talk about a lot of problems, but Jem is a big deal. Let me just sort of think about this is a big view. And why is torque degeneration good? So, torque degeneration. For generations, help with both goals. So we can use them to construct integral systems and they lie at the luminal space. Between some classic perspective on torque degeneration from a syntactic generative point of view is that there are these things that seem like this magical mystery. Like this magical mystery coming into, I don't know where. It's just like, whoa, why is that true? But two of the things as a graduate student, I just was like, I wanted to understand. I didn't really understand. They turn out to really be toward degeneration. So toward degeneration is sort of moving between these. And that's what I'm going to talk about in my other two talks. It's two of these questions. That's a possibility. Further questions? Question of private. Yeah. So thank you, Alexi. I'll just stop recording.
