Thank you for putting together such a wonderful workshop and for the invitation. I'm really happy to be here and I look forward to listening to some of the exciting talks that are coming up. So today my talk is about curvature sensing with twisted filaments and in the title I said something about geometric incompatibility and how that can be tries to function. So let me start with some general remarks about geometric incompatibility in the context of Compatibility in the context of filamentous biopolymers. So, filamentous biopolymers, as you all know, and as you heard in the previous talk, are vital in a variety of critical cellular processes ranging from segregation of genetic material, cell division, producing forces and cell migrations, shape changes, and so on. And in many cases, these filaments in general are associated, can be associated. Their association with surfaces can give rise, and there's some mismatch between the geometry of the filaments and that of their surfaces that can give rise to the distribution of the colours. Uh the Geometrically mismatched because its size is larger than the space that it has between, let's say, two surfaces. And the confinement entropy here can drive the translocation of such proteins. And this actually happens in Act A, which is an expression of the N-terminum region of ACT A in mysterium. And finally, which is the topic of the talk today, is a somewhat more subtle emergence of functions, some much more subtle. Functions at some more subtle physics, which is having a chiral or helical filament with a soft attack to a surface. And the interplay between the chirality, surface interactions, and the curvature of the surface itself, I will argue, can give rise to function in many interesting ways. And it can actually lead to allow these two-step filaments to sense curvature at length scales much larger than themselves, and actually also allow them to tune their lengths and orient. Allow them to tune their lengths and orientations on the surface. And so the work I'll talk about is a series of papers over the years. I'll first talk about some of the physics and mathematics of the problem in general, and then I'll talk at the end about experimental validations in ecosystems. Alright, so before I get into the physics of the system, let's talk about what actually kind of motivated these questions in the first place. So the last question a lot of people are working on is how do bacteria make size and shapes? And it turns out that the colour is a little bit more difficult. Uh so the the uh the basic uh what controls uh uh so what is the uh Is the MRED filaments which are associated with the inner membrane of these bacterial cells, but they actually template several synthesis. And so these in E. coli, for example, they form twisted photofilaments that are short and oriented in a certain direction along the certain orientation from the long axis of the cell, and they actually move along certain axes. And they actually move along certain helical paths, and that's what is known. So, what we are, and one of the interesting things is that this MREP templates cellular synthesis, and not only do they do that, they have specific geometric preferences. And so, there's work here from Casey Wong Group and from others like Dr. Schale and Princeton, where they show that these MREDs, MRED can actually localize and enrich the regions of specific surface curvature, specifically Gaussian and negative Gaussian curvature. And negative Bausian temperature here. So we have an interesting system here. These are these little twisted, curvy, little twisted, curvy filaments trying to stick to the surface, and somehow they are oriented in certain directions, and somehow they sense curvature on scales that are much larger than themselves. And they can also, point mutations in MRID can lead to differences in length and subtle changes in the cell wall width and also the orientation of these filaments. Of these filaments. So there's a rich interplay of the, and I will state that here, and I will show it later: the chirality of these filaments, the surface curvature, and their elastic properties. So, and that's going to be what I'll claim as the trick that allows all of this to function together. All right, so now I'm going to go into the actual physics of the system. And so it's going to step back and talk a little generally about it. And so the work that I'm going to talk about. And so the work that I'm going to talk about is mostly done by my ex-postdoctoral fellow David Quint at East Merced and in collaboration with Greg Grayson, who is at EMAS Amherst. And so before I jump into it, I should say that what I'm going to say is quite general, doesn't have to specifically apply to just MRIP or bacterial protophil or bacterial filaments, because chiral or helical filaments, as was mentioned earlier, are quite generic. Are quite generic. And these occur because you're stacking monomers on top of each other. And as you go up along the axis, depending on the conformation for these single monomers, you can actually easily get helical arrangements. And so things like double-stranded DNA, Factin, and HDSC, which is bacterial chromatin, all have certain helical structures. So let's say biopolymers in general are quite usually twisty, and then the second part. Twisty. And then the second point I want to make is that in many cases they are adsorptive surfaces. So not only in bacterial contexts, but also you can have actin contexts in the karyotic cell, you can have actin contractile rings, or you may be doing an experiment on these polymers, and you just pull them down on the surface, like you typically filaments here shown to the right. So there are a large number of situations where you have twisty filaments that are absorbed to surfaces. So what happens when you take a twisty filament? So what happens when you take a twisty filament and then sock it to the surface? I claim that there is some frustration that arises. So let's first talk about a model for a twisted sticky filament. So in general, we're going to consider that the filament's chirality of elicity gives rise to a helical stickiness pattern. And this is because typically a filament interacts with the surface either through specific moieties that connect them to the surface or through, let's say, To the surface, or through, let's say, charge dupes or polar residues or something of that sort that are more commensurate or more likely to lump the surface. And if you have a twisted filament, as you go along the long axis, you're going to see that the sticky regions actually describe the helix along the outer surface of, let's say, this cylindrical protein. So we're going to consider these protein filaments as elastic cylinders with a helical sticky stripe. With a helical sticky stripe painted on it. And then you could potentially also have an anisotropic bending stick so that the filament bends with different bending moduli in different directions. So just to make it easy for us to think about the system, rather than thinking of a complex protein filament, we can think of something that looks like this thing on the left, which is kind of like a ribbon, and it's a twisted ribbon. And so what is shown here is the natural twist of this ribbon that it likes to have. That it likes to have, and let's imagine that one side of this, let's say the orange side, flat side, there's a little side that likes to stick to the surface. So that's it. And then you take this thing and you throw it down at a surface, and this seemingly innocuous problem is going to show some interesting behavior. So what are the parameters that govern what's going to happen in this problem? They are the bending moduli that I already mentioned, the stiff, the twist stiffness, which we denote by k, the negative twist of the filament. The negative twist of the filament, they are in parameters, and a surface potential V, which tells us the strength of the interactions of this filament with the surface. Alright, so we can write down just an elastic energy for the system. So it has bend contributions, which are proportional to the curvature squared. There's a twist contribution, which is proportional to the deviation from the intrinsic twist. And then you have an interaction term here, which is based on which is based on the sorry okay is based on the uh this angle psi which is the angle that the flat surface uh or the sticky region makes with respect to the uh flat uh the surface that it's trying to bind okay so uh we and we introduce a term that looks like v sine square sign and so that it's periodic and basically it promotes the binding of the flat this vector surface flat This picture surface, a flat side of the element with the surface. You can write this down generally for any arbitrary surface, but for simplicity, we're just going to take a really, just a flat surface to begin with and look at what happens. Okay? So, and we're also going to neglect any pending of the filaments. So, we're going to take the simplest case, which is a straight filament that's intrinsically twisting, that's trying to absorb to the surface. And so, the elastic energy. And so the elastic energy for twist alone in bending is just two terms now, which is the twist stiffness times the strain rate, which is given by psi prime, and the interaction energy, which is v sine square psi. And if you look at this, this might be familiar to you from different contexts, like interpretance matters. This looks like the Frankfurt-Contrava model. And our if you've done rigid pendulums, that this is the rigid pendulum as well. So in general, this has. So in general this has shows frustrated competition between two solutions, one with a uniform twist rate, which minimizes this part of the energy, which is the twist energy, or one with locked-in solutions with constant psi, which means something that looks like this, let's say it's psi equals zero, but the filament is completely twisted out and sliding back on the surface. And as you can see, the energy per unit length in the negative twist case is proportional to V. Is proportional to v, and in the untwisted or completely untwisted case, that's proportional to the twistedness times the square of the intrinsic twist rate. And you can imagine now that obviously, as I increase the interaction potential, I'm going to go from a negative twist state to a completely untwisted state. And the critical potential is set by simply the twist stiffness and the intrinsic twist rate. So it's fairly straightforward, you can think about it. But what is not so, what is quite not revealed is the. What's quite not revealed is the way this transition actually occurs. It's a sharp, unwinding transition, and it's also called a commensurate and commensurate transition. So, as you increase the normalized strength at the bottom here, and we plot the normalized twist rate, you can see that you start with a situation which is completely native twist. And as you increase the binding strength of the surface, it decreases slowly at first and then very rapidly, and then beyond this critical point, it actually goes to zero. Critical point, it actually goes to zero. And so the solid line is our theory, and the dotted symbols are actually Monte Carlo simulations or filaments. And you can see that the theory actually and the filament and the simulations actually do quite well. So to get a mental picture of what's happening, let's look at going through this transition pictorially. And so on the left is the twisted term that you started up with. And as you increase, and as you go closer and closer to the normal, to the critical potential, The normal to the critical potential VC, you see that these regions, these flat regions or untwisted regions, grow, and the twist is always confined to some region, a smaller region, which you can call a twist wall, or it's kind of like a domain wall. And these domain walls or twist walls get further and further away till you cross the critical potential and they are completely expelled and you get this completely accrested film. So these twist walls cause bending energy across. Bending energy, cross-binding energy, sorry, but they relieve proshi strain. And so as V increases, binding is dominating and then they are expel. The interesting thing here is that the strain that you have in this filament is non-linearly sensitive. I can come back to that. But as I said before, so this is actually a rich problem by itself, but I'm going to talk about bacterial systems, so I want to actually put this on a curved surface. So it doesn't change the problem too much. I mean, conceptually. I mean, conceptually, so what you need to worry about is that there are new terms of energy or your elastic energy, one that happens for bending. So now the, so because now you have an extra degree of freedom, the filament can now lie along, let's say, helical trajectories and that will create a bending, but also that will also create a phrenic torsion. So the sprenate torsion can relieve the twist energy, and so you have to take both of these into consideration. So, how much time did I have? Yes, sorry, I was muted. You can go until about I don't know what time zone you're in, until about 55. Okay, yeah. Alright, so I have 40, so 15 more minutes. Okay. Alright, so I can slow the tiny bit. So you can write down. So you can write down. So now you have these new interaction terms. These are surface curvature contributions here, elastic energy. And you still have your interaction energy of the filament with the surface. And what you can do is you can try to minimize this energy. And so we're looking for minimal energy solutions to the elastic energy of the filament given a certain surface curvature. And notice that we don't have Gaussian curvature here, it's simply our cylinder. And we can get Gaussian curvature at the middle end. And we can take caution temperature at the very end if you have time. So you can take these equations for the elastic energy, you can write down the Euler Lagrangian equations, and you get these equations of, let's call them motion, but they basically talk balance equations for these two variables, the angle theta that the filament makes with the long axis of the cylinder, and the angle psi, which is the thrust angle locally. Okay, um and uh so you have these equations and you can try to solve them. So the solutions are now not as I mean not trivial uh so you can solve them numerically and so what I'm going to do is give you a pictorial throughout what these solutions look like and what the important things to look for are. So here are different you can see different groups and so they are groups with different radii of curvature of the cylinders and for each group with a fixed radius of the cylinder the average Of the cylinder, the arrow denotes the direction of increasing interaction potential. And the color bar is showing you the local twist rate. And so blue means that they're completely untwisted. And one means they are in their native twisted state. So when you start with low interaction potential, let's look at this B in the middle. You start with something that has a native twist and is like straight along the axis of the cylinder, but as you increase the interaction potential, But as you increase the interaction potential, you can see, as we predicted from before, this gradual unwinding or untwisting transition. But along with that, the filament also now begins to tilt. And so it's because the tilt can actually, while it causes bending energy, it actually can relieve the twist energy through the frenet target. And if you look at situations where the bending is weak, you can see there are some interesting effects, which is that they read. The fact switch is at the regions where you have these twist walls, you actually get chains. And so where the filament actually straightens up in the axial direction. The things I want to point out are that you can see that this phenomenon is generic. It happens for different values of the size of the radius of the cylinder, and it will also happen for different values of the two string. So the point I want to make here is that Point that I want to make here is that surface interactions can induce unwinding, and these can be relieved in the when you have a surface with some curvature like these cylinders here, this unwinding can be relieved by helical writing so that actually sets an orientation. So the filaments aren't twist and then tilt and that these surface interactions therefore drive velocity activations, even in filaments with no spontaneous curvature. So these are filaments that dislike to be straight. Are filaments that dislike to be straight, but the interaction with the surface causes it to adopt helical configurations. Alright, so that's one of the interesting things to say here. And so let's look at how this plays out in a little bit more detail by looking at the mean twist and the mean tilt that I talked about, plotted as a function of the crit of the actual binding potential normalized by the binding critical binding potential on a flat surface. Potential on a flat surface. And I want to look at this as a function here. I'm looking at it as a function of radius. And so again, you can see that as you increase the binding potential, you go from an untwisted state. If you look at this largest radius, it's out here. It goes from an untwisted state and then goes through the short and mining transition to a twisted, completely, sorry, it goes from an agent twisted state. From an agent twisted state to a completely untwisted state at this critical potential, which approaches the infinite or the flat plane value for large curvature. But as you decrease the radius of curvature, that is, you make the cylinders thinner, you actually see that this critical potential, the point at which this drops off, becomes smaller and smaller. So surface curvature actually lowers the critical potential. And both this and the both, and how does that look? And the both, and how does that look? Well, you can actually write it down that the critical potential is a function of the twist rate omega naught and the radius of curvature of the cylinder through this omega naught r dependence. And it's basically re-normalizing the flat plane critical potential by a term that is essentially coming from the Feigny Target. And so surface curvature actually lowers the critical potential, and twist and tilt are both sensitive to this potential, even far from its critical part. Potential, even far from this critical point. Okay, so that's what I want to point out. But all of this is interesting, you know, kind of theoretically. But the question is: you know, is this have anything to do with real filaments? So I didn't show you any numbers. These were for some fictitious filaments. If we put down numbers for actual filaments, what do we get? So what I've shown you here is this, again, this plot of the critical potential as a function of omega dot r. A function of omega naught r. So basically, looking at the value of this particular potential from this equation down here as a function of omega naught r, which is also shown here. And the dots are actually from actual multi-colour scintillations. So as you can see, and as I said before, as you increase the radius of the cylinder, you actually, the critical potential approaches the critical potential approach. The critical potential for a flat plane, and so this ratio is one. But as you go to smaller and smaller radial curvature, you actually sharply drop off. And where do realistic values lie? And so we can do estimates of this for filaments like MRID or actin. And this is just showing you what omega naught R is. So typical radii of curvature, typical filament twists. Twists, the range would be somewhere here, and you can see that this actually straddles this knee in this transition. So, what that means is that this in vivo regime exists near a sensitive knee, which means that small changes in geometry of the surface can lead to large changes in morphology, that is, going from twisted to untwisted, which also means that the orientations of these filaments can change. And I'll argue next that. Can change, and I'll argue next that it also will change the lengths of these filaments. So, length, orientation, and twist all can change. And you can couple a lot of biochemical processes to these. You can also show later that if you couple it with spontaneous curvature, so that is the filament tends to curve in one direction more than another, this untwisting can actually lead to spontaneous force production. So, association with the surface can lead to the untwisting. Can lead to spontaneous curvature of rising element and post-production. You can also use it to target regions of a certain Gaussian curvature, in particular negative Gaussian curvature, which I'll come to N. And then simply having an untwisted filament can actually expose certain pointings that would otherwise be accessible. So that can actually lead to kind of aggregation phenomena. And so you can couple a lot of downstream events in the cell to this transition. So that's kind of This transition. So that's kind of what the interest is in general. So, having said all these things about the general system, let me now talk in the last portion about twisted elements in Vivo. So, this is work that is done in the lab, experiments were done in the lab of KC Wong by an incredibly talented graduate student, Nan Bu Shri, who's now a postdoc at Sanford. And what they have are twisted films in Vivo. So, they have access to those MRIs. So, they have access to this MREB in E. coli, and they can do certain kind of mutations to this MREB that results in different morphologies of the cells themselves, but also different orientations of these filaments and different lengths. And so the first thing to understand, which actually wasn't really seen before, was looking at whether these filaments indeed are twisted and whether there is any spontaneous curvature to these filaments. And so Hando actually took, you know. Actually, took pistol structures of different versions of MRD from Colobacter and from E. coli and did hardcore MD simulations of timers and filaments with four or more monomers and absorbed them to surfaces. And what she observed at the Long Story Shop was that they actually form double protofilaments that are twisted and that when these twisted double protofilaments bind to the surface, they actually unflip. Surface, they actually unflist. This unplisting also results in a spontaneous curvature and bending forces being applied to the membrane, as I suggested before. So this is kind of going along with our theory of predictions from before. And even more interestingly, what they could do is actually check some of our predictions, connect this molecular scale twist to macro scale filament properties. Filament properties. And so, what they could do was look, and they had access to different mutations of this MRAB, as I said before. And so, the names don't really matter much. The important plot is down here at the bottom, showing these little histograms of the twist angle of these different versions of these different mutations of MREB. And you can see that you have kind of white pad in the middle here, and you have two mutations. And you have two mutants that are of higher twist and two mutants that are of a lower twist. So you have a range of the intrinsic chirality or helicity of these filaments that you can play with. And so you can actually express these in the bacteria. And so the first thing we did is to look at how this twisting sprain limits filament length. So you can take our analytical model. Okay, and so let me explain this kind of detail. So you actually take these So, you actually take these filaments, you look at the free energy as a function of the length of these filaments. Okay, so for an analytical model on a flat surface, they're shown in solid lines, and we're doing them for different radii curvature of these cylinders to which they are absorbed. Okay, so the first thing to note is that these filaments actually grow on the surface, and I've said that before. And so, how long do they grow? Well, you can see that this You can see that this free energy increases with filament length in a non-linear fashion. And so, what happens is that as they grow, they actually build up crystals, right? And the amount of strain they build up actually depends on the radius of curvature of the cylinder to which they are actually absorbed. Now, as you increase the filament length, the cystic strain builds up, and at a certain point, the change in the free energy per unit length exceeds. In the free energy per unit length, exceeds the polymerization free energy. So that presents a natural barrier for the filament to grow. And so, what we are calling, that's what we call the limit length. This is the length to which we expect these filaments to grow. And so, you can actually plot those points down on these curves. And so you can see that for different radii of curvature, the limit length is actually to be square things here. And the dots, the smaller darts, are actually Monte Carlo simulations. You can see that the filament. Simulations, you can see that the filament length actually increases. So, as you make the confining cylinder, or the cylinder to which they are bound, or the radius and the width of the bacterium smaller and smaller, the filament lengths can actually grow larger and larger. And this is actually consistent with in vitro experiments where we have MREB bound to flat surfaces which show filament limit lengths of about 160 nanometers, which is where this green coil is for our theoretical prediction. For our theoretical prediction. And then, also, as you go to radii average below about 80 nanometers, you see there's no filament length because the slope of this current effort goes beyond the polymerization energy. And this is also consistent with extremely long MRID growth in tubular liposomes, which have radii less than 80 nanometers. Alright, so that's how. So, what I've pointed out is that this twist is actually critical in regulating how. Regulating how long this filament grows, and it's also critically connected to the curvature of the surface that it's absorbed. So both of these play an important role. And now we can look at how twisting governs, as I said before, we talked about how the radius of curvature governs the twisting filament length. Now we talk about how the intrinsic filament twist governs filament length. And so again, from let's say a model, we And so, again, from that same model, we can actually predict what the filament limit length is as a function of the intrinsic twist. And what you can see, which is these blue curves, as the filament twist increases, the filament limit length actually drops. So, more highly twisted filaments become shorter and shorter. And the pitch angle actually increases. So, more highly twisted filaments tilt more and more away from their preferred direction, which happens to be in this case the circumferential direction, because they have spontaneous curvature. And so, you can actually. And so you can actually do these experiments in live cells and you can actually try to figure out what the filament lengths are based on some techniques that I won't get into. But the idea is that let's say you can measure the pitch, that is the orientation of these GFP patches, which are this is GFP MRID, and you're looking at these patches and trying to ascertain their lengths and orientation. And you can see that what we predict, which is that as the meat just Which is that as the mean twist angle for these different mutants increases, the measured pitch angle also increases and the filament length decreases. So, in accordance with what we're actually predicting. So, that's kind of validation for our theory in V-Woll. And it's also telling you that these kind of subtle interruptions between the chiral or helical nature of these filaments, the geometry of the surface, can give rise to interesting ways of regulating filament. Ways of regulating filament length, orientation, and in the end, these are again related to the cell wall synthesis. So, you can actually, this is directly now connecting to the maintenance of shape in these bacteria. But I don't probably don't have time. I have like three minutes left. That's right, so probably don't have time to get into the details of this. But you can imagine that we can now go back and go into a talk about a situation. To talk about a situation where you're not just looking at cylinders, you can really look at filaments absorbed to arbitrary surfaces with different mean curvature and Gaussian curvature. And so this is just a color plot showing the free energy of adsorption of a particular kind of unit here on different kinds of surfaces. So you have spheres up here with large absorption curvature, you have cylinders with zero. You have cylinders with zero Gaussian curvature along this dotted line with different mean curvature, and you can have saddles where let's say mean curvature is zero but your Gaussian curvature is negative and so on. And you can try to ask where these filaments would like to buy, which means that you can now have filaments that actually go or because they have lower free energy binding to certain geometrically defined regions, you can actually direct their aggregation in those regions. They're aggregated in those regions, and therefore, again, the right cell wall synthesis in different regions of defined geometric nature on the surface of the cell. So that's pretty much it. I will skip this summary because I want to quickly advertise a few things, which is a bunch of collaborators, other faculty and students are actually giving talks that we are globally involved in. Talks that our group is involved in. So, on Wednesday, this involves a lot of the work that we actually do, which is intracellular transport, pinesons, and how argomediated mechanisms and steam work, pinesin motors. Patrick Nur will be talking about optimizing multicellular network formation on plastic subtrait, this is cell migration, and forming vascular and relations to vasculogenesis, and then Ole Cogan from CSU will center. So, this one will be talking about. So this one will be talking about competing intracellular carbon transport mechanisms and there's non-trivial transport and statistics, so analytical work there. I also wanted to put a plug for a focus session we are organizing at the APS March meeting next March in Chicago. This is the Gleana Cross Lover and this is about intracellular transport on dynamic cytoskeletal networks and the abstracts are due October 22nd. Due October 22nd. And lastly, I just wanted to put a plug out for a job we have. We have an NSF-funded center for biomolecular machines, which was mentioned before. And we actually got renewed for another five years and we are looking for a computational project scientist. It's kind of an independent project scientist position who can work with multiple faculty in the broad area of computational modeling and biological physics. And this is the application website. With that, I will stop and thank all the collaborators. I will stop and thank all the collaborators that made this possible. David Quint, who is now at Livermore, Sean Postoff, Casey Wong, who in both the lab all of his experiments were done and these simulations, and Greg Grayson, the former collaborator on the theory of these crystal films. So with that, I will start with my funding agencies, NSF and NIH, here. So thank you all for your attention. Thank you so much, Andy. So, first, any questions from the virtual participants? Maybe I could ask a question as a recording. Really, really interesting talk, Adji. Um I was wondering whether it's important or it's it's sort of whether you looked into the twist benefit. Whether you looked into the twist-band coupling and whether in this particular filament it's important or not to be not important, or and what will be the role of that? Okay. So in some sense, there is already a twist-band coupling in the sense that you have, it's essentially what we have is twisting that couples to a rising, which is why you get these three crop-technics. Why you get these three prototypes? So, in that sense, there's that elastic coupling between twist-back-band, but we don't put in any extra kind of twist-band couplings. This is the simplest kind of model. And you're right, if you had more intricate forms of coupling between the twist and bend that dependent on the molecular details, you could get more interesting features that arise. But we haven't looked at it. So, that would be a good thing to look at. Okay, thank you. Great talk. I was curious, it seems like you actually have situations where it's actually difficult to unwind the filaments if they're sort of trapped in a local minima. Do you see differences for the sorts of curvature preferences or structures you get if you polymerize the filaments as it's forming on the membrane versus if you assemble filaments and sort of give it a membrane? Yeah. Yeah, so I think that's kind of what we are trying to do in a very basic way by measuring this filament limit length. So the idea there was: I can go back to that here. So in a basic way, if you go along the x-axis, which is filament length, you can think of it as a polymerizing filament on a certain surface width. And so if you pick one of these curves, you're trying to polymerize. These curves, you're trying to polymerize this along on a surface of a given radius of curvature. And the so, as you rightly pointed out, this now gives, we have not considered this in our previous calculations, where you basically have an infinitely already assembled element trying to stick to the. But what this is showing us is that, like, okay, there's another problem that you hit before you do that, which is that as you try to polymerize this, you get to a specific length, and this is a little bit. Length, and this is the limit length, and you can't actually follow going beyond that. So, and this limit length is set by the twist as well as the radius of curvature. So, and of course the elastic constant. So, in that sense, different regions can have different limit lengths. So, the length of the filament that can actually polymerize is different. And so, but this space assumes, I think this is what you're getting. Space assumes, I think this is what you're getting at, is these are always untwisted. So we could, and this is something we've been looking into, is trying to understand as you grow, how much do you untrust? We are assuming that you actually completely untrisk, but this need not be the case. And so we'd have to look at where the untristing critical potential is and whether you crossed that. But that's something we have yet to do. That's an interesting part. One other question is: if this is for a single Question: This is for single filaments, but for filaments that actually have either cross-syncers or like to associate with one another, the other interesting emergent properties arise? Yeah, so the one thing to say is, okay, it's very coarse thing, like the MRDB results, they're actually this double filament, but we treat them as a single filament. And in these cases, they actually the association of the membrane is through a specific link around Z, and so. And so, if the linkers are only serving as a means to anchor them to the surface, then within this model, you can basically treat them effectively, correctly. But if there are higher order processes like link curves associating with each other or the untwisted orientations of certain filaments promoting lateral interactions between filaments, you know, then you get an First month, you know, then we'll get another rich kind of behavior that we haven't what I was alluding to, but we actually haven't looked into it. But that would be one way of coupling local surface curvature and twist to aggregation of this lateral. Excellent. Any questions from the in-person participants? I can kind of see some hands up. I can kind of see some hands up. Well, mine sort of feeds off of Orion's. Okay. So, yeah, so feeding off of what Orion was saying, have you looked at larger contexts for this interaction between the chirality and the geometry? For instance, like in hydra, where you've got two epithelial layers, and then you've got chiral actin filaments that have opposite chirality. And it's really important for And it's really important for kind of the functional like feeding and those kinds of things in hydra. And if you take a patch of hydra out that preserves locally that orientation, it'll regrow an animal with the proper chirality and orientation and geometry overall. And so I was wondering if that kind of like a large scale, organism scale application, is something you've looked at. No, but that would be our dream kind of thing to do. Our dream kind of thing to do. So, yeah, the short answer is no, we haven't looked at large-scale organismal scale pirality and how that arises from this molecular scale pirality. But, you know, in this kind of constrained case, what we're showing is that there is a pathway to connect the two. That this molecular scale twist can lead to orientation of certain filaments and certain directions, which templates the growth of the organism and the scale of bacteria, which then This case of bacteria, which then acquires chirality simply because of the way it actually grows, which is being templated by this MRIP. So there's this kind of interesting organismal scale thing going on because the bacteria as it grows actually also twists and this twist is related to MRID localization and all of the tension. So it would be great to be able to look at other systems and I'd be happy to talk more about Hydra if you're interested in that. More about Ava if you're interested in it. Absolutely, yeah. It's a crazy little animal. But of course, given the scale, you're going to rely much more on cross-linkers and bundling, like Orian was referring to. But yeah, I'd love to check further. Yeah. Sounds great. Thank you. Yeah, just a quick question. There are some very small microorganisms called molecules that have a band of filaments. Have a band of filament stuck to their membrane, and there was some conjecture that they could swim by twisting and/or bending their filament. Have you heard of this? What is it called? Molly Cute? Molly Cutes. Cute? Molly Cute, as in a cute molly. Molly Cute. Oh, cute. Molly Cute. Okay. Let's see. Okay, great. Okay, great. I mean, I will look into it. And if you don't mind, if you're familiar with it, I mean, we could talk about it too. I'll send you an email. Okay, great. That sounds kind of fun. Well, it's cute anyway. All right, so maybe we'll adjourn for this session. And I believe in-person participants have about two minutes. Events have about a two-hour break for lunch, but thank you for joining it.
