Yes, the variation is the opportunity to participate in this initiative. This type of initiative inferred some of the things that I expect with you, but now we are going to mathematical. So, I share this, and your pose also. View full screen. Voyager persistence proposed dynamic perspective to singular and what to note notion. So we have to We are trandos with victorial camps that are like here, MTM. Where Me vasara la variadad, y aho que three cosa Me mention Juay quiera, I voy if it is compact and that has a metric. And in general, I see here at the campus, and how to flujo socio campo. And I will conjure all the singularities. When And the conjugate critical elements is the union of singular periodicals. Well, we see the dynamic of flujos, and logic in. El logic in this definition and dynamic map. The video and singularity in the period, no? Very. Voyage critical and when the differential of the flujo has the proprietary in the tangent, I can contraries one that the vectors are contrary to the orbital. And depending on if there is a periodic orbit or that singularity can be also generated by the vector in the point. No, in case it is a singularity, no voyage because the vector in the point of the servants is not generated in a space, but in the But in the case that I regularly singular, when it is a regular and all the regular vector that is, that is the vector since the campo and that generate a space. So when you have a periodic average, we have when there are space, a established queue that vectors contribute, a stable queue when the vector is. A inevitable queue is where the vector is pandemic and other que es direction of the campo, which is the direction of the orbit. In finishing, sobre que en la variadado mijimos variables orbitas que se van a circar la orbita mi de mi pointo periodic point, like the verdes if the future and that part will be facifable. No, the part. The part of the orbit is that legal of my orbit, and that people are like a direction for the orbit in this case because it is a periodic order, and we have what we pass with the singularity of the simulation. This is not a cup for the movement of the simulator, and in this case, there is a dimension when, for example, the past dimension, and this has. And the choice of different things is a important thing to say in the top of the character. But one thing that my important result of this is that persistence prepared in perspective as well. So, the critical elements if they are a campo, that the campo is also very important. That the campus is also, and that is more differential of the flujo circle of fluoriginal fluid, the differential of my fluoriginal. So, this factor of contraction and factor of expansion, if we are sufficiently not the joy for three. No, because uniformly controller and Spanish, so this is important for me because I have a campo, but If you have a campo, I can officially criticize, and it meant in that campo, so you have a conclusion about the camposinos, since the campositos. So that is a persistent, because Latin toddling campos, and we are checking in the campo que techno. No. So, I've been signing. So, I've seen one to rebuild when passing. Latin, my campo y aims latien los campos circanos. Sarcanos in essentio de la topology se una. Or the campo está circa y el differential está circa. Bien. This concepto delita critica que y parabolica que digiantes es un concepto que pues extend with compactos invariantes. No? How do you? As a concept that results, because I think I have a information on all decided, so that is a interesting concept, other parts. So, we have what is the definition of a parabolic, all compact invariants to be hyperbolic when it is. So, you have this factor of contraction, this factor of expansion, and Factor of expansion and direction where we have the orbital, but we are composition of the tangent variety continuously with the point in my conjugate. And I will be interested in some special points of the variety. That is the point that the mimosa. This is how it is. If you imagine a map, no, that is a map where. No, that is a map where you have a riba, a proposed, all the points here in asia vajo, as we have a velota. All the points that will rib as well, they are pointing that in some ways. So, these points are not the points that are. So, what do we do to recurrent? Clara que las singularity and periodico recurrentes more simple, no. And the conjugate of the recurrence is going to be parochial, but all that passes all the time. So, that conjuncts that all dent of the conjugate recurrence, they are classes of recurrence. So, we have recurrence, we have the classes of recurrence classes that are all. And these are the points that we will interest in. So, can define that these confunds are and because you can compact invariants: when this is or when these are not and the idea that I decided that my books in more cuando else recurrences and So the parabolic is a rejust include more elements of critical elements, but we are a conflict and parabolic concept, or a parallel queue that I do have the recurrent faculty, but it is perfect. That is that the past recurrents are also here, and what the passage is that is. And what happened is that it is a conjugate parabolic. So, shout out to the proprietor of all the sinoems, and also here also. Also, with their parabolic points. And many more passa, have all their recurrences and parabolic points, and today the decisions that are all dynamic, are within the And now that the 2000s are all and they have, more than dynamic in here, to start. So, there well, it's a very interesting thing, because to understand a live. And there is something that is for this good in the topology, because it is not depending on the topology that is in the campus. If it is, or if there are a campaign that with the dynamic with all vegetables, so the problem is the universe that has been ready. So, this is all this motivation because. This is all this motivation because it is important because I will say, in this position, the challenge. And that there is a relationship superfort between this structure of things that contradict and things that are funding and the conservation of perturbation or a proprietary guard, or a proprietary product. So, if I want to understand what So, there is an idea of what can be structured on preserving structures in the space to respond to it. In particular, it preserves absolutely all my dynamic is a liberalized structure. So, we have a more city structure, not simplicity or the conservation of the other. Or the conservation of the laguna otter appropriate dynamic allies lagunas. Well, we have the lagunas other types of ideas of probabilities that we charge partial. That is, for example, this push in the country and we can also compong in a central space that we can say great, and a space that expands, but in But in the uniform momentum vector, which is in volume, which is the way the grammar is a fascinating dimension, and one contract in myself, in volume. So, that is a map of the body in things to do. The more everything we have, is that the country is not the country, but not that we have expanded, the year that I can see that if this porter. If this por government expands more, if this contrary doesn't contrary, and that is composition dominated. So, these are concepts more than the probabilities of structures in the people with a similar way. And a question that can have some relationship with preserving dynamic for perturbation in the top. Proprietary dynamic for perturbation in the topology. So, this is how positive to reflect a little idea. I have to say a ladder and structures in the other, and that will be the relationship that the relationship is very strong. When the structure is superfuck, you have all the structures, all the preservatives. And then I'll see you where this situation is functional, no? So, when I have the proprietary project, or the proprietary project, a thing that will pass in a series of concepts and their consequences, which I also don't have singularities in the class of recurrence that orbits regular orbits, that orbits periodic orbits or not. There came the point of the total. Well, this conjugate to a singularity in this conjugate. That is not a great problem, but when they have a singularity that is accumulated by the period that regularly. Probability period of regular queue, so recurrent so that is a stability and probabilities. That is not passing when the causes are. Well, when not in this situation that the guarantee is the stability and the guarantee of the privacy, but not the guarantee, if we are a good relation between what this type of This type of notion of probabilization that contains and the preservation of dynamical. For example, the idea is to have a orbit of orbit, and that is a robust process, with a probability partial probability, for example. And there are other things that I think is to be stabilized and. Stability and forced concepts equivalent concepts, there is a passage that takes the stability part of the periodic storage. So, I would say, 3,000 is all the periodicity, parabolic, so for the same perturbation. No, so singularities, when the singularity is not approximate for this periodic, it is appropriate and implicit that the choice. There are this proprietary period, and if all campos ahead, we are the proprietary. So, the name is my cup. And that we are going to this. And we are going to this because this is a situation that when the singularity is not in this phenomenon that is in a class, I regularly say that. In a misma class, I have regulated the stability and singularities, cumulative periodicity, and that champion the extreme property and because of the singularity to state and periodicals, their parabolic manifesto, and that is a very fortune, it is a very important. And that is a very important thing, a proprietary porous singularity of the activity. No? So, I want to try to understand that the job or that is reparable, the choice of similarity. And this can pass, there are examples of campos that have this appropriate change, we're talking about Lorenzo, but it is a marriage, no, that we have. Sotaña, who panels diogethito, because I'm very happy. So I can. Question that we are taking original tenets on the singularity that we do impossible thinking that a cosa like the singularity is impossible in contradiction in structure that relations. Periodic demand and parabolic perpetuation with a structure and parabolic structure or parabolic parameters. Singularity, this is not problems. So, specific and proposed partial problems that compatible with the singularity is accumulated for periodicity and that recovery relationship. When this is a proprietary, That is interesting that it is very stable, which has many dynamic rounds, which is noticeable, because that is detectable in the system, and well, all that is a structure that compatibilizes what they regularly with what pasta with the singularities. We are a little bit like singularities. The singularities were typical when I paralleled this, one space established. A space established and a stable, but not in direction of the flujo. The regular establishment in direction of the flujo or campo is. And that is a problem, because it is that these two types of different things. So, the budget proponent is a notion of partial process that joins these things that are grammatical. And it's compatible, that is a uniformized splitting that has decomposition that have been, the type of composition that has, and functional, finally, in dimension 30, which the majority are to the campus 3 in dimension 3 tiene este typo and parabolic. Well, I suppose that is typical of the image. Yes, well, it could be a type of splitting and a type of composition and parabolic comparison to a singularity, but what is the image of the faces of these singularity? Because also many of them, and when the dimension of 3 can pass singularities that are different between them, only differently. And this is a problem not for the campus. It is a problem for the idea of understanding the proprietary processes of the campus through structural structures. And what passes that the direction of the chambo vectorial championship is in the parabolic components and many more singularities of different types of sanguines and fluorescence. So, one of the problems of the direction of flujo or direction that generates the campo, the composition of parabolic composition, is mirror. Parabolica is mirror to normal. So, in the mirror, the space, if you are in the case of the campus three cases, in dimensions, you can see singularities of different dimensions in the same regular dimension. And in quality dimensions, minimize the quality. That is what you have. That's perfect. That perfect. So this problem, what we do is in the normal space. That is a pace that I disaster of the direction of the campaign, because the mirror, the people that are normal in the direction of the campo. Well, what is induced a campo in the normal campaign? In the normal flow, apart from the differential part of the flujo. So, charity vector in the normal vector, the very operating of flujo, we can see the normal fluid in the point that I move, I have, but the point of equals. Tengo vector in the normal vector, we operate the differential. Well, I would say that this vector doesn't be the normal in the point of equals. All the projects, the normal project, which is vectors, and if a flujo. A flujo que es inducido por el differential, but in the tangent in the non-guenation of the problem of the direction of the campaign with the compositions and composition. So, with good introduction a notion of partial que es not. Partial queue is in the normal partial, that is one probability and probability and partial probabilities, because the problem is the singularity, it is a problem that I exemplify with the street, but it is a problem to idea of the root versus the problem structure. So, the idea is to structure structures, the normal structure, as we have said, not and try to define the definition. The normal. The normal pas not definitely in the singularity, no? So, conclusion was to be a notion that I exist in the normal singularity. But I see, and we are noticing much more definition, and that is the peril in this flujo normal flu, which is in the singularity, but we are some other proprietary. We have some other proprietary, for example, that not the directions establish from the singularity of the recurrence. So, when we pass these things, the campo que flu inducido el normal fluid is hyperbolic and that the singularity with a extra recuperamos is characterization of what is required that in a Of this proprietary project that, in similarity, is equivalent to the stability, the recuperamos are a characterization through a type of partiality. So, with Christian, we know that audience of the three dimensions have this type of probability, and many people with Nelda Tambelay. Nelda, also, y with Jennifer Borco Jesus, we know that all the three has this type of problem. So, that's a very identical choice to have this problem that the principal. No, it's there and. So, a error and campus in dimensions in this proprietary, but it is a 13, and in particular, this proprietary multi-singular and probability that is another thing that are equivalent when they are a singularity. But, in the rest of that in dimension 3, well, here we can singularity differently, but in a moment, you can So, can we say singularity differently in dimension 3 in the same class? It is a situation that is facing. And the question is that this has a probability or if the type of probability is not only audience. So, very connected with Nelda, we have all that in this. All that have this structure that we are major and well, we are trying to see if we can see the hypothesis that we have in the combinatorial, which also is a dense to understand that pass away, to understand the campus in general, at all. No. Noticieno elo minutes to start propaganda. Claro que, claro que sí. Clara que, claro que si drenda. Yences. This articulo with Jennifer and Nelda, that is a article that is a group that we have ajeyamica that is the internet and Instagram. That is a group that nation of Eugenia. Because Eugenia, when we are in Uruguay, with all this type of things that organized things from the groups of women for public women and all the masks. Attract public in between, and so it cannot be more. We are the time, and in good idea, to try to publicize it. This group with the intention that groups are working to work in very women. And for me, it was a cosamo because in some moments I need a passion, more like to publicize with our people who can understand a little bit more, and. And for me, it's animated, so I want to say that I think that these types of passions recognize and that change. For me, the million and the majority, I think that they are much more and more passing. The invitation that I have in the past that I used to do is very good. Elista, my friends, I think. But all right, many. Muchas, glaciers, Adriana, porna platica, tan interest. Tan, Clara. And you see, por here in vivo, Gabriel, Adriana sugar decimento because. Because this is space conferencia, I por there, don't yust with a woman dynamic women, and so today we are inauguration at the group of women, as we are mathematical and discreet, no. So, the mate and discretion in Latin America of this Congress of a group that. We are a former group that will have mathematics and indiscretes. So, this is the invitation to all the discretions to summarize, and these gracias because it was raised from this group of dynamic groups, which is not yet involved in mathematics and discretion. Gracias.
