Yeah, do you see my mouse also? Yes, we do. Okay, great. Okay, thank you very much. So thank you for the introduction. I will, first of all, let me just remind the collaborators that have worked with me on this kind, on these issues. I mean, I just briefly mentioned them here in the bottom of the slide. So the idea, the idea, oops, it doesn't change the slide. It doesn't change the slide. Okay. Sorry, no, sorry. So, the idea we are trying, the ideas I'm trying to discuss with you today is they go around these three sets of questions that I wrote here on the top of the slide. This is a series of questions that we are trying to work on since a few years indeed, and they are connected to the possibility to see if one can To see if one can track in some preferential way some kind of structures in turbulence, could be large or small scale. And why we want to do that? Because we would like to see if it is possible to invent, at least in silico, in numerics, but I mean, maybe in the future, also experimentally, never say never with the experimentalists, any system to force turbulence or to control turbulence in a Lagrangian way. So tracking preferentially some. So tracking preferentially some particular structure and eventually acting on these structures. And a goal that is connected to the first two questions is maybe doing that, having the capability to act and to react on some particular topological or statistical structure, we might understand better who are the most important animals inside the turbulent flow that are behind, that are driving the dynamics of the system. Dynamics of the system. And I will present three main different results. At least the first two, I think I have time to speak about the first two. The third one, I mean, I don't know. We will see. And the first work is a work where we try to invent some, what I call here, hardwired Lagrangian probes, which means that we try to invent, to prescribe some Lagrangian. To prescribe some Lagrangian forcing on the three-dimensional Navi-Stokes equations, which is hardwired connected to a protocol to act on some prescribed structures. And then the second question that is somehow connected to the first one, but slightly different, is again a Lagrangian hardwired forcing mechanism, but now it will act on the thermal properties of the flow and therefore. Properties of the flow, and therefore, I will try to describe some way to control the convection in a flow by forcing only in a Lagrangian way. And I think it will be clear in a few seconds. I don't think I have to spend too much time with this audience to convince you that turbulence is a hard problem in the sense that there are extreme events, small-scale structures, multi-scale structures, and things like that. So I will really not waste time in these things. They waste time in these things. Just let me stress one aspect that I mean, we are in the work that I will tell you, we are particularly interested in Lagrangian properties. So, I will try to focus not only on the Eulerian extreme events or on Eulerian structure, but also on Lagrangian structures. And therefore, I mean, I will try to see also what one can do by following particles inside the flow and acting on the particles and which kind of Lagrangian extreme events people, particles might. Particles may feel when they navigate inside the flow. Here, for instance, these are two pictures that I always show in my seminars. This is the evolution of the velocity along one particle trajectory inside a three-dimensional turbulent flow, and this is its acceleration. So it's just the time diverging of this guy. You see that clearly there are extreme events along the life of a particle inside a turbulent flow. You might typically oscillate in a more or less Gaussian way, and then from time to time you enter. Time you enter in small-scale tornados that have more or less the scale of the Kolmogorov lengths and the time span that is of the order of the Kolmogorov time, but which are really singular events for your particle trajectories, acceleration might be easily 200 to 300 times the standard or 100 times the standard, the standard deviation. So what is a way to suppose one would like to track this Suppose one would like to track these events. One would like to, you are an experimentalist and you want to particularly be good in sampling this kind of events, or you might want to track these events because you want to act, I mean, maybe deplete or enhance this kind of events. So how can you do it? Well, one blind way to do that is to see the flow with particles, for instance, with light particles, if you want to track extreme high vorticity. Track extreme high vorticity events. You may see the flow with light particles, and we know that light particles, even if when they are passive, they preferentially track vorticity events. Here you see a typical snapshots, two-dimensional snapshots inside a three-dimensional flow that has been seeded with heavy, the red ones or light, the blue ones, particles. And you see that after a while, when you get a stationary state, light particles are strongly concentrated on. Concentrated on vortex filaments, while the red ones are typically in eye-shear region. So, what is the problem of doing things like that is that you don't control. You see that the particle, you see the flow with bubbles, and the bubbles will go dynamically in the more or less the nearest high vorticity or vertical regions. And you don't have any way to distinguish, you don't have any way to jump from one structure to another one. And every time the vortex filaments will Every time the vortex filaments will die, the bubbles are again disrupted in your flow, and you need to search for other regions where you want to, eventually where you want to concentrate. So it's a way to visualize, if you want, high vorticity events, but it's very difficult to imagine that in this way you can indeed control or act on some special extreme events. So what we tried to So what we tried to, and in particular, we want you to understand how much these extreme events, how much these high vorticity events are important for the dynamics of the flow. So how can you do it in a dynamical way? Of course, you can always do in a non-dynamical way, in a posteriori way, just by a posteriori cutting from your statistics the eye region events. But this is, of course, very different from having the possibility to act on the flow. So what we did, we started to do a few numerical experiments. A few numerical experiments trying to implement this idea of having a smart, hardwired Lagrangian forcing that is acting only on extreme vorticity events. For instance, we played a numerical trick like the following one. We had a three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and steered at large scale by some forcing mechanism, suppose just low wave numbers, Gaussian forcing, they're the most Gaussian forcing, the most traditional that you can imagine. And then we decided we tried to see what happens dynamically by preferentially tracking high vorticity regions in your system and then killing them. So what we did, for instance, we had a sort of damping, a damping term, which is a linear damping in the energy and which has a pre-factor, which depends on the underlying vorticity. For instance, you can imagine a sort of on-off Of on-off pre-factor that is typically reducing energy whenever the vorticity, the underlying vorticity, is larger than some cutoff. Then, I mean, numerically, this cutoff is never so sharp, but I mean, this is put aside, it's not so important. And we tried to play the game by saying, okay, the cutoff where we start to remove energy depends on some critical vorticity. And the critical vorticity is, for instance, a fraction of the omega max that you typically observe. max that you typically observe in omega max or i mean of the order of the omega max that you typically observe in a in a in a fluid without without the control so the question is what happens by changing this fraction i mean of course when p p equal one we never we never control p equal one which it means that we simply have the three-dimensionalist equations for set at large scales p equal almost at zero it means that we almost uh remove energy everywhere while remove energy everywhere, while p in between it means that we remove energy only where the vorticity is larger than a fraction of omega max. The idea is to see what happens dynamically by do not allow the flow to even produce this kind of very intense vertical events. And we've performed some numerical simulation. We perform some numerical simulation by changing this by changing this fraction p, and just in a very, you know, with an empirical spirit, we just observed what happens. Well, just let me show a few results. Well, first of all, if you look at the total energy, well, the total energy is almost unchanged. I mean, you can change P even considerably by cutting up to 20% of the energy, by removing energy in all events. In all events where omega is larger than 20% omega max, and the total energy does not change too much, the total spectrum does not change too much. It's not surprising because our control is a control that is concentrated on the regions where vorticity is very intense. These are, I mean, a small fraction of the volume, and it is mainly a control that acts on regions that are very, very small scales, concentrated at small scales. At small scales. And then you look at, oops, wait. You look at, I don't know, because I have the zoom window. I hope you can see. Do you see the whole slide? Because I have the. I hope you can see the whole slide. I mean, it's true. Okay, good. So if you see, if you look, for instance, on other observable, look at, for instance, at the PDF of the anstrophy. The anstrophy is the... Is the vorticity square. And you see that indeed the dynamical way to cut off extreme events is very efficient. When p equals one, you have the usual Heiling on Gaussian PDF. As long as P starts to become smaller than one, you immediately are very efficient in cutting the production of intense vorticity regions. And with P that is of the order of 0, 2, you have really a PDF that is completely cut. Completely cut off at larger vorticity events. If you want to, even though you are acting, you know, still at a very small percentage of your volume, I mean, if you look to visualize where the forcing is acting, for instance, for p equals 0, 3, I think, in this way, you see that it's a very sparse set in your system. Then you can measure how much you are changing the statistics at all scales by changing P. And again, you see that it's. And again, you see that it's very efficient in removing high Linux Gaussian fluctuations. For instance, with P equals 0, 2 or P equals 0, 3, you can reduce the flatness, the maximum of the flatness at the smallest scale of your velocity increments of a factor almost 2, if not larger, maybe 3 when P is equal to 0.1. But this is not, I mean, in some sense, up to now, it's not so surprising. It's just telling you that when. Surprising, just telling you that whenever you remove energy where vorticity is intense, of course, you tend to not produce intense vertical elements. The real check that you are doing something which is dynamically important to control your flow, I think is shown by this plot. Let's look at the plot on the right. The plot of the right is, I show the flatness of the velocity increments at changing the scale. The usual plot that you want to measure to understand how. You want to measure to understand how much you are non-Gaussian. I mean, Gaussian is three, and you get it only at large scales. Highly non-Gaussian is larger than three, and you typically, in your 3D Navier-Stokes equations, you have a plot like this with a power low growth in the inertial range and then a saturation in the viscous scale. And then I show two different curves. One curve, the one here below, is the one that you obtain with a dynamical control of your vorticity. So killing. Your vorticity, so killing dynamical at every instant of time, trying to kill dynamically at every instant of time with this Newtonian relaxation term, all events where the vorticity is larger than 0.2 times the maximum vorticity. And you see that it's very effective in reducing the Long Gaussian fluctuations. While on the other end, the other red curve here is the a posteriori non-dynamical conditioning. That is, I took the 3D Navier-Stokes equation, so I took Dinavier-Stokes equation. So I took the 3D Navi-Stokes equation that had really produced the whole kind of fluctuations and I remove by hand in the 3D Navi-Stokes equations the events where the vorticity is larger than 0.2, the maximum vorticity. You see that the aposteriori one, where you do not act on the dynamics, you affect a little bit the statistics, but it's very small. On the other hand, the dynamically, you are really able to, if you would be able to track vorticity. To track vorticity-intense elements and remove energy on those regions, you are really able to reduce the intensity of fluctuations of turbulence at small scales in a very sensitive way. You can then ask a last question about how this forcing or I mean this extra dissipation that you induce in your system, which is a Lagrangian dissipation, is affecting the global balance a little bit. Affecting the global balance, a little bit like the questions that Prazad was asking in the talk earlier. And here I show you three different d nu, that is the dissipation due to the viscosity, the dc that is the dissipation due to the control that we add, and d total that is the total dissipation. And I always normalize them with the typical large-scale kinetic energy in order to understand how much. In order to understand how much the flow reacts to this kind of extra dissipation. And you see that the interesting plot is this d total. And you see that, of course, when p is equal to one, d total it's equal, this normalized dissipation, which is a sort of drug reduction or enhancement parameter, it is the same of what you obtain when you do not control, that is the, when you have only viscosity. But then when you act, when you, when you, when you. When you start to control, you have that this drug reduction coefficient goes to a value that is larger than what you had asymptotically, which means that indeed you have a drug enhancement. So the flow in this way, you need to input more energy than what you get out at a large-scale flow when you add this kind of control. of control. How much this can be implemented in a real way or in experiment, it's an open question because I mean, we do it, we do it in a brute force way. We just suppose we can measure everywhere and act everywhere in a systematic way. Let me then ask the other question, how to try to control in this Lagrangian way flows that have... I don't can you tell me when there are five minutes Tell me when there are five minutes left because I don't have a watch. Sorry. Maybe 13, 14 minutes, something like that. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you very much. So I have time to discuss the other Lagrange forcing that is now applied on thermal flow. We ask a question that is very similar to the previous one in some sense. That is, suppose we are now a thermal flow. This is a two-dimensional This is a two-dimensional flow where there is temperature also and gravity, so there is buoyancy. And you do not force the flow by boundaries, but you only force the flow by particles. You have particles that are hot or particles that are cold. And you suppose that you can control the temperature of these particles. So you can decide when the particles become hot and when the particles becomes cold. And you would like to invent a protocol to steer the flow, to make it as turbulent as you want, or eventually to control the flow. Balantals, you want or eventually to control the flow. Once it is steered, by changing the temperature of the particles, so by changing this Lagrangian forcing, you want to kill buoyant instabilities. How we did it? Well, we did it, suppose, now I don't know if I, because I don't have, sorry. Okay, so we did it by inventing a very simple protocol. We had particles that can have a temperature that is either positive or negative depending on the underlying vertical velocity. Vertical velocity. If the vertical velocity is positive, the particle is hot. If the vertical velocity is negative, the particle becomes cold. It's very simple to realize that this is indeed something that is typically you introduce some instability in the system, because, I mean, becoming hot tends to warm the fluid close to the particle, and then so it tends to produce a plume that brings it up, and then vichevers for the cold flow. For the cold flow. So, the system that we invent, that we studied is the following: no forcing from the boundaries. So, the boundaries are completely adiabatic. And then we just add a forcing true Lagrangian particles that move inside the flow and that they are hot when the velocity is positive and they are cold when the velocity is negative. And we ask ourselves what happens. Let me see if I can. And what happens is that we saw that there is a clear transition from a stable. Transition from a stable to an unstable situation. For instance, here I show what happens. I fix the temperature, positive or negative, of the rising and the falling particles to some value, which is, I mean, dimensionless in number in this way. And we change the number of particles that are seeded in the flow. And by changing the number of particles, at some point, you see that there is a clear transition. See that there is a clear transition. If the particles are not enough, they do not interact one with the others, so they just create small fluctuations around them. And the total kinetic energy is never zero, but it may be very small. On the other hand, this total kinetic energy normalizes the number of particles. And I didn't write, but I mean, it's like that. While if you increase the number of particles, at some point you see the total kinetic energy as a transition and you get a kinetic energy that is. get a kinetic energy that is that is order one and this we can do it and we did it at changing at changing the temperature of the of the cold and and and and hot particles and the typical uh this the typical realization that you obtain are two the two typical realizations are the following ones when you are not when you are almost stable you have particles that are never zero they continue to fluctuate but around some around some in the middle of the cell on the other end when the particles are enough to induce The particles are enough to induce some large-scale instability, you started to have large-scale roles and the typical structures that you observe in a turbulent convection. If you, then, okay, you can study the transition as a function of the number of particles, and meaning the transition is very sharp, indeed. It's a real dynamical instability. And I mean, we have not been able indeed to find a good argument. To find a good argument to predict where the transition happens. At the moment, this is really a preliminary study, very empirical, not published yet. And okay, here I show you a movie if you want to see it in the two different regimes. You see, when you are stable, you just have a small oscillations in the boundary. Here, it's very close to the transition, by the way. It's not very stable. While on the right, you see a clear typical case where you have large. a typical case where you have large-scale fluctuations and large-scale instabilities. What is remarkable, which is that if you measure the temperature profile, well the temperature profile is always stable. I mean the system is it's it's it's easy to realize that indeed you tended to produce in average a stable temperature mean temperature profile. You see that the bottom plate is colder than the hot plate. Than the hot plate. When you have a strongly turbulent, let's say, flow, the stability is really marginal. So, in most of the flow, you have an almost a flat temperature profile, but still, nevertheless, it is always slightly stable. So, this is a case where you have a turbulent convection in a fully stable mean temperature profile induced by local instability of your instability of your of your Lagrangian particles. Then you can measure other things, you can measure well there are you can try, it's not so easy, you can try to define a sort of scaling of Nasselt versus a control parameter that is how much energy you inject, even though it's not so easy because the energy that injected depends on the particle themselves. So it's the typical way, the case where the forcing is strongly non-linear and let's say not controlled. Not controlled a priori. So, what is the rationale? The rationale is that we are starting to play with these kind of games where you have Lagrangian forcing. So, objects that act preferentially on some structure. For instance, in the case of the particles of the auto-cold particles on the plumes, right? And the idea is that the long-term goal would be to understand if by then inventing some other By then inventing some ad hoc smart protocol, one can control some properties of the flow, either enhancing or depeating the heat flux, for instance, in this case. Just in the last two minutes to advertise something that is still, I mean, realizable only in very simple flow, to play the game of controlling in an optimal way the flow, we started to play games connected to play games connected to using the reinforcement learning, that is these, let's say, machine learning tools of trial and errors, to optimize the properties of particles in order to accomplish or to force the particle to behave in some special way inside the flow. So we played very simple game like a two-dimensional flow with a map of vorticity like the one here and trying to understand if there is a way to optimize the density of the particle in order to force any Every particle independently on the starting point to end up, for instance, in the region where the vorticity is maximum. Of course, this is highly non-trivial task, even a simple flow, because I mean, if the particle is simply light, then it will be attracted by the close, depending on the starting position, it will be attracted on the closest high vorticity region. So if you want to drive the particle in a particular region where you have, for instance, the maximum vorticity, you need to decide to be light or heavy, if you can change it. Light or heavy, if you can change the density, in a smar way, in order to not be trapped from wrong, not so high vorticity, be expelled and then being attracted only by some given region. To do that, it's highly non-trivial to invent it a priori how you can change the density. So we started to play with these machine learning tools to try to optimize by trial and error the density path that you have to decide. That you have to decide. And we, you know, we even in a flow that are time-dependent by trying to teach. Oops, let me see. I don't see the movie anymore. Do you see the movie? I don't see the movie. It's not moving. Sorry. It's frozen. Let me see, maybe here. Okay, this is a case where with a flow that is not time dependent, we just try to teach the particle to To teach the particle to reach the region of highest vorticity that is here in the top right small corner. And you see that at the end of the training, when you start with particles that are homogeneously distributed, you can find a path of density that must be changed depending on what happens on the underlying flow that is able to steer all particles in one corner. So in our very, very far dream, we Dream, we want to be able to invent a policy like that to concentrate particles in, for instance, very intense regions, maybe not very fully turbulent flow, but in a highly complex flow, more complex than the one that I show here. I mean, we played the same game also in three-dimensional ABC flow, asking to find an optimal path of density trajectories to concentrate the power. Trajectories to concentrate the particles only on some vortex filaments, and also in that case, I mean, the algorithm is able to find non-trivial policies to drive the particle in the regions where you want to be driven. I conclude here. I mean, just summarizing. So, our game is playing with tools to control turbulence. We would like to do it in a Lagrangian way, and we are playing both with high light and Both with high light and heavy particles in a complex flow or with hot and cold particles in a convection. Thank you very much. Thank you, Luca. Thank you. Yes, let me start with John today. John, you want to ask questions? Yes, Abe, sir.
