Okay, so uh now I at first I'm uh I t try to uh to start really gentle and I think many of you who told me yesterday they are interested in this dot construction will probably bored. I think it's a somewhat hard task to tell uh Chuck Weibo something new about this dot construction, so I will try my best. But uh probably you will know most of it. Okay, so um um So, I will start with the really classical stuff, and afterwards, I will go to two single things, which both appeared in the work of Toby and Caprano, but also in the work of the three of you, Emma Galvasker, Andy Tongs, and Jan Hung Ka. So, I try to get there. Okay, but at first let me just stick with the category of opinion groups. So, this is something everybody knows. So this is something everybody knows, I assume. So if you have fancy, you can also do this with our modules for other rings. So depending on in a second, I want, you know, you can do this in this generality. For many purposes, you want to say finally generated a video group and finally generated R modules, you know, or you want to say finally generated projected modules. Generated projective abelian groups and finally generated projective R modules. Depending on what you want to do exactly, you may say that R maybe is a regular Noetherian ring. If this doesn't speak to you, think C. And for many purposes, abelian groups are fine. So if you are scared out of this algebraic things, think abelian groups. Algebraic things, thinkability groups. Okay, so we're trying to compute something related to the K-theory of this. So, as Maru was pointing out, but at first we just do the S-dot construction. So, we will try to do S-dot, and I will abbreviate for now of abelian groups. As I said, you can also do some variants for other categories of abelian groups or R modules. So I start. This is going to be the first, just some simplicial set. And it's due to Walshausen, I think, maybe 70s, 80s. And what we are interested in, this simplicial set in particular, because the simplicial structure will be something particular, the simplicial structure will provide us with examples of two. Examples of two single sets of spaces. Let me come back to this in a second. But let me remind you what S dot of say above in groups generally is. So it's a superficial sense and it's related to algebraic K-theory of abelian groups, of the category of abelian groups. abelian groups of the category of abelian groups and if you are fancy you can take some category A. I will point out what kind of A as an input is allowed in my talk later on. But for a second you can do something for more general A. So okay, what kind of simplicial set do we have? So n degree zero, you know, webinarian group. No Vabelian group. Well, this will be just the zero. In degree one, I want to just record an ability group. And they will write this in a kind of funny way. So A is just an abedian group. They will write this in a funny way. So of course an albedian group receives a monomorphism. Received a monomorphism. I will try to stick to this notation. This is not an inert map, so if you get quite used to this yesterday, sorry. So it has a monomorphism from the zero and it has a subjection or epimorphism to zero. You know, for some reason I'm recording this, but in principle, this is just an epidemic. So S2. Okay, so now things get slightly more complicated. So, what I want to record, and this is actually what the whole thing is about, and all the other things just happen to be there in order to get a special sense. I want to have an exact sequence in my category of abeyane groups, or more generally, in my category of R modules, or in some category. Or in some category. So it's an exact sequence. So I rather have a monomorphism into some object B. I have an epi-morphism. And something which you can realize after a while, that it's equivalent to have this exact sequence ABC. This is equivalent to have both a pullback square and a push-out square with these. with uh these constituents with zero in this column. So uh if you think about this, this is more or less C is more or less, or C is a quotient of the monomorphism from A to B. So this is kind of the pushout part. You can say the same, the pullback part, A is the kernel of the morphism from B to C. And once again, just for fun right now, in a second, if we play our role, I can also Will play a role. I can also have a monomorphism from 0 to A and epimorphism from C to 0. So those are abelian groups, so take here exact sequences. Now S three is already. S3 is already getting a little bit more complicated, and I will try to introduce already some notation for you. So far, my alphabet was okay, but in a second, for S3, it's already difficult for me, so I will introduce some numeration of those things. So I will start with the zero thing, and now you know, I just You know, I just taught some years ago linear algebra to students. I can only remember this one convention of how to number things like in linear algebra. So it will be zero first and one second. And no other convention will appear, I hope, in my talk. So zero two, zero throw and then I'm going to continue. This is the only convention for today. Convention for today. Three. So I want to have monomorphisms here. I want to have epimorphisms down here. A one, two, a one, three epimorphism here. And every morphine to zero. Once again, at the moment, this is no additional information. I want to keep this, however. And all of those squares are supposed to be what people sometimes call by Cartesian. All of them are supposed to be both pullback and push-out squares. So I take the set of for the moment of all such diagrams and you know in order to be consistent I could call this also A00 A11 A22 and A33 Okay, so this should give you a feeling of how to continue the pattern. So this was a three of say a BMW. A tree of, say, abelian groups. You have a system of abelian groups where you require some of the maps to be monomorphisms of abelian groups, some of the maps being epimorphisms, and some squares to be bicycles. But as all of you know, a sufficient set does not consist just of a sequence of sets. There are some maps which should declare for you. So say some faces and degenerate. say some cases are degeneracy so what about so now my numbering is actually working in my favor because the numbering is made so if I just leave out everything having say an index one in it then it's a D1. Then it's ed1. I leave out everything having an index 3 in it, then it's ed3. So let me make some examples. E.g. So these are the faces, and for the generic I need to repeat some rows and columns also according to this number. So a G, so D0 of such a diagram, let me just not copy this diagram of this. Is going to be, well, I remove everything within index zero, so I'm left with just this part underneath. So that's kind of the easiest one to see, D0 and D3 in this case. The top and bottom faces, they're just really in the picture. Whereas for one and two, I will need to compose something in a second, but let me copy this first. But let me copy this first. Okay, so this would be a D0, and I said. This would be a D0, and I said D2, for example. This would be slightly more complicated. So let's say D2. Once again, I'm not copying the whole thing misleading, so I'm moving it this bit. This is all good. So uh I was uh looking at this yesterday and you know from my perspective back there red and orange looked pretty much the same. But can you distinguish the you know violet and blue? Okay, I will try to. So right now I'm just looking at D0 and D2 of these larger things and what I said so far. Things and what I said so far, the zero is just this smaller thing in here. Yes, so let's try a yellow, I hope. Yellow is pretty much different from what we had. So my recipe was to remove everything having the index two in there. So I keep zero, one, I skip zero two, I go all the way to zero three, I need some monomorphism. Some monomorphism. But happily, if I compose those two monomorphisms, I will get a new monomorphism. This is the one which I'm denoting here. Okay, so I just go to zero. Now I need a monomorphism to the epimorphism one three. 1, 3. I see the end of bicartesian square. And here I'm using something. In abelian groups and in nice situations, anywhere else, bicartesian squares compose well. I think it's pretty much an instance, say, of the pacing clamour which Philip was having yesterday for pullbacks. A similar thing for push-out. So if I look to pullbacks. So if I blew two pullback squares, I will obtain a pullback square again. If I blew two push-out squares, I will obtain a push-out square again. So I'm skipping this one too, but in total I will obtain a new bicartesial square. And this is once again mapping to zero. So let me record this in the picture once again. I'm taking this composition and this composition, and the new square or rectangle, depending on Square or rectangle, depending on your homotopy theory, will be a bicartesian square. And so I'm leaving out roughly this column and this raw. Okay. I think. Any questions so far? Yeah. Is there an interpretation of S3 in terms of the exact sequences? Exact sequences. I think you can glue some two exact sequences, but let me think about this. About this. Let me give you a different interpretation in a second. And then I think you can also do an interpretation in terms of exact sequences, but this I will defer to other people. But let me give you a different interpretation in a second, and then you might see what's going on. Okay, so I gave you a claim, which I'm not intending to prove. I gave you a recipe how to provide you with You with simply show face maps. I gave you a rough recipe for degeneracy, and I'm claiming that it's going to be a simple show set. And so something which addresses a bit of Raj's question is, well, how should I think about this? And what was actually in, well, I cannot tell for sure what was in Walthausen's mind, but I can tell you some bits of it. Can tell you some bits of it. So he very much wanted, I think, to have a super set of just filtered objects starting with zero and ending in some abelian group, say, or in some R1. So you would actually really want only this bit. So you want a filtered object. You know, you have some filtration steps starting with zero. Filtration steps starting with zero, and then you have a subabelian group, and next subabelian group, and in total, you have your large abedian group. So, you would like to remember only this bit or only this bit. So, this is easier to say. I have an abelian group B and a subgroup A, and you can recover the exact sequence by just taking the quotient, right? So, you would like to remember or just. So, you would like to remember just those. But there's a problem with this, and this is something which Bathausen is Doge construction addresses and which you can actually see. So, if I just do this, I could try. I could take this set of n step filtrations, starting with zero and ending up in somewhere near group, and that's something that's I can look at the set all of those if I wi wish. All of those, if I wish. But you know, if I want to skip a filtration step, completely fine. So this would provide me with D something for all but one of them. For D0, I cannot just skip the zero if I want all the filtration to start with here. So what you would like to say, okay, for D0, I would like to say I'm taking quotient 0, 1. Portion 0, 1, sorry, 0, 2, mod A01. This is a abelian subgroup of A03 A01. And you know, if I want to be fancy, I can write my 0 as 0, 1, mod 0, 1. Well, this is a Q sequence of filtered abelian group, filtering this object that z. Object that seems fine, but you know, you really want to have a simplicial set. And in simplicial sets, you would expect the space maps to satisfy simplicial identity. So if you do twice D0, you would expect it to be equal to, I think, D0, D1. So you want this really to be equal, not just isomorphism. And if you think about this, what it goes down to is Goes down to is, let me write this down somewhere. So this is addressing the following problem. If I take some abelian groups, say X mod Y, and then I'm taking some Z mod Y, for some abelian groups I can perform this also for R modules or something. This is gonna be isomorphic, canonically isomorphic, but not equal to X mod Z. equal to x mod z. And you know, you want simpler identities to really hold, not just up to something. And this is not going to happen with just filtrations or even if you take the bluepoint, if you take the isomorphism into account, it's not a strict equality yet. So um makes strict simplicial identities fail. Simplicial identities fail. So you could design in our modern language, which I think was not available to Walthausen back then, we could make an infinity group point out of this, or like space out of this. This is subtle, and you know, Waltausen solution. Well, I want this, but instead, but in a But instead, in addition, I record some choice of all the quotients down here. Since this is what I did: I take A01, A02, and this guy is going to be a quotient of this filtration. This is what this bicartesian square is telling. Then I'm taking the quotient of this filtration, this large bicartesian rectangle scales, well I take the quotient of 0,3 by 0, 1. 03 by 01, and I record this somewhere, you know, this lower line. But once I have started, I need to do this again and again. I need to record the sub-portions for the next sort of object and for the next one. And so this is something which comes out a bit. I think you can reinterpret this as exact sequences, but I will defer this question to the public. I think they you know that there are experts in here who know this better than me. Experts in here who know this better than me. But I think this filtered object and all of its subquotient, I think this is something which you want to record. And so this provides you with something which is actually a simplicial set. So the axioms really hold the simplicial identities really hold. About this? And you can also think of it as a space of iterated extensions. As a space of iterated extensions. Right. So I think Raj's question is kind of how to see, say, as iterated extension of something. And I don't know exactly. I know that this is the quotient of that. And I guess you have an exact sequence here, right? And then you glue them around this object, right? You could have four exact sequences. One would be like sequence. Four exact sequences. For example, sorry, it's going to be. Yeah, that's a tetrahedron. Ah, now I see your tetrahedron. Yeah, I think I will refrain from drawing a tetrahedron. It will just but obviously we can. Okay, so this is uh Walthausen's S dot construction. So so far I just told you about some simplicial set constructed of disabel uh out of abelian groups. Of out of groups. So let me briefly talk digress about an extension. So I can take x to be an exact category. I think this was first defined by Quillen. And I think then the axioms were simplified a lot. Although you're packaging something and you don't see the axioms anymore, by Bernard Keller. So I'm more or less following the definition of Bernard Keller. I will not tell you which is that definition. I will not tell you the first set of definitions. So let's reconvene for a second. What did we actually use? So we did need some notion of monomorphism. We did need some notion of epimorphism. So these were the two. We did need these to compose accordingly. We did need some bicartesian squares. We did need them once again to compose. And actually, something which I was not discussing. Actually, something which I was not discussing in much detail, but you are using here secretly. Say you have a monomorphism, you take a push-out of this monomorphism, then, well, it exists, it's A, but B, it's going to be a monomorphism again. So, this is something it's all packaged in the notion of an exact category. I guess many of you also know the definition of an exact category. In case you don't know, you can safely stick with opinion groups or other. Safely stick with opinion groups or R modules, but in case you know, this all what I'm saying is gonna work more generally in exact categories. You know, I'm an old-fashioned person. You can see I like cardigans. And if I say category, I really mean category and not infinity category. But you can actually put something infinity in here, so there's uh a notion of exact infinity category which I think is due to Plant Borvik. I think it's due to Platte Barbie, so I can swi uh stick infinity here. It encompasses both the notion of exact categories, as previously considered by Quillen Lakella, but it also allows you to take, say, stable infinity categories as examples, stable infinity categories and you're gonna apply then a stoge construction uh to those. To those. So, once again, if this doesn't speak to you, if you've never seen the stable infinity category, well, I think you see great ahead. But if you don't realize that you have seen a stable infinity category, just ignore this column. It's not going to be super important at all. I explained to you some of the Waltzhausen's DOS construction, so I'd rather come to a connection to two zero spaces. Connection to two single spaces. Double questions, right? Are you saying that every stable infinity category is an example of something exact? Are you saying the collection of all stables? No, I say every stable infinity category is an example of an exact infinity category. And there I need, I know I need more data and what sweeping this under the rug, but there I can take for s stable, I can take both uh homomor uh both uh monomorphisms and epimorphisms to be just all morphisms. To be just all morphisms, and then you know, I will obtain by Cartesian squares. This is all fine, and you know, I can perform this construction if I just put anything here, like no restriction or something. Ivan, did you have a question? Oh, maybe this is also a naive question. So, how functorial is this? So, if I have two categories and I have like the S-dot construction. Like the S-dot construction at the level of simplicial. I think you need, so from what I said, you know, if you need an exact factor between exact categories, then it will take you to something from Florida, I guess. Then let me show you how this presents, how this gives you an example of two sigmo things and how it Of two CDO things and how it doesn't. So I will try to do this more or less simultaneously over there. And you know, first I present to you a proof that this is a two-sided set. And in a second, you will realize that there's a flaw in this proof. But it's essentially correct. So that's what I'm going to talk about next. So I will not exploit the full definition of plusbo objects. I want to present you a single example, which I think illustrates the idea. And you know, there are more things to say which I will welcome to in this talk. So, I'm addressing the question for security. I'm sorry, I cannot write properly even in this line, and the title was already a stretch I needed to go as far as I can with writing. So I'm a little bit vertically challenging. This official set as dot to signal. And well, the answer will be yes and no. And let me tell you why yes. We will discuss why no in a second. So I'm in good shape. So there's something which is one to signal condition is like the following. I the first instance, I guess this was called TACU yesterday. This was called Taco yesterday. But I think I will not try to draw the three-dimensional picture. As I said, this can go wrong. So I think something like this. So I have two pieces of the boundary of a tetrahedron, and they supposed to determine uniquely something in my x3. So I have x2. F x two cross over x one x two and so for the two siggo to be isomorphism I expect this map coming from D 0 D, or D 2 D 0 to your like I expect this to be an isomorphism. So this is the question I'm after. It's the first instance of Tusil. I know there's another Of Tusil. I know there is another instance. Let me go back to this in a second. But this is one of the first two instances. So I'm trying to answer the question: did I present you an example where I can recover uniquely the X3 out of X2s? Okay. So I described to you what D0 and D2 is gonna be. And if you think about this, And if you think about this, what am I missing out of my picture? This bluing tells me, well, that the 0 and the 2 will coincide. So in my picture, I'm having 0, 1, I'm having 0, 3, so all of this is in here. I have the morphism between them. The yellow one, The yellow one over there. And now it starts, the gluing starts because 1, 2 is not in my picture of D2, but it is in this picture. So this is part of the gluing I did. 1, 2, 3, 7 epimorphism here. I have an epimorphism to work. I have an upper morph control zero here. This is once again bipartition. And this outer bit is going to be bipartisan as well. So I'm really missing the object bright colour drop somewhere out there. So what about A02? Like this object is not in the chart so far, so I need to do something to recover this object. But you know that in my desired thing over here, I did want A02 to fit into a pullback square here. So this is one thing I can do. And I can take the pullback of my diagram A03, A13, A12. A13A12, and I get something. And due to my axioms, this is going to be a monomorphism, and this is going to be an epimorphism. And I should also refer that this is actually going to be a pullback and a push-out back. So, and also, I will get an induced map back here. I think by a variant of the Blue Eclimber, which pacing climber. Luing climber, which or pacing climber, sorry, which Philip was presenting to us, this square is also going to be Pushel and Uber. So I can recover more or less the whole datum of S3, so an object in S3. So it looks pretty good. I should be more or less two-sigo here. There's a caveat with this. So several caveats around, but let me see. Around, but let me see. It's a similar caveat as the one which Welthausen was trying to treat with this Walthausen shapes. We took the pill back here and they are only where we find optocanonical, but still optoasomorphic. So I can put many different objects here and I will obtain the diagram which I want here, but this is not how isomorphisms strictly work. And so the first answer is no, this is not a two-seagle set because you know. A two signal set because you know I can choose something, but it's not going to be an isomorphism. So that's not a two signal set. But something which was really influential, and I think you can make precise, and this is an example which was identified by both groups of authors. So both Ivanov Pranov. And I hope I've put the accents in the right place. Carilla, who are you? Perfect. Thank you. So, both sets of authors have identified this as an example of two-zero space or a different position space, depending on your liking. But I have dot for the set space and not set. So as dot, and I can do this in any exact category, so also dot of A is an example. And you can do this actually in group voids, where you allow for your morphisms between the diagrams of this shape to be isomorphisms. Isomorphisms. And then you have a notion of group point in every degree, and that's going to be a simplicial group point, and that is an example of a two-siegel space or a simplicial space which is two-siegler, or a simplicial group void which is two sieges. For an exact page array. So we took care of this caveat. There are some remarks which I think are in order here. So in principle, I describe to you what to do with the exact category. Walthausen was much more daring than I am. He actually put in not just an exact category. And not just an exact category, what we call today a Walthausen category. Obviously, he didn't call it like this. And you have a similar set of axioms as for an exact category, but only in halves. You have a good notion of push-outs along covibrations, so along, say, something like monomorphisms, but you won't have full backs and you won't have usually a good node. Won't have usually a good notion of epimorphism. And so you kind of only have half of the structure. And you know, this construction requires some kind of proof. So I think there's, you know, you can do half of it. And I think Tan is going to comment on this in more detail today after the look, right? Okay. So you do only half of this for those bulge housing or co-fibration categories. But on the nose, this doesn't work in urban household categories. So let me make a tactical remark, so we took care of this, but this does not, and I would say immediately. Okay. I think I will make some more remarks but uh let me ask you first, are there any questions for that? Looking whether I need to have something specific. So there are more remarks to be made and one of them, okay, I presented you an example of more something to single, it's a space, not a set, but up to this, I presented you in its. Up to this, I presented you an example. So, if you remember, I think it was in Philip's talk, but maybe the two talks of yesterday's morning, you can also say, well, maybe this is just single set and a single space. And yeah, well, I presented to you a complicated proof of this particular example of sigo spaces being too signal. Well, maybe there I just tricked you into something. Probably, but let's see. But let's see why this is not a SEGO space in general. I want to keep this up there because I will still do a similar example to this. Maybe I will actually go with this too. So, example, let's say, in general, and you know. In general, and you know, you can find examples of A where it will be a pseudo-space, but they are somewhat special in our comment. On this, in general, S dot of A is not a siege space. Something which occurred both, I think, in Walker's but also in Philip's talk was: you know, if you have a pseudo space, you have S2 of your A, and it's essentially determined by S1 of A. So it should be some kind of equivalence or isomorphism here. So I want to want So I want to uh want uh as not as easy. So what about EG? You will look at this map, given by d0, d2, or d2, d0, up to your liking. So what is roughly saying to me? I said to you that object in this left-hand side, they're roughly exact sequences. So I have A, B, some C. And I want this to be bipartisan square. Okay, so this is an exact sequence. This d0 and d2, this will remove either the last column, leaving me more or less with an object A, or the first row, leaving me more or less with an object C. So what this roughly. So, what this Rafnis speaking is saying is that my exact sequence is determined by A and C. Well, there is one exact sequence which all of you could put as a B here, which is a split one. You can put B being just a direct sum of A and C. So this being a Siegel space, so Siegel condition. condition is equivalent in this case to A comma C determine the exact sequence and more or less it's saying the exact sequence is split and I assume you have taught already to undergrads that you know not all exact sequences of abelian groups Sequences of abelian groups are split already. You know, the one, the Z2, Z4, Z2 doesn't usually split. And well, the same occurs for more general A. There are exact categories in which every exact sequence splits. Like if you take finitely dimensional vector spaces over a field, this will work, but in general, it doesn't. Even in this case, it's not quite. Yeah, you're in this very easy example, exactly. But for a vector spaces, it's hard to see. The sequence? Oh, okay. Then I'm misremembering. Okay, then you probably should come back. Maybe the only example is of like a point, or maybe like high or big sets that can also split. Splitting is unique in this case. Yeah, the uniqueness of the splitting. Yeah, you're right. Okay, that's a good point. So vector spaces with the basis might be better. Save again? You attach the bases to your data, then make it better? Well, I mean, if you choose a splitting, right, then essentially you just get SQL's version of the gamma space construction. Then of course it's SQL. But if you don't choose a splitting sequence, then it's not quite SQL. Choosing a basis, I'm not sure. Yeah, maybe we can discuss. Yeah, maybe we can discuss later. I would have thought that the choices of the bases tell you how to split, but maybe I'm thinking about this too naively. Well, if you, for example, look at the whole algebra of Becker spaces over FQ, then you realize that some of the structure constants are actually binomial coefficients. Binomial coefficients and they're not algebras. Okay. That kind of explains why it cannot be. Yeah, that's true. I guess we'll see more in Matt's talk, right, about all algebras of two single things. I think Chunk's example is applying the free vector space function to a total set of a finite pointed sets. Ordered sets is a way to go, but it's very important. But maybe there are two outcomes which you can take away, even if you didn't follow the complete discussion. So one of them was the example of point finite pointed spaces. And you can put in, so far I told you how to do this as job construction for This is a cell construction for exact categories. And you know, in the usual setup for me at least, exact contains the first requirement, the category to be additive. But we actually didn't use this additivity anywhere. We just needed some notions of, you know, uh administral monomorphisms, administrative hypomorphisms and some uh Cartesian by Cartesian squares, but we didn't use any sums or something. Use any sums or something. So, in general, you don't need this. I think there's a notion of proto-exact categories, a proto-exact infinity categories. I've seen proto-exact infinity categories, I think, only in the work only starting with the work of the Company Patrano. Did it exist before, or did you just come up with it? Of course. Sorry, I missed the question. Put a step. So, did you come up with the notion of proto-exact infinity categories? Categories? Presumably. It's form, but I mean it's borrowed from variations of concepts that appeared previously. I would say thanks. Okay, so the outcome maybe being you don't need additivity, you can do this even more generally. And I think I have told you about this not being a CDOS space. I secretly have assumed. I secretly have assumed something here. Maybe I will tell you that this is also not 100% accurate. I just told you the zeroth level of my simplicial set would be the zero object, but you know, there's no very zero object. I can make a choice, but usually I would say there's some zero object for everything in the diagonal here, and you know this is a contractible space of objects, but reg But asking which setting you are exactly in, this might or might not make a difference. But usually there is a space of zero. Okay, so I need to tell you a little bit about how this, you know, this is not, once again, this two-zero notion, it's very, very much, I would say, combinatorial in nature, combinatorial. In the communatorics of this official set. But why did Whitehouse, what does it do with the break-K theory I was claiming before, this S-DOL construction somehow related? So I rather comment briefly on this. Once again, there are much more expert people in the audience, so maybe I could refer to them for the details of this. So, what does it have to do with K-theory? Do with algebra K-theory Okay, so if I give you an exact category, I can define the K-theory space of my category A by taking this dot construction. This is gonna give me some for the moment simplicial group point or simplicial space. I realize it to be very precise, I realize it in a good way and And this, let me see, I need to take loops of this, otherwise, I feel something. And when I'm realizing it, I'm losing more or less all the combinatorics. So, you know, this construction, I told you, there's a lot of combinatorial things going on. But once I realize it's, you know, for the purposes of combinatorials, it's lost. But it's giving you a very interesting. But uh it's giving you a very interesting topological space, recording a lot of uh you know structure of A. And this is uh is a K-theory space, is the algebraic K-theory space. And I think this is what was in on Baltausen's mind for a large variety of examples. I'm stressing space because there will be in a second. Because there will be in a second a variant of this. You can also do, and I will not give you any kind of fruit. But if you remember not just the exact sequences and isomorphism between them, you can actually remember morphisms of these shapes and of the diagrams of this shape. This gives you a category, and this category indeed gives. This category indeed turns out to be something which I've called before the Wauthausen category. As I didn't tell you what a Wauthausen category is, I will not delve into those details either. But this gives you an advantage. You can iterate this construction. So you can do now a bisemptic thing. You can do n iterations of this construction and you can take this is a bisemplicial thing, the number of iterations. The number of operations and the size of the diagram being the two parameters, and taking the appropriate realization of this, you can actually take a K-theory spectrum. If you don't know what this is, think space for a moment. You can do a K-theory space. And again, this is an equivalent construction also gives you. Gives also gives you and you can even make this construction work for A theory spectrum. K the NFL looks better. You're probably right. Yeah, I I should ah. Yeah, I I should. Ah, no, no, no. If you want to take the space, you should. Otherwise, you're getting an order spectrum, right? Oh, yeah, the sequence of those. Yes, the sequence of those. Okay, that also gives you the series space, and maybe you can remember there are some kinetic sense to this. So, this is these are two relations to the algebraic k-theory. And let me And let me maybe do a spoiler for the next talk. So this is an algebraic thing, which algebraic K-theory, which many of us are really interested in, and we're trying to put this down, say for example categories of about thousand categories. But what about this example before even taking the realization? So we have this example of zero spaces. Example of zoospaces come from a source construction. And this is, I guess, something Judy was already alluding to yesterday, and Julie and Martina have told you yesterday a little bit about. If you look at this example of a Delta construction, it looks like this example which I had over here, this is kind of generic. So we were trying to figure out how generic it is actually. And well, if you do this just for exact categories, this is. Just for exact categories, this is a bit special. But if you take different inputs of A, you can make this actually a theorem how generic this is. So spoiler art can make the inputs, and this is something which Martina will talk about in great detail: can make the inputs. A, so that first of all it will coincide for say exact category, so more gener inputs which we already know about with the old construction, but we can make the inputs more general so that more general so that all examples I chose this fall. This form. And you know, I'm just taking a vague statement, but Tina will be much more precise on what this means. All examples are. And in the same vein, I think, but much more suitable, I guess, for K-theory, and this is something you will see more about today afternoon. I think Brendan is going to talk about, you know, you can take a different, more general input, A, which Puts A, which are those CGW categories, right? And so you can also look at S-DOS construction for those and see where it takes you. And this has the convenient property that you can also perform these iterated constructions. And I guess you will talk about this too. Maybe not. Sorry. I don't want to talk. I don't want to talk about it. Not specifically, but it is true. Okay. But you will get something out of it. You can do something reminiscent of that in a more generality and this will again provide you with some relationship to K-theory. I guess many of those people over there are actually interested in the relation of the stars of this specific kind to K-theory. Kind of educate you. So, yeah, I think I've said taught you everything I know about the source construction so far. So, thank you. And I'm happy to address any questions first. So one thing uh that has come up yesterday as something that's important is if you have a two seedl space you should look at its technology which is a one seedl space. Decorous which is one single space. Do we know what that is? I think this is really there are some relationships. Will you address this? Should I say something? Okay, you can read actually something of the Decolage of S dot of A. And I think the Decolages were figuring in this path space criterion yesterday. Path space criterion yesterday at the very end. I guess at the very end, you should have stopped, right? Did you? Yeah. So we have a kind of path space construction, which Martine is going to talk about, which also has these decouages as parts of it, but there are more to it. And I guess we will address that in more detail, right? Yeah, that you agree with that. Okay, why don't you know? So you wanted to know what are the signal spaces you plug in stock of an exact yeah exactly. Branny was asking this yesterday, I didn't remember anything, but the conclusion I have right now is that one of the two should be the category of horizontal things. Which are in this case categories of monomorphisms which I have here. And the other one is almost the vertical one but contraband. And uh vertical one is right now been category of epimorphisms. Yes, definitely thinking about that. There's some story as to how all these six people came to two sequels. I think the example I think the only five people this is really this is really confusing because I could not This is really confusing because I cannot do a related comment to it. Yeah, so the first two names belong to one person. I know. But there's a bunch of people and they all came up with the sixth colour. Maybe they had the six typical lines and all of the things. I think that this talk has said yes, I didn't know, but maybe I misunderstood. So, did you have this example? So, did you have this example in mind? No, we were just trying to say, explain why the whole altruist is society. Of course, we didn't come up with this example until Walthausen, did he? And I think Walthausen was, so the reason why it's actually um denoted by the letter S is because Walthausen himself was actually heavily inspired by a sequence construction. So he's he's sort of the father of all this um I don't know, do you guys want some common system? Sorry, many co-algebras and combined tracks that have the same shape that it's about either some kind of exact sequences or there's the whole algebra which is much older than there's something else called the del sat and you Called the Del Sart. Have you uh exposed shape? Okay, yeah, so this may be, I guess they are in discussion now. So, but maybe you know that there are several things of the same flavor. I think that's important. Okay. Do we have any final questions for these board? And now we have a coffee break and we receive 10.30. And I press stop recording. Yeah. The touch button.
