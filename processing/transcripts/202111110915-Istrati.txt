So hello to everybody and thanks to the organizers for giving me the chance to give presentation in this nice workshop. So I will discuss a special class of complex compact non-Calarian manifolds, which are Cato manifolds, and more particularly about a special class of them, which we call the Tauric Cato manifolds. So this is a work So this is joint work with Alexandro Otiman, with Marximilano Pontecorvo and Mateo Richeva. So the plan of the talk will be that I will first give basically one motivation for studying this. Then I will say a few words about in general about catamanifolds and then I'll present the more special construction of Toric manifolds. So basically these catamanifolds they are quite old. Folds they are quite old, they appeared in the 70s, were defined by Cato, and they were especially interesting in the story of classification of compact complex surfaces. However, for us, we are especially interested in them in higher dimension than two, and this is because none of them have locally conformally Keller metrics. Okay, so one of our So, one of our first quickly recalled the definition. So, locally conformally Keller metric is a Hermitian metric on a complex manifold whose fundamental form is locally conformally symplectic. It satisfies this differential equation. And theta is the left form. And this is essentially equivalent to asking there to exist a color metric on the universal cover or on some cover of the Of in some cover of the initial manifold on which the deck group acts by homogeneous. So, there are many questions, of course, regarding LCK manifolds. One general question for complex geometers is does the existence of special Hermitian metrics impose conditions on the homology, particularly on the Dolboch homology? Homology. So it is well known that for Keller manifolds, we have the Diddy Bar Lamma, which then implies that we have both the Hodge decomposition and the symmetry. So we have the Ram group decomposes a direct sum of the Dorbeau homology groups. And moreover, we have a symmetry between HPQ and HQP with biconjugation. So one of the starting questions could be questions could be can this hold for locally for locally conformable manifolds and the answer is no for compact LCK manifolds which are not globally conformable and this is basically contained in the proof of Weissman's result which he shows that they cannot satisfy the Debar lemma but in fact he shows more he shows that the first Betty number is always stricter than two times the Hautsch Betty number Two times the Hodgebetti number H01. So this means that the above decomposition for LCK fails already at degree one. On the other hand, we could just forget the last part, so the symmetry, and just ask, does the first part hold for LCK? So the first part only means that the Freudihertz spectral sequence that generates at the first spectrum. So in fact, the answer. So, in fact, the answer is yes for all the examples that where we know how to compute this. So, for complex compact surfaces, this always holds, and this has nothing to do with metrics. And this is a well-known result. I don't know who proved it first. On Weissmann manifolds, again, this always holds, and this was shown by Tecada by explicitly computing the work homology on Weissmann manifolds. And also, the answer is yes, on Euler clusters. The answer is yes on Euler-Claus-Toma manifolds, and this was more recently shown by Alexandro Oteman and Atlay Tolum. Okay, so you could try to make this as a conjecture for LCK manifolds. However, the problem is somehow that I don't really have so many examples of SCK manifolds in higher dimension, which are not special in the sense that they are either Weissmann or have a positive potential or are special blow-ups of this kind. So basically Blow-ups of these kinds. So, basically, the only high-dimensional example which we have, which is really special, are dotty manifolds, which don't admit any exact LCK metric. So, this is one of the motivations why, in general, to want to have new examples of LCKs and then to try to check this question of comology. That's the spectral sequence that generates the first page. Okay, so this is what I want. Okay, so this is what I wanted to say. We need more examples. So this is where basically why we wanted to study catamanifolds. So first the definition. What is a global spherical shell in a complex manifold? This is an open subset in the manifold which is biologomorphic to a standard neighborhood of the sphere in Cn, Cn minus zero. And we say that a spherical shell is global when it's. A spherical shell is global when it does not disconnect the manifold. So you can have in mind the torus, but in general, we are interested in this situation in complex dimension bigger than two or two. And we call a manifold which contains a global spherical shell a cato manifold because they were introduced, in fact, by cat. So, as I was saying, he introduced them in 77, and he, when he gave And when he gave the definition, he also showed how one obtains a general construction by which one obtains all the Cato manifolds. And the construction goes as follows. One starts with the ball in Cn. Then one performs a modification of the ball at a finite number of points. So a modification means that you do some sort of holomorphic surgery in which you replace in a compatible way the finite number of points with Finite number of points with hypersurfaces. And so then you obtain an exceptional divisor. Then, what you do is you take a holomorphic embedding of the ball in the modified ball, you take out this embedded ball, sigma of b, and then you glue neighborhoods of the two boundary components. And when you do this, And when you do this, by this gamma, which is well defined, given by the composition of the embedding and the modification, you obtain a compact complex manifold. And this is precisely a catal manifold. So the spherical shell in the manifold will exactly be given by the neighborhood of this boundary. And basically, what is drawn here is what you obtain when you cut a catalog manifold along a spherical shape. Okay, and this data, so the modification and the embedding is what is usually called a cato data for the catal manifold, and it completely determines the catal manifold. So a few remarks is that in this construction, you are, of course, allowed to not modify at all the ball, so to take for pi the identity. And then this is exactly what you obtain. When you do this, you obtain all the so-called primary Hopf manifolds. So-called primary Hopf manifolds. So all the manifolds which have universal cover Cn minus zero and fundamental group set. A bit more general is that when you do not intersect by the embedding the exceptional divisor, but in fact it is enough to ask only that the modified point by sigma don't intersect the exceptional divisor. Then the gluing map commutes with the modification. Commutes with the modification, and in fact, what you obtain at the end is a modification of Hopf manifold, so modification of the initial of the above situation. And by this reasoning, in fact, you can show that you can always move a little bit sigma off the exceptional divisor. And in this way, you are deforming your catamanifold into a modification of a Hopf manifold. So, topologically, Kata manifolds are modification. cata manifolds are modifications of hop manifolds uh can i ask a question about um i i guess the definition uh so does having a global spherical shell imply that the sphere is dual to the leaform or is that assumed in the definition oh it's not assumed but so having assumed but so having global spherical will imply that uh this will yeah i mean this is not assumed the global spherical will give zero homology okay yeah yeah that's implied by other things that's implied yes okay yeah great thank you so uh these manifolds always since we are in dimension two or bigger they always have Bigger, they always have a fundamental group Z. And in fact, the initial drawing which I had was a fundamental domain for the action of the fundamental group on the universal cover. So the universal cover really looks like you glue Z copies of this ball minus the smaller ball and you glue all of them along the boundary by this gamma that we had. And instead of it, usually if you did perform Usually, if you did perform an actual modification, then you will have compact hypersurfaces coming from the exceptional device. So, as I said, often these manifolds have LCK metrics. And this was shown by Brunella basically. He only interested himself in the case of dimension two when and that's. And that's where you've proved it, but you can directly see that this proof works in any dimension with the additional hypothesis that you start from a Keller modification. So the actual statement in general dimension is that a catal manifold is LCK if and only if the modified pole is scalar. And this happens exactly when the universal cover is scalar. So one direction is clear, the other one. Clear the other one, you have to see that it is true. So, here the first remark is that in dimension two, you don't need to ask this because any modification is a composition of blow-ups at points. So, any modification in dimension two is a ready color. So, then all cutter surfaces are LCK. However, in general, there are famous controller examples by Heronaka, where you can have modifications which are basically only local. Are basically only locally a composition of blow-ups, but globally they are not compositional blow-ups. And you can show that in these examples, the manifolds are not Kalo. So then this gives us also cato manifolds, which are not really calorie. And another remark is when the modification is the identity, then we have Hopf manifolds, and we know that those admit SKs with potential. Meet SCKs with potential. But when the modification is not identity, then we can never have an exact SCK or a Weissman LCK or LCK with potential. And this comes from the fact that when you did modification, you have created compact hypersurfaces and in the universal cover. So this means the universal cover cannot have an exact color metric, right? Or one with potential. So for this reason, So, for this reason, these are really in this sense new examples. So, you cannot use the tools from Weissman or from LCK potential. So, I will just say a very few words about the proof of this, how does the Brunella construction works. So, you start from a Keller metric on the modified ball, which you assume to exist. Then you basically perform some gluing constructions. Perform some gluing constructions. So, first of all, you try to make it flat in some neighborhood of sigma of zero. So, you know that on the ball it has a potential. Then you can interpolate between this potential and the standard z-square up to multiplying it by some constant. So, by interpolation, I mean you will take the maximum between the two and regular. Maximum between the two and regularize it, and you will obtain a new strictly plural Marmonic function. So, this means you will obtain this way a new metric which is now flat around sigma of zero, but outside you did not change it. Then you need to change the fundamental domain because you can only make it flat on some neighborhood of zero, but not on all of sigma of b. So, then the new fundamental domain you should take. New fundamental domain it should take will be the modified ball Br of radius R minus sigma of Br. Now on this new fundamental domain you work again and you look on the neighborhood on the outer neighborhood of this modified ball you see again that this metric has a potential you again can interpolate and make it flat near the boundary but with a new constant c So that in the end, what you obtain is on this fundamental domain, you have a Keller metric which is flat near both boundaries but with different constants. So this means that when you glue, the gluing will not preserve the metric, but only up to homotity. And there will be a constant which is there and we cannot make it one, of course. So since this fundamental domain is precisely fundamental domain in the universal cover for the group, this means Cover further the group, this means that you have produced an LCK metric on the Cato manifold. Okay, so this is about the construction. Now, next the goal would be to study more these catamanic holes, right? So particularly their homology and their complex geometric properties. However, the problem is somehow that what we know in this very general definition is not much. So we know the topology. Is not much, so we know the topology, but there is no clear tools what you can use to study them. So, in order to be able to say something more special, we try to impose some symmetries on our data. And so here the natural symmetries to impose would be to consider kato, kato things, kato, I'm sorry, toric things. So this means we are looking only at We are looking only at toric catadata, right? Namely, at modifications which are toric in the sense that we already know that Cn is a toric variety, and then we ask that also the modification is a toric variety, and pi is equivariant with respect to the action of the tor. So, example of this are particularly when you do blow-ups, you do a blow-up at zero, which is affixed for the toric action, and then you Fixed for the toric action, and then you keep blowing up only sub-varieties which are fixed for the torus actions. When you do this, you will still have a toric modification of Cn. And then for sigma, you also have to impose some compatibility conditions. And here, the natural condition is to ask that it is in some sense equivariant. So it cannot be strictly equivariant with respect to the torus action. But the natural condition to ask here is that there is some group automorphism. Ask here is that there is some group automorphism of the torus so that sigma behaves in this way with respect to the action of the torus. Now, whenever this makes sense, of course, the ball is not invariant to the action of the torus, but every time you can multiply with an element of the torus, then you want it to behave in this way. So, as I said, the typical example is you blow up fixed points of the action. Blow up fixed points of the action. And then you have for sigma, you take one of the toric charts. And in complex dimension two, we know exactly who these manifolds are. And in fact, these were the first introduced Kato manifolds before Kato even. They were introduced by Inue when they were not hop. And so Torik Kato surface. So toric cutoff surfaces are exactly the Inua surfaces with positive second battle number. And there are so-called Inua, parabolic Inu, and hyperbolic Inua. And there exists also another construction which belongs to Tsukihashi, and which is very similar to this. And he retrieves in some of the cases, he retrieves some Torikata. Cases he retrieves some pericatoman flow, but not all of them. And then, why do we do this? So, the point is that when we consider only this kind of data, we have a very good understanding of what we are obtaining in the sense that we know how to describe the universal cover of the Tori-Kato manifold as well as the dead group. And so, we can, in fact, say that for a Torikato. Say that for a toric atom manifold, the universal cover will always be an open subset of a toric variety, which will be of infinite type in the sense that it will be covered by infinitely many affine charts. And we can also say precisely what the degree group looks like. So, in some sense, this theorem tells us that we can use toric geometry to study authoric atom manifolds. So, I will say So I will say more precisely how this toric variety looks like, how the open subset in it looks like, and what is this cover. But this is very good because basically in SCK geometry, you very often do work, in fact, on the universal cover, even when you try to write metrics or to do anything there. So this is one of the goals to have a clear description of the universal cover. And how are these things constructed? So, when we start from a Tori Kata manifold, we have a Tori Kata data. We have the modified Cn, which since it is a Tauric variety, it can be represented by a fan. So, in Tauric algebraic geometry, Tauric varieties are always represented by a fan, which a fan is always. A fan is always a collection of rational cones inside of Rn, which is closed to intersections. So every time it intersects two cones in the fan, you obtain another cone in the fan. And these cones kind of basically tell you what are the coordinate changes from one atlas to the other, from one chart to the other. So we start with by representing our modified Cn by the fun sigma hat. Then we can show that since we have asked sigma to be compatible with the torus action, sigma cannot be anything. In fact, it has a very special form. It is always the composition of some element from the torus with a toric chart of the CN modified. Now, so this means that there is an n-dimensional Now, so this means that there is an n-dimensional cone in this fan, which is generated by n elements of Zn, so rational elements, such that when I put these elements, since they give a basis, this gives us a metric which is in GLN set. So I wrote here the formula for phi A, but this really means that VA is the authoric chart corresponding to this cone alpha. So every end of the. cone alpha. So every n-dimensional cone gives us one chart in the toric variety. And this cone is exactly giving us this phi. So this data is already given to us from the Torikato data. And next what we do is we construct a new infinite fan. From the old one we take out From the old one, we take out this cone alpha, which was given by sigma, and then we take z copies of it. We take all the copies of all the cones, remaining cones, by the powers of this matrix A. So this is a fan, again. It has all the properties of a usual fan, except it is not finite, but this is fine. You can still construct a Turk variety associated to this fan. Associated to this fan. May I ask a question? Yes. The first fan you take, is it finite? Yes, it is finite. The first one is finite, and this one will not be finite. Okay. It's not finite because it really has that copies of the first one. Yes. Okay. The first one is finite, yes. Okay. Thanks. Okay. So when we did this in particular by construction, In particular, by construction, this fan has an action of A on it. It is clear what it is, right? And every time in the description of Toric varieties, when you have something acting on the fan, this automatically induces something acting on the variety. And if what is acting on the fan is invertible, then again, what is acting on the variety is invertible. So this means that this A induces naturally an automorphism of the historic variety. Of the historical writing. And we have another data, another thing which is an automorphism, namely this lambda, the element of the torus which participated into the embedding, right? So this element being an element of the torus, it acts also on the toric variety. So then the group gamma which we want will be exactly given by the composition of this element of the torus with this automorphism defined by the matrix. Defined by the matrix. So we take this group generated by this element. This is a group which acts on the full infinite Tori variety. This action is in general not free or properly discontinuous, so you cannot just take the quotient of this. And this is why you need now to take a subset of the storage variety where the action is good. And this separate is exactly you take the Take the stable set of gamma inside of the complex torus, all the elements set so that gamma of m tends to zero. And then you take the partial complexification of this u inside your toric variety. So this will be precisely the infinite, the universal cover of the toric atomanifold and the And the quotient of this thing by gamma, where now gamma will act freely and properly discontinuously, is exactly our toric manifold. So this needs to be shown, but this is true. So sometimes it does happen that this universal cover, in fact, is the full Tauric variety, but in most cases, it is not the full Tauric variety. So I will just show. So, I will just show you one example what you do in this story. So, of course, the simplest example is: let me go back here. When you take pi to be identity, then you have only one cone in sigma hat. So alpha has to be that one cone, n-dimensional cone. And so you can see that in here, what you're doing, you're doing really nothing. You are just producing as the Tauric variety Cn minus zero. Minus zero and then you are just taking the quotient of that by some lambda of the twerps, right? If lambda well chosen, so that sigma sends the ball inside the ball, so that sigma is a contraction. So that would be the simplest example. And then the next example would be in complex dimension two, when you only do one blow-up at zero. So this is okay, this gives you another variety. C2, as I said, is represented by one two-dimensional. Represented by one two-dimensional cone generated by these two rays, and then two one-dimensional cones, and then one zero-dimensional cone. So, this is here represented the fan of C2. Then what happens when you take the blow-up of C2 at zero? You are adding a new ray given by the sum of the old rays which were in this cone. And so, if you blow up zero, you have to add all the rays of the cone representing. Of the cone representing zero in this chart. So, see to hat the fan of this will now have two-dimensional cones. I choose one of these. So, I choose the cone generated by one, zero, and one. So I have this matrix given by this choice. I also take an element of the torus of this for one and lambda with lambda smaller than one. And when you do this construction, When you do this construction, gamma will have this form, and the infinite fan will be this. So as I said, you have to remove the cone corresponding to sigma, so corresponding to A, and instead of it, now put Z copies of what remains. So basically, we are left with only one two-dimensional column here, and we just take all. Just take all of its copies by the powers of A, so we'll have many copies of this cone. A acts here by sending each of these rays to the next one in the clock direction. And then you have one special ray here, which is fixed by the action of A. So A just fixes it. And by looking at this fan, you already know two things actually about your map. About your manifold, you know that what happens here is also that the universal cover will coincide with the full toric variety. And in Tauric geometry, you often have you always have this correspondence between invariant subvarieties and different cones of your fan. In particular, in dimension two, you have a correspondence between rays and curves. Is between rays and curves, invalid curves. So, in this situation, since we have one ray, we have actually z-frays, but they are all sent to one another by A. All of these rays in the inversal cover will give us many copies of CP1, but in the compact variety will give us only one CP1, which is nodal, so it will be glued at one point, and then one special curve which in the And then one special curve, which in the infinite in the universal cover is a C star represented by this ray, but in the compact surface will in fact be an elliptic curve given precisely by C star over this lambda here, the lambda that contributed to this. And so this really helps us to see already any geometrical features of our catalytes. So, more generally, so we have something special associated to our toric tattoo manifolds, which is this matrix A, right? Which was basically representing, given, determined by our embedded sigma. And although the matrix does not at all determine the atom manifold, none of its properties. None of its properties do directly reflect on the Kathaman effort. So, one special thing which one needs to consider is on this matrix, you could easily have standard vectors as columns. So part of it could be a permutation matrix. So then you need to distinguish when this permutation matrix is very big or not so big. So basically, the important case is when the general So, the very special case is when A itself is a permutation matrix, but then this corresponds exactly to the case when you are dealing with Hopf manifolds. The next case is when A is a permutation matrix plus some column, so it's almost maximal. And this, in this case, we call the catal manifold of parabolic type. And then, the general case, when the permutation metric is not so big, we call it of hyperbolic type. And we chose this. Type. And we chose this name because this is what this corresponds to the names already existing for surfaces. So Tori Katomanifolds of parabolic type are exactly the parabolic inner surfaces, and those of hyperbolic type are exactly the hyperbolic in surfaces. And you can directly see when you look at the curves that these properties reflect. Properties reflect. So we can exactly say when Kata manifold is in one of these three types by looking at the invariant curves. When I say invariant, of course, I mean those curves was in a pre-image in the universal coverage invariant for the action of the torus. So we can only see that this story catamanifold will be hoped exactly when all of the invariant curves are lifting. It will be of hyperbolic. It will be of hyperbolic type if all of the invariant curves are rational, and then it will be of parabolic type when it contains one elliptic curve and at least one rational curve. And then all the other invariant curves will be rational. Yes, of course, you don't have only these curves. You have many more curves in this catal manifolds. But here we are only looking at invariant things in order to have some rigidity. Rigidity. So, this is a first property of the manifolds. A second property is related to the analytical invariance of the manifolds. So, first of all, we can always see that the anti-canonical bundle of the cato manifold is up to twisting with torsion two line bundle. Torsion 2 line bundle always an effective divisor. So it always has the Torikata manifolds always have negative Codera dimension, which means that it can never have sections in any of the power of the canonical bundle. The second property is that these story cata manifolds never have allomorphic forms on them. And then in general, we were not able to compute all the Hodge numbers. We were only only could only could compute huge numbers of type h 0p and h1p right and this also in the case of basically of hyperbolic type or of some parabolic but especially for hyperbolic type so for hyperbolic type we could show that uh basically up to order two so for beti one and betty two you do have this host the 1 and beta 2, you do have this Hoch decomposition, you do have the Betty 1, this H10 plus H01, and then for Betty 2, you also have what you expect. Yeah, so we couldn't go further. And these are the exact numbers that we obtain. And I will not really give the proof for this, but I will just say a few words about what kind of tools we use to compute these things. So one of the things that you can think to do is because we know That you can think to do is because we know the universal cover and that it is almost a toric variety, or at least an open subset there, you can always try to compute cohomology upstairs and then to compute cohomology downstairs as gamma equivalent homology of what you had upstairs. So, of course, the only problem is you could do this if you only were allowed to use rational or regular or algebraic things and the toric variety, which is the case on compact things. Case on compact things. But however, we are dealing with non-compact things, so we cannot really compute the homology of the universal cover. We don't know how to do this because we don't know what happens really. But this still works for some very small things. So this works, for instance, to show that you don't have holomorphic forms. It's already enough to see that you don't have holomorphic forms on the universal cover. And another tool to do this is to, because we have destroyed. So, because we have this story description, we can construct explicitly families into which let us, so flat families, which let us see that X degenerates to some singular, but in some sense, easier space, because easier because the singular space is much more algebraic than Torikato. And then you can use some semi-continuity results, and this is what we do. Continuity results, and this is what we do in order to, if you are able to compute in some way the homology of the singular space, then to deduce what happens for the catalog manifold. Sorry, you generalize the Camois construction? Yes, I mean, not exactly. So I will just say this. So we actually generize two constructions, one of Nakamura and one of Tukihaishim. Actually, we construct two different families. Actually, we construct two different families. But I will just stay here for one. So you can construct a family in which, a flat family, in which over the disk so that one of the fiber is the initial tolicator manifold. And then the central fiber, the singular fiber, is given by a tolic compact variety. Variety into which you have glued two hypersurfaces invariant to the torus action. So, in fact, there are two such families which you can construct, but not always. In the hyperbolic type, you can construct two families, and the second one is the one given by Tsukihashi. In the general case, you can always construct generalized Nakamura. Generalize the Nakamura degeneration. But in fact, the special one, the Tsukashi one, is better because in the hyperbolic type, what you can show moreover, what you can do moreover, is to make sure that all the fibers in the family, in this family, except the one at zero, are isomorphic to your catomanifold. So then you are free to use semi-continuity results because you just know that everybody else is the catomanifold and only at zero. the cato manifold and only at zero something happens in general uh if the manifold is not hyperbolic then this family we cannot construct it and then you have another family you know to which all the fibers are some catomanifolds but they are not necessarily isomorphic between each other so actually they can be non-isomorphic but they also still all the fibers are some catomanifolds one of them is the initial one and then in the middle again you have this uh Compact algebraic variety into which you have glued things. So basically, these are the two things that we use to be able to compute low-degree homology. I believe that probably you can go further and compute further. Problem is that we don't really know how to compute the homology of this thing here for Here for shifts different than the regular shift or the shift of holomorphic functions. So when you have holomorphic forms, I don't know how to compare this. Okay, and then just to end this story is so we still of course believe that probably the Hausdor composition holds in on these manifolds. And then I just show you what the betting numbers look like. What the betten numbers look like, so that you should know what to expect for the Hodge numbers, right? So, the beta numbers for this Tori-Kata manifolds, it's not extremely important what the formula are, but you can always represent them in terms of the numbers of cons of the fan of the modified Cn, so that the odd ones are always zero, except the first and the last one, and then the even ones have this special. And then the even ones have this special formula. So in particular, you can deduce what is the second betting number, what is the Euler characteristic. And most probably the Hodge numbers will always also be zero, except when they are of type P P or when P is bigger than two, but this I don't really know, I'm just guessing. Yeah, so of course, there are still open questions. So, one of them is this: you have to. This you have to be able to compute the rest of the homology. Another question which is open, or which we are still working on, is using the historic description to try to produce a new construction of LCK matrix different from Brunellas, which would tell you more about what kind of leaf forms you can have. Because the Brunella construction is, since it's given by the deformation, it doesn't tell you. By the deformation, it doesn't tell you how far you can go, actually, it doesn't give you all the possible leak classes that you can have, and I will stop here.
