Start by introducing Erdős Korea theorem, which I'm sure everyone knows because they know Karen. So what we consider is we consider k subsets of a given n set and we call them intersecting if two members intersect non-trivially and as the classical problem has find the largest family of pairwise intersecting sets which is called an intersecting family. Which is called an intersecting family. One such family is this: the first family one could think of: you know, you take your favorite element and take all the k sets that contain your favorite element. That's an intersecting family of size n minus 1, 2, 3 minus 1. And these families are called stars or canonical sets and they cover many different names. So the theorem of Erdős Corado says that when n is bigger than 2k, the size of an intersecting family is bounded above by the size n minus 1, choose k minus 1. size n minus 1 choose k minus 1 which is size of a star and that any intersecting family of size n minus 1 choose k minus 1 is necessarily a star. So that's the classical Durdish Korrada theorem. And it has been generalized to many objects. You can take any class of objects with you know some notion of intersection and try to see if a similar an analogous result holds or if you know something else happens. Or, if you know, if something else happens. So, one such example is: we can consider k subspaces of a finite n-dimensional vector space. And we can ask, well, what is the largest family of pairwise non-trivially intersecting K-sub spaces? And an exact Q-analog of the classical Erdős-Porrado theorem holds. That is, the size of an intersecting function. Of an intersecting family of k subspaces is bounded above by this q binomial coefficient n minus 1 choose k minus 1 and this is the number of subspaces that contain your favorite non-zero vector and this equality holds if and only if you get a star that is you know the set of all subspaces that contain your favorite vector. And there's this other And there's this other generalization where you know you can, instead of taking sites, you can just take sequences where you can repeat entries and say two of them intersect if both of them agree at a coordinate. And one can ask, well, what is the largest family of intersecting sequences of n letters? And a similar result holds. And there are many other domains for which There are many other domains for which analogous results have been proved, including permutations, set partitions, lines, and partial geometry, and many others. So I will start with this general framework. So in a general framework, so all these objects are described, they can be described as a subset of some set. Like, you know, if you want to take k spaces, you can just take the set of our non-zero vectors. You can just take the set of our non-zero vectors in it, and that's the same as that's considered in the case space. So we can consider any family we took, like sets or permutations or k subspaces to be a family of a subset of a power set of some set. And in all these cases, the intersection that happens in the there translates to intersection of sets. So we want to ask, okay, going ahead of myself. So in this as well, we have this. So in this as well we have this canonically occurring intersecting sets. You take your favorite element in X and take all your objects that contain your favorite element in X. So in the sets case, we have seen that in the case of vector spaces, we take our favorite non-zero vector. In the case of sequences, you know, you pick your favorite coordinate and take all the sequences that attain a certain value of that coordinate. And this is called a star. And if the size of any intersecting family in Intersecting family in this G is bounded above by the size of a star, then we say it satisfies the EKR property. EKR comes from the classical Radish-Koradi theorem. And then we have another stronger condition in which, you know, if stars are the only things of the largest possible size, then we say it satisfies strictly care. I mean, this terminology was initially introduced for permutation groups, but I think we can generalize it to all other rules. To all other rulemates. Now, the classical EKR theorem says that if you take this family of k subsets in an n-set, that satisfies EKR property and it satisfies strict EKR property provided n is bigger than 2K. And the Q analog of EKR is basically you take K subspaces of an N space, and a similar thing happens here when you take the family of K subspaces in an N-dimensional vector space and ask for. Dimensional vector space and ask for the size and structure of the largest intersecting family of subspaces. And there's this analog of permutation groups. So, permutations, instead of looking at them as permutations, we can look at them as n sets of tuples, i, f of i. So, that's the way I embed it into power set. And two of them intersect if they agree at a point. And for the symmetric group, Desa and Franklin. Desa and Frank then showed that this satisfy the strict EKA property. Any questions so far? Is it okay? So this is one question I think Karen asked me, or at least I believe she did, that can we find a sufficient condition, very generic condition to say, well, you know, if you are given a family of sets, when will it satisfy one of the CKR? When will it satisfy one of the CAR properties? Of course, you know, this is a way too ambitious problem, but let's see where it takes us. So, I'll just present some general results, and most of these are in the case of groups because groups are so varied, we can take classes of groups. So, one easy result is if you take a permutation group, which is a regular subgroup. So, a regular subgroup is a subgroup of a permutation group with no derangements. That is, you know, nothing but the identity. You know, nothing but the identity element fixes any point. So, in this case, all these groups satisfy the EKF property. And another general result is if you take the family of two transitive groups. So, a permutation group is two transitive if it acts transitively on distinct Q Q, two tuples with distinct coordinates. So, this very general class of groups also satisfies the E-CAR property. Well, the next example I'm going to give, it's not very general, but since I General, but since I was one of the person that helped prove it, I would advertise my result, which is, you know, all three transitive groups satisfy the strictly care property. The reason it's not so general is because, you know, there are like about five or six class of three transitive groups. So, but nevertheless, we can take a group and you know give some properties and we get some nice general results. Now, we can ask, you know, what about other domains? So, now. So now I will briefly go over the algebraic techniques one could use to prove this EKR or strict EKR properties. And before going on, I'll put your attention to this title of this frame. And this is a very obscure book that details, and I believe both the authors are here as well. So, the way the general one method of attack is: you know, you take your family of sets and then you transfer the problem of finding intersecting sets to a problem in graph theory. That's done by constructing something called a derangement graph. So, derangement graph, the vertices will be your sets in your family G, and we will put an edge between two of them if they are disjoint. So, it is easy to see that if you have an intersecting family in G, then it has to induce an independent set in the graph. Now, this is where we can use one of the spectral graph theoretic results to find more information about independent sets. So, one such result is this clique-co-click bound, which states that if you have a vertex-pranitive graph, the alpha of x is the independent. Alpha of x is the independence number of the graph, omega of x is the clique number. The size of independent sets times the size of clique is bounded above by the number of vertices. And of course, I mean, I think we can weaken this assumption of vertex transitivity to something else, but I think this is one of the neater sort of statements. So, of course, you know, one could just make this statement saying that you. Just make this statement saying that you know, if you have a family and if the family the derangement graph is what expansitive, and if I have a big enough clique and I just need a clique of size, the number of sets divided by the size of a so this G subscript X is a set of all sets that contain your favorite element X. It's also an intersected set called star. Now, if we have such a clique of this size, this one tells us that the independence number is bonded up. Tells us that the independence number is bonded up over the size of a spare, so we have the ECA property. Of course, you know, you could ask, well, you know, how do I know which word is transcribed at all by now? That's for you. So this is one such very weak answer to the question that can we give a general condition in order to get ECR. So another result that has been useful is this ratio bound. It's also called the Delta Half Man. It's also called the Delsard-Hoffmann ratio mode, which tells us if you have a regular graph on n vertices with degree k and if lambda is the smallest eigenvalue, then the size of an independent set in this is bounded by this ratio, n by 1 minus k by lambda, where k is the largest and lambda is the smallest. And this one we can generalize it to instead of taking just the adjacency matrix, we could also take weighted adjacency matrices. And this And this result also gives us tells us about the characterization of maximum independent sets. Tells us if you have an independent set which satisfies this equality, then the characteristic vector of that independent set will sit inside the direct sum of these eigenspaces. So, this is the eigen space corresponding to the smallest eigenstalue, and this is the one corresponding to k provided. One corresponding to k provided it's connected, but if it's not connected, just consider this polynomial vector. So, this is a nice result because you know, if we can get this equality, we also know something about the structure of the independent, maximum independent sets in the graph. So, the classical E-KR theorem can be proved using this. You know, the classical E-Ker theorem, the derangement graph is the Knesset graph. We can find the IA values of the Knesset graph and use this result. Use this result to show that the bound is n minus 1, 2 sk minus 1, and then from there, and then using this sort of characterization, one could do a bit more work to show that the stars are the only maximum intersecting sets. And this ratio bond was also used to show that all two transitive groups satisfies the EKR property. And using the second part, these authors showed that we can say more about the maximum intersecting. We can say more about the maximum intersecting sets in two transitor groups, which is called the EKR module property, which is which we don't need for this talk. So, is everything okay so far? So, now I will describe a very abstract setup which I think has potential to, just like two transitive groups in the case of groups, have this potential to satisfy this large class of groups which satisfy ECR and try to construct. I will try to construct another family. So I will describe it first and then I will do some computation and then come back to it to show why I think this setup has potential. So this might seem a bit abstract. So I will consider a transitive permutation group and consider the subgroup which is multiplicity free. That is the induced character from K to G of the trivial character. Is multiplicity here. That is all the irreducible cements have either multiplicity 0 or 1. Now, this will prove useful later on. So, and further assume that the action of K on this LZ has exactly two orbits. One of them will be small, one of them will be big. Consider the smaller orbit. Now, in the case of the classical EKR theorem, we can consider the group to be sim n. H will be this young subgroup. H will be this Young subgroup. Now, this fixes one of the K sets, and the orbit will be a K set. So, this will have two orbits, a K set and its complement. So, I want to consider this orbit and consider all its G translates. Now, that is a family of sets inside this power set of this n set. Now, does Now, does this satisfy the EKI property? Now, in the case of this when G is simn, H is this Young subgroup, we will have this family F is exactly the family of K sense. And now, if we consider the derangement graph of this family, there's something we can say. I'll define what these are later. But basically, if you take the derangement graph of this family and take its lexicographic product with a sufficiently With an sufficiently small or large empty graph. This will be this graph. This graph is called the double posted graph, which is in some way a generalization of the K D graph. And these graphs, when K is a multiplicity-free subgroup, we have a formula to find the eigenvalues. Now, I'll take you back to the group case. The reason why two transitive groups are more. The reason why two transitive groups are more amenable to this algebraic approach of using ratio bound is because we can find its eigenvalues. And because we can find the eigenvalues in this setup, since we can find the eigenvalues of this graph, there is some potential to at least try to see if an algebraic approach works. So, I will briefly go over what this graph is. So, again, we'll have the same setup. So again we'll have the same setup. So we have a transitive promotion group G, a subgroup which is multiplicity free and we have a set S, just any set now. Now the vertices of this graph are just the either left or I guess in this case the left cosets of K and this is a directed graph. I mean if it is bidirected we can make it a simple graph. So the arcs of this graph will be of the form GK arcs of this graph will be of form GK and GSK where S belongs to the set S. So this is similar to KD graph. Now the Eigen values of the graph, I have written a formula but all I want you guys to take from this slide is the Eigen values of this graph are indexed by the irreducible characters of G which appear in this permutation character where you take the trivial character and induce it to G. Induce it to G. So we have a formula and we know what are all the eigenvalues and we also know about the eigen spaces as well. But this is the information that I want you guys to remember for the next slide. So let's go back to my setup. So I have a transitive computation group, a multiplicity free group that has exactly That has exactly two orbits on n, and this O being the smaller orbit. I consider the G translates of O that is another way of looking at this: I just conjugate K and look at its orbits. And I want to see if this family satisfies the E care property. Now, we know that the derangement of this is exactly I mean there could be potentially some lexiographic product with an empty graph, but that doesn't change much. So, let's consider Doesn't change much, so let's consider this. Now, the eigenvalues of this are indexed by irreducible summits of this character, this induced character, and let E chi be the eigenvalue corresponding to this character time. Now, why I considered this is, I will explain in a second. So, since the action of k on n has only two orbits, using Burnside's orbit quantity theorem, we can show that. Orbit quantity theorem, we can show that there is exactly one non-trivial character which is common to the permutation character of G and this induced character. So let that character be sine. Now this is where this very surprising result happens that if we consider this ratio, so this is the eigenvalue corresponding to the trivial character and this is the eigenvalue corresponding to the special character sine. Now if I just use it, so if you remember, this is the ratio in the ratio bound. In the ratio bound. But of course, you know, we don't know if this e psi is the smallest eigenvalue. We definitely know that the e1 is the largest. But let's just assume that this is the smallest eigenvalue just to keep on. Now in this case, what we'll get is, just irrespective of you know which groups we are taking, we'll get the size exactly the size of a star. So if this was the smallest eigenvalue, then we readily get E k. So that's why So, that's why I consider this abstract setup to see if we can find more families where we have EKR instead of usually you take a family and try to either test if it has EKR or strict EKR property, but this is kind of the other way where we use the machinery to concoct more things that are EKR. How much time were I left? Yeah, you can have power. Yeah, you can have five minutes for sure. So, again, you might again say, well, you know, this is too abstract and this is too many things. But in most of the classical results, this setup we can observe. I'll just go through some examples now. Now, consider the first Burdish-Porrado theorem. We consider the group is sim n and k is the young subgroup and the neser graph will be the The Kneser graph will be the derangement graph. And there is exactly one non-trivial character common to the permutation character of G. I mean this is a two transitor, so there is only two and this one. And that is the character corresponding to this partition n minus 1, 1. And that will exactly use the least eigenvalue. And we get E care from this. Now, another result that also satisfies this is this Burdish Porado. This Purdish Korado perfect matrix. So, the way I consider perfect matrix is you take a set of size 2n and consider a partition into sets of size 2, disjoint partition of sets of size 2. So, if you consider sim2n acting on sets of size 2 in a set of size 2n, and if you consider the subgroup sim2 read simn, now this will have exactly two orbits. One of the orbits will be a perfect matching, and one of the orbits. Will be a perfect matching, and all of the other orbit will be things outside the perfect matching. So, if you consider this G translates of these perfect matchings, we get all perfect matchings. And this is just the, we come to the Erdős-Pohrado problem for finding the largest intersecting family of perfect matchings. And even in this case, we have exactly one non-trivial character which is common to the permutation character of G, and then this induced character, and that will Induced character and that will give us the smallest eigenvalue, and that's that readily gives us Eka. Okay, so these are you know well-known results. Now I will try to now I will go and tell you what results I got. So before that, I would like to mention that all multiplicity-free subgroups of SN are classified, and one could technically go through all multiplicity-free ones. Go through all multiplicity-free ones, which have exactly two orbits, and see if we get any new ECAT type results. But unfortunately, if we are just sticking to SN, we don't get any new ECAT, we just get either perfect matchings or that measure graph. But the next best group is, if it's not a symmetric group, the next best is linear groups. The multiplicity-free characters of the gender linear group are also characterized. So, I went and Characterize. So I went and looked at multiplicity-free characters of multiplicity-free subgroups of the gender-linear group and tried to see if I can find any different kinds of Erdesperado type results. So the first one I took is Erdesporado on bare supplies. I hope I got the definition right. I mean, this is, if there's any finite geometer that finds a mistake, please let me know. So, what we consider is we consider this projective generation. is we consider this projective general leading group a dimension n on the field of order q squared. Now this acts on the points of this projective plane. Now this has a subgroup PGLNQ on the smaller field. Now this is a multiplicity free subgroup. Now this acts on the projective plane with exactly two orbits. The first the smaller orbit will be a copy of the projective space on the smaller plane and as And as was the case, we considered all the G-translates of this, and I think these are called bare subspaces. And we can consider the problem of finding the largest intersecting family of bare subspaces. Now, in the case n equal to 2, this person in Belgium showed that this F satisfies a strict TKA property. They used different results. And I considered the case n equal to 3 and 4, and I was able to show that they satisfy the EKR property. But you know, there are maximum intersecting sets that are not necessarily stars, so the strict EKR is not true in higher dimensions. Of course, my next project is to try to do it for all n, but the characters of PGN and the contiguous clients are something that I've still tried to understand. So that's why I stopped at n equals 3 and 4. And 4. So I'll give another example which I think is a Q analog of the perfect matching case. And for that, what we'll consider is we'll consider generally in a group of dimension 2n over a finite field Q acting on sets of two subspaces. Now this has the symplectic group inside it, and the symplectic group is multiplicity field, it acts with just two orbits. With just two orbits. I still haven't found a nice geometric description of these two orbits, but I can just take the smaller of the two orbits and try to find E care on this not so nicely defined family. And I was able to do this for n equal to 4 and say that this family of G translates of this orbit satisfies the EKR. Now there is another candidate which can also be the key. Candidate, which can also be the Q analog of the perfect mathes Q. So instead of taking this symplectic group, we could take a copy of G Ln Q squared inside G Ln 2 and Q and the same result follows even in this case, where n equal to 4. Now the reason I say it's the Q analog of perfect matchings is you know if you consider the irreducible summants of this, there are exactly q analogs of irreducible sumants appearing here. So some of the characters of Some of the characters of PGL are also indexed by partitions. That's one reason why I believe this is like this could be, these two could be potentially a Q and a log of the perfect matching case. As I said, it's not a complete work, so this was joint work with Karen. And if you are interested, it could be potentially you. Okay, let's bend reviews. Yeah, we can take a few questions from what it is. Do you have examples where you have the setup and you don't have the character? Yeah, I mean there's multiple software. Very few of them are not right. That's all right. Any other questions? Well, if you're shy, we have the topic right in an hour. In an hour. We just want to lunch, everyone. In an hour, of course. So yeah, that's the breakthrough. I know what it is. Yes or no. Not going to say it. I got quite tried. We're perfectly normal. We're perfectly normal. Absolutely. I want to know the rumor. We don't even know what it's like. I know exactly what's happening. Oh, I don't know. I was going to ask you. Okay, we're now moving on to our next talk for this absenteeism.
