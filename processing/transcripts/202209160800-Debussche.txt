Okay, and I apologize for the speakers of yesterday because I couldn't attend the talks. I was busy in Ren. Okay, San, and second apologies for those people who already heard that talk. Well, anyway, so it's a joint work with Umberto Paparitera, who is a PhD student of Franco Flondoli in Pisa. Okay, so first I want to Okay, so first I want to, for those who don't know this, to recall how we classically derive the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation very fast. And it's not the best derivation, but just to understand why we consider stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with the noise I will show. So the starting point is what is called the Lagrangian formulation of flows. So you take a fluid with velocity u in some With velocity u in some domain O. And so you take a particle X and it will move in this fluid. And since the U is the velocity, it has to satisfy the position at time t of this particle will be capital X of T, which has to satisfy this differential equation. Okay, and so, but U and X are linked, of course, since U is the velocity of X. So what is important? What is important is to examine what's happening in volumes. So you take an initial volume V0 inside O and you transport it with the flow. Okay, so this is then Vt. And you look, you take a function G, which will be, it depends on the particle, and you have G evolving according to the flow. Okay, so and if you assume that G is as compactible. Assume that G is compact support in the initial domain V0, then of course capital V will have compact support in the transported domain Vt. And it's easy to see that phi has to satisfy this transport equation, okay, because it's transported by the flow. Then you take any quantity depending on the characteristic of the fluid, depending on the particle. So it can be typically it will be density, velocity, and if you look at the energy, it will can be temperature also. Temperature, or so, and you so you take the average of this quantity in the volume Vt, and for those, for the derivation, this way to do the derivation, I take the test function phi, which is transported by the flow. So, and you look at the evolution of this quantity. Okay, so what you do, so you remember that capital Phi has compact support in GT, so you don't need to, in fact, to integrate inside on GT, you integrate on O. You integrate on O, so you don't have to worry about the derivative of the domain. This is why I use this function phi T, which is not so classical. And then you just use standard calculus to compute this product of derivative. And then you remember that d phi is minus u grad phi, and you get this identity. Okay. And then you do integration by part here, and you get this what is called transport theorem, but the derivative. theorem that the derivative of the what is the the integral of the sorry the average of q inside vt is the integral of dt of dtq plus divergence of q u okay this is very very standard so next for instance if you take the density you expect that the density the total density of inside of uh this volume vt doesn't change because the particles are are they are stuck Particles are stuck in the volume. So the derivative of this should be zero. Okay, so you take the, and you remember the identity I just wrote. So you get this. Phi is arbitrary test function and you derive the well-known conservation of mass. Okay. So this is, and then if the fluid is incompressible, rho doesn't change, it's a constant. So you get the incompressibility condition divergence of u equals zero. Okay. Okay, so I sorry for those who know this by heart because this is really classical. Then the next thing to do is to look at the at rho u, the moment quantity. And so what you say is that the fundamental law of dynamics is that the derivative of this is equal to the sum of the forces on the fluid. Okay? And for incompressible fluids, what kind of force do you have? You have external force. You have you have external forces, F, okay, it can be many things, it can be gravitation, anything. You have the pressure of the fluid, and you have something which is quite complicated to derive, which is called from the strain tensor of the fluid. But finally, you find a solution. This is the force that the particle exerts on themselves, one particle exert on another one, and you get this Laplace operator. And again, find. And again, phi is arbitrary, so you get this well-known Lavistos equation. Okay? This is very classical again. So, what I want to do now, I want to take a fluid which is turbulent. So, I want that the particles, the velocity has two components, a smooth part u, not so smooth, but smooth part u, and a very oscillating one, which will be a noise. Okay, and so and the And so, and so you can see it as the turbulent part of the velocity, or if you think about numerics, you can think of it as the scales you won't compute. So, you don't compute the small scales, but you want to see what effect they have on the fluid, so to compute the effect they have. Okay, so you do everything as before, but you see now, if you go back, the function phi will be stochastic, okay, because capital X will have a stochastic part. Capital X will have a stochastic part. So capital Pi will be stochastic. So you have to differentiate this to get this transport equation. And so you have the composition of function. And since phi is stochastic, you have eto and z formula. Okay, so the computation is much more complicated. But you have many, many terms coming out, but you can work. And finally, what you got is this kind of system. So this is one way to derive it. And this is so you have the velocity U satisfies this equation. So you have the transport noise, which is very classical now and it has been popularized in particular by Franco Flandoli. You have a part of the force in the noise, okay? And you have this U-bar, which is quite complicated to get, in fact, because it has, but it is very classical in fluid mechanics. It is called the Uh, fluid mechanics. It is called the Stokes drift, and since it's we have uh noise here, we call it Ito-Stokes drift. Okay, and the noise is Stratonovich, of course. It has to be Stratonovich. So you can transfer from Stratonovich to Ito, and so you get the Ito noise, and here K phi will be a second order differential operator. Okay, and so this can be an equation for turbulent flows, okay. Flues okay, but sorry, sorry for the interruption. Yeah, I'd like to just know, yeah, all right, yeah, great. I just want to know more about the U-bar. Is your bar also unknown or your bar? U-bar is explicit in terms of the correlation of the noise. Oh, okay, I see. In fact, it's one half of the divergence of the variance. All right, okay, thank you. Okay, so uh Okay, so in fact, this kind of derivation has quite a long history now. I think there is a very quite old world by Bresnik, Kapaski and Flondoly. They started to do this, but they didn't go that far. Then in, I think it was beginning of 2000s, Boris Rozovsky and Michele Visius, they did this kind of derivation, but it was less clear and they didn't get the U-bar, which is very important in. UR, which is very important in physics, and more importantly, I think it's Etienne Mema, who is a colleague in Ren here, who did exactly the derivation that I explained. And he obtained this. And also just to mention, because there is another way to derive turbulent equation, but quite different by a group in London around Darryl Hall, but I won't talk about it. It's quite different. Okay, so the problem with this. The problem with this derivation is that it's not rigorous at all. Because at some point in this computation that Edmema has done, you have to differentiate the white noise, you neglect some quantities, it's kind of really not rigorous. But the good point is that this is a very, very robust way to derive equations, and you can take any fluid equation and get a stochastic equivalent by this scheme of By this scheme of by this methodology. So just one. Yes. I cannot think of Mema being non-rigorous. Is that really possible? It's the son of Jean. All right. And he's not really a mathematician. But I didn't say that he's not rigorous. I said that the derivation is not rigorous. Okay. All right. all right when you know when you when you do modalization you have to be non-rigorous at some point okay and then you try to be as rigorous as you can and that's why that's what we will try to do now no i was not thinking about the same limits okay yes okay but it's this sound actually all right okay so so arnaud uh yes can i ask another question yes please so when when you say uh like uh the the non-rigorous step the the non-rigorous step is it in the application of the ito formula no at a certain point no non-rigorous step is precise one of them is precisely here you see for instance when you disequality yes when you when you try to have a turbulence you so when you have a turbulent u inside of you you'll have a a a noisy part yeah so it's not uh regular so the regular and you have to differentiate the noise okay which is quite bad Okay. Which is quite bad. This is one point where you have to neglect something. Okay. And there are other things you neglect. Etienne has a way to explain it. He says this is small scales, blah, blah, blah, but still it's not rigorous. Even though I think we are close to understand how to do it more properly. Okay, so. So, this equation is you can study it very classically. It's very, very similar to the standard stochastic Navy-Stokes equation with transport noise that Franco studied, but there are many people working on it now. I think also the group, Dan, has done a lot of work with transport noise now, many people. So, it's the standard framework for Navy Stokes. So, you introduce the space of divergence-free vector fields because. Vector fields because you want. Sorry, yes, this shouldn't be u here because u is not divergence-free here in this new model. So you take the Lorentz projector onto divergence-free field, and you take the Stokes operator, which is the projection of the Laplace operator. You introduce the nonlinear term, which is here. And since you, in this model, is not divergence-free, you have to translate it so that you have an unknown with divergence. It so that you have an unknown with divergence free. So it's much easier to work. And you get this equation, which is really, really close to the form which is standard, and you can study by quite classical methods. So in 2D, 3D, any setting. Arnaud, I have another question. Yes. About boundary conditions, because here, so you take your favorite boundary conditions. Ah, okay. You can use Dirichlet or. You can use Dirichlet or Dirichlet periodic, blah blah blah. Of course, if you take 2D, 3D, of course, if you are 2D periodic, as you explained in your talk, you have much better properties. No, I mean, of course, it's not realistic. Periodic is just. No, no, it's realistic, especially if you study turbulence. Turbulence is usually with periodic boundary conditions, so no problem. Okay. What about I've lost the phi? I've lost the phi. What is the meaning of phi there? Sorry, maybe I changed my. Yes, sorry. There should be a phi here. It's the correlation of the noise. Sorry. A correlation of the noise. It's phi dw. If dw is a space-time white noise, you have the phi which is in front of it. Okay. Okay, sorry about that. Okay, so now. Okay, so now totally different approach. So, starting from Franco's work, Franco tried to derive a turbulence model also for a totally different perspective. And he started from work by Maida and introduced this kind of way to study turbulent flows. So, the perspective is quite different here. So, he thinks of the fluid with two components, U, which will be the small scales. U, which will be the small scales, and V, which will be the high scales. And this is reflected in the fact that there is one over epsilon here. So if you take C equals identity, you see that all the frequencies in V will start at one over epsilon. So this is why you can think as V as the small scales, because they have a very, very long, very high eigenvalues, so very small scales. And so the idea is to take the And so the idea is to take the limit epsilon go to zero here and to derive an equation for you. Okay, so this is this is the spirit is the same, but the starting point is completely different. But in terms of your previous and models, what would be the epsilon in the physics? Does it represent like a Radel's number or what's the physical meaning of this epsilon? So here the meaning is the smallest eigenvalue corresponding to small scales. To small scales. Okay, in this setting. But if you start from my previous setting, it would be quite different. I cannot, well, I didn't want to talk about that, but maybe I can. Roughly, yes, an analogy, you should, and this is something we are doing with the students. So you don't take a white noise here, but you take a process which has a scale one over epsilon. One over epsilon, okay, and you take the limit epsilon go to zero, which it will go to white noise. This would be the analogy, okay. Here, when you start from white noise, you epsilon is already zero, okay. All right, so you want to introduce this as epsilon, huh? This parameter, excuse me, so you would like to introduce this parameter. So, you would like to introduce this parameter epsilon, but you will study the behavior, right? The limited behavior as epsilon goes to zero. Yes, that's exactly my aim. I want to take epsilon goes to zero in this. All right, yes, okay. Thank you. Okay, so yes, so formally, if you try, if you work formally, when you take epsilon go to zero, okay, you neglect them all this term, which is on the one, this is on the one, this is on the one. So, okay, at the limit, you. Other one, so it okay. At the limit, you should have cv equals phi dw. Okay, and so here you would have phi dw here, and so you expect this equation, okay. And the circle here means that it's stratonovich when you multiply. This is what you expect formally, okay, but we'll see that this is wrong, and in particular, you don't see the etal stocks drifting this, okay? So, and we'll see how to do it later. So, and we'll see how to do it less formally. Okay, so what Franco did in the series of work in particular with Papaletera, so what he does, he sees here, so he worked in many different cases, he started to work with Euler, so A equals zero, and then he did more recent work with A not zero. But anyway, so so you see you expect that uh C goes that V goes to white noise, okay? To white noise, okay. So you can see V as a regularization of white noise here. Okay, you regularize white noise by the Snavi-Stokes equation. And so you can see what he sees this equation as a Wong Zakai thing. You have U perturbed by V and V will go to whiteness. So in this series of work, he did it he mimicked the proof of Wong Zakai and proof of convergence to this equation. Of convergence to this equation. Okay. And again, he has this equation, so which is close to Mema's model, but you miss the heterostog's drift. And also what this, if you get rid of this term, the non-linear term Bu plus V V, get the same result. So you miss something here. So just a remark. So, just a remark before I go on. Why V scaling? V-scaling is interesting because you expect to have a white noise here and transport noise. There is another scaling which would be very interesting, is this one. Okay, this one means that the noise is much less strong. In fact, if you look at Franco's paper, he tries a lot to explain the regime. And in fact, he said, okay, this regime should be also considered. But this regime here is much less interesting. regime here is much less interesting because here you see that you have you are in the averaging regime okay because you have one of epsilon one over square root epsilon and so v is like a fast equation in averaging uh regime and the this will be neglected because you don't see it and the so the the limit equation you will average v with respect to the invariant measure of the dominant term here Dominant term here. And the invariant measure is just zero as average. Okay, because when you average V with respect to the invariant measure of the leading term, this is a centered process because it's all steigland back, so you get zero. So you just get the Navier-Stokes equation, you lose all the nonlinear effects. What would be more interesting is to study this problem, okay, when you keep the nonlinear terms with the fast thing. With the fast thing. And then you would obtain this average equation, which I know probably is a good model. And this is something I want to check more, but I'm sure it's close to what you find also in some of Maida's paper. Well, anyway, just to this remark is just to explain you what you have several regimes, and each of them has his own interest, I think. Okay, let's go back to the previous scaling. So at first, I consider the So, at first, I consider the very simple case you see in my equation. I know, can I ask you another question? Sorry. So, what is the dimension of you here? It's like are you in 2D or 3D? It will be both. 2D, 3D. Both. Yes. Okay. It will be both. You can think 3D if you want. Okay, so first I start with the simple case where I neglect the non-linear term. The non-inner term. So in this case, V is very simple because it's an Ernst Lein-Lunebeck process. So you can compute V explicitly and you see that V has order epsilon minus one half. This is just a very easy computation. You write V as an Ito integral and you compute the average and you find that it's one over the square root of epsilon. So it's very natural to rescale V to see that it has this size. But it has this size. So w will be over the one, and you have this equation. And here, what well, this is my approach. This is like, you can see, it's a W is like it evolves, you can see that it evolves like, but its time scale is T over epsilon. So it's really close to what is called dissipation. Sorry. Sorry, diffusion approximation. Okay, so it's very natural to go to the very standard and classical approach of diffusion approximation based on generators from work very old by Papa Nicolau Struk and Badan. So it's very natural to look at the generator of the process. Okay, so this is the generator of the process UW. Okay, so since you have singular power of epsilon of the. Have singular power of epsilon, of course, the generator will be singular. Okay, and so the game of this method is to find how this generator, what this generator becomes when epsilon goes to zero. And since you ex and you want to see the generator only on the on the U equation, because you don't want to see W at the limit. You just want to see the noise. Okay, so this is called the perturbed test function method. Uh, perturbed test function method. So, what is the perturbed test function method? So, you take a function which depends only on u, this phi of u here, and you want to see the limit of a generator acting on this phi of u. And see if you understand the generator on u, you will understand the limit equation because you can read the equation on the generator. So, what you see what you do is so you take this function from your view, this test function, and you perturb it, and you hope that this perturbation is functional. Hope that this perturbed test function will have will kill the negative power of epsilon. Okay, this is the game. So you look first at the first bad term, which is one over epsilon one half. So you have B W U D U phi, this term. And you'll have another term, which will come when you take this epsilon one half phi one time one over epsilon. Okay, this will be this will. Okay, this will be this will give you one of epsilon one half Lw phi one. So Lw, sorry, this is the generator of the Anshai Lunebeck process here. Okay, is it clear? So you want to find that phi one so that you can solve this path term. Okay, and this can be done because this is a Poisson equation, and you all know that the Poisson equation can be solved when this Then this has zero average with respect to the invariant measure of the process behind Lw. Okay, but here we have an Ernst Time process. It has zero average, W has zero average, and U is a constant with respect to this generator. So this you can solve it. And in fact, since we have a very easy generator here, this is Ernst Steinmanbeck. It's very generate, easy generator. You have an explicit solution, in fact. Solution, in fact, there you have you can compute precisely the first character, which is this one. Okay, is it clear? No question? Yes, what you're saying is that Flanderi was using a different method to get the same type of limits? Yes, yes. Flanderly has done exactly this in this first work. In this first work, doing this Wong Zakai theorem. All right, so you okay. But I think that this is much simpler, but once you agree to use generator, this is much simpler. But this may be a matter of taste. And we will do things that are not possible to do with Flandovi's method afterwards. Okay, so once you have phi one, you put phi one into this, and you get this. And you get this, uh, you get this expression here. So, you where you have killed this bad term. Uh, sorry, and so when you, yes, so you neglect all the terms which will have epsilon one half or epsilon because formally they go to zero, and you get this thing, which does not depend on epsilon anymore. Okay, so you have to trust me, but it's very easy computation, okay? Once you have two. Okay, once you have killed this bust term, the whole thing simplifies to this plus epsilon one-half times something. Okay, and then what you want, you remember what you want is the limit behavior of u. So you will like something which does not depend on w here inside the generator. And this is precisely what the phi2 will do. Okay, so I have a question. So, I have a question, Arnaud. Yeah. The stupid question. So, when you take this phi epsilon of uw, because it's your expansion, yeah, this is your choice. The choice of this expansion, the way that you choose that it's phi u plus the correct the phi one and phi two, it's based on so what's the basis of this test function? What's your Function, what's your basis of this choice? Well, this is the classical method. It's you try to find characters to kill the bad terms. This is something very natural. So you don't expect the solution of something, but you don't expand the solution, but expand the test function. Yeah, this I know, but what I'm saying is that you know that the bad actor is W, so you want to keep it in the average. You are averaging with respect to W. We are averaging with respect to W somehow in a certain sense. Yes, exactly. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good. Thank you. So, exactly. This is what I was about to say. So, this depends on W and this LW will exactly do this. So, you want to kill this term, but as I said before, you cannot solve LW equals something unless the something has zero average. Yeah. Yeah, like you are doing homogenization, like you're homogenizing. Like you're homogenizing the round W. When you do homogenization, you need one character. Yeah. When you do diffusion approximation, you need two correctors. It's exactly the same. Okay, so now you want to solve this equation, but here, this is not zero average, so you have to subtract the average to be able to find the phi2. Okay, and this will have the effect to replace this term by the average. Okay, so this is formal up to now, it's very formal. And at the end, what you get, since the phi one is explicit, you can compute explicitly the average, and you get this apparently complicated equation. Now, this should be a du phi, sorry, there's no phi epsilon here. But when you're used to it, you can see exactly what this generator is, and this is the generator of the limit equation that you expect. That you expect. Okay, and you can read here: you have the second, you have the second-order term, which precisely the Ito term, and this is the Ito-Stratonovich character. Okay. And so then you have to do the rigorous proof. So the rigorous proof, what you do, this is here, it's a little more simpler than usual because the Martin Miller term is explicit. So what you do, you apply Ito formula. So, what you do, you apply Ito formula to phi of u. You take phi of u, you correct it, you get phi epsilon, and you take you apply ito formula to phi epsilon, so that you'll get the generator plus all the batters, no, not the batter, the terms which are supposed to go to zero, and you have the multimedia term, okay. And if you're able to take epsilon to zero here, you read the equation on this, okay. Okay, so here is the place where it begins to be quite bad because when you look at the remaining terms, they are here, you see that they are quite bad. Because you see you have A applied to U plus B U U. So you use a lot of derivatives now. So this uses a lot of smoothness on the solution U. Okay, but you can do it and Can do it, and uh, but uh, you can do it, but sometimes we need to use the regularization of this C, so that's why we cannot see it cause identity. Okay, so you have to trust me because I don't want to go too much in detail. So, what you do now is so once you have this, you can do everything you oh, sorry, something I forgot to say is that tightness of your websign is very easy to get. U epsilon is very easy to get because if you start from the equation, it's from here. You see, from the equation on u here, but when you multiply by u, you have v u plus v u times u is zero. This is very standard for Navy Stokes. So it means that you have the energy inequality for u, no, no, no, it's nothing. So u is very easy to get tightness of u in this case. Okay. Yeah, so tightness is not a big deal. Well, tightness time is a little more complicated, but it's okay. And you take the limit here and you prove that any limit point is a weak solution of the Stokes-Astic-Label-Stokes equation. Okay, this is for 3D. But if you're in 2D, you know that the limit is unique. So you use the So, you use this now classical argument by Gyunji and Kriloff, which roughly says that when you can solve the Martigale problems by an approximation argument and when the limit is unique, pathways unique, you have convergence, strong convergence in probability. Okay, so in fact, you have convergence of the whole sequence to a solution in probability in 2D. All right, so when you take a limit, what's the sense of the limit? Take a limit. What's the sense of the limit? Which end of measure? Yeah, I think the theorem will be. You want to see the theorem? Yeah, I will give the theorem, but on the full problem, if you don't mind, because this is a simplified problem. All right. Okay, so I didn't do the whole thing. But so I want you, all the brackets are taken in the UUL2 sense. Yes. Yes, because what I didn't say is that this, the capital. Is that this, the capital D here is the gradient in L2? Okay. Okay. This is the differential, but I identify the differential with the gradient with the base space as L2. All right. Thank you. Okay. So just for this simple problem, we didn't do this simple problem. This is just to explain the method. And in fact, for this very simple problem, you can do much better, in fact, because you can see V as a rough path. Because V will convert. Because V will converge to a noise as a rough path here, because it's a standard Orschein-Breck process. So you can just use the paper by Manova, Leahy, and Nielsen, and then where they proved Navy Steps Navy-Stokes in the sense of rough path. So you have continuity with respect to rough path, so you have convergence in the sense of rough path to Navier Stokes. So for this very simple example, you can do much better. But anyway, just to explain the method. Explain the method. So now, when you go to the full problem, so if I don't neglect the noise, the non-linear term, sorry, so you still do this. So now you split the unknown, you isolate the thing which will go to white noise and a remaining part. So you rewrite the equation as under this form here. So the W is okay. This is an Oschineric process. You have everything you want on this, and you have the remaining. Want on this, and you have the remaining part R. And if you look carefully on what happens here, so you have the leading term epsilon minus one C R and you have also one of epsilon B W. Okay? And W is a very oscillating thing. So this, there will be an averaging process here. You expect R to be averaged at the limit. Okay, and this is precisely the ethostox drift. Same expression as in Etienne Mema's work. So, if you want to see the ethostox drift, you have to consider this nonlinearity, the extra nonlinearity in the small scales. Okay? And so, what you expect, you expect W to converge to white noise, as before. So, you have your white noise here, transport noise, and R to converge to the etos. And R to converge to the etostox drift. So you'll have this R bar or U bar if I use the same notation as before. Okay, so you can see very easily this with correctors. So you do the whole same business, but you have another corrector due to this homogenization part, this averaging part. Okay, so now I will give a rigorous here. So these are the assumptions. So you say there are So, these are the assumptions, so you say they are quite complicated, but it's quite standard for when you do SPDEs, you need assumptions on the noise. So, I work with very smooth noises. I don't want to consider rough noise in space because the roughness is somewhere else. The roughness is in one over epsilon. So, smooth noise in space, no problem with this. I need the C. This is very technical. I need the C to this basically say that C is a different. Physically say that C is a differential operator, so that C minus one is moving. Okay, so I need smoot on C, except this. I don't need this assumption for Navier-Stokes in dimension two with periodic boundary conditions. This is exactly what I said before. When you have a nicer equation, you need less assumption. Also, I assume that the noise is sufficiently nice such that you see this invalid measure is smooth. measure is smooth. Okay. And also I need a very last assumption, which is very natural in this setting, is that the C and the phi commute. The correlation and the friction commute, which is clear if C is identity, otherwise it's an assumption. And I don't understand what's happening when C and phi don't commute. We don't know. We work quite hard, but there are terms, we just don't understand them. So these are the assumptions. So, these are the assumptions and the theorem, because so we have we need a theorem. So, first, so you take the solution. So, you have a solution. So, in 3D, it will be existence of a Martingale solution. In 2D, it will be existence of a strong solution. You can do all the energy estimates. It's very, not very easy, but it's quite standard. So, you have the solution are bounded in these spaces. So, this is to answer the previous question: where do I get tightness? Do I get tightness? So, and you get so much. This space is completely embedded in this space, you have tightness in this space. Okay. And when you take the limit, you converge to the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with transport noise and heterostok's drift. This is the theorem. I skipped all the technical details, but I think it's not reasonable to do technical details online. Details online with Zoom. And so if you are in 2D, you can take C equals identity, and so you have a much better result. Okay. So next. Yes, okay. So in fact, just to mention that we just did, we used in fact very similar ideas and a paper on Zachar's system, which is, it's, you know, it's a mathematic surprise. Sometimes you look, you work on a completely different. You look you work on a completely different problem, and the same method applies to another problem. That's something I developed with Anne de Boir and my student, our student Grégoire Barrier. And in fact, we also discovered that Justin Lagarnier, who is a professional of dissipation diffusion approximation, used similar arguments for completely different problems. And what would be nice, so the second step would be to have an order of convergence, because here I just have u epsilon convergence to u. Just have u epsilon converges to u. And this could be possible, but I would need like to have a solution of Navier-Stokes equation, which is in H4, I think, and I would need moments in H4. And I don't think anyone, I don't know anyone who is able to prove that the existence of solution to Navi-Stokes equation with moments in H4. So it doesn't work. Arnaud? Yes. Since you are talking about the convergence, so the convergence, you epsilon convergence. So the convergence, u epsilon convergence to u, you proved it in 2D in probability, correct? Yes, that's what I said before. In 3D, it's distribution. It's convergence in law, and in 2D, it's strong. When you have pathways convergence of the limit, pathways uniqueness of the limit, then you use this argument by Jungi and Kriloff, and you have strong convergence in probability. But what I'm saying is that you don't have the convergence in L2 of omega or Of omega, or do you have it? No, yeah, exactly. Okay, is there a hope? Yes, yes, yes. I think it's, I think, in fact, I didn't think about it, but I think it's clear. It's easy because you have energy. You have in dimension two, you have energy inequality. Okay, so it's dominated convergence. Okay. No, no, it's not dominated convergence. It's uh Convergence, it's or you use that you have convergence in probability and convergence of the norm and something else. I think it's okay. Okay, okay, yeah, very good. Thank you. Okay, so final remarks. So remember that the model by Etienne LeMan had extra terms because I had this, I have also a forcing, a noise-in-forcing term, and I have the divergence of u plus u bar equals. divergence of u plus u bar equals zero. Here I have divergence u equals zero. So I think that this would be, you would need to start from this much more complicated system. And formally from this system you get the good, you get exactly the same result, the same model as in Etienne Nehman's work. But this system is much harder to study. So but I think we will try to do this somehow sometime. Time okay, so it's still work in progress. So, next, uh, yes, okay, so maybe if you follow Frank, what Franco does, so very, he did quite a nice result with Benjun Laure recently, where what he did is he take Navier-Stokes equation with transport noise, and it takes a vanishing noise, but at the limit, there is something which remains because, in fact, when you Because in fact, when you what happened in this so it's on this equation, I don't know if you so it starts from this equation with r bar equals zero, you write it as a Ito equation because this is Stratonovic equation, okay? And I'll say yes, so it's written at the beginning. I'm sorry, I shouldn't skip the slide, but uh yes, where was this? Yes. Yes, here. You see, when you switch from Ito-Sratonovich to Ito, and what so he doesn't have this term, but it's okay. So you take a noise which vanishes, but the Ito-Sratonovich correction does not vanish. He's able to do this, and so at the limit he has something which remains from the noise, even if there is no noise at the limit. So since we have the same limit equation, it's very natural to do the same. Very natural to do the same, to try the same. And in fact, you can do it, it's not very difficult. So, what you do is, yes, so you take a noise which vanishes at the limit. This is the condition, but the noise disappears at the limit, and you choose it in the right way so that, yes, and so this is the little correction that you obtained at the limit that you obtain, and there is a way to choose. Obtain and there is a way to choose the noise. The Q and K are the eigenvalues of phi, so the covariance of the noise. You assume that the noise is diagonal in this thing. And you have noises such that this is zero, but this doesn't go to zero. And in fact, it goes to something which has a strictly positive contribution to the energy quality, because when you take this term, scholar U, you get a positive contribution. Scholar u, you get a positive quantity, so it's a very nice thing because it means that you have there is a way to put noise, you don't see the noise, but still you have more dissipation of energy, enhanced dissipation. And in fact, they even are able to have a noise such that the limit here, sorry, so that this k n of u converges to a limit, which is precisely the Laplace operator. Operator. Okay, so it means that at the limit you convert to something which you have two Laplace operators. So you have more viscosity at the limit because of the noise. And here you can do exactly the same. You start from a noise, you do the whole thing, you took epsilon and n go to zero, and you get this equation at the limit. It's not very difficult. You just have to take the whole setting by a Frondorian. The whole setting by Flando Lou. Okay. Maybe I'll skip the details. And so just to finish, because it's already 10 to 4. So this is what I think is interesting because, by the way, yes, so I don't want to compare to Franco's work because Franco does very, very good work, but I think it's interesting because in Franco's with Papal Metara, they weren't able to study the 3D Navy-Stokes equation. Study the 3D Navier-Stokes equation, for instance. They are only able to work in 2D, but you can go even further and you can consider many other equations. For instance, if you consider the 2D quasi-sterotrophic equation, so they are quite complicated, they have this form, okay, and you can do exactly, so you have coupled equation, and you take the same type of scaling, and you converge to a cross-shotrophic equation with transport noise. Same method, same everything. Method, same everything, you just have to work differently for the estimates, of course, because you use the technology is not exactly the same as for Navy Stokes. But the theorem is okay, you converge in the space where the quasi-school trophic equation is okay. And you can also work with the primitive equation of the atmosphere, so it's even more complicated, 2D or 3D. So you couple two primitive equations and you converge to the good equation. Good equation. Okay, and I think it's I should stop now, anyway. No, thank you. Okay, so thank you. Thank you very much, Arnold, for this very interesting talk and difficult also. So are there questions to Arno? We have some time for questions. There have been a lot of questions throughout the talk. So, can I ask. Go ahead. No, go ahead. Go ahead. So, Arnaud, thank you very much. It's very, very, very interesting. Arnaud, when he talks, he always does very interesting work. Very, very nice. So, Arnaud, I have a question about the goal. So, the The goal. So, the main point here is to study turbulent flows, right? Because, right? Because you believe that it's the transport, the noise, it's in the transport term. It's physical. I mean, I'm talking about the at least it is there. Maybe another place is there. It's there, yes. But this is well known. If you talk. But if this is well known, if you talk to any physicist, yes, yeah, yeah, he will tell you that the noise is a natvection. But now, my question is: so the goal here, so because turbulence, here you are taking the, so you start with a particular model that you claim it is turbulent, and then when you take epsilon goes to zero, you would like to arrive to an averaged. To an averaged equation, right? I mean, yeah, exactly. So, what are you capturing here? So, I'm trying to understand the physics. Are you trying to capture the turbulence or are you trying to capture something else? This is what I am not able to understand. I don't want to claim that I explain turbulence. That I explained turbulence. I'm doing that. What I think is interesting in this work is to try to see how terms in turbulence model can happen from rigorous mathematics. Okay, so I don't claim that the initial model, this model, I don't claim that it's the true one. I just claim, okay, it can happen as noise in small scales acting on large scale. Acting on large scale, and this is one mechanism. It might not be the physics, but maybe it mimics something that really happens in physics. Okay. And it's so I don't claim I solve troubles. No, no, no, but we are all aiming at understanding something. So what is nice is that from this system, we get two terms that are important. Get two terms that are important in physics. So it's transport noise and the histosophile drift. So in physics, when you think the limit goes to zero and you arrive to that model, the limiting model, which has, for example, it has the one that has two Laplacian. Is it is it a physical model that people, for example, in physics use or uh Physics use, or uh, because it would be good, right? You mean the last one, the last one. No, no, when you pass to the limit, the average, when you have two Laplacian, you have two Laplacian. What do you have? I don't know. The last one. Oh, you mean, yeah. In the limit, you get Laplace. I mean, A of you and another A kappa or something, right? Right, or oh no, but this is sorry, sorry, maybe I shouldn't have talked about this. This is this is really something which is Franco's work. This one, yeah, this is Anand's dissipation. And you know, again, it's this is interesting. This is interesting. This is interesting, it's very interesting, but it tells that the noise may give extra diffuse viscosity, which is also something that physics happens. It's very old, it goes back to Reynolds in the 19th century. To Reynolds in the 19th century. So it's again, it's only mathematics, it's far from physics because the noise is really artificial here. But it says that a noise may bring to enhanced viscosity. So it's very interesting, but it's probably not close to physics. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Hakima. So, Sami, you had a question also before I think. Yes. Yes, so I just wanted to go back to this non-rigorous derivation by Mima. It looked to me that this could be amenable to also rough path type constraints. So yes, actually you are right, but I don't know what probably not. So what do you mean? Here, from here? Here from here. Yeah. So instead of using Ito Vensel, I was wondering if some people had tried to use more pathways techniques. Well, I don't know if it's what you mean, but yes, what can be done, and I think, and actually, that's something we are. And actually, that's something we are doing now, but not with rough path, but maybe we will do with rough path. Is you instead of w here, you take a smooth thing, you do the whole derivation with standard calculus, and then you take the limit in the whole derivation in rough math sense. Yeah, that's exactly, yes, this is something what we are doing now. All right, so you're doing. All right, so you're doing that in a kind of rough path setting? Yes, no, actually, I don't do it with rough rough setting because I'm not in a rough path business. I do it with other arguments, but you can do it with rough paths. And I think I will do it because you get other properties which are also interesting. Okay. And this is something we just started to discuss with Martina. All right. You're right. Okay. So there is time for a Okay, so there is time for a last question.
