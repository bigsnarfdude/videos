Thanks to the organizers for organizing a beautiful workshop, and especially for being so cheerfully flexible about all the changes that had to be made along the way. I really appreciate that. And as you see, I'm speaking out here on Thursday afternoon precisely because of that flexibility. And so thanks. Been really a lot of fun. I'll try to learn some lessons and how to relax more myself from this. Okay. So, um So, I want to give you a quick list of the topics I'd like to cover. So, this is going to be about dispersing billiards. Happily, it should fall in the theme of the conference, which is not always the case. But so the basic object I'll be talking about is a finite horizon Sinai billiard. So I want to review some geometric facts about that. And then the main tool we'll use is transfer operators. So I'm coming at it very much from the point of view that Marius was describing yesterday in a sense that it's really a functional analytic. Sense that it's really a functional analytic approach to some of these problems. And then the nice setting, I'm going to talk about the nice setting where for this class of geometric potentials, right, E times log of the unstable Jacobian, we have quasi-compactness of this transfer operator acting on some bonic space, which I'll wave my hands at, and you have a spectral gap. And so things work kind of the way they should in this setting. And then I'll talk about a case where they don't work, where causal compactness fails, and yet, and and yet and the reason why this family of uh penos is interesting is because well it contains the measures of maximum integrity for both the map and the flow those are two different measures but it's sort of using the root function here tau is the function between collisions for the billiard flow that we use to define the map and uh so well we don't have nice spanach spaces there but still we can recover something from a functional analytic approach Functional analytic approach and still get existence of these equilibrium states and therefore MMEs for the map of the flow. So I want to talk about those. So this is a few projects that I'll be kind of summarizing today. Almost all of it is jointly with Vivian Baladi, and then also on some of the other projects that I'll mention, Jerome Karand and Alexei Karafana. So, and I'll try to make clear which projects do what, but that's kind of the summary. That's kind of a summary, so they'll be a little bit mishmashed together, also. So, oh, and I say, and then I mean, I gave you this list of topics, right? But actually, I won't be presenting it in this order. So, because it turns out that some of the things I want to define geometrically are related to how we want to define the transproper. So these kind of get mishmashed together. They're not really separated as separate bullet points, but don't be, you'll see, they'd be kind of going out of order. But anyway, here's the base model. But anyway, here's the base model. You put finitely many convex obstacles on a torus, two torus, and you let a point particle bounce around, collide elastically with the boundaries of these things. The boundaries should be C3 curves with strictly positive curvature. And we can do some of this stuff with infinite horizon, most of it with finite, I mean, most of it is restricted to finite horizon. So today I'm just going to talk about the finite horizon case, which means that we have a upper bound. We have an upper bound on the free flight time between collisions, so there are no lines in the torus that never meet any of the obstacles. And so that's the flow, right? And then we turn it into a map by parametrizing the boundary with some arc length parameter. We record the position and then the angle that the outgoing trajectory makes with the unit normal at each collision point. And we get a two-dimensional phase space in that in the Phase space and that and the billiard map is essentially the Poincar√© map on that on that cross-section of the flow. And so our phase space essentially becomes a finite union of cylinders. So this is a map that is, well, since the scatters are C3, it's going to be sort of piecewise C2, but you get singularities near tangential collisions. So raising collisions will cause discontinuities for the map and also places where the derivative gets arbitrarily large. Arbitrarily large. So that's kind of the classical model. It's been introduced by Sinai in the late 60s, proved as the fact Bernoulli by Beloved and Ornstein. So this is all with respect to this kind of smooth invariant measure. So despite the fact that this map is discontinuous, it preserves this very nice smooth invariant measure, the SRB measure. And that's the one that we have really a rich. We have really a rich collection of facts about Bernoulli exponential decay of correlations proved by Leisang-Jung in 98. That's for the finite horizon case. The infinite horizon case was added a year later by Chernov. And then lots of limit theorems that come out of it. So central limit theorem, which doesn't get exponential to gate relations earlier, but I have another case and I. And then things later, once the Young-Cower approach was introduced, you could get a lot of these other. Introduced, you could get a lot of these other more refined limit theorems coming out. And so that's just a very tursory summary of the different things that have been proved with respect to this invariant measure. And there's a comparable set of results for the flow as well. The flow preserves just Lebesgue measure essentially on some three-dimensional porous. And you have essentially all these things. I mean, it's also. All this thing, I mean, it's also Bernoulli, and it also enjoys exponential decay correlations and has a bunch of limit theorems. So, there's, I'm not putting up those references, but there's a comparable set of references with respect to the smooth invariant measure for the flow. So, what I want to talk about today is kind of other invariant measures, right? What else can we say? Since this, you know, it was a workshop that are not going to have formalism. We want to talk about equilibrium states. And so, here's a familiar definition. Let's take entropy plus the integral. Plus the integral of some potential, and that's a pressure. And now we want to talk about: can we prove existence here, right? And what kind of potentials can we use? What kind of phi can we stud equilibrium states for? So the first class, right, the nice class where things work out is this one here, geometric potentials. I'll have to restrict T in a bit, but for now we can define it by an alt R just this way. t equals one is the srv measure right i mean that's the equilibrium state for t equals one is the srv measure um this is proved essentially by spels and if you if you take the supremum over a not maybe all invariant measures but all invariant measures that decays sufficiently in some nice way as you approach singularity set then that's proved in uh in a book by falkin strelson with the appendix by With the appendix by and for sticky, right, which actually proved half of this variation principle. And then global uniqueness, Vivian and I did it a couple of years ago. So t equals zero, of course, also in this family, right? Another element of this family is the measure of maximal entropy, but that's kind of degenerate, as we'll see today. So I'm going to put that in the other family with the root function, because of course when t equals zero. Because, of course, when t equals zero, you know, it goes into lots of different families, this one, right? So, because it doesn't really behave like the t equals one case, all the other positive values of t are nicer, but t equals zero is not so nice. So, I'll put that away in the second half of the talk. And this is also Bernoulli, but we don't have a rate of mixing because we don't have that spectral gap. So, actually, in a project with Alexa that I'll talk about a little bit later, we have some polynomial rate of mixing that we think. Rate of mixing that we think, well, we don't know if that's the best you can do. So that's an open question. So negative t. Let's not really talk about negative t because there you have these, if you have a grazing periodic orbit, the lesser periodic orbit, the least one grazing collision, then the update exponent is automatically infinite, and therefore the pressure will be infinity. And so that pressure function will just jump in this case. So that's so we're going to restrict our discussion. So that's so we're going to restrict our discussion t greater than or equal to zero, where this pressure is always finite. And in a related work, there's a preprint on archive by Chen Wang Zhang. And this Zhang is a Hung Ben Zhang who worked out the original kind of functional analysis Bonach space norms for the SRB measure on billiards with me. So they have gotten Have done kind of look at this class of potentials and sort of in a regime of t near one, their young-tower methods have shown the existence of equilibrium states. Because there, if t is near one, essentially you can lift all these measures to some comparable inducing scheme. Okay, so transfer operator. So what kind of transfer operator are we going to use? Well, it's if you've dealt with If you dealt with expanding maps, this might look a little bit funny because we have this stable Jacobian, right? That's kind of an extra thing, and you always have to end up kind of potentially in the stable direction. So this is, if you look at like AISO maps, you get something like this. It's kind of the unstable Jacobian is raised to the power T, that comes from that potential. And then you're also multiplying by the stable Jacobian there. For a billiard, but then that's kind of like, that looks ugly. So for a billiard, we'll take advantage of. So, for a billiard, we'll take advantage of the fact that we have a nice formula for the determinant of the map, just the ratio of cosines where you kind of start and where you land in one iterative of the map. And so, this will be, well, the product of stable and stable Jacobians times some angle that depends, times on ratio functions that depend on the angle between these stable and unstable subspaces. But so, the point is that up to some kind of co-boundary, this potential, this weight in the transfer operator. Potential, this weight in the transfer operator is equal to that one. And that's a much nicer looking one, just the stable Jacobian to the one minus t. So the spectral properties of those two operators should be the same, speaking some details in the rug. But if everything, if we find the right Lanach spaces, we can study this operator instead. So that's the one we're going to study, just the stable being raised to the one minus t in the denominator. So when t equals one, this goes away. And this transfer operator is really nice. It's just composition. Is really nice. It's just composition of the T inverse. That's the SRB case. That's the well-understood case that's much easier precisely because this stable Jacobian disappears. Every other value of T, you're going to have to deal with that stable Jacobian, which because of these near-grazing collisions will be arbitrarily close to zero in some places in your phase space, so that's going to blow up. Plus, the stable subspaces don't vary continuously for a billiard, they are just measurable. So this function is not that nice. It's not a whole very continuous. Not that nice, right? It's not a holder continuous, it's not even piecewise holder continuous, it's just kind of a mess on the phase space. Okay, good, but still, we're stubborn. We like functional analysis, so we're going to want to push this through anyway. So, there it is, right? So, what do we want to do? Well, we can define this transfer operator on some set of distributions, right? Just essentially by kind of. Right, just essentially by kind of some dual, right? Just an opposition of the test function. I'm not going to be specific about the classic test functions here. Obviously, t has discontinuity, so you can't start with like a smooth test functions because that won't be preserved by the composition with the map. So you have to be a little bit creative about how you define the right class of test functions and, therefore, the right class of distributions. But who cares? Basically, that's the definition of the transfer operator. When you take your distribution. Take your distribution to be just a density times the SRB measure, then point-wise, it reduces to that. It's just transforming densities like that. Okay, and so what do we want to do with this thing? Well, we want to do what Perry taught us to do with finite state markup chains, right? Which is just look at the left eigenvector, look at the right eigenvector of the eigenvalue of maximum modulus, pair them, and get an equilibrium state, or MME first, and then more generally, equilibrium state. And more generally, equilibrium states. So that's the kind of setting, that's the kind of strategy we want to employ. Obviously, as I said, the potential is not so nice because the wave is unbounded and your stable subspaces don't vary well, you know, smoothly or even continuously. And so, of course, even just thinking about topological notion pressure, if you think about trying to prove variational principles, you have to. Trying to prove variational principles, you have to decide how you want to cut up your face space, how your discontinuity is going to cut your face space, right? Because they're going to play a role in any definition of topological pressure that you want to invoke or formulate. And that definition of topological pressure should coincide somehow with the functional analysis bit, too. So you want the monic spaces to capture that. All right. So just don't So just don't know how familiar you are with the geometry of billiards, but I thought I would summarize a few properties just to start off. So here's the derivative as you approach tangential collagens. You see it's basically proportional to one over the cosine of the angle where you land, right? And so that tells you, kind of look at where you took off from. It's roughly like a one over square root of the distance to the singularity set. Singularity set here. S1 being the pre-internet. Set here S1 being the pre-image of those tangential collisions. So where phi would be pi over 2 or negative pi over 2. But if you don't look there, I mean, that's the bad spot. If you look away from that, then everything is very uniformly hyperbolic. It's very nice. You have a family of cones. They are uniformly transverse on the face space. They are uniformly transverse to the singularity sets in just the way that you want them to be. And so they really are. They really are help, they help you a lot, right? There's a kind of uniform dublicity. Cones contract, right? The unstable cones contract under dt, stable ones under dt inverse. So you really just kind of like anisov away from those singularity curves. So, okay. And in a finite horizon case, they're just finitely many. This S1 is just finitely many piecewise smooth curves. Curves. But then we have to make things more complicated because we don't have bounded distortion, right? So, how do you do that? We say, well, okay, let's cut up the face space a bit into strips where if I just stay within the strip, I'm going to have bounded distortion. So that's kind of a usual technique where you have things breaking down. But that's kind of the standard thing to do. And Q equals 2 is the standard thing if you're looking at SRB measures. In general, since we want to take T small all the way down to zero. To take t small all the way down to zero, right? Actually, our q is going to get bigger as as t goes to zero. So we're going to choose q basically so that qt is at least two. And that will sort of so this the way so these are kind of artificial subdivisions that we make in the phase space to control distortion. And we're going to, you know, index that according to the potential that we want to study, according to P. So that's okay. I mean, a very elementary diagram. I can do straight lines. Diagram. I can do straight lines. Everything else is a challenge. But yeah, so that's kind of what they look like, right? These solid, they just sort of accumulate on the top and bottom boundaries of these cylinders, right? Each scatter indicates a component of the phase space that's a cylinder. And these just the top and the bottom boundaries are exactly S0. They're exactly the places where phi is equal to pi over two and minus pi over two. Those are the tangential collisions. So this is kind of how you're cutting up your phase space. So the price. Cutting up your face space, so the price you pay now you get amount of distortion. The price you pay is that now your singularity set is countable, right? Yes, well, there's not an answer. I'm just calling it open. Sure, sure, sure. But I mean, what I'm just having here. I mean, what I'm just having here is how you got phase space. So when the dynamic comes in, if you have a curve, so every line tip curve, for example, has positive slope in the phase space. So when it lands across several homogeneity strips, you're going to cut and treat each one as a separate curve. Yes, right. And then, and this is this is cutting more and more often until you get to the top boundary, right? It's an accumulation. To the top boundary, right? It's an accumulation of these horizontal line segments to the top, and also at the bottom, the same kind of accumulation. Yeah, so now when you have when you iterate a curve, now it's going to have maybe countably many components instead of only finitely many. I mean, really, there's finitely many, but you insist on counting them as an infinite number. Because when you chop them like this, then within one of these, the derivatives will be, will have bounded distortion. They have comparable size. So that's kind of a trade. So that's kind of a trade-off, right? Yeah. Okay, so we need some sort of way to say, though, that all this extra cutting hasn't destroyed the effect of hyperbolicity in the system. So hyperbolicity beats cutting, right, is kind of the standard philosophy in this sort of piecewise hyperbolic setting. And so this is so here we're going to choose this QT at least two. So that is aligning our spacing with that t, right, which is kind of the amount of. Right, which is kind of the amount of derivative that we allow ourselves, right? As we have this unstable jago being given to the power of t. So, as t gets smaller, we have kind of a weaker and weaker expansion, and this is why we have to cut according to that t. So, for again, for t equals one and q equals two, this is a classical result of Chernov, this one-step expansion. So, here we're going to define Ws to be the set of local stable manifolds. They are all, they all have uniformly bounded. They are all they all have uniformly bounded curvature, so you can kind of think of them as locally the C2 curves in the space. They can be arbitrarily short, of course, because of the cutting due to singularities, but they are well defined almost everywhere. And then for a stable, one of these locally stable leaves, let BI denote these homogeneous connected components of T inverse of B. So homogeneous means they're just lying in a single homogeneous. Single homogeneity strip. Here they're stable, so they go the other way. So I drew an unstable with positive slope. Every stable curve has negative slope. So your cones are aligned this way for these billiards. If you pull back a stable curve, it stays a union of stable curves. So that will be classically like the inverse of B. Then you subdivide it according to homogeneity string. Then you subdivide it according to homogeneity strips, and you have a countable collection of these things. And so then you ask: if you sum up the stable Belbian to the power p over these pieces, what do you get? And what you can show is that at a small enough length scale, right, so that you're just looking, you're not looking kind of globally at the chopping, but just locally at what the singularities can do, that this is some compress, it's strictly less than one. And so that extra T you're adding actually just. That extra t you're adding actually just scales the x, I mean, like an exponent, but it doesn't ruin the contraction as long as it's greater than zero. Of course, this all falls apart at t equals zero, right? So, that's for the second half of the talk. So far, everything works. And the proof is essentially the same as the general case. Because you see, every if you go look at a small enough length scale, delta, then a short curve can undergo at most, you have this tau max, the finite horizon condition tells you that you. Horizon condition tells you that you can, in one kind of passage of this short curve, you can be cut at most this many times: the max of the root function divided by the min of the root function. And so what happens if you get cut that some number of times? Well, every one of them, except at most one, is nearly tangential. So everyone is seeing a ton of expansion. Backwards unstable is expansion, right? It's the same as forward and unstable. So you have a ton of expansion. And maybe one you go is not. And maybe one you go is not close to tangential. But when you add up all those, you think of the stable going forward as just like one of the unstable, right? So you add up either the reciprocal of all the expansions or all the contractions looking the other way, then you will get something less than one. So a picture you could have in mind is if you put a few scatterers out there and you let And you let some wavefront go forward. Well, maybe I should have put these scatters a bit closer together, but the idea is that you might have something that looks like this, and these don't have to be the same distance apart. Maybe they're a little too symmetric. So, but the idea is that this one at a short length scale, right? Maybe this one is almost grazing here, this one is almost grazing here. Here, this one is almost grazing here, and then in the middle, this part is not nearly grazing, right? But still, so here you have kind of order one expansion. Here you have tremendous expansion because if they're nearly grazing, and so if you add up the three contractions going back this way, or one over the expansion as they went that way, then you will get actually something less than one. So, that's what it says. It basically says the expansion used to use beating whatever cutting you do. Beaning whatever cutting you do, and this is kind of the minimum hyperbolicity constant. You see, it's entirely in terms of the geometric quantities that are defined by the table. One plus twice, that's the minimum curvature and the minimum light. So, as long as these scatters are disjoint, you have some talmian that's positive, and you get some uniform hyperbolicity here. So, this is the setting in which you have this one-step expansion. And using the one-step expansion, you can then get that's the kind of the central point to the contraction that happens in the To the contraction that happens in the Lasodi-York inequalities. Okay, so what do we want to do? I'm not really going to give the definition of these norms, but I will tell you more or less what they do. And they integrate on pieces of stable manifold. So that's what this W is, some piece of local stable manifold. And then we're going to take some power of the transfer operator. To take some power of the transfer operator here, which is weight function, right, depending on t, and apply it to some element of our bonic space, and then times the test function. And we're integrating with respect to arc length on this little bit of smooth stable leaf. And we change variables, right? So what happens is you get the stable, you get the Jacobian change of variables, but since this is a piece of stable manifold, that is exactly the stable Jacobian. You get one power of it. You had one minus T powers of it in the denominator. T powers of in the denominator, so now you end up with t powers in the numerator. So you have a bit of contraction, and that's what that's actually exactly the fact that we were summing in the one-step expansion or the one-step contraction, depending on how you want to look at it. So then when you decompose this p inverse of the stable leaf into some countable collection of these, you realize that actually after you apply the norms here, we're going to have to estimate things of this type, which is like some iterated version. Which is like some iterated version of what we were estimating in the one study. Right? And so this is the kind of thing that, I don't know, if the iterates of this transcript are going to grow according to some eigenvalue, right, some pressure, then that's the kind of expression that it's going to grow like. Stable to Colvin to the power T summed over all the pieces you create as you iterate. Okay, so that's how we're going to define topological pressure. We're going to take that idea from change of variables, what our norm tells us, and we're just going to make that the definition. Tells us, and we're just going to make that the definition of topological pressure for this potential. So we have some cutting due to the singularities, right? That's Sn. We add the extra cuts for the homogeneity strips. So I'm going to put this bold H up there for that countable cutting that we've added with the homogeneity strips. And then, okay, then you have these notations. M0n is just the connected components of m minus sn. They look like this, because this is just a bunch of stable curves, the boundaries of these things. Stable curves, the boundaries of these things, they're all have negative slope. So, some of these cells, right, will be long and thin because you have hyperbolicity, so they all have to be thin. But some, because of the discontinuities, will also be short, and other ones will be long, right? And so then it becomes a play of like how many short ones you have, how many long ones you have. Obviously, in a smooth case, you'd have all of them all long. So, here you want to know that somehow the longer dominating the short. I haven't drawn in the extra cutting that goes with this. Drawn in the extra cutting that goes with this m0 and h because that would be, I mean, it's just makes you confusing. But just to think that along some of these, you would have a countable collection of curves accumulating on some of these boundaries. And then that further subdivision gives you the elements of M0 and H. So QNT is just going to be the sum over the elements of these, right? And you're summing the state with Gobin raised to the T to the N raised to the power T, right? Raised to the power t, right? That's exactly that expression that came out of that change of variables. And we are going to sum that over the whole phase space. So this is kind of a global quantity now. The other one on the level of the curve is more local, but this one is global. And then our topological pressure is just going to be the limit of the exponential rate at which QNT grows. Yeah. So that will depend on the prediction of the speed. Ah, it does. Yes. But you have. Yes, but you have to now think why it should. Well, at each end, it will, but maybe the limit won't, right? Yeah. So, and once we get an equilibrium state for this, you see that the formulation of the equilibrium state is independent of the choice of Q. And so it won't, it won't, right? Yeah. But okay, it won't, but you have to make. But okay, it won't, but you have to make, you have to be careful because, of course, if you chose the initial Q so that this thing diverged, then you wouldn't get a very good limit. But within a certain range, it's independent of Q. Yeah, within an acceptable range of relationship between Q and T. Okay, so the limit exists here. I've written limit not in super limit because you have some sub additivity. Examples of addictivity. And so you get the limit to exist. Not only that, it's equal to the imp, so you get a lower bound, a trivial lower bound on the growth of QNT. And actually, most of the work is getting an upper bound that's of the same exponential order and doesn't have any like polynomial multiplication, you know, it's not growing, but some sub-exponential rate that's bigger than that. Okay, so just as an initial result. Result, we're going to just prove some just from this definition without giving any of the functionality stuff, just as a definition, you can see that this function we've defined as this p star, right, as a just as a function is convex and continuous and decreasing. So let's count the properties you want from pressure, right? And it satisfies a variational inequality. It is big enough to dominate all the metric pressure. And that's not a restricted soup, right? Detect any invariant. Super I can take any invariant invariant probability measure. This P star is kind of big enough. So the only worry is: did we, by chopping too much with those strips, did we create a number that's too big? Right. Just like, is that pressure maybe too big? Or is there actually a measure in there whose pressure equals P star? And that's most of the work. And that's where we need this monox basis, right? So in order to inequality, we want to demonstrate that there is an invariant measure. Demonstrate that there is an invariant measure, pressure control, this topological notion. And so we want to create some Bonach space for our transfer operator that has the right spectral radiance and then do the parrier construction. Okay, so for what range of t can we get this? Well, essentially you have this pressure function, right? That's convex decreasing continuous, and that's the red curve. That's the red curve. And then we have the straight line, which is that lambda, right? That one plus twice the minimum curvature times the minimum flight time or distance between collisions. And that's this blue, that's this blue line, right? I mean, so minus t log lambda is that blue line. And as long as the blue line is less than the red line, then the one-step expansion we get, the contraction to the north-sector expansion, is going to be strictly less than what we expect. Is going to be strictly less than what we expect to be the spectral radius, which is e to the p star. And so we're going to have kind of a pressure gap or a complexity gap, and we're going to be able to prove quite a compactness. Once those two hit, that's going to fall apart. That's not going to work. So that's kind of as far as we can push it. So T star is just defined as the intersection point of these two. T star may be infinity. We actually have no idea if these two curves intersect or not. But we know that if they do intersect, they intersect past one. That's clear. Intersect past one, that's clear, right? Because at one you're zero, but this one is definitely less than zero, and it equals one. So, where, however far we can push it, it's definitely past one. And you have essentially that's that's yes, it's your pressure gap. That theta to the t that we have, I mean, that theta is going to be made arbitrarily close to lambda. So that's really why this condition is the pressure gap, because for any t less than this point of intersection, you can always choose your theta, your length scale. Your theta, your length scale, so that theta falls between lambda and beta tt. And so then you can do a whole bunch of uniform choices. So you want to fix some compact interval here, tier 0, t1. And on that compact interval, you can choose your exponent for your homogeneous strips, your k0, which is the minimum index when you start cutting, your length scale for your stable curves, your theta from your one-strip expansion, and everything in math. And everything in that interval, that compact interval of t's, you can have one choice of either these constants. That means you have one box space for your transfer operator. As soon as you change one of these constants, you change the box space. So the result is going to be that, okay, we can do it for everything between zero and t star, but on every compact sub-interval, we have a single Banach space. So we're going to have be able to, so for example, we want to take a derivative, we want a single Banach space, and then we can take a derivative in T in that compact interval. If we want to show continuity properties, Complex interval. If we want to show continuity properties of various objects, differentiability, this kind of thing. That's why uniformity here in a single monic space is important. So that's maybe a little bit technical, but I just wanted to say that sort of, okay, we're going to construct monic spaces, but on every compact interval, we really just have one Bonic space. And then if you want a bigger compact interval, you tweak things a bit and you have another Bonach space that works on that compact. Okay, so we want to prove. So we want to prove this uniform growth of this QNT, right? That's going to be central to understanding how this transfer operator works. And so, well, we want to iterate these curves, right? So you pull back a stable curve. It gets cut into countably many pieces by the singularities, by the homogeneity strips. And so you are going to subdivide the long ones, so some length scale delta one, so that you can iterate the one-step expansion. And that's, we call it the. And that's, we call that the nth generation of piece. That's the GN delta one of W. So it's basically the pieces of T minus N W with long pieces subdivided. And the kind of things we want to prove, the type of growth lambda you see is that, you know, if you add up this sum, the contribution of these weights on just the short pieces, right? So if you are only adding the pieces that are length less than delta one over three, then three, then they are not the ones that you artificially, the long ones that you artificially subdivided because they were too long. Those would only create things of length delta one over two. So these are really the ones that are cut, genuinely cut by the singularity. So this set are going to be things with at least one endpoint on the singularities, and they should make up a vanishingly small proportion of your sum over all pieces. So you should be able to bounce. So, you should be able to bound the contribution with the short pieces, compare their contributions all. For T less than one, this is easier to estimate. Because for T less than one, and this is going to be growing like the pressure, you figure, that's going to be exponentially growing, actually. And so, as long as you can show that this is going to be shrinking, you're going to have this type of relationship. For T bigger than one, it gets much harder because both sides are now shrinking exponentially fast. And so this is why. Exponentially fast. And so this is why you need that pressure gap condition, you know, to make sure that the left side is shrinking faster than the right side. And then similar, so that's on a curve by curve basis, right? And then you have similar lemmas about the elements of right the open sets, right? The component, the connected component, connected homogeneous components in your phase space. You could also have notions of long and short there. And so there's a complication. There, there's a comparable statement that's a little bit technical, so I'm not going to say it. Basically, the ones that have long whose images have long unstable diameter contribute most in this sense of the weight to the total pressure, the QNT, right? So, again, they're the short cells contribute a small proportion of the total topological pressure. So, those are a couple of things you can prove. And once you have that, then you can basically say that every curve. Basically, say that every curve sees the global pressure. Because if the long curve, I mean, if the long elements are carrying most of the weight, long elements of the nth generation carry most of the weight, and the long elements of the cutting in your face space are long, or carry most of the weight. Then what can you do with long things? Well, long things on one side, long things on the other. They overlap and a positive, right, positive proportion of them overlap. Positive proportion of them overlap. So now you have that a positive fraction of this is, sorry, a partial fraction of this is factored by each curve. And that's essentially the main idea of the argument. That just once everything is long, then you can get overlap and the growth rates are the same. And then you get a super multiplicative property or sort of with this concept, but the concept doesn't ruin anything. Too, but the concept doesn't ruin anything for this QNT. So, once you have super multiplicativity, you get the upper bound, and so you get sub-multiplicative gives you the lower bound, super gives you the upper, and you have exactly this QNT trapped between the same exponent, right, and no sub-exponential factors ruining things, which is great for your transfer operator. For the transfer operator, that's going to mean you don't have any Jordan blocks on the peripheral spectrum, which is a good thing to eliminate. You can do averaging things then. Lots of nice stuff. Lots of nice stuff. Okay. So, bonic spaces, as I said, I'm going to skip the definition because it's just too technical. But if you've seen standard pairs and coupling arguments, then you've basically seen these mod spaces just flipped over onto the stable from the unstable side. So, coupling arguments and standard pairs essentially take smooth densities on unstable curves and push them forward, and they wait till you get to some reference set, and then you couple. Till you get to some reference set and then you couple along stable manifolds, right? And this is kind of a coupling argument. And so the idea of the transfer operator is you kind of look at the dual of that and you're going to integrate, or you're going to define norm by integrating unstable leaves against polar hezillon. And this, I mean, there's so there are lots of, there are several versions of Bonach spaces for hyperbolic maps. This particular branch is following the Guzel-Devrani paper from 06, which did it in the Anasov case. Which did it in the Anisoff case, then it's extended to piecewise hyperbolic by myself and Carlando in 08. And then with Hung Kun Shang, we did the billiards case for the SRB. And so we're kind of generalizing that at each step of the way. But the philosophy is kind of the same, the fact that the transfer operator acts as kind of like a dual to the coupling method. Okay, so then Okay, so then the Bonach spaces are basis of distributions, but you can just kind of think of them as taking some starting with some C1 function and then taking the closure or the completion of this C1 functions with respect to some pair of norms. And it has the usual SODR setup where you have the unit ball of the strong space is completely embedded in the weak space. So you have kind of that standard setup, even though now you're not really dealing with functions, you're dealing with distributions. Really, dealing with functions, you're dealing with distributions, but still that setup is the right one. And so, here, right, for every compact sub-interval of zero t star, we have a box space we can define depending on the interval t0 t1, and you have a spectral gap. Moreover, exactly e to the v star t is the eigenvalue of math maximum modulus. And so, first you prove quasi-compactness, and then a spectral gap. And then a spectral gap. And that sigma there is, you know, has to do with that contraction from theta to the t. So once we have that vector gap, then we take the left and right eigenvectors with respect to that eigenvalue of maximum modulus. So nu t will be an element of the Bonach space. Nu t tilde will be an element of the dual. You pair them normally. The dual, you pair them, normalize the pairing, and that is the invariant measure. Oh, well, okay, very distribution, but you have to prove that because new t and new tilde are elements of the peripheral spectrum, then these Bonn basis the distributions are actually that the elements of the peripheral spectrum are measures, and then this is an invariant measure. The uniform estimates here are essential to this part. Where are essential to this part of the argument moving from fuzzy compactness to kind of the perum-forbening's argument about the peripheral spectrum? They are also needed here to show that the normalization is not zero and so that you really have a probability measure. But I'm skipping all that. And then, as Marius explained yesterday, once you have, if you can do it for a little bit more, Uh, if you can do it for a little bit more, uh, more general potentials, then you can take derivatives in different directions, right? And you can actually get uniqueness of this equilibrium state using kind of the differentiability of these operators in various directions. So, this is different from the differentiability with respect to t, which is also true, but just a totally different technique. So, here we're adding something smooth, and that's e to the z b. As e to the z phi, and um, that's much smoother than t, right? So, in principle, this is going to be analytic in z, but uh well actually it's also analytic in t actually it's both, but it's just that it's applied here, it's applied to something smooth here, it's applied to the state which is Bogian, which is, as I said, not that smooth. So, you have to make the argument separately. So, the differentiability with z with respect to z is easier than that with respect to t, but but they're analytic both. Both okay, so you've got this. Uh, well, you don't know as equilibrium state yet, you just know that it's a measure constructed using the right, I mean, the right and left eigenvectors corresponding to this eigenvalue. So now he wants to show that its pressure is the right pressure. And for this, it's essentially a bone ball argument. Um, just as with everything else, like with the norms. Like with the norms and everything, you know, always iterating stable curves backwards. So we've got a backwards Bowen ball, right? At time n and scale epsilon there. And you can prove just an upper bound. You can't really get a lower bound. You mean the uniform in the classical bowl argument, and you get also a lower bound of its same order, and you more or less get existence from the upper bound and uniqueness from the lower bound. But you don't get uniqueness from this argument here because there's no Uniqueness from this argument here because there's no good lower bound, right? You can have some bone balls that get approaching singularities too quickly, and so you get you have to have some correction here on the text dimension rate for the lower bound and it ruins the bone argument. So that's why that transfer operator, the differentiability of the transfer operator, is an important idea here because the usual argument doesn't work. But the upper bound does work just fine, right? You get the pressure and then the potential as an upper bound. And then, okay. And then, here's a lemma of Brennan Katak, main theorem, which they call main lemma, I think, in their paper. But it's like, great. So, yeah. So, oh, well, because we already know it's stereotype, right? Spectral gap. So almost every bone ball goes down like the entropy. That's what the Brim Katok result says. And so that you know from this upper bound here that you get a lower bound on. That you get a lower bound on, like, because the negative sign turns everything around, so you get a lower bound on the pressure minus this integral. And this integral, because of the symmetry of the billiard, minus log of the stable-covian is equal to plus the integral of log of the unstable covian, which is kind of your pressure. So that tells you that the pressure of this particular invariant measure is dominating p star, but of course, p star dominates all the pressures. Star dominates all the pressures. So you have inequality both ways. You have equality. Yeah. You explain, at least, the difficulty in the proposition. You said that the point can be close to the yeah, but the lower bound is hard, but the upper bound doesn't have that problem because, okay, if you get cut too far, then certainly you're going to satisfy the same upper bound. So this is an easy direction and it works just fine for systems with singularities to keep the upper bound. The upper bound. What fails is if you try to do the Bowen argument of uniqueness using the lower bound. At any point along these n steps of the trajectory, it can be close to the singularity. Right. And then get cut. And then so its measure is too small. And it can be, yeah, much smaller than this. Exactly. So what's the way around that? That is the differentiability of the. The differentiability of the transfer operator. So that was here. I just popped it at the bottom of this slide. But you see, we perturbed this transfer operator with something. And you can take anything, say, C1 function B here, and then so that this is an analytic perturbation of the transfer operator with C equals zero. And then that means you can take derivatives kind of in any direction instead of one direction. And then by the argument that Marius described yesterday, you potentially show. Marius described yesterday, you essentially show that you have to agree if you have two equilibrium states, this is differentiability, then you have to agree on every C1 function, whatever class is that you put out here. And that means that they're the same as measures. Are you just one measure? A priori, you don't know, but you, I mean, it comes out of the fact that these are elements of the bonus space. So that is something you have to show along the way, yeah. Is something you have to show along the way, yes. So, here, once you get this measure, you have to show that the bound you get is related to the Banach space, that the measure of some epsilon neighborhood of a singularity set is bounded by some constant times epsilon to the, and then it's going to be some exponent. It depends on how you define the Banach space, right? And so that. Right. And so that that tells you to measure the singularity set to zero and you can right no because I'm just trying to understand the difficulty if then can you just estimate the remain between small exponential ball away from singularity most of your trajectory? Yeah, well, okay, so you mean for the Bowen argument for the lower bound. Yeah, so there are, so I'll, yeah, I will try to explain. I mean, here is because we have the differentiability of this trend. Is because we have the differentiability of this transfer operator, it's just a much easier argument. We don't have to deal with the lower bound in the case t equals zero, and we don't get a spectral gap, and so we don't have analyticity here, we can't take a derivative. Then you're right, we have to make an adaptation of a Bowen argument in some averaging sense that, yeah, maybe your ball gets cut too short at some point, but that's relatively few balls compared to all the other balls. And then also for that ball, if you wait a bunch more steps. If you wait a bunch more steps, now that lower bound is much smaller because it's and so now it's actually the right size again. And so you have this sort of you know, you have to play a little bit with flexibility in time and space, and then you can adapt a Bone argument. Yeah, absolutely. But that's a much longer path. This one is easier when we have the spectral gap. Yeah. But you're right. That's what we had to do for the T equals zero case. Yeah. Okay, good. Any other questions here? Questions here because I'm about to move to the TQL zero case, in fact. Okay, so that's all the nice case where everything works, right? That's the geometric potentials, t greater than zero, spectral gap, sort of some simpler set of assumptions, and nice, I think, strong set of results in terms of, you know, equilibrium states, exponentially mixing, Bernoulli. Exponentially mixing, Bernoulli, and differentiable value. I mean, so we prove actually that that pressure function that I showed you earlier is analytic on that interval, zero to t star. So now t equals zero. What's the, this is the bad case, right? So second, am I hopefully speed up a little bit? So what happens when t equals zero? I want to describe a little bit what you can do even when you can't prove quasi-compactness. So, transfer operators are not completely useless if they're not quasi-compact. They can still tell us something. And so that's this example. Okay, so cow is just the distance from x to tx in your billiard table. So it's the minimum flight function. And of course, you can view. So, I mean, of course, the billiard is first divided as a flow, and then we take this point-gray map, but you can also. And then we take this point-gray map, but you can also view it the other way around. You have this map, and then you can view the flow as a suspension, right, with this root function tau. And so, a Bram of Sword kind of tells you how entropies are related there and how to get an invariant, you know, translate between measures on your section, right? That's the phase basically map. And then you basically just, I mean, there's nothing happening in that time direction between collisions, so you just, you know. Collisions, so you just uniform in the time direction with the right normalization that becomes an invariant of the measure of the flow, and the entropies are related like this. And so we want to define a new P of T, which is the same as the old one, but we're just changed this from the unstable Jacobian to pow now. So it's a new family of right pressures, so in function. And say definition for equilibrium state. We want things that attain the supremum. Supremum, right? The supremum, right? That's missing. That's the soup. Right. Okay. And of course, this family also contains the MME, if you look at t equals zero for the map. And if you look at t equal to the topological entropy of the time one map for the flow, it also contains the MME for the flow, if you can get it. So it has kind of both MMEs. And that's a good reason to look at it, right? And that's a good reason to look at it, right? I mean, the other one we could also look at as kind of some kind of limit of the geometric family. But here, since they kind of use the same techniques, well, you'll look at both of them as elements of this family. So we're going to have a similar definition for topological pressure for this function, but no homogeneity strife. Because our transfer operator, as we see, is going to kill any stable Jacobian. So if we cut our space into kind of Cut our space into countably many strips, our pressure would be infinite, infinite at the first step and infinite at every step. So we can't do that. So we're just going to take M0N, just the finitely many components created by the singularity set Sn, and add the contributions of the pressure, right, at this potential weight, essentially, over all those finitely many elements. And this is now a piecewise holder, right? Tau n is piecewold. Piecewise folder, right? Tau n is piecewise folder, it's folder continuous on each element, an each domain of continuity for t to the n. So tau n is just going to be the ergodic sum, right? The first n steps. And again, by subadditivity, you have that the limit p star of t exists. So I know I'm using the same notation here. I hope that doesn't create too much of a confusion. I'm calling still u and t and still p star p, but instead. But instead of the stable decoding here, we have e to the tau, right? When t equals zero, we're just counting the cardinality of these sets, right? Just the cardinality of the domains of continuity for t to the n. And so that is going to give us what we call the topological entropy of the map. So the strategy is the same. We want to get uniform exponential bounds on Q and T, and then you parry our And then do the parry argument here, constructing the equilibrium state out of the left and right eigenvectors for the transfer operator. This is our transfer operator. Notice this is the case t equals zero from the geometric family. And so that's the worst case, because when we change variable, what was our change of variables thing, right? We had we ended up with this kind of stable Jacobian to the power of e. But when t is zero, that means this is gone now. So for every one of these operators, So, for every one of these operators, we won't have stable, which means we won't have any chance at a one-step expansion. So, we won't have any exponential contraction. And then we added a root function. So, this is like just a weighted transfer operator, but not a worst case for the potential there. The stable Jacobian kills every bit of contraction. And that's the failure of the spectral gap. And so, what do we do? Well, we still want to look at Well, we still want to look at how short pieces and long pieces carry these weights, right? So same kind of definitions we had before. This is our nth generation at scale delta of stable, right? Same as before, local stable manifolds, right? Is our ZWS. We look, we pull back n steps, but now not subdividing by bandy strips, just finitely into many pieces. That'll be the nth generation. Generation with back end steps the short ones things that are length less than delta over three and you want to compare the sum over all pieces versus the sum on the short pieces. So here just going to introduce some some just some notation right so just call this thing this nth generation with this t is just going to be the sum of that weight right summing over the nth generation those weights and the s and w t is also the same. S and Wt is also the same. Again, when t equals zero, you can think about it. We're just counting partialities, right? Because the weight is just one then for every n. And so this is a bit of a simplification, but basically what we want to know is just as we did before, so we give this a name. If we have small singular pressure, we call this what we say if we have small singular pressure. If basically, Um, if basically for any epsilon, we can make the sum over the short pieces at some epsilon part of the sum over all these right, these weighted forms, and we need kind of an extra condition of this summability. Again, if the pressure is positive, then this parameter denominator is helping this series to converge. If the pressure is negative, then obviously there's a competition between those two. But if those things are, I mean, If those things are, I mean, that I'm just sweeping some things under the rug, but basically, that's the idea of the small singular pressure. You see, it's very similar to what we had before in terms of the growth levels. But now we kind of think of it as an assumption. So this is really a property that formulation, I would say, that Jerome Carrand used in his thesis when he is generalizing the work we did at t equals zero. Because the idea is that if you have this problem. That if you have this property, you can actually prove a lot of things about the operator, and so it becomes a game of for what t can you establish this problem. We know we could do it at t equals zero, and so but not satisfy not satisfied at t equals zero if you want the enemy for the flow, you have to get it for much bigger t. Okay, so anyway, so that's why it's kind of formulated a little differently here as an assumption, and then we have to brought a proof that it holds for enough t. Since we don't have the one-step expansion, we go back to a much previous. Go back to a much previous bound, right? Much older bound on linear complexity, Judy Bonimowicz. And so, if you look at, if you call n of s n the maximal number of curves of the singularity set at time n intersecting at one point, it turns out that that grows at most as a linear function of n. And the nice thing about linear is that it's less than exponential, right? So that means that we have this lambda to the n things. That means that we have this lambda to the n things growing at a rate lambda to the n, right? And but getting cut more or less at a short enough scale at length at some rate that's linear or at least as slow as you like in terms of exponential rates. And so that's hyperbolicity beating complexity. All right. So that's kind of an important aspect here at this point, once you don't have to save the code anymore. So why do we Anymore. So, why do we have this SSP? Is that once you have this small singular pressure, it implies those growth lemmas, they analog to the growth lemons that I showed you earlier in terms of long pieces dominating short pieces. And so you get the kind of uniform estimates we had before, which is kind of one thing you want to do, right? The sum at the nth generation, right, of whatever t is should be bounded uniformly above and below by the global pressure, qmt. And then qm. QNT. And then QNT itself is again subactivity. The lower bound is trivial, but the upper bound doesn't have any sub-exponential correction. And then putting these two together, you get that each curve is growing at a uniform exponential rate, the pressure on each curve. So that's kind of, that's really Karan's generalization that's in his thesis: that once you assume SSP, you get all these very nice uniform growth rates. Leaf-wise, right? And the idea is the same as before: once you have long elements in one direction, long elements the other, you get them to intersect, and they're going to have the same rate of growth. So that's it. All right. So as I said, we know that at t equals zero, right, that this small singular vector holds. And of course, by a perturbative argument, you know that it's. By the perturbative argument, you know that it holds for small positive t, but you'd like to get it all the way up to this topological entropy of the flow. And so, while that might not be so small, right, you don't know how big that is. So, you'd like to get it on that whole interval again, right? Like before it was 0, 1 for the geometric family, but here it's some number. That's the topological entry of the flow, and you want to get that full interval. So, we do it kind of by argument by contradiction. Suppose that you Suppose that you can't get all the way here. You know that you have some interval, including zero, for which this SSP holds. So suppose it ends somewhere short of this horizontal intercept that you want. And you can kind of leapfrog. You can use the convexity of this function to leapfrog over using kind of a lower bound. So you pick some kind of point S1 and T1, bracketing T0, and then use the Getting the zero, and then use the fact that you have a subtangent, right? This kind of this derivative here, because the convexity is going to lie below the curve. So you get kind of a lower bound as long as you pick your theta to be, I mean, here we're using the fact that the slope, you see the fact that tau has a minimum and a maximum means that you have an upper bound, a lower bound on the slope of this thing. And so because you have a minimum slope, you have some rate of contraction basically that you have, you have like a little bit of error. That you have, you have like a little bit of error to play with, and so you can choose some brackets so that this derivative is just and kind of misses one by something very small, smaller than the minimum slope. And so, right, so once you do that, you have SSP here, and you can use it to get lower bounds on rates of growth of your factor in terms of this derivative, and that gap then will give you. gap then will give you this lower basically a good enough lower bound so that you can show that ssp also holds at t1 but t1 is greater than t0 so it must have involved that ssp ended at p0 and so just by this kind of convexity argument just leapfrogging it's kind of a holder inequality you can just push keep pushing and pushing and pushing as long as your pressure is positive you can just keep pushing past pushing past and so you get to the fact that SS The fact that SSP must have been holding at here, all the way up here, and that's what you want, right? You want to know that, and so that there you can get all the conditional results of Quran that then follow, and you get exponential, uniform exponential growth rates for all those quantities. And that means for all your transfer operators, you're going to have any non-control. All right, so. All right, so that's true apart from one small lie, and that is that at this point, if you really define the transfer operator, I mean to get the inequalities we want from the transfer operator, which are not real solidarity inequalities, we need an extra assumption on the billiard map. So here, and we call it sparse recurrence to singularities. So this is true in t equals zero, and it's true for all the range. True for all the range of t that we want, we have to get some extra assumption somehow to make up for the fact that we don't have the spectral gap. So you pick some n0, some orbit length, so n zero collisions, and you pick some angle, pi zero close to pi over two, right, close to tangential. And then S0 is going to be the frequency, the smallest number of nearly grazing collisions along every orbit segment. Along every orbit segment of length n zero. Right? So if the collision angle is at least five zero, so at least that close to tangential, then we count that as one of those. And so S0 is kind of a frequency between zero and one. The finite horizon condition guarantees that you can always choose n0, n phi zero, so that s0 is smaller than one. S0 is smaller than one, and maybe you can choose it quite small. So I'll talk about that a little bit later. But in any case, it's always some parameter less than one. And the assumption for the math enemy, if you just don't want the case t equals zero, is that the topological entropy has to be bigger than S0 log two. Where the log two comes from is that near tangential collisions, stable manifolds mapping backwards grow at most like square root. row at most like square root of their length and so if you concatenate this along an orbit you're going to get powers of this right square root i mean powers of one over two right in your exponent and that's where this rate comes from so that's what you have that's kind of the local expansion that you want to beat with your global cutting like kind of the glob global growth and complexity so that that's really the dominant thing you see um and so so that's enough So that's enough for the t equals zero. And now we want to generalize this for greater than t, we need to actually strengthen this condition a little bit. We're going to make it that the topological entropy of the time one map will flow, which would be like h star, but then times tau min should be bigger than s zero log two. So that's what we need to do. And this is strictly stronger than the other assumption. H star is bigger than s zero log two because this function p star plus function p star plus p tau min is decreasing and so if you assume this you're essentially assuming it at the value of t where we want it right and so actually since it's decreasing it implies that this is bigger than s zero log two for all t to the left of it and also and in particular one value t to the left of it is t equals zero and so it apply the previous assumption so so this is just we're kind of you know substituting the previous assumption Know substituting the previous assumption for the map MME with this assumption, but then once you have this one, it implies both. So I'll say a little bit more about this S0 and the fact that generically this is not a strong assumption. So generically, this is expected to be true. Always. Or maybe even just always. Okay, so we have some box bases, right? Spaces, right? In the usual kind of setup, strong space in the weak, the unit ball of the strong is compacting that in the weak. And there are space of distributions, but you can, I mean, certainly C1 is in there because we take the completion of C1 with respect to some norms. And then they are also contained in some, you can think of it as some dual of some holder continuous functions. That's the C alpha of M star. So they fit inside something, but they're sort of adapted to the dynamics. And under this assumption, for the both the map and the flow, we get this type of inequality, which the first two look okay. You get the weak norm kind of growing like the spectral radius that you want. You get the strong stable norm that this strong norm can have two components, some along kind of stable direction, unstable direction. The first one is contracting nicely, so that's like a good Lesodi-Yargin quality. That one is really bad, there's no contraction, and that's. Contraction. And that's because we couldn't use much in any strips. So instead of getting scalings where you get a log holder control, I mean a folder control, we get something like log epsilon to some exponent. And that's too weak to get a contraction. It turns out that contraction goes to one when you have, because then you have to take some sup over epsilon. You have because then you have to take some sup over epsilon, and that goes down a little. So, there's a kind of correction in the in the in the norms to make it kind of a logarithmic modulus of continuity. And with a logarithmic modulus of continuity, you can't, you don't get a spectral gap. So we don't have quasi-compactness, but but we do have all those uniform estimates on these growth rates, right? And so at least tie into these norms. And so, in particular, we know that the We know that the spectral radius grows at least as big as right kind of at the right at the right rate, right? So the upper bound tells you that your spectral radius is at most e to the p star, and this lower bound tells you that it's at least e to the phi star. So, well, it's e to the p star. And these uniform lower bounds mean that you can do averaging things. And you know that the limit point you get at this average is not zero or infinity, it's something. And for this, you use the fact that you're going to be able to do that Uh, and for this, you use the fact that the again this unit ball in the strong space is compact in the weak. So, if you take a sequence like this normalized by the perspective radius, it's going to have a uniform bound, a sequence of functions that have uniform bound in the strong norm. So, there's a sub-sequence that converges in the weak, and that will give that a name, new t. And then, of course, you have to prove that such a limit point is a measure rather than just a distribution. Is a measure rather than just a distribution, but anyway, there's a candidate measure, and then you do the same thing for the dual, and you again get a measure, and then you pair the two. And why should the two make any sense while paired? Well, again, the uniform estimates you have show that they are well defined as a measure, the pair is well-defined as a measure, and it's not zero, it's not infinity, so that you can normalize it and make a problem as a measure. And so, this is kind of the analog of the parry thing, right? It's not. Analog of the parry thing, right? It's not necessarily an eigenvector in the strong space because it's just a measure in the weak, but still it actually is you can show that it's an eigenvector in the weak space. And that's enough. And yeah, so you have the, you do have it is an eigenvector in weak spaces. And so you have invariant measure. So that's your candidate for the equilibrium state. So it's an element of the weak space. So in principle, you don't have this kind of control on the this kind of control on the epsilon neighborhood of the singularity set comes from being an element of the strong space. So that's part of the strong norm. The weak norm is just like some integral on stable curves. So at first you look at this and you're like, well, this is no good. I just have this measure, but I have no idea what I can do with it, right? I don't have any properties. It's just in the weak space, which is pretty weak. Just in the weak space, which is pretty weak. But it turns out that it's much nicer than just an element, an average element of your weak space. And as an analogy, you can think of if you take a sequence of C1 functions, right, say on the unit interval, and then, okay, you know that it's compact in C0, so you get some sub-sequence converging to a continuous function. But that limit point is much better than just your average continuous function, right? If you take a bounded sequence in C1. Sequence in PC1, it's got to be at least Lipschitz. So that's that's that's really nice, right? Now you have Lipschitz at the function. So, yeah, maybe it's not differentiable, but it has much, it has a lot more regularity than just the weak norm might indicate at first. And that's the same thing that's going on here. If you just change the class of test functions, you can get estimates like this because you have uniform estimates like this along the sequence. So it asks. The sequence. So it passes to the limit points. So you have, up to just changing a little bit the class of test functions, you have essentially an element of the strong norm, or more or less. So you get bounds like this. And that tells you that it's enough to tell you that you have stable and unstable manifolds of positive length. So okay, good. So you have the measure is hyperbolic. Awesome. Then a little bit more work, and you can get absolute continuity arguments, right? Once you know the measure. Absolute continuity arguments, right? Once you know the measure is hyperbolic, you can make cantor rectangles and you can look at the holonomy map sliding between unstable manifolds and your cantor rectangle. Now, of course, it's not a full rectangle, right? Because at any length scale delta, the set of points that have stable and unstable manifolds, at least delta, is just a cantor set. So, but still, with restricted to that cantor set, you can still slide along the manifolds that are long, and you can show that this holonomy map is. This holonomy map is absolutely continuous and has a Jacobian that, you know, is actually a holder continuous Jacobian. So you have control as right, that's the thing. You need the Jacobian to approach one at some rate as the two unstables get close, or as the two stables get close. And then you do a local ergodist. I mean, then now you can run the Hopf argument, right? Locally, almost every point in the canted rectangle belongs to the same ergonomic. To every point in the cantor rectangle belongs to the same ergodic component, our map is topologically mixing, so we can have these cantor rectangles see one another, and so you get ergodicity. In fact, you get any power of t is ergodic with respect to these measures. And then more stuff you can do that I'm skipping. I mean, you can prove then K-mixing and then from K-mixing boost to Bernoulli. So you have that kind of classical path open to you now once you get that absolute continuity argument. Okay. Okay, so you have a whole bunch of ergodic properties that you can prove. And now, of course, the entropy and the entropy argument is just the same as before. You can do an upper bound. And then you use Bryn and Katak. And that gives you, right? That gives you that the pressure is at least as big as P star, but the other way around is trivial. And so you have equality. So the argument at this point, this is a very robust argument. You don't need any spectrogap stuff going on. And again, the upper bound is very robust. Bound is very robust. The extra cutting due to singularities doesn't bother you at all. The nice uniform hyperbolicity is all you need to get that upper bound. So great. So we've got an equilibrium state for each one of these. And so just to kind of wrap up the statement, under this assumption, right, H top of the time one matter of flow, time count is bigger than S0 log two. We have a variety of principle. We have unique nuclear equilibrium. We have an equilibrium state, which is okay. We don't have a rate of mixing because we didn't get a spectral gap, but we have Bernoulli property, right? It's positive on open sets, so fully supportive on your space. T adapted means that the integral of the distance to the singularities is finite. A log of the distance to the singularities is finite, which also means in the fillier case, integral of the log of the derivative is finite. Okay, and then Okay, and then so of course t equals zero that gives you the MM, right? T equals zero gives you the MME for the map. The other endpoint, t equals h top of i1 gives you the mme for the flow. And that's a that's a corollary of it's and this theorem it's really as I said it's before it's really a combination of things. First we did the case t equals zero, then Jerome did the conditional results in meaning XSP, and then we extended and make sure we could get all the way out there. Sure, we could get all the way out there having a joint project three of us together. So that's kind of the summary there. So, that's that's kind of what you know, what can you do when you spectrogap fails? Well, pretty much an analogous set of results minus the rate of mixing. So, I just want to say a couple words about that, and in particular about this assumption that we had to add that the topological entropy rate times L min bigger than S0 log two. Zero log two. So remember this, yeah. This could be a totally stupid thing, but the S0, is that the finite horizon? Is that this finite horizon assumption hiding in S0? It's hiding in the fact that Sn is finite for each n. So S0 is just the top boundary here, and it's the union of the top and bottom boundary. No, no, I'm sorry, different S. I mean S0 times log two. Oh, top banner. Well, in principle, in infinite horizon, S0 could be one. And in finite horizon, it's always even always used as less than a longer. So it is related by that is a relative horizon, but I'll tell you that a lot more stuff goes wrong. stuff goes wrong. So S0 equals one, you've been horizontally. Yeah. Because so what's essential in the finite horizon, what we're really looking for there is that Sn, the singular set at time n, is finite for each n, and therefore the domains of continuity for tn is always finite. Once you go to infinite horizon, that is immediately false at step one, you automatically have kind of The question is: Is the pre-image of a stable curve, right, stable manifold still bounded by W to the one-half? So this bound that we used before in the infinite horizon case. Right, that was a question that came up, and the answer is no, but the bound is that T inverse of W is bounded by a constant times W to the one-third. So you still have some exponent, right? That's not a problem. The problem is just that what we want to define in sub-large countries is e to the infinity. Find a topological country is immediately infinity. And so there's a paper by Chernov and Trebetskoy from 96 around, or I think late 90s, that says essentially the topological entropy of the infinite horizon lens gas is infinity. And there are measures that have infinite entropy and infinitely eponymous exponent. There are measures that have. Effin of exponent, there are measures that have finite entropy and infinitely effort of exponent, and there's no uniqueness. There, meaning there are multiple measures with those properties, so there's no unique equilibrium state in the infinite entropy case. So, this question was resolved much earlier, 20 years earlier, by Chernobyl Rabatskoy in the infinite horizon case. And the answer is essentially that there are no reasonable notion of equilibrium state or, and there's no reasonable notion of any. Or just known reasonable notion of any, I get it. So, yeah, so it's essential here our finite horizon function. Okay, so but I do want to say a little bit about this, yeah, this S0. So remember this linear bound on complexity due to Bonimovich, that the number of singularity curves intersecting at one point, right, is bounded by a constant times n, right? So it's sublinear growth or at worst linear. There's actually a conjecture that should be. There's actually a conjecture that should be they're anxiously awaiting a proof to be coming out at any moment. It's been announced for some years. I've seen handwritten copies. I believe it's true. And that is that in fact, for a typical planetary failure here, the complexity is bounded, meaning that actually you don't grow, you just, there's some upper bound. And then after that, the same orbit can't. I mean, because for singularity curves to intersect at a point, it means that point sees multiple. means that point sees multiple tangential collisions in its orbit. So what this conjecture says is that generic for generic positionings of the scatterers in some way that you have to interpret generic, no orbit will see more than a finite number of tangential collisions in its for all time, right? I mean, so there's just some maximum number that it will see. Maximum number that it will see. And so, if you assume that that conjecture is true, which I am happy to do, then in a recent preprint with Alexei Karapano, we proved that you can actually choose N0 and find 0 so that S0 is as small as you like. So this condition then is always satisfied for such tables, for any table which has amount of complexity that will necessarily be satisfied because, oh, sorry, this is getting cut off by the Zoom. Oh, sorry, this is getting cut off by the Zoom thing. On my screen, it's not cut off. But you see, no? Okay, sorry. That bottom line says both the map and the flow have a unique one in them because this condition implies, remember, both the condition for the map and the flow. And so if this S0 can be arbitrarily small, then this will be satisfied. So generically, that should be the case. And for any table with bounded complexity, the best room is the case. So that's a pretty So that's a pretty mild assumption. We don't really know. We don't have any examples of tables for which it fails. Put it that way. All right. So some questions. So of course, there are lots of different questions you can talk about. You can talk about what's the rate of mixing. So I'll just do a couple of questions here in the geometric family. Again, the MME for the map is also in the geometric family. So this is one example of one of these measures. One example of one of these measures that we don't have a spectral gap for. So, what's the rate of mixing? Is it exponential or is it not? And so, we have a pre-print, but let's say we have a polynomial upper bound that is given by some power of this, you know, S0 log2 at a polynomial rate of decay. Since S0, again, for generic tables, can be made arbitrarily small, that means that this. Can be made arbitrarily small, that means that this bottom of the power can be made arbitrarily large. So, generically, actually, these proves super bottom. Can you do better than that? Is it actually exponential for some tables? So, I don't know. And that's an interesting question. And let me just say why there might, I mean, for some tables, there definitely is a phase transition in this pressure function that we saw before. Here's our red. And here's our point, like H star here, one if we're in the geometric family. And then, so for some tables, we know that when you have a grazing periodic orbit, this pressure function is infinity for every point to the left of zero. So you go from analytic here to infinity there. And so that might tell you: well, okay, maybe there's not always going to be exponential mixing at that end point. Maybe it really will be a jump. Maybe it really will be a joint. On the other hand, this is maybe kind of fake. So you might say to yourself, well, hang on, that's just because you have that annoying measure supported on the periodic orbit with a grazing collision. What if you throw out those kind of measures, right? Throw out zero entry measures. Only consider measures like Kazakh and Strelsland that have some bound on the measure of the singularity set, right? That's reasonable. And so this is a project that. So this is a project that I was supposed to be working on this week with Von and Ung Kun, two co-authors, and neither of whom showed up this workshop. In which we are constructing measure, a measure that say could be, right, could have some positive entropy, say, and still give infinite pressure for some classes of billiards. So just to show that that jump is kind of real and not just some sort of Just some sort of silly periodic orbit that you can throw out. So that's what, so that's, yeah. So that's one set of open questions there around that: is there really a phase transition? Does that ruin exponential mixing sometimes, even though generically maybe you get super polynomial, maybe even better? I don't know. So there could be just some condition there that's differentiating certain types of billiard tips. You mean if such a thing is not like if If such a thing is not like, if it doesn't have a periodic orbit with the Grayson collision, you expect finite. That's another open question. What does the Apanov spectrum look like for dispersing barriers? Is it like finite and then jumps to infinity if there's a grazing orbit, but otherwise stays finite? Open question. We don't know. Yeah, I'd be interested to know. I could find out, but I don't know. Yep, a lot of good open questions, most of which are not on these slides. On these slides. And then the other side, right? I mean, so we have this P star that we proved for the, you know, when that line crosses, but that's not very optimal, right? That line where that blue line crossed this pressure, because that was that, you know, minus T log lambda. But that point, or okay, that these are then. That's not optimal, right? This is some minimal hyperbolic. That's not optimal, right? This is some minimal hyperbolicity, but that's probably most orbits see something a little bit better than that. And so maybe actually you can push it out. But is there some place where these two things cross and you lose a pressure gap? Or in fact, is the real T star just infinity and you actually have for every positive T, you do have a spectral gap? But we don't know. Right. We don't know if the two things will. I mean, yeah, we don't know how far out we can push it. Yeah, that's what I'll say. Okay. Uh yeah, that's what's what I said. Okay, good, so that's it. So I guess I'll stop there.
