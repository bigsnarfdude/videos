I will talk about the radical fragrance in quantum hydrodynamic theory. This is the outline of my talk. First, I will remain what is quantum hydrodynamic theory, which can be derived directly from time-dependent density functional theory. Then I will talk about the problem of about some functional for discrete. Some functional for this critical frequency, and then the new class of functional we developed some years ago. So, what is the quantum dynamic theory? The quantum theory theory is a method for the calculation of excited states directly from the ground state electronic density. So, this is the flow chart. In general, you start from external potential, you do a constant calculation, you obtain orbital. Calculation, you obtain orbitals, then you do time-dependent DFT, you obtain the density-density response. From the density-density response, you can obtain the induced density from the induced density absorption spectrum. Another part is that from the external potential, you do orbital fi DFT directly, you obtain the density, ground state density, and from the ground state density with the quantum unit theory, you can obtain directly the density. You can obtain directly data sets. Okay, this is much faster than doing all these steps. Of course, the density can be also consumed, orbital free, model density. It doesn't matter for quantum theory, which is the input density. This quantonomic theory is basically the same as time-dependent orbital field of T. However, quantum hydrodynamic theory has been mostly derived within energy. Mostly derived in energy physics and more recently in plasmonics. Plasmonic means for studying large metal nanoparticle. These are some important review about the quantum theory and these approaches. Okay, first, I would like to show some slides to understand how quantum dynamic theory can be derived from time-dependent DFT. So, time-dependent DFT. So, time-dependent DFT, you have a time-dependent evolution for each orbital. No, this is by standard time-dependent Cauchy equation for one orbital. The main point is that you can do a model transformation in which each orbital can be represented as a phase and an orbital density. Okay. Then, instead of treating a real imaginary part. Treating a real imaginary part between phase and orbital density. If you substitute this here, you obtain two equations for the orbital density and for the phase. For the orbital density is the continuing equation. For the phase, it is important that it appears immediately in the Bombay Zagreb potential, which is the fixed derivative of the Bombing Zager genetic energy. Then you do a small perturbation. I mean, you assume that the potential is small, everything the perturbation is small, so you can expand everything in order of lambda, where lambda describes the strength of the perturbation. So you have restored, which is indicated by one here, restored as function, and the same for the effective potential. In the end, you obtain two. In the end, you obtain two equations for the restored inducer density, one for the restored inducer density, and one for the fist order orbit A phase. In this case, you see that here it appears directly the von Wing-Zacker curve, which is the second derivative of the von Wing-Zager kinetic energy density. Then it is important that for finite systems, I don't go in detail for this derivation. I don't go in detail for this derivation. The phase F can be simplified, then you obtain directly an equation directly in the inducer density. Okay, this is a differential equation in the inducer density. You have also this volume circuit camera here. So then, because this is varying for each orbital, you have this J here. If you sum over all orbitals, you obtain the full. Orbitals, you obtain the full induced density, and you obtain an explicit equation for the induced density. And you say that this is an exact reformulation of TDFT. We have not done any approximation. So, if you solve this equation, it's the same that you solve TDFT in Cassida approach, Stendan approach, in Fanchu, whichever method. This is another version of TDDFT, but it's interesting because this. It's interesting because this is a differential equation, okay? And this is what is called, let's say, this is called also steven-man approximation, but this is exact. Then the approximation comes when you do an orbital free formulation, because as you see in this part in yellow, there is this index j, no, that means some that consider each orbital. That considers each orbital on its own. Instead, in the quantodynamic theory, this equation, okay, you do a Fourier transform of this, there is a dumping, but everything is the same. What is changed is that these terms in yellow becomes this, which is exactly the same, but you remove this J in the denominator and you replace this Homme Zagreb for each orbital. Orbit on this synthetic term, which is also frequency-dependent, and there are terrorists that show that this exists, and the train gives you the same result. Of course, it exists, and the problem is that nobody knows, like exchange correlation function, like the extra genetic, and there are some theorems that exist, and there are some approximations. So, for So, for an implementation point of view, then the quantity domain theory is quite easy because it's a linear equation where you have a matrix A that depends on the frequency. Your unknown quantity is the induced density, and you have an unknown term, which is the external upward potential. This is an integral differential operator, which contains Coulomb exchange H. It can be solved for each fragment. It can be solved for each frequency. So it is embarrassing parallel because you don't have to do one evolution. For each frequency, you can solve it. And you can solve in real space or finite different finite element methods, whichever method you want. So there are already some implementation. And then I told you that directive, because in this equation, the only input is the ground state density and the uphill potential, because also the Because also the disso variable depends only on the ground state density. So from the ground state density, you obtain directly the induced density, and from the induced density, you can obtain just one spectrum. This induced density, this ground state density can be at all concham, orbital-free, analytical. In the next slide, I will focus that N0 is the concham exactly to have some exact compensation. Okay. However, the most critical. However, the most critical part at all is the synthetic energy approximation, because even if it exists, this is operable, nobody knows. I mean, of course, the Gauchama kinetic energy function is known in thermal orbitals. This is the definition, thermal orbitals. Instead, here we know something that depends on the density. There are only two exact functions, which one is the von Benzager, which is exact for one. Benzager, which is exact for one and two electrons, another one is the Thomas Fermi, which is exact for homogeneous electron gas. This is the only exact function which are known. And then you have to do some approximation to work for the system. There are mainly two classes of functions. This class are the non-local function, which are mostly developed for biotic systems. In this case, you build your phonetic functional from. order of synthetic function from the terminus of the literat function and you obtain the synthetic function. And this is there are many functions, conformal and this can be obtained very good result for periodic system. For a finite system, another simple approximation is to work with these semi-local functions, which are much easier. That is just an That is just an answer factor. One of the most approaches is this Thomas Fermi plus von Winzager. I use this convention eta, one over eta. And then so the standard Thomas Fermi von Winzager has eta one, or there is also, for example, the second-order gradient function that has eta nine. Okay, this there are many studies about this. Many studies about this functional in the context of the quantum endodynamic theory. Here, I will focus mostly on metal number particles because these methods work mainly for plasmonics and are not very good for molecules, but for metal normal particles, yes. Then I will focus on this model system, which is a genus sphere, which is a sphere with an homogeneous pergram. Sphere with an homogeneous background, then you can choose the type of the net, for example, when LS is for you are modeling sodium. This is the charge density, if you do a constant calculation, this is the breakground density, it is the electronic density. It is important to see that if we do quantum anonomic theory for the case of just two electrons and we do And we do a quantum named theory with the Bombing Sager functional with this approach show before. As you can see, we obtain exactly to all numeric appreciation we are such a spectra of time-dependent NFT. For example, if you use another function, Thomas-Pherigo means this is shifted because it is not exact. So, this is a numerical proof that really for two electrons, when you have the exact function, which When you have the exact function which is Bogin Zaker, you can reproduce exactly time-dependent DFT. Time-dependent DFT here is obtained by Calcida calculations of the agent value equation. This is a quantum theories of a differential equation. When you do larger systems, for example, this is a large number particle with about 1000 electrons, there is some difference because the time-dependent DFT is shown here. The DFT is shown here. You have several peaks in here now in time-dependent DFT because you are describing all exhibition, single-particle exhibition, all kinds of transition because you have orbitals in time-dependent DFT. Instead, quantum dynamic theory, if you use, for example, this function, you obtain some peaks. Okay, not in because in quantum dynamic theory, you are describing only collective excitation because. Collective excitation because you are removing the single particle orbital with this approximation, you are describing collective excitation. So, these two spectrum seem quite different because this is a log scale with small broadening. However, if you do, for example, large broadening in a log scale, now you see that the comparison being time-dependent DFT. Undevaned DFT, quantum dynamic theory is very good. You see, you describe exactly the position of the plasma peak, which is the main peak here, where you have induced density positive here and negative here. So you describe exactly also the shape. So all the shape you describe exactly. You look also on timing, you know, time-dependent DFT, you will require for this calculation about 2000 minutes. 2000 minutes quantity or you need only 10 minutes, so just to order of speed up. And of course, this is very important when you have to treat very large number. In fact, quantum hydrodynamic theory is used in plasmonics as an alternative to classical electromagnetism. Instead of doing classical electromagnetism, you need to include some quantum effects. To include some quantum effects, you can do quantum hydrology. This is, for example, a small slide about the code. There are one implementation in the FTP, but this is a real time. There are also other implementations again in real time. In the frequency domain, there is this code that I use that I plan to put on GitHub soon. Mostly, there are implementation codes. Firstly, they run implementation in COMSOL, which is a commercial finite element methods with some of three extension modules. And then very recently, we have completed a plasmonics free implementation in FEMIX, which is an open source FEM implementation, where we are going to submit this Discord where you can do FEM for your nanoparticle with For your nanoparticle with axiom symmetric axial symmetric system, and you can obtain all sorts of quantum quantum hydroluminic approximation with different exchange with different symmetric energy functions. Now, let's go to the main topic of the talk, which is the critical frequency. So, let's consider a spherical system because, I mean, all system when you treat Whole system when you treat the asymptotic region, somehow approximate as fair. So, if you have an asymptotic region, you have always that the ground state density decay exponentially, because you solve a Tonshan equation or an oblique equation, the ground state decay asymptotically. Then, if you have a perturbation which is in the double approximation scheme, you have a double excitation. Scheme, you have a double excitation, we can write like this. We have to understand what is this new. Okay, we have to find what is new. Okay, we have to find what is new, and then we consider this time Thomas the von Winzai eta function. Okay. Minzal eta function. Okay, this is a quite complicated quantum domain equation with all terms bounded, but we see that on the left-hand side, we have N1. So, because this is in the asymptotic region, we have two cancer, all terms which decide faster than N1, because this is a differential equation that must have a solution also in the asymptotic. Also, in the asymptotic region. So let's see which are these terms. First of all, this term is faster because it's N0 times N1. This is faster, we can translate. This is the exchange correlation part because the exchange correlation part is also LDA, GGA, or whichever decays like this. And it's also faster than the money. Also, in the decimetic functional, the Thomas Fermi also decays faster. The Thomas Fermi also decays faster, and also we can cancel also this. There remains also only this term, but this term, because it's the total electric field, is faster if nu is smaller than one, because this can be written like this and must be smaller than one. So at the end, there remains only the going zagged kinetic energy theory. So in the R. Sinetic energy term. So, in the asymptotic region, the quantum hydrodynamic equation is very simple, just this equation. And again, you have this volume zagger kernel. The volume zagger kernel can be explicitly written like this. And then, because this is at the end, it's very simple because we have the asymptotic decay of n0 and n1, you know, which are shown on the. Which are shown before. And then, if you put the asymptotic decay here, you obtain this equation that you have this new that are this tendency. Because n1 is here and there, we can cancel, and then we obtain an equation for omega. So, this is really an equation for nu if as a function of omega, which has an aspiration solution, an identical, this one, which is shown in the. This one, which is shown in graph. So, because this is a fourth-order, this is a fourth-order differential, which you have a four solution, but which are plotted here. But everything is normalized up to with this critical frequency, which is shown here. This is in new as a function of the frequency for the For this, but you can see this fourth solution: one is larger than one, but we have seen that this is too fast because new must be more than one. Nu, not that one is less than zero, but this is impossible because it means that the solution is exponentially increasing. It is not possible. So, u remains just for these two solutions, but Solution, but higher than omega c, these are complex, means that the solution is oscillating in the asymptotic objects. It also will be oscillating, which is not okay because I will show you in the next slide. If something is oscillating, then you can some numerical problem. Then you have only these two solutions. The merits up is that to have something very stable, omega must be smaller than omega c. Smaller the omega c it is shown here. So, what happens really in the absorption spectra? You see here, for example, this again is the absorption spectra in log scale for the quantum agronomic theory. This is, for example, the classical solution, and this is the solution. Here, I put all this card because I just changed the simulation box, which is here. Box, which is here. No, because of course, when you do this calculation, at the end you have to put a box, or what you, if you do real space or finite element, at the end the simulation box will end. For example, here is again the spectra, a self-control simulation box. You see, there are all these branches. And if you look at the spectra, you see that if you change the simulation box, which for any simulation box, you start. For any simulation, you start to have oscillation. This oscillation shifts completely. You see here, from here to here, there is a huge shift of oscillation. This means that the associate spectra is stable up to omega c. You see, okay, here you are stable because you have some broadening and that there is some perturbation inside. But the spectrum is stable up to omega c. Above omega c, you cannot compute. I mean. You cannot compute. I mean, you, of course, can compute, but the result depends upon the simulation maps because the solution is complex in the asymptotics and you have all these oscillations. And you can never put the oscillation is going to zero. When the oscillation box ends, it means that you force your solution to be zero. But this is not possible if it is oscillating. Oscillating. For example, here is what happens if you do a plot. You see, now this is the density and this is the solution for different frames. You see, you obtain some solution, and then you start to have some oscillation. The more critical results are when you do system, for example, with rest equals three, because for rest, For a race, equal three. The frequency, the critical frequency, is much lower than the main peak. And then, when you do calculation, you obtain a result of the terminal stable, even for the main peak. Instead, for thumb, for example, the plasma peak was before the beginning of the H. Okay, one short slide about orbital. Slide about orbital free FT because so far we considered only constant ground state, which is the exact ground state to compare exactly with time-dependent FT. And another solution is to do the ground state calculation with the orbital feed FT. In this case, you solve the ground solution. You solve the orbital feed FT ground state. The point is that if you use this function, Is that if you use this functional, this Thomas Fermi-Gonbinzavert functional, the asymptotic decay of the density will change a lot. You see here, for example, this is the conchum decay of the conchamp density. If you use, for example, GA2, you see that the induced ground state density is much more confined. And this has a larger impact on the critical frequency because the asymptotic decay will increase. The asymptotic decay will increase with this fraction of the bond sag, the critical frequency also will increase. And in particular, if you do this self-consistent quantum theory, means that you use the same function for the ground state and for the oxidative state, then the typical frequency assumes this formula, which is proportional to the square root of the fraction of the bonding cycle. It means that large. It means that larger fraction, larger eta, means larger omitac. This explains the success of this orbital PDFT method developed by Tuscano some years ago, where they do orbital 3DFT with the G two approach. You you can see here, no, this is the absorption spectra. Absorption spectra in the self-consistent hydrogenic solution for different eta. This is the time-dependent FTP. You see that at eta9, you have the exact peak, and also there are no oscillations, you see, because oscillations are here. Because in this case, the critical The critical frequency is very high, and then you obtain a very stable absorption spectra, also called instead. If you increase eta, you start to have more oscillations, but also you have a shift of the name. Instead, if you do with a fixed constant density, you obtain that there is a region full of oscillations. region full of oscillations and only with eta one you can obtain a good spectra. If you have eta nine for example with the constant grand state density that the spectra is completely complete because there are all oscillations. Okay I go very fast because time is running out. So because we have this problem Because we have this problem, we need to have a better function, okay? Because this genetic, this thomaspermyjible means I is good, but there are some problems. So we introduced in the last year this Lablaci-led genetic function in which you include also a term that depends on the Labelacian. Instead of having gradient approximation where you have only the gradient, you add also the Labelacian. The Laplacian. This is the full. Okay, this is quite complicated, I don't go in detail, but the main point is that we add this term that depends on the square of the La Bausian. The main point is that you can redo all the proof for the asymptotic decay as we tant independent for the Thomas Felicon Winsak. But at the end, it turns out that because you have this term that depends on Q squared, It depends on Q squared. There are no critical frequencies. So there is no critical frequency because all terms are not depending on the frequency anymore. And you obtain, in this case, six solutions. In this case, for the Laplace-Levi functional, the quantum Levant equation is a six-order differential equation, not for torture. You have six solutions. Some of them are impossible. Possible, you get only this resolution independent reference. And then, this is the spectra you get. You see, even if you change the simulation box, it doesn't change anything. The spectra is completely stable. In this PGSLN, we add a correction for describing vector display peak, which is a second peak that appears in the article, and the decay of. No particle and the decay also is very smooth and very clear. So this is a okay. Then we did some benchmark for comparing all meta-nanoparticle, comparing Losileto strength and the energy for the nanoparticle from 300 to 6000 electrons. At the end, we end up at our functional L as a few million. Has few milliv six milliv of airborne about the main peak, main plasma peak, and also the oscillator strength is very good. For example, in comparison to Thomas Fermi von Vinzag. Thomas Fermi von Vinzag from 18 millib, which is already very good, we can go to 6 millib. From the oscillator strain, we can go to 13 to 2 millimeters. So we improved. So, we improved in these parts. So, in proportion, so quantum hydrolinear theorem is an efficient approach to compute mostly plasmonic excitation because with the genetic function we can have now are working very well for this plasmonic particle. Laplace Levitic and the function represent the current side of the app for semi-local quantum theory for financial. Quantum amplitude for finite system, when we wanted to take care about boundary conditions and so on. Future perspective, what's in progress is one is trying to develop a dynamical kinetic energy function for finite systems. There are only approximation for the mode electron gas. One needs this dynamical for a real finitial system. Or another part. Or another part is to try to develop a new genetic MAB function, MAB with machine learning technique, considering not only the two ingredients so far which have been considered for the ground state orbital field, means symmetric energy potential, but also for the curbing, because for one period, you need only the curb, only the symmetric curve. So from the round state, then From the ground state density and the synthetic energy kernel, you obtain a social spectrum. This is quite more complicated, of course, the kernel, because it can be a two-point function, but this is really the function. Okay, thanks Dr Christian Chilacci for the cosmonautification, Dr Constantine for development of negative functional. Development of negative functional aim for your attention.
