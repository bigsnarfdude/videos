Welcome to the last talk of the day. Doug Devir is going to talk on the component substrate problems for one analysis and he's going to deviate from the model today as you thank you very much for the presentation. Thank you. Thank you, Blani, for the invitation, this conference. I'm going to speak about I'm going to speak about the complementary subspace problem in Buana Claticis. This talk is based on work in progress with Guantanamo Martínez Tervantes, Pedro Trasetti, and Alberto Sabiero Alarjuan. I would like to start with a quoting a Quoting Apir Casaza, Nigel Katona Leosafri in one of their articles, they say, one of the most important problems in the theory of banal lattices, which is still open, is whether any complementary subspace of a banach lattice must be generally isomorphic to a banach lattice. This is the definition of a banal lattice, but I think that we don't need to record this again. And the complementary subspace problem in banal lattices is the question marks. A complementary subspace in banal lattice is isomorphic to analytics. I will fix the terminology that we use during the presentation. By anisomorphism, I mean linear and bijective continuous anisomises. be uh be active continuous and linear mapping between two and a spaces. I wanna assume any lattice prop any lattice property, it's just a linear map. And a complementary subspace is the image under a linear and continuous projection. And I will remark this, I would like to emphasize this because we are just dealing with linear operators. We are not assuming any relation between the lattice structure of our banach lattice and the projection. For example, if we had a lattice homomorphism, then obviously the image of this projection. The image of this projection would be a sublattice. This is not interesting. And for example, if we have a positive operator, a positive projection, then we can define an order in image in this way. The supremo of 2EDNS is the image of the supremo under the projection group. And with these large separations and this renormal, the node of x is the node of p, the node of the modulus of the node of the modulus of x under p. Then we obtain a vana glaci. If we have a positive projection, then we can run over this the image of this operator and we attain. Operator, and we obtain a banana like this. So not our base, obviously. And a natural starting point to think about this problem is to look at the examples that are not banned lattices because many of the or most of the space that we use in banner space theory are banner lattices. Like the the spatial continuous functions or PS spaces. Okay, I I will give some examples of panic spaces which are not panelatic, which are not isomorphic in the sense of panic space. We have this criterion for vanilla lattices when a vanel lattice is a vannal lattice does not contain uh a vanilla lattice does not contain isomorphic copies of C0 and little one, then this space is reflexive. This is true for any vanilla lattice. But for example the J space doesn't have copies of C0 and L1 but it's not, you know, this space is not already dual, but it's not that flexible. So the Flexible. So the gens space cannot be isomorphic to a banana lattice. Another criterion that we could use is that any banana lattice has an inconditional BC sequence. For example, when you have an infinite sequence of disjoint vectors, this is an unconditional basis. This This is an unconditional basis. This an infinite sequence of the joint depths. So every banal lattice has an unconditional basis of course. But for example, the example restricted by Global Samore in 1993 is a space without unconditional basis, so it cannot be isomorphic to analytics. And another useful property is the local unconditional. The local conditional structure. Here I mean the local conditional structure in the sense of world and language. There are several examples of spaces which don't have this property. For example, the space of one deton analytic function in the unit disk or the Calton Peck space. There are more examples. Which don't have this property. The user space doesn't have this property also, but this is interesting the first feature. And the problem is that this criteria don't actually distinguish between banana lattice and Barrel lattices and complementary subspace in banal lattices. Okay, so those criteria are also true for complementary subspace in banal lattices. So these examples are not isomorphic to complementary subspace in banal lattices. Free-band analyticist provide a criterion which is not A criterion which is not very easy to handle, but uh this criterion allows us to distinguish between banner lattices and complemented sign space. A banana space is complemented in a banach lattices if and only if it's complemented in its free banner lattices. And we have that a banner space is isomorphic to a banner lattice. Isomorphic to a banana lattice if and only if there is an ideal containing spree banal lattice such that we can decompose its free banal lattices into a diagram between this ideal and the canonical copy of x, the free banal lattices. But this criterion is not very easy to handle. But in some cases, for example in We have another version of the SP or CFK spaces. A Maraek space is isomorphic to a CFK space. I mean a space of continuous function in a on a compact Hubsor space with the the norm of the super. Of the scroll. If and only there exists an idea in the space of continuous function in the unipode of the dual with the Wiggle topology. So this is a compact. Such that. We have this decomposition. But in this case, the ideas are, in the case of C of K space, the ideas are sets of zeros. So it's an easier case, I mean, I think. It's an anonymous material. But But the problem is that in free banana lattices we don't know our ideas. So this is not very easy to apply. And now I'm going to record some answers and some questions about this problem which are well known in bio-space theory. Space theory. For example, every one complement subspace of an L P space is isometric to an L P space when P is selectively smaller than P, obviously. But this case is very different from the general case of a complementary service process. Because, for example, we don't know if every complementary subspace of a capital L1 is isomorphic to literal L1 or capital L1. It's a very famous conjecture in Manac space theory. But in the contractive case, the case is completely solved for any necessary space. Another answer is that every one complement is a space of a separable. This is very important. C of k space is isomorphic to a C of K space, and this is a resolute engine. Whereas we don't know if every complement is subspace of C01 is isomorphic to a C of K space. This is another feminist conjecture. And in the complex case, I will And in the complex case, I would like to mention also uh the theorem of Calton and Wood. Every one one complement is a space of a space with one unconditional basis. Also has one unconditional basis. This is false in the real case. You can even give an example in finite dimension. But we don't know if every complement is of a space, of a space with a condition. Of a space with unconditional basis has unconditional basis in general, in the complex and in the real basis. This question or an answer. And another problem which is still open is, for example, in capital F for P between one and infinity, P is configured two, obviously. We know that there are uncontrollably many mutually non-isomorphic complementary subspace in capital L T. But we don't know if there exists a continuum of complementary subspace in capital L T, mutually non-isomorphic. For example. And we don't know either if every complement is a. if every complementary subspace of capital P has a conditional basis. Or even if every complementary subspace of capital P is a vanilla latitude. We don't know these questions. And it should be recently Gergos Plavanika and Guercos Algero have constructed a a counter example to the example to the expature of a complemented subspace problem in C of K space. They gave an example of a complementary subspace in a C of K space which is not isomorphic to any C of K space. And Montaro Martínez Hervantes, Alberto Salve, Pedro Trate Tiana have observed that this example is Sample without any change. Cannot be isomorphic to analytics. This question can be simplified, as we will see. We just need to solve that. Show that PS2, this contact sample, is not isomorphic to an astral M space. We just need to prove that, which is much easier. So I will show this. PS2 is complemented in a C OK space. So this space is an script L infinity. Complement is a space in in script L infinity in In a script an infinity or in a CFK space, are again a scriptal infinity space. And I recall here the definition of an asynchronous space. The norm of the supremum of two positive elements is the supremum of the norms of these elements. This is a submen space. And Carcutani characterized this class of... is a class of spaces as they are exactly sublattices with C of K spaces. Can be identified with sublattices of C of K spaces. Now I will try to justify why if PS2 were isomorphic to a banana lattice, then it would be isomorphic to an isotopic space or a Space or an AM space. And this is a consequence of theorem. If we have a banner lattices, which is an explicit one space, then we can renovate this banner lattice and we obtain a capital one space for one space. We found the idea of the proof in an article of Agramobita and Mortac, but was the idea of this ubernorm, but we haven't found a proof of this fact. To prove this, you have to use the You have to use the the renovum is natural in certain sense. For every element in our banana lattice x, we define this renormal. There is a typo here, the supremus of the all possible sums of the nodes. When we decompose X into the joint x into disjoint elements, into a finite sum of disjoint elements. Yes, yes, this is clearly an A-L-null, a null which is additive in the positive elements. But the proof that this is a null, not easy, and is not trivial. You have to use Grotenby inequality You wrote in the inequality twice and you obtained this estimation, this relation. But this is the idea. For exam uh for example, for okay, well I will I will say some consequence of this theorem. This is the theorem. And the first corollary is that if we have a banal lattice, which is unfair infinity, then the banal lattice lattice is morphic from the second phase. This is easy to prove. You have two batch two duals. Okay? Uh the dual of our banner lattices will be a banal lattice is an skeeper one space, because the original space is on skeeper infinity. So we can renormal the dual of the van lattice to be an A L space and then the bidual of an A L A L space is a C of K space And as a banana lattice is the canonical embedding of X into its bidual. It's a lattice embedding. And this is a subset of the space. So X can be written out to be a standard K space. Another consequence is that If we have a complementary subspace in capital 1 or a capital 1 minute space, which is isomorphic to a banal lattice, then this parallel lattice has to be isomorphic to a capital 1 space. This is easy to prove, this is another consequence of the theorem. Another corollary is that we have Is that if we have a separable complement subspace in a C of K space, which is isomorphic to other lattice, then it is isomorphic to a C of K space. If we have a separable X has to be a script and the X is a X. Has to be a script of infinity since it's complemented in a C of J space. And as it's isomorphic to a banner lattice, then X is isomorphic as a banal lattice to an assault name space. And uh bendy mini proof that set verbal assapp name space or M space or more general T space are isomorphic to C of K spaces. The key here is that X is separable. So by me a mini is isomorphic to a C of K is this the essential. But this is the essential part. It's a two-piece problem. Another consequence is that if the complementary sub-space problem had a positive answer in the separable setting, we would have an affirmative answer to these two famous conjectures that I mentioned before. Every complement is subspace of capital. Every complement subspace of capital 1 would be isomorphic to L1 for capital 1. So this is a consequence of corollary 2. And a consequence of corollary 3 is this. Every complement is subspace of C01 would be a small class of k space. And now I go to uh Now I'm going to because some definitions that we need to describe the space constructed by Gerboros, Klobanika, and Bertha Salge. We say that a family of of subsets of omega is omega I will omega stands for uh the natural numbers here. The natural numbers. Here, I use the discountation. A family of subsets of the natural, so omega, is said to be almost easier if for every pair of elements, this inter elements, we have that the intersection is finite number. And the Junction lines are space associated to an almost unique family is defined. as the closed linear expansion of the natural numbers, or the characteristic functions in natural numbers, the characteristic functions in elements of the almost joint algebra, and the unit in addition, the constant unit. This is the junction that. This is the Jamie Desphase associated to anonymous agent family. And if we denote by U sub A, the Boolean algebra generated by the elements of A and the neutral numbers in the power of omega, then the Junction Lines are space of this family can be identified as the close. As the close occurrence of the simple functions in u sub a it can be shown that the junctions are linear star space of an almost exact family. In the subspace of an almost different family, is isometric to the space of continuous function of the ultrafilters of the algebra UY. The dual of the Johnson Lindley Star space is always a little L1 space. So this compact space is always a display. dispersed the uh dispersed or comple scatter compact uh and the dual can the dual of a junction lined the subspace can also be identified with the finitely additive measures in the algebra generated by A. And I'd run numbers. This letter sensor. Since uh a U is an A. This is uh the algebra generated by the elements of the family. I'll write in this this letter. This letter denotes the anti-marginality by the elements of the almost region family and the natural numbers, the form of omnipotence. Another definition I will use is cylinder a cylinder in only a only a times 01 or I will use also this notation is a set of this form a times 0, 1 with a being a subset of the natural numbers and these authors build two almost these families in omega sine 01 of cardiac. Sine 0, 1 of cardinality the continuum such that the first family is actually an almost design family of omega. It's an almost design family of omega. The second family, D is an almost Asian family. This is almost easy family of uh the power of omega times two, okay such that the elements of this one the elements of of the family b0, alpha b one decompose each cylinder. Compose each siliner associated to A alpha or Realpha in this way. For example, if we take one A alpha king in the family A. It's a subset of the natural diverse. For example, it has this form. Then we consider it's Then we consider its cylinder. This alpha times two copies of this set as this form. And B zero alpha and B one alpha are sets, for example. Could be. For example, could be B B zero alpha could be of this form and B1 alpha so this one, see? Or in any fiber we choose one element and in this way we have we Uh we we consider these these elements, okay? V0 alpha and v1. So precisely, uh they they not only verify this this is the journey they also have the property that for any Fiber the intersection between a fiber and this X or D set is one, exactly one of them. I choose one element in each file. And PS2 is the image of the Jungson star space associated to the omniscient joint family under this projection. Pretty exact. This projection is with this. With this definition of with the of with with this almost design families then this Junction with the star spaces is can only be included in this Junction in the star space for it but uh these are exactly the segments which are constant Exactly the segments which are constant in the fibers. We see this spec as a subspace of the usually subspace associated to be. This is exactly the sequence which are clustered on the fibers and PSU space and the And the uh deep space is complemented by any assessments. Uh and this projection as a sense uh leads to this. This is the categorical projection of of the Junction intercepts uh of of the Junction intercepts associated to B to this uh Junction Interstellar space. Uh Jensen in Japan space. And Q is just I minus P and it's this projection, okay, which has norm one. And so the space constructed by Trevanica and Salvella is the complement of The complement of this just on the data space here. So this space is one complement in a C of K space because these spaces are can be identified with C of K space. An important simplification of our problem. Our problem is to determine whether this contra example can be isomorphic to an analatus. It's the following. We have to observe that PS2 is a subspace of little L infinity, okay, because it's a subspace of. Because it's a subspace of a Johnson in the subspace of infinity. So we have a control norming set. L infinity, you have the canonical basis of L1, and this is a control norming set. L infinity. If you restrict the elements of the canonical basis of d to L1 to PS2, then you have a control norm instead. Another property of PS2 is that if one complement is in a C of K space with K scatter, the dual of a C of K space with K scatter is a little L1 space. So PS2 is an isometric pre-dual of little L1. In this junction in the standard space, so it's two parts, it's one connected. In the dual of the John's universal space, which is a detail one space, so we assume it's an isometric pre-dual of little one. With these two properties, we can prove that the following statements are equivalent. It just needs to prove that It just means to prove that PS2 is isomorphic to a banana lattice to prove that PS2 is isomorphic to a sublattice of L infinity. We have also this property that I think that is more intuitive is that there is there is a normal sequence in Is a norming sequence in the unit ball of the dual of PS2 such that for every f in the space there is an element which gives us the modulus of this f. It is clear that this is That this is a standard to prove that 2 and 3 are equivalent for any other space. Since, for example, if you have a normal sequence like this, then you can define this. You send each element of of your vanage space to. your vanity face to its unit under this element. Since this since this the sequence x star n is normal this operator is bounded below because x star n is normal and And uh so the range of this operator is is a a a blank space or it's closed. You have for every f in pin p2 or next if you have a f Or next. This property, this is the same to say that this image is a sublattice. This is the same. For every F, there is an element G, in PS2 plus flat, you have this. This is the same as to say that this is a sublatus. This is the modulus. This is the modulus is closed. I think that it's more intuitive, this third property. So we just need to show the third property. We don't need to prove this. Um this is our the these are the the description of the of the two families that Alberto and Gregor constructed to to provide this contract sample they constructed to They constructed two almost joint families, A alpha and B0 alpha, B1 alpha, in this way. The first one is for my elements of the subsets of the natural numbers, and the second one is for my elements of the natural numbers. Of the natural number signs two. And I will use this notation for every C the continuum V of C stands for the algebra generated by the Fine the this element. L C is algebra generated by the first the elements to the C. And for every C uh More than the continuous, they constructed uh three three sets, okay these sets are infinite sets or infinite sets or subsets of the natural numbers and the difference. And the difference between J0 and A1, and J1 and A2, is also infinity difference or same thing. And B0Z is defined as if the the union of these elements where Pn stands for. That's four and I should put uh PN support P, but this uh PN P sub N is a selection of a natural disadvantage. a selection of a natural number of a number of this in in each fiber we have to decide we have to choose one one element and the end represents these uh sets day zero j1 and day two are constant are chosen in order to satisfy the following properties this is This is very technical, but this is the key of the fruit. I will add the proof to check that PSU reason at a time of fictional analysis. We, as I said, we I said we we just to to prove that for every norm in sequence in the unit mode of the dual of PS2, there is an F which has no modulus with respect to these segments. For every norm sequence in the dual of the unit mode, we will prove that there's we cannot define a modulus. We respect this arbitrary enormous sequence. So since PS2 is complemented in, we have this. We have this IU for this. Then the dual of PR2 is this is uh placeta, then the dual of the of PR2 is isometrically isomorphic to this version between the dual of these. The dual of these space are this annulator and this space, the dual space since we can decompose any any measure in M of B, of the algebra B, can be decomposed. B of the algebra B can be decomposed into a sum of two measures. The first one is in little one and the second one, mu n, vanishes on finite sets and it it is distinct to zero for at most comfortably many bits in the algebra. So in particular, there exists an alpha zero, alph alpha zero. uh as a zero uh such that uh new n is dual from these uh from this element and given that uh a star n plus is our cylinders we have this okay the the part of new n as I said is uh null on finite sets. On finite sets. But since we have this property, we are dealing with a sequence which is in the layer of the suspects. This is the same as to say that this is this. In every set, which has the form of a cylinder. So we have this property. On the other hand, since it starts an organization, we can assume this property. And this is one This is what Alberto and Gerbos call an admissible sequence. A sequence which is a little while also has this property. The infimon of M0 is strictly bigger than zero. This is what I would call an initial second. And uh And uh in the inductive process they encode all the possible uh sequence sequences which has this have this the the properties, okay? They encode this property, uh, this uh this pair of measures, okay. The person of segments of measures, where the first element of the verb is a function which is admissible, is indigenous and has this property. And the second part, nuan, is a sequence which vanishes on finite s and also has this property. It's distinct from zero. It's distinct from zero for the most countably elements in the area. They encode this property, all these sequences, please by means of this inductive process. So we have ID. I won't go into the details, but this given that they're inductive construction, this pair of measures are not B, C minus C separative, which is a technical definition that they use to prove that these modules can exist. I want to find this. And it can be so that this function, function f, which is the difference of these two characteristic functions, which is in PS2, cannot have a modulus with respect to the arbitrary sequence that we have fixed in the part of the hook. But the proof that we have five is almost the same that a virtual and gravous hot plan. You have to do the same things and you arrive at a contradiction. If we if you assume that F has a modulus Modulus, then you approximate by a simple function, and you arrive at a contradiction. If you assume that hypothesis, then you arrive at this one of these pair of families has to be B of C minus C separity and it's the same quota exercise as. the same cotton results as they I would like to end with with some comments of about this example the first one is that it is trivial or it is known that the example constructed by by Plebanek and Samiro is not aiomatic to an astrologian space because if you Because if you have a banana space which is isomer to an asteroid space and it is one complemented in a C of K in a C of K space, sub sigma of K space can be identified as one complemented subspace of C of K space. Uh uh then this is isometric to a C zero space, okay? C0 space, okay? And C0 spaces are isomorphic to C of K space. As Banach spaces are isomorphic. Okay? So we can say that it is known that this space is not isometric to an space, but we prove that it is not isometric. Another comment is that lazy, I think that it is lazy because he I think that it is Lacey because he's in Lacey's book. But I don't know if he is an original version or not. Uh he proved that every C sigma k space, we can assume that C sigma k space are one complete subspaces of C or K sp for K scatter compact, which is our case, and sigma fixed point three. sigma fixed point three without fixed point without fixed points, then this space is isomatically isomorphic to a C of k space. If we represent the space constructed by Levantica Salvadoro as a C map k space, this space has exactly one fixed point, it's the point of the point of point of infinity, the finite infinity, the finite infinity, we're representing this. And it is curious that with only one fixed point, we can give an example that is not even an isomorphic to all anomalies. But if this sigma were without fixed points, then we would have an isomorphic isomorphic, C of the isomorphism. Another comment: okay, the Separato case is still open and we cannot expect to use the same techniques to solve this avaro case because, as I said, one complement subspace in a separable C of G space are isomorphic to C of K space. This is a one complemented subspace in a C of K space, but this In a C of play space, but it's not a problem. My last comment is that with slight modifications we can construct another version of the space constructed by Levantica and Sabello such that its complexification is quite Okay, this the complexification of this space is not isomorphic to a complex banana lattice. This is a standard property. If this were isomorphic to a real banner glattis, then PSU sync the comprehension will be contextualized. Would be a complex isomorphism to a complex. So this is a standard property. But we have to do some slight modification, but the proof is not the same.
