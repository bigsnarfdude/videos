Who is going to speak about stability and index estimates of compacts of compact or non-compact capillary surfaces? Please. First, thank you for introducing me. And I would also like to thank organizers, Professor Depinier, Elizabeth Wenner, Ninja, and Dima Riobogin for organizing such wonderful virtual seminar. Wonderful virtual seminar conference. I really enjoyed it. So, as the last talk today, I will talk about some results on capillary surfaces regarding the stability and MOS index. So, as the title says, we're going to deal with capillary surfaces, both in compact cases and non-compact cases, too. Non-compact cases too. Okay, now let's look at the first part. We're going to deal with compact capillary surface. First, let me give you a basic definition. So we consider a compact three manifold M with boundary. So if any one of you is not familiar with the concept of manifold, just think M as a subdomain, smooth subdomain of R3. Everything we're going to discuss goes through perfectly. So now Perfectly. So now for this manifold M, we consider a surface sigma, compact connected surface in M. We call it capillary if it is a surface with constant mean curvature. And the surface intersects the boundary of M at a constant angle. Okay, the angle belongs to zero and pi. From another point of view, From another point of view, we can define this type of surface from a variational point of view. We can think it as a critical point of a certain energy functional defined like this. So E sigma t is the area of sigma t minus cosine theta times W t. So area sigma, the first sigma t is the variation of the surface. So you can t is the parameter of the T is a parameter of the one parameter family of surface here. So cosine theta is a fixed number, and wt is usually called a wetting area, which I will explain later in the picture. So I say sigma is a critical point of this energy functional among all variations that have same volume function. So when you do the variation to the surface, you don't want to change this volume function. This warning function. So, by definition, this waiting area is defined like this way: by that's the poor bear cost boundary measure to this boundary cylinder. You can integrate it. And the volume functional is defined to be the pullback of the volume element integrated on this cylinder. And X is the isometric immersion of our surface. Version of our surface. So geometrically, if you look at this picture here, so sigma is the original surface. And when you do a variation to the surface, you get a sigma t. So the volume function vt, capital V sigma t here, is just, you can think it as the sine volume enclosed by this two surface. Okay. So when we say volume preserving, we want to make sure this sine volume. We want to make sure this sign volume is zero. And the wetting area is just the area sweeped up by the boundary of the variation. So with this definition, with this energy functional, we can look at its first derivative. Then we get this where no first variational formula this. This derivative at time equals zero is equal to this right-hand side. And here the h is mean culture, u is the velocity function of the variation. And nu here is the normal vector of the surface sigma. And eta is the conormal of the surface. That's the vector field tangential to the surface, but normal to the boundary. Okay, so when we see the variation. So when we say the variation preserves the volume function of Vt, that means when you choose test function, when you choose variation, you have to make sure the velocity function is balanced. So the integration is zero. Because the derivative of volume function is just this integration. Okay, so from this equation, we can see that sigma is a critical point. You already say volume preserving critical point if H is constant C. If H is constant, C and the sigma intersects the boundary at a constant angle theta. So such surface, as I said, are cavillary surface. And in particular, when theta is 90 degree, they are free boundary surfaces. So regarding the existence of such surfaces, I would like to put two comments here. So first one is there is no general, as far as I know, there is no general existence here. There's no general existence theory for such capillary surfaces in general manifold with boundary. But second, the second, but there does exist some infinite many capillary surface in some particular compact manifold with boundary. For example, in the unit ball of R3. And second comment is that when theta is pi over 2 and when the mean curvature is 0, so this class of so. So this class of so-called free boundary minimum surface. So the existence of such class is well studied. Okay, we have a general existence for that small class of capillary surface. But that's not our concern in today's talk. So let's not worry about it. So at the critical point of this energy functional, we can take a second derivative. So that will give you this right-hand side integration. And you can see it's a quadratic form. So we denote it by QUU. So we denote it by QUU. So Rich is the ambient rich curvature in the normal direction. And A square is just square length of the second fundamental of the surface. So you can do an integration by parts. You get the second equation. So before I explain this, what Q is, let's look at the following picture. So this describes a local intersection of the surface with the constraint. So if you think the So, if you think the M as the upper half space, so partially this dotted line denotes the boundary of M, then this negative nu is inner normal, nu is out normal. So, n is the outer normal of m, and eta is the con-normal vector of the surface. And t is the normal vector of the surface of the boundary of sigma lying in the boundary of m so it's a curve in a plan, so it has a normal vector. Curve in a plan, so it has a normal vector. Of course, you can choose t to be this way, but we choose to be this way because we want nt has the same orientation as eta nu. Okay, so the intersection angle, as I said, keeps in the constant intersection angle is the angle theta here. Okay, so then this in this equation, Q is defined to be this way. So it involves angle C. So it involves angle theta and the second fundamental form of the boundary of M in the direction T and the second fundamental form of the surface in the direction of eta. And after you do integration part, you will get an elliptic, you will get a Schrodinger type operator called Jacobi operator. Also, you can also call it a stability operator. So now based on this quadratic form, before This quadratic form, before I define the definition, I want to say that along the boundary of the surface, this Q actually has a relation with the geodesic curvature of the boundary of the surface. So the summation is actually equal to some term that involves the boundary mean curvature of the ambient manifold and the mean coverage of the surface. So this relation will help the calculation in the proof. So based on this quadratic form, So based on this quadratic form, we can define an index called weak index. So it's defined to be the maximum dimension of a subspace of this function space. So the U is balanced inside, in which the second variation of energy is negative. So that's when QUU is strictly negative. Okay. And if the index is zero, we see the surface is weakly stable. So actually this definition is equivalent to the number of negative eigenvalues of falling eigenvalue problem. So in the interior you have a shooting type eigenvalue problem and the boundary condition is a robot boundary condition. So this is kind of standard technique. So this eigenvalue problem also has Also, it has a min-max characterization for its eigenvalues. So the nominal k is defined to be the infim of the radical when you normalize the function u in L2 sense. And u has to be L2 orthogonal to the first k minus one eigenfunctions. And also to be orthogonal to the constant one, that's the balance condition. Okay, so whenever you have a So, whenever you have a function orthogonal, satisfying these conditions, you can plug into Radicusian to somehow estimate the upper bound of lambda k. So now in the first part of the talk, we are interested in get a bound, lower bound for this weak index by the topology of the surface. So the lower bound is a uniform constant C1 times the genus plus another uniform. genus plus another uniform constant times the number of boundary components. So the key point is that these constants are uniform. So once you fix N-B maniford, this index is uniformly lower bounded by the topology. It doesn't depend on the geometry of the surface. Okay, so regarding this question, we have several results I combine here. So let M be a three. Now, let M be a three-dimensional oriented Riemannian manifold with boundary, isometrically embedded in some Euclidean space Rd with dimension D, and for, let's say, for any capillary surface sigma inside, as we defined before. And suppose every non-zero vector frequency in this space satisfying the following integral inequality, then which I will explain it soon. I will explain it soon. Then we have a uniform lower bound for this index. So that lower bound depends on the number of genus, number of boundary components, and the dimension of the Euclidean space Rd that we put our ambient three manifold in. Okay, so now let me explain some notations here. So H sigma partial sigma denotes the space of harmonic vector fields on the surface that are tangential along the boundary. So the Boundary. So the vector fields are tangential to the surface, but when you fix, we move to the boundary, the vector points, you know, along the boundary direction. Okay. Yeah, tangential direction. So here there are a lot of covert terms, which I don't think I will explain one by one. But the key point is that the left-hand side, okay, these cover terms only depend on the... depend depend on the M-B manifold M. This is scalar curvature, right? This is how you this is second fundamental of M-B manifold when you put it into Euclidean space. So it doesn't really depend on the surface. And then the right-hand side only depends on the mean cover H sigma and some angle theta here. Of course, also the boundary mean cover of the ambient manifold. So this integral in condition seems Integral condition seems complicated at the first sight, but it applies in many particular cases, especially in space forms. So this theorem has, this theorem basically answers, partially answers the question we raised in the previous slide, right? With some condition here. So this theorem has a color in it. If you restrict in if you restrict your your your manifold to be uh smooth subdomain uh smooth domain let's say uh the come with this boundary in r3 or s3 then the the integral condition simplifies to this point wise uh condition okay so that is when this the summation of boundary mean culture plus mean culture of surface times cosine theta is non-negative and See that's non-negative, and suppose one of the following conditions holds either mean culture is positive, right? The mean culture could be minimal at the first place, but if it's strictly positive or the boundary mean cover of the ambient manifold is strictly positive at some point along the surface, then we have this condition. This uniform lower bond. So, when CETA is 90-degree, this colour reaction was already obtained by Cavacanti and D. Olivier in, I think, in 2019. But our results, especially the previous theorem, works for domains in general manifolds and actually we get for closed CMC surface. Closed CMC surface. So this kind of lower bounds for the weak index has some applications in isoparametric problem with boundary, which I will not get deep into it today. So now I would like to give an idea of proof. So if you still remember the definition of index, right, it's defined to be the dimension of a subspace in which this quadratic form is negative. So in order to get an estimate for the index, you have to find a good space of test functions. Once you plug into this quadratic form, you get a negative value, right? So that's the basic idea. Basic idea. So we need to find a suitable space of test functions. And the space we use is this H sigma partial sigma, as I explained before, that contains harmonic vector fields, KC, tangential along the boundary. So this kind of idea has been used in other papers, especially for estimated index for minimal. Estimated index for minimal surface. So here we just adapt to CMC surface by some modifications. Of course, there are some difficulties here. So this, I haven't explained what the harmonic here is. It's actually defined to be the Hodgel operation. We use Hodgelopers here. So, but the good thing is that the Weisenborg formula gives you the relation of the Hodge Laplacian and the Eural Laplacian like this way. So it has a Ricci term, okay, because the surface has Ricci culture. But in this case, it's just Gaussian culture. And another theorem, Hauden's theorem, tells us that this space, right now we already have the space, but we so we can use to So, we can use to test this quadratic form. Then we need to know how the dimension of this space is related to the topology of the surface, right? Now, Haji theorem tells that this space is actually isomorphic to the first relative homologic group. And the basic topology tells you that this dimension is actually equal to 2G plus or minus 1. So, that's how we relate this analytical quantity to the topology. Analytical quantity to the topology information of the surface. Okay, so for the rest of three steps, we just need to do some calculations. For example, we need to make sure all the test function in this space satisfy the balancing condition. So the integration has to be zero. So if cassie is a vector field, you choose its coordinates. And I think I have a mistake here because here the Because here the dimension should be the EI is the standard basis of RD, so you should have D components here. So you have to check the coordinates all balanced test functions. Then you just plug in this test function into the quadratic form and by using rank continuity theorem and a contradiction argument, we can get the main statement. Okay. All right. So All right, so let me see. So before I move to the non-compact case, I want to leave a comment here. So our theorem, the idea of the proof only works for two dimension, although all these definitions can be generalized to high dimensions, but our technique only works in two dimensions. So one obvious reason I can tell you is that only I can tell you is that only in two dimensions we can define this dual harmonic vector field. Okay, so in high dimensions, we don't really have an analog for this quantity. So this quantity helps us to eliminate the non-constant mean curvature term. And in minimal case, we don't need to worry about it at all. So that's one reason we can't generalize to high dimensions, at least for now. To high dimensions, at least for now. Okay. All right. Now, for the second part, let's move to the non-compact cabinet surfaces. And for this part, since it's non-compact, we can also study the index theory for such surfaces, but it's just getting harder, right? So let's just focus on the easiest case that when the index is zero, so equivalently, we study. So, equivalently, we study the stable case and can we get some classification result for this kind of surface. So, before we move to our result, let's recall some classic results in history developed by Rick Shong and Fisher Cobury. Okay, so we consider a complete non-compact minimal surface, so the mean culture is zero, sigma. To zero sigma in a three-manifold m and we define the index as follows. So the index is defined to be the limit of the index of the compact subset. Okay, so you can choose this dr to be the geodesk to be the exhaustion of the surface. Okay, so this definition makes sense because once you increase the domain, the index actually also The index actually also increases. So it's a monotone quantity. So this limit makes sense. Of course, it could be infinite. There exists some surface, minimal surface that has infinite index, but we are only interested in surfaces with finite index, as the title says here. So in the compact set set, in a compact subset of the non-compact surface, the index is just defined as before. Defined as before, okay, to be the index of this quadratic form with respect to diriti boundary condition. Okay, so then Fischer Corporate in 1985, she showed that if this surface has finite index, then there exists a positive function u, a global defined positive function u on sigma, and a compact subset C, such that GU is zero. GAU is zero in the complement of this compact subset. So basically, she found an eigenfunction u corresponding to eigenvalue zero. And it's positive. So that basically says that this u is the first eigenfunction because it doesn't change sign. So this u has to be a first eigenfunction. And in particular, And in particular, when the index is zero, so that's the stable case, this compact self-state can be chosen to be empty. So basically, you find a global positive function u that's in the kernel of the Jacobi operator. Okay, it's pretty cool. So with this probability, they showed they get some classification results for minimal surface. So she showed the if So she showed that if sigma is a complete finite index oriented minimal surface in three manifold M with non-negative scalar curvature, then this surface has to be conformally equivalent to a closed Riemann surface with some finite many punctures. For example, the plan is conformal to a cephal, conforming equivalent to Sephiroth with puncture as north pool or catenoid. Pool or catenoid is conformally equivalent to cephalopuncture at two points, something like that. Okay, and in particular, Fish Kirbery and Rick Shun showed that when the index is zero, we know more explicit classification. So the sigma has to be conformal equivalent to either a complex plane C or cylinder. Okay, so we know it's conformal structure. Know its conformal structure. And more importantly, they showed that the stable oriented minimal surface in R3 must be a plane. So this was seen as a generalization of classic Boeingstone problem. And there's some byproducts of this paper. They showed that They showed that if sigma is a complete finite index-oriented minimal surface in the manifold with non-negative rich curvature, so then they show that the surface has finite total curvature. So the total curvature is defined to be the square length of the second fundamental integrated on the whole surface. Priorly, you don't know if it's finite, but she tells that the She tells that if it's finite index, then it has finite total cache. And in particular, if the ambient spaces are three, these two are actually equivalent. And some of these results were generalized by the servia to constant mean culture case. So when H is a constant C, that is not necessarily zero. So our purpose, our, you know. Our purpose, our idea is to get an analogous theory for surface with boundary, with constant theta intersection and with non-zero mean curvature. So we just want to do it once for all. But we have to justify the definitions we define on surface with. We define all surface with boundary. Now, let me give you the definition of index of cavillary surface. So, let sigma be a non-compact cavillary surface in a three-manifold M with boundary. So, yeah, at a constant angle theta. Similarly, we define the index to be the index to be the limit of the index of a Of the exhaustion. Similarly, this definition makes sense. And the index of the compact subset is slightly different from before. So it's defined to be the number of negative eigenvalues of the following problem. So the Dirichlet boundary condition is kind of similar as before. But now we have a Robin boundary condition because that Because our surface, originally our surface has a boundary that lies in a constraint. And when we do variations, we allow the boundary of the surface to freely move in the constraint. So you get this Robin boundary condition. So this eigenvalue problem also comes from a second variation of certain energy function. So, in particular, we define sigma to be stable, actually strongly stable, if the falling quadratic form is not negative. So, the only difference from before is that now we have this boundary term. But this boundary turn brings a lot of difficulties because on the one hand, we don't know if the boundary of the surface is compact. Compact, okay. A second difficulty is that we don't know the sign of q, so it's hard to drop this boundary term, right? Easy, it's not easy to drop this boundary term in the arguments. But anyway, we are still able to obtain similar results. Okay, now for the rest of discussions, I would like to simplify, I would like to restrict this M-bin manifold M to be been manifold m to be upper half space. Okay, so for simplicity. Then we define a capillary surface in the half space with constant angle theta. We see if it's weakly stable, if this quadratic form is non-negative for any compact body function u with this balancing condition. Okay, so. Okay, so here we don't have rich term because the ambient space is flat and the Q just reduces to this term. So one easy observation is that if you consider a half plane, the intersect that lies in the half space with the boundary lying in the boundary of the half space. And you can rotate it to have any angle theta you want. And we can easily. And we can easily say it's weakly stable because the quadratic form above just simplifies to the energy function because for plan, the second fund form just vanishes. So you don't have this a square here. You don't have this boundary turn. So you only have energy. So that's always non-negative. So we are interested in if the converse direction is correct or not. Okay. And on. Not. And honestly, we want to show that weekly stability implies this capillary surface must be a half plan. So you can compare this rigidity result with the one proved by Fisher-Curry and Rick Schoen. So yeah, our main target is to prove the following theorem. So let sigma be the surface we defined and we have assumption. And we have an assumption here. Assume that h sigma times cosine theta is non-negative. So this condition just translates to if mean curvature is zero, we don't have angle condition. If the mean curvature is strictly positive, then angle has to be zero and between zero and pi over two. So with this assumption, we show that sigma is weakly stable if and only if it is half plane. So this So this result I put it here is actually stronger than the one in the archive, in the one we posted, because we realize we can improve it later. So I will prove this stronger version. So in order to prove this theorem, we have to develop some propositions or theorems. The first one is the conformal, you have to understand if Understand if the surface has a finite index, what kind of surface is, the conformal structure. So, this is a long theorem, but it basically says that if the surface has a finite index, okay, has a finite index, and if we suppose the scalar curvature plus the mean curvature square is non-negative, and we also assume one of the following holes, right? One of the following holes, right? Either the boundary of the surface is compact. So the surface is non-compact, but its boundary could be compact, okay, or non-compact. If the boundary is non-compact, then we assume that this summation is non-negative. So if you still remember in the third slide, I said Q plus the geodesic culture is some term, right? It's a term. It's a certain term. This is the turn there, okay? So, if this is non-negative, that tells you the Q plus geodesic curvature is non-negative. And that's what we need in the proof. So, with these conditions satisfied, we can show that sigma is actually equivalent conformally, okay, conformally equivalent to a compact Riemann surface sigma i bar with boundary. And you take a And you take finite punctures. But the point is, the puncture could be in the interior of the surface and it could be on the boundary. That's the main difference from the case without boundary. And each puncture corresponds to an end of the surface. And moreover, we should define it. and moreover we should this finite uh finiteness of this integral so uh in particular if if the surface has is stable okay here if it's stable that means the index is zero uh we can show more okay not only we show it uh it's conformally equivalent to a compact surface actually we can specify these compact surfaces so we we surfaces so we we restrict the possibilities to the following uh to to the following uh three configurations so the first one is uh there are two boundary ends and no interior ends so you can think of a compact surface with two boundary punctures and no interior puncture in the second case that there are no boundary ends and one single interior end okay i will give you some uh I will give you some example soon. And the third case is there is a single boundary n and no interior n. And if the first one, second one holds, then sigma is totally geodesic and a scalar culture zero and the mean culture zero. So this conclusion is not really what we need. Okay. But now let's see. I want to see that these three possibilities. I want to see that these three possibilities could occur. Okay, and now I'll give you three examples. So if you consider a slab in R3, and you consider sigma to be an infinite flat strip in M meeting the boundary at a constant angle theta, right? You can make it as an angle as you want. So this is a capillary minimal surface and it's stable. And this surface topologically is just a disk with two punctures. A disk with two punctures along the boundary on the boundary. Okay, so that's the first possibility. And second example is if you consider this product space and you consider sigma to be this half cylinder at one point. Now, this is the free boundary CMC surface. And you can prove it to be stable because it's totally geodesic. Because it's totally geodesic. So, this surface is actually topologically just conformal to a disk with puncture in the interior. And the third example is quite simple. So, consider a half plane, right? You rotate it to make sure, to make any angle as you want. So, this is capillary minimal surface and it's stable. Okay, so this surface is to volume. Okay, so this surface topologically is just one puncture on the boundary of a disk. So we have all possibilities. But now we want to classify, okay, with this topologic result, we want to classify what is weakly stable capillary. Weakly stable capillary surface in half space. Okay, I only have three minutes. So I will just give you the idea of the proof. So suppose sigma is a non-flat, weakly stable capillary surface in half space. So we want to prove this surface is half flat. So it's flat. Now suppose it's not flat. Then the conclusion just follows. conclusion just follows uh if we can construct a compact supported piecewise smooth function u or leaves function u such that it's balanced and once you plug it in this quadratic form is negative okay right because these two equations will contradict this weekly stability and so the construction basically comes from this conformal structure so if the So, if the surface has finite index, right, because it's weakly stable, so it must be finite index, and then you can find a compact subset signal naught such that the complement is a union of finite many ends. And E1 to EL is just interior ends, E1, E2, E3. And you could have our boundary ends, let's say EL plus 1, EL plus 2. And you have many ends here. ends here. So by conformal structure result we will have a ten before we know that these ends are either isomorphic conformally equivalent to this half cylinder when it's interior ends or it's conformally equivalent to this semi-half cylinder if it if they are boundary ends. Okay, so now we can transfer all the calculations to the to the to the To the cylinders by the conformal invariance of energy. So, this kind of idea only works in two dimensions. Then, yeah, I don't think I have time to go through all the details, but we successfully construct this test function. We find a function u times phi a naught and that satisfy this balancing condition and its compact space. Condition and it's compact supported. And once you plug into this quadratic form, it's strictly inactive. So the key point of this construction is that once you plug in this function into the quadratic form, this quadratic form just simplifies to interior integration. We no longer have this boundary term. That's the key point. We want to drop this boundary turn because we can't control it. So then Okay, so then the calculation just reduces to the calculation on the cylinder, and we can show it's strictly negative. Yeah, I think I don't have time. I'll just stop here. Thank you so much. Okay, thank you very much for this wonderful talk. Please, questions, comments to the speaker? Hi. Hi, Hong. Yeah, if you have the barrier is a ball, so if you consider the capillary non-compact capillary surface outside a ball, so what do we have? That's a good question. Oh, that's that's really good. I guess it has to be a plan. It has to be a plan. Yeah, that's my guess, but I have never thought about it. Yeah, but my guess is it's also flat. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Reasonably. Yeah, that's a good question. Thank you. For your argument, if you consider the ball case, then what the difference? Then, what the difference, just the difference from the Q, right? Yeah, I think that's actually the key point of the proof. So, when it's half space, right, we choose this function u here. That's very special. Here we have an inner product of the normal vector field u with negative U3. So, this negative U3 is the outer normal vector of the half space. The half space. Yeah, it's killing vector. Yeah, yeah, it's killing. Yeah, I'm not sure if you use the position vector field in the ball case, if we can still get the same result. I'm not sure about that, but that's what's trying. Yes, thank you. Thanks. More questions?
