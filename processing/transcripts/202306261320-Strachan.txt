Hi, everyone. Our next speaker and the last one today is Cameron Strechen. Perfect. Hopefully, everyone can hear me in the Zoom chat. Thank you very much for all being here. My name, again, is Cameron Strachan, and the title of my talk today is The Boundary Structure of C Polygons. This was work done in my master's degree, but this is not solely my own work. But this is not solely my own work. This is, in fact, a joint collaboration done with Ilya, who's in attendance here today. So that's great to have him here. And with that being said, we're going to hop into the outline of the talk. First, we're going to start off with some convexity background and terminology. This will be really quick, just making sure we're all on the same page. Then we're going to introduce the kind of general class of convex bodies we're interested in studying the boundary of. These are namely called C polyhedra. The results covered in the slides today here are strictly planar results. Today, here are strictly planar results, though, so we naturally use the term C polygons to refer to those planar C polyhedra. And the general kind of approach here is that we're going to, I'm going to try to portray a big picture idea of kind of the most important parts of the proofs of proving these statements. And then, sorry, an initial step towards this end is first going over the phase structure. We can define kind of a phase structure on the boundary of these convex bodies. We'll hop into the proofs right after that. The proofs right after that. And then finally, we'll discuss kind of the sharpness of the results coverage. The results essentially fall into a category of classifying the complexity of the boundary of these convex bodies. And so by sharpness, what we mean is can we actually find to see polygons that attain this complexity that we bound this class by? So convexity background, we'll go over this really quick for our purposes today. A convex body is a compact convex set with non-empty interior. We use the term convex domain to refer to plan. Convex domain to refer to planar convex bodies. Of course, we're interested in studying the gauss, in studying the boundary of these convex bodies. So the Gauss mapping is, of course, a very important tool. And this is a map from the boundary of C to our spherical space, where each boundary point is mapped to the set of outward unit normal vectors of the supporting hyperplanes of C at this boundary point. It's well known that this map is functional, meaning each boundary point is mapped to at least one point in the spherical space, and it's also surjective. Space and it's also surjective, right? But it may not be well defined nor injective. And when it is, we use these two special terms here: a convex body is called strictly convex if its Gauss mapping is injective, or equivalently, C contains no line segments in its boundary. And a convex body is called smooth if its Gauss mapping is well defined, or equivalently, every boundary point has a unique supporting hyperplane. Given two sets, we define their addition and scalar multiplication in the obvious way, and with this, we can define where the transformation is. And with this, we can define what a translate and the homothet is. Essentially, a translate of a set is a shift by that set by some vector x, and the homothet is, well, a translate that we're allowed to kind of positively scale up and down. So with that out of the way, we can hop into what convex bodies we're interested in studying today, and these are called C polyhedra. These are going to be intersections of other convex bodies, but not any intersections. They're going to be reduced intersections, which are defined up top here. So a finite intersection of sets. So, a finite intersection of sets is called a reduced intersection if, for any index j, when we look at the intersection removing the jth element we are intersecting, we are left with a strictly larger set. And what this means is that every set in a reduced intersection contributes to the intersection, right? There are no extraneous elements in it that we could kind of remove and our intersection remain the same. And so, with that, we can define what a C polyhedra is. Essentially, if we're given the convex body and we let HI denote a homothet of C. HI denotes a homothet of C, then a C polyhedra is the reduced intersection of n homothets, which we require to be greater or equal to two. And we may assume that this has non-empty interior as well. So our C polyhedra is given up here, and essentially it's an intersection of n homothets of C, that is a reduced intersection with non-empty interior. Some terminology about these objects is that we use the term generating homothets to describe the homothets we're intersecting. And when these homothets are translates, we When these homophets are translates, we use the term translative C polyhedra. Of course, there's a lot of motivation behind this definition, right? We're probably all familiar with ball polyhedra. And so this is really a generalization of this notion, right? When C is a ball, these notions align with generalized ball polyhedra and regular ball polyhedra. And essentially what we are asking the question today is how complex can the boundary of these objects be if we know the complexity of the C? If we know the complexity of the C we start with, right? So if we bound C or C has some given properties, what does that say about the C polyhedra we can form with these with this convex body? So our results today are strictly planar. So we're going to be focusing on a C polygons. These are intersections of n homothets in the plane. And we define kind of a naive notion of vertices and edges initially. We'll get to a more sophisticated characterization shortly. But we say a convex C polygon is C polygon is a convex domain, which implies its boundary can be separated into singular points and smooth boundary arcs connecting the singular points. These are what we define as vertices and edges of a C polygon. Yes? These are smooth boundary arcs are going to be essentially we have some singular points on their We have some singular points on our convex body, and these will be essentially boundary segments connecting these singular points that are smooth, meaning that there's no singular points along the way of our boundary segment. Okay, and so our kind of the main theorem that we prove is that if we're given some translative C polygon generated by n translates and some just regular C polygon generated by N. Just regular C polygon generated by n homothets. If C is a strictly convex domain with M singular boundary points, well then the number of singular points or the vertices of a translative C polygon will range between n and n plus m. And for the general C polygons, these will range between n and 2n minus 1 plus m. So I want to kind of, sorry, before I go to that slide, I want to kind of, I've given you. Want to kind of uh I've given you the definition of C polygons where C is kind of an arbitrary convex body, but we see in theorem one that we require C to be strictly convex, and the reason we require C to be strictly convex is, well, really because of the following example here. We see that this is an intersection of two convex bodies, this kind of rounded square. And we see that when we intersect both of these, we can actually form a smooth intersection body from these two homothets. Homothets. With this, we see that the boundary segments are quite not nice, right? We have some boundary arcs that are in only one homothet, some that are in two, but we see that this will be a smooth convex domain. And in this sense, when C is just an arbitrary convex domain, the term polygon might not be the best fit for it, right? Usually we don't think of polygons as smooth convex domains. But hopping into our proof of our main theorem, right, when we're looking. Proof of our main theorem, right, when we're looking at C polygons of strictly convex domains, we have this very important property, which we've called pairwise lemma. If we are given two homothets of a strictly convex domain C, whose intersection is reduced and has non-empty interior, then the number of boundary intersections we can have between these two homothets is exactly two. This is a strike contrast to just general intersections between convex bodies. We can have lots of boundary intersections, but when we are intersecting two homothets, But when we are intersecting two homothets of a strictly convex domain, we can have only two boundary intersections. And an important point is that the kind of two boundary intersections we get will be singular points in the intersection body. Pardon? General is the top one. Yes. Yeah. For home effects, but not for general complex models. So this is a very important property. Is a very important property we have, and with this, we can actually define what you know a more sophisticated example of edges and vertices for a C polygon. We're going to start off with the definition of an edge family. So given a generating homothet Hj of a C polygon H, the edge family of Hj is denoted and defined as the following. And essentially, we look at the boundary of our C polygon intersecting the boundary of our generating homothet. This is really how much does our homothet contribute to. How much does our homothet contribute to the boundary of our C polygon? And we kind of remove this set A, which is given to us as follows. The intersection between the boundaries of H and H is a finite union of boundary arcs of HJ. The set A contains all of these arcs that are singletons. So essentially, we might have kind of singleton maximally connected components in this boundary, but these really aren't edges, right? These are just going to be kind of points of tangency. Be kind of points of tangency. And so we take these non-singleton maximally connected components of our edge family, and these are going to be what we define as edges of a C polygon. And the set of all edges in an edge family, we will denote with this kind of normal EJ. So looking at our kind of pictures here, right, if we chose this to be HJ, then we see essentially our edge family corresponding with homothet is this kind of one edge here. But if we were to take kind of a different Hj, But if we were to take kind of a different Hj, right, imagine we took Hj to be this kind of middle homothet here, then we see that this will have this will have two edges in its edge family. And this is how kind of an edge family is formed. And we see that this set A here in the definition does come into play sometimes. In our third example, if we pick HJ to be this homothet here, we see that the boundary intersection between this homothet and our C polygon. Homothet and our C polygon. Well, it's going to be this one edge, which we want in there, but it will also be this one point here. And this is essentially the role of the set A that is playing, right? Essentially, we don't want these singleton points to be edges or anything, so we kind of throw them out at will. With this, with edges defined, we can now define what a vertex is. Essentially, a point V in the boundary of a C polygon is a vertex if it lies in the boundary of at least two generating homothets. To generating homothets. And this is equivalent to our kind of notion of vertices and edges we had before. These vertices will be singular points on our C polygon, and the edges will be smooth boundary arcs connecting singular points. With this definition and with pairwise lemma we had before, we see that we can actually bound the number of vertices a C polygon will have. In general, it's not a nice bound that we have given in the theorem. That we have given in the theorem. But essentially, a vertex is a point in the boundary of our C polygon that lies in the boundary of at least two generating homothets. So, if we look at the set of all boundary intersections between our homothets, we see that our vertex set will be a subset of this set. And since, given any two homothets, we have exactly two points of intersection, we will have at most two times n choose two many vertices in a C polygon. And so, while this is Polygon. And so while this is not a good bound, right, the bound I've given you before is a lot better than this. This at least shows that the number of vertices is finite. And since we're in the plane, right, this implies that the number of edges will also be finite. Okay, so we are going to hop into our proof of our main theorem. And essentially, our general approach is to handle the case where C is first a smooth, strictly convex domain. And then we'll generalize to where it's not smooth. So for this case, we want to So for this case, we want to show that for a C polygon generated by n homothets, where C is a smooth, strictly convex domain, that the number of vertices a C polygon has, which is the intersection of these n homothets, is between n and 2n minus 1. We prove this by induction on n. The lower bound is very easily handled with an upcoming observation. So we focus on the upper bound initially. And our base case is the case, well, we need at least two homothets. So our base case is when n is equal to 2. Base cases when n is equal to two, and we want to show that the number of vertices an intersection of two homothets has is at most two in this case. Well, this is exactly given to us by pairwise lemma we saw just a couple minutes ago. So our base case is handled, and now we can move on to our inductive step. Our inductive hypothesis is that any C polygon generated by n homothets has at most two n minus one vertices. And so for our inductive step, we assume that H is the C polygon generated by n plus one generating homothets. By n plus one generating homothots, and consider this following C polygon here, which is denoted as WJ. And essentially, what the C polygon is, is we take the H we started with, and we remove the Jth homothet of H. This is a C polygon, right? It is an intersection of at least two homothets. It has non-empty interior because it's a superset of the C polygon H we started with, but we need to make sure that this is a reduced intersection. This is a reduced intersection. And this is exactly given to us in this lemma. At the bottom, this is actually a property of reduced intersections in general, not just of reduced intersections of homophobes. And it says that if we are given a reduced intersection, essentially, if we pull out any kind of set in this intersection, we will be left with a reduced intersection. So this WJ is indeed a C polygon, and this is going to be the object we will be applying our inductive hypothesis to. So, to finish the proof, or to see the end in sight, I should say, recall that Wj is defined as follows. And by definition, R C polygon H is equal to, well, WJ intersecting HJ, right? WJ is without the J-theal method. So when we add it in, we get back H. And since this is a reduced intersection, we must have that the boundary of Hj intersects the interior of Wj in some portion. WJ in some portion. This actually implies our lower bound of n vertices or n edges of a C polygon. What this says is that given any generating homothet, we have some intersection of it with wj, and we see that the edges in the edge family of that homothet will be exactly the kind of boundary segments that cross the interior of our convex body. For instance, the edge family of Hj here is highlighted in yellow. highlighted in in yellow here so this will be an edge family of sorry this will have an edge family of three edges and this will have an edge family of one edges so essentially the kind of edges in an edge family uh show up as kind of this piercing the interior of this wj and we should also notice that the new vertices present in h that are not in wj will have to occur in the relative boundary of these kinds of boundary arcs passing through and with this um And with this, we are done if we show just one thing. If we show that there exists a singleton edge family, that is an edge family with only one edge in its edge family, then we can bound the number of vertices H has, well, by, it's going to be less than or equal to the number of vertices Wj has, plus, well, the number of vertices H has that is not in Wj. Of course, with the vertices of Wj, we can apply our inductive hypothesis. We get the upper bound of 2n minus 1. The upper bound of 2n minus 1 for this, and for the number of vertices of h that are not in wj. Well, we just mentioned that these are going to occur in the relative boundary of the edges of this homothet. And since this is a singleton edge family, we will have only two points of two new vertices showing up, which gives us the upper bound of two here. And this together gives us our upper bound of 2n. So the proof is really just showing that there exists a singleton edge family. If we have that, then we can apply this kind of inductive. That, then we can apply this kind of inductive trick, and we will have proved our upper bound. So, in order to do this, we need a notion of gaps. This is a kind of a long definition, but hang in with me for a second. Let Hj be a generating homothet of H and consider kind of the complement of our edge family, right? That these are all of the points in our boundary of our homothet Hj that do not belong as an edge of our C polygon. This is going to be a union of, well, the amount of Going to be a union of well, the amount of edges in our edge family of maximally connected open boundary arcs of HJ, and we'll denote these open boundary arcs by G1 through G cardinality of EJ. And we call the closure and the convex hull of these open boundary segments the gaps of our C polygon. So for instance, I've given you three examples here. Essentially, the edge family here is going to be these two boundary arcs. Our gaps are going to be kind of Our gaps are going to be kind of the. We're going to look at first the open boundary arcs that are not in these edges, right? These are essentially the boundary of our blue regions. Then we close these boundary arcs and take their convex fall, which exactly gives us these blue regions. And we call the union of all these gaps the gap family of the homothete. A very nice initial property is that given any homothet, right, given any index j ranging from 1 to n plus 1, the boundary of h that is not in the edge family. Of H that is not in the edge family corresponding with HJ, well, it needs to belong to the gap family of that homothet. And we can see this through the following argument: that the boundary of our C polygon will essentially connect two vertices bounding any gap, right? It might look like this. And essentially, what we are wanting to show is that these kind of boundary segments connecting these vertices bounding a gap, these are going to be contained in our gap, right? We can't break out. To be contained in our gap, right? We can't break out or we can't do anything else. And essentially, we can see this by seeing that the boundary of our C polygon must be a subset of this homothet. So we can't go outside of this homothet, right? We couldn't have an arc such as this in our C polygon, right? Because our C polygon is a subset of all of our generating homothots. So we can't kind of go outside of the gap, and we also can't kind of curve inwards as well because our Inwards as well, because our well, our C polygon is going to be a convex body. So we, you know, the line segment connecting these two vertices has to be contained in our C polygon. So this gives us our first lemma that we're going to be using. And we just need one more lemma in order to find our singleton edge family. And it is this. If we look at two homothets of a C polygon H, then the intersection of the boundary of one homothet with the gap family of the other one. With the gap family of the other one is contained in, is non-empty and is contained in a single gap. We can see that the boundary of one homophob must intersect a gap family of another because of our last lemma, which states that the boundary of our C polygon must be contained in these gaps if it's not in the edge family. And since any generating homophet must contribute to the boundary, essentially we need to have it intersect the gap family in order for it to be a Family in order for it to be a part of the boundary of our C polygon. Yes? Sure. Okay. So we know that the boundary of one homothet must intersect at least one gap of another, but why is this? Of another, but why is this? Why can it only intersect one gap? Well, it is because of the pairwise lemma. Essentially, if we had a homothet intersecting multiple gaps, we would have more than two pairwise boundary intersections between the two homothets. So this is kind of gives the example of what would happen if a homothette intersected multiple gaps. I'm saying this can't happen. So of course, we see that this kind of outlined convex body is not a homothette. Is not a homophyte of the generating homothy of the gap family. And as a result of this lemma, we see that no two edges in the same edge family may lie in different gaps of a gap family. Essentially, because the homothytes can only intersect one gap, their edges in their edge family will be contained in this one gap, and therefore we can't have two edges in different gaps. In different gaps. And with this, we can actually find our singleton edge family. And this is kind of the algorithm we use to find our singleton edge family. So, first, we start off with choosing an arbitrarily edge family. I've labeled it in black here in this diagram. And essentially, we assume that it needs to be a multi-edge family, right? If it's a singleton edge family, we found our desired case. So, assume that it is a multi-edge family. This means that there's at least one other edge and hence one other gap. And we consider an arbitrary One other gap, and we consider an arbitrary gap of this gap family. We then, with this gap, there are two vertices bounding it. We pick the edge adjacent to one of these vertices. This is highlighted in blue here. So we pick this edge that's kind of adjacent to the vertex bounding our gap. And we say, okay, well, if this is a singleton edge family, we're done. So assume it's a multi-edge family. By our previous lemma, all of its other multiple edges must be contained. Multiple edges must be contained in this one gap. And so we have another edge in this gap that is a part of this edge family. And hence, there's kind of a smaller gap, this one given in blue here, that we can repeat this process with. And so we do it again. We take the two vertices bounding this smaller gap, pick an edge that's next to it, right? If this is a singleton edge family, we're done. If it's a multi-edge family, then there's a smaller gap we can zoom into. And we see zoom into. And we see that in this way we keep picking edges, and essentially, the only way we can stop this selection is if we reach a singleton edge family. We can't keep picking edges forever because we just saw previously that we have a finite number of edges. So this process has to stop and we eventually get to our singleton edge family. So this proves our upper bound for C polygons. I'm going to skip the translative C polygon case just for time here. And we're going to handle the non-smooth case, right? We were in this kind of ideal example of dealing with a smooth, strictly convex body, improving our bounds. What happens when we have a non-smooth convex body? So let C be a strictly convex domain and H a C polygon. Pairwise lemma holds for strictly convex domains, so we still have that. Edge families are defined identically, right? They're given there. But the only difference here, considering our non-smooth case, is that Our non-smooth case is that these boundary segments of our edges may not be smooth, right? They may have singular points because they're boundary arcs of our generating homophet, which may not be smooth in this case. This allows us to classify vertices in one of two ways. We call the vertices in the relative interior of an edge, right, the inherited vertices, and the vertices that are in the boundary intersection of two homothets are called the pairwise vertices. So essentially, pairwise vertices are all we had before in our smooth, strictly Are all we had before in our smooth, strictly convex case? In this case, we may have, we'll still have some vertices generated by the boundary intersection of two homothets, but we also will have some vertices that are kind of inherited by the homothet itself. Yes. Can we recall please? A is the set of kind of singleton components in this boundary intersection. Um, so uh, the uh the proof of the smooth case is quite easily adjusted to apply a C polygon has uh at most two n minus one pairwise lemos, sorry, pairwise vertices, right? Essentially, our arguments in the previous case didn't rely on the fact that our edges were smooth, right? It just helped us in counting the kind of pairwise number of vertices we had before. And so we have that bound on the number of pairwise vertices, and to bound the number of inherited vertices. To bound the number of inherited vertices. Well, we can see a C polygon is a strictly convex domain. These inherited vertices correspond to singular points on the boundary of C. And so we can't have kind of more than M of them showing up because our body is a strictly convex domain. We can't have kind of two of the same vertices showing up. So with this done, this proves kind of our main theorem. Sorry. And we can now talk about the sharpness of the bounds given. And really what we're Of the bounds given. And really, what we are asking is we can define sharpness in three ways. There are essentially two parameters we can use, right? If we have a C polygon where C is in some class of convex bodies or convex domains, rather. We can adjust what convex body we're selecting, but we can also adjust how many generating translates we have of the C polygon. So the strongest version of sharpness we have is that for all in our natural numbers and for all In our natural numbers, and for all C in our class of convex body, convex domains, there exists a C polygon H such that the number of vertices the C polygon has attains our upper bound or lower bound. The weak version of sharpness is if there only exists one convex domain in our class such that for all n, there exists a C polygon that attains our bound. And the weakest version of sharpness is that for any n in our natural, there exists some convex domain C in our Some convex domain C in our class, and a C polygon that attains this upper bound. So, of course, these are all kind of in descending order of strength. And the question now is the bounds that we proved before, are these strongly sharp, weakly sharp, or the other version of weakly sharp? And we are given three claims here, which we proved in our paper, namely the upper bound of 2n minus 1 plus m vertices for C polygons, where C is a strictly convex domain, is strongly sharp. Domain is strongly sharp. I'll reiterate what this means. This means if you give me any convex domain with m singular points in its boundary, I can give you for any natural n, a c polygon generated by n homothets that has exactly two times n minus one plus m vertices in its boundary. The other two claims are the other bounds, right? The lower bound of n vertices for c polygons and translative c polygons, where c is a strictly convex domain is Strictly convex domain is weakly sharp. So this means that not every C polygon where C is some non-smooth convex domain will attain this lower bound of n. But in the case we have a smooth, strictly convex domain, this will always attain its lower bound of n. The final claim we have here is that for every natural n greater than 2, there exists a convex domain C and a C polygon H with n generating homothets such that H has zero vertices. Such that h has zero vertices. And here we are coming back to the general class of C polygons where C is just a convex domain. We see essentially that the kind of lower bound on this set is going to be zero vertices, and it's sharp in this following sense. The kind of one missing piece here in the puzzle is the case, is the upper bound, where C is an arbitrary convex domain. And so this is given as an open problem at the end of our paper, which Problem at the end of our paper, which says that if C is a convex domain with M singular points, then the number of singular points a C polygon with n generating homophets will have is at most 2n minus 1 plus m. So even though we've kind of been limiting our focus to strictly convex domains, it seems to us that when we kind of limit, when we get rid of this limitation, that we will have, we still won't kind of break this bound of the number of vertices. And with that, I'll conclude the talk. And with that, I'll conclude the talk. Thank you very much. And we can, of course, go over some questions. Thank you very much. Thank you. Any questions? Live people and online people. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you again. Oh, there is a question. Thank you again. Oh, there is a question. Yeah. So just a second. Motivation of this work, not just paper, but generally this work, is to provide some general pattern for dealing with all those situations. With all those situations when we deal with like translate, like this sort of C-type or C polygons, right? Which is like generalization of some cases, as you mentioned, a generalization of some cases which are like widely studied. So did you have any particular applications like to revisit some known facts or like to extend them using these techniques? Well, the kind of a, you know, the main kind of object of motivation, like I mentioned before, is a ball polyhedra, of course. And we can ask kind of a similar question I answered in this proof of essentially if we intersect n congruent balls or n non-congruent balls, what is the maximum number of i-dimensional faces that this shape can have, right? This is kind of like a like McMullen's upper bound theorem, but for ball polyhedra. And so the kind of biggest question. So, the kind of biggest question we have about this class of convex domains is essentially what class of C will behave similarly to balls, right? And in this paper, we kind of showed that the class of strictly smooth, strictly convex domains will behave exactly similar to ball polyhedra in the sense that their number of vertices will be bounded in the same way. But the kind of general question still remains open in higher dimensions of kind of this McMullen-like question for ball policy. Like question for ball polyhedra in higher dimensions. And this is kind of the next step of this research as well is to hire is to handle the higher dimensional case. Thank you. Thank you. Any further questions here or online? No, then let's thank Cameron again.
