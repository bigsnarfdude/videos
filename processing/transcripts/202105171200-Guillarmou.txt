In my opinion, it's really quite amazing field of physics and now math. So I wanted to share a bit what's going on on this program. So this is about quantum filtering and especially conformal filter theory for surfaces in dimension two. So notoriously, So, notoriously, quantum filter is a bit difficult to approach using mathematics. But still, the physicists from, especially from the 80s, have developed actually a lot of tools, in particular in conformal field theory. And I must say now that I start to understand more of it, it's quite something what they did. So it's really a long project, so it's impossible to. So, it's impossible to explain everything. I will need like three or four hours to do that, but I'll try to give you some idea about it and especially what's the physical argument and motivation. And the message I want to say is that everything I will talk in the physical heuristic or language now for a special conformal filter called the U-vil theory. A conformal filter called the UV theory. Everything now is basically solved using mathematics in the last five, six years. So it's one of the first examples, at least of conformal field theory where you have a continuous family of primary field where we can really solve everything. And this is a combination of probabilistic tools and a spectral method. Actually, I used quite a bit. Actually, I used quite a bit of scattering theory argument for solving this, and some representation theory, and also a bit of modular space. And in fact, the scattering theory part is really necessary to solve the problem. My feeling is that it's impossible to solve it without this part. So, this is also why I wanted to mention this. So, what is a conformal field theory in dimension two? So, the data, these are Riemann. These are Riemann surfaces with marked points. So, Riemann surface is a surface, a closed surface, let's say, with a conformal class. Okay, the surface is oriented, and a conformal class plus an orientation gives you a complex structure. And then you put some marked points, x1, x2, and so on, on the surface. So these are this xi that I drew on the picture, and some weight attached to each marked point. And some weight attached to each mark point. So the weight are positive numbers, and you have to think of them as something like angles of conical singularities. So now in the conformal filter, what the physicists want to compute, the object that they like to analyze, or the so-called correlation function. So I will denote them by Z G X alpha. So G G X alpha. So G stands for the Riemannian metric or for the passive. The screen did not move for us. I don't know if you meant to move it. You need to move it up. Okay. We can only see to angles. Okay, but then okay, then I should come back to previous scene because I cannot move it from where I was. So do you see it moving now? Yes. Okay. So you have the core. Okay, so you have the correlation function, which I denote by Z, G, G is the Riemannian metric, or of course conformal class. X is the family of marked points, X1, X2, to the Xn, and alpha are these angles. And this has to be a complex number. And it needs to satisfy two properties. One is the diffomorphism invariance. So it means that if you move, if you pull back the metric by a diffomorphism, essentially the Essentially, basically, the partition function should just move the point by this psi. So it's a natural diffomorphism invariance. And so in particular, if you take a deformorphism which fixes the point, then you really should get the same value. And you should also get something called a conformal anomaly. So it means that if you change your base metric G by a conformal factor, By a conformal factor. Then you multiply your original correlation function by an explicit anomaly, conformal anomaly, of the following form. So it's the exponential of C. C is a number which is important, which is called the central charge of the theory, and I will come back to it later. Then Ag of omega is a usual functional on omega, which is this integral of d omega squared plus twice or g omega. twice Rg omega, where Rg is the scalar curvature in your integrate on the surface. So this is the conformal anomaly. It should remind you the anomaly of the determinant of Laplacian. It looks very similar. And then you also get some anomaly coming from this conformal factor W evaluated at the Mach point and with some delta I delta I or some some weight, so some positive number or negative number. Positive number or negative number, just real numbers. And this number should be explicit function of the alpha of this weight which corresponds to this kind of conical singularity. So this is the axiom of two-dimensional conformality theory. So this is what I wrote here. Rg is the scalar curvature. C is the central charge of the theory. So it's a number. a number uh delta i or a particular function of the alpha i called the conformal weight and in fact because of this conformal anomaly you see that if you pick one metric and you pick another one which is conformal to it you basically can recover the the correlation function one one from the other so this means that in fact this z g x alpha you can really view it as a section of a line bundle over the moduli space The moduli space of conformal classes, so which means really complex structure. And X, you can also think of them as Mach point, but they don't move, for instance. So in this case, you would reconsider the moduli space with Mach point. But I'll come back to it. So now, what is the physical meaning of it? So correlation functions, they are really expected value of random field. And you should think of them as phase. And you should think of them as Feynman type integral. So Zgx alpha should be the integral over all possible fields. So E of M denotes the set of fields on M. So a field, just think of it as a function. So for instance, E of M could be L2 of M, the set of L2 function. And then you have a certain action, which I denote by S of G. It's a functional from. Of g, it's a functional from C infinity to the complex number, of course, depending on g and depending on which action you take, you will get a different field theory. So it's a quantization, if you want, the field theory is the quantization of this action, of this classical action S of G. And it should be integrated against a Lebesgue type measure dÏ† over the set of fields. So, of course, d phi is complicated to define mathematically because the set of Mathematically, because the set of field is infinite-dimensional, and then you put this exponential alpha i phi evaluated at xi. So these are called the primary fields. So these are, just think of them as Dirac masses of the field on xi with a weight, essentially, this alpha i. And you want to try to compute these values. So this is the correlation function. So, this is the correlation function. So, this exponential of i phi or called the primary field, m is the space of field on m. So, the prime is mathematically, it's hard to give a sense to this measure exponential minus s g phi d phi. So, the main problem in theoretical physics is to give an expression, try to say something about the correlation function. Can we compute them? Or say something about them. And the difficulty is that it's hard to make sense of this Feynman integral. So, what the physicists use? They use symmetries of the model. So, because you have all these complex structure, conformal structure, and they also use representation theory of a certain algebra, a Lie algebra, which is called the Virasor algebra. I wrote it here. It's generated by a family L of M, parametrized by the integers, and then Entries by the integers and then C. C is like C times the identity. It's an element of the algebra which commutes with all elements, all this L M. And I wrote here the commutation relation that this algebra should satisfy. So what is this Virazo algebra? It's a central extension of something called the Wid algebra, and the Wid algebra is just the algebra of this complex vector field Z n plus 1. Field Zn plus 1 DZ. So if you compute their commutation, you get the same as above, but you remove the central charge part we see here. So this algebra is somehow a Lie algebra of the group of local conformal transformation on the surface. So it's a very important algebra to really analyze the conformality theory. Analyze the conformal field theory. So, let me explain a bit of heuristics in physics. So, take, for instance, the Riemann sphere. It has a complex structure, just with the canonical metric. Take four points, four marked points, x1, x2, x3, x4, and I draw the equator in blue here in the middle. You split your surface in two parts, m2 and m1. One is the upper half sphere and sorry, m2 is the upper half sphere and m1 the lower half sphere. Half sphere. And you try to split it as I draw into two pairs of points and then two half spheres with each one has a marked point contained in it. And you glue everything along these circles, which I draw in blue or in purple. And I will explain what means this blue and purple bit after. So, I draw what was M2 and what was M1. I decompose them into Lego blocks somehow, into blocks, geometric blocks. And each of them has a complex structure. Now, to compute the correlation function on my sphere with four points, I want to make a heuristic using the Feynman integral and try to decompose it using a decomposition of the surface into these blocks. These blocks. So remember, the correlation function was written like this. So in this case, I have four marked points with this alpha i and the measure. And I want to disintegrate this integral over all possible fields. So how should I perform this? I will put a conditioning on the value of the field on the circle where I have decomposed my manifold. My manifold. A little bit when in probability you put a conditioning on an expected value of a random variable. So just I want to define a certain amplitude. I will call it an amplitude. I call it M1G. So it will be the amplitude of the surface M1, which was the half-up sphere. Upersphere. It will be a function over this phi zero, this red phi zero. Phi zero is going to be a field on the circle. If I come back, it will be the circle splitting, the blue circle splitting the sphere here, if you want, which I draw a bit below as the circle splitting my two pair of points. So I define this amplitude to be the same. Amplitude to be the same integral as before, except that I integrate over all possible field on M1 with a conditioning. The conditioning is that I ask that my field on M1 has the value phi 0 on the boundary, on S1, the boundary where I'm supposed to glue my two things. And then I do the same for M2. Okay? Okay, now if you do a heuristic, a physical heuristic, and this is how physicists do, in fact, you can do the disintegration of your Feynman integral, and you see that the correlation function should be just the product of the amplitude of M1, which you view as a function on field on the boundary of M1, times the amplitude of M2 integrated against all possible fields on the boundary of M1, which is also the boundary of M. The boundary of M1, which is also the boundary of L2. And this boundary is a circle, so it means I integrate over all possible fields on this circle. It means that this integral over a closed surface, for instance, I can try to split it into pieces. So as I said, this A MJ G, we call it the amplitude of Mg. And similarly, M1, you can also uh m1 you can also decompose it further by uh decomposing by decomposing into uh the the the the amplitude of a pair of points and the amplitude of a disk with one mark point x1 and a disk with one point x2. If I come back to my picture before, this was this further decomposition. And I can do the same by again conditioning my value of phi zero to be something on the boundary of To be something on the boundary of these two new boundaries. So, all this is so far is heuristic. So, now what is Segal axiom? So, Segal tried to give a mathematical axiomatic to express this fact somehow. And he said, What should be a conformal field theory from this perspective? So, he wrote a quite long article, which was Kind of available somehow, typed probably in the end of the 80s, and I think it appeared a bit later, maybe I don't remember exactly when. So let me explain what are the segal actions. So you have to view CFT as a functor. So what are the objects? The object are disjoint union of circles, which you have to think of just boundaries of To think of just boundaries of Riemann surfaces with boundaries. What are the morphisms? The morphism are oriented Riemannian surface with geodesic boundaries. And then you put an orientation for each boundary component. So of course, the Riemann surface gives you an orientation, uh a natural induced orientation for each boundary piece. But then I want to to to choose uh an orientation on each boundary, which is either plus or minus one. Which is either plus or minus one, and if it's plus one, if it agrees with the induced orientation. So it's just something I fix. I choose certain of the boundaries are going to have minus one orientation, and certain of them will have plus one. So far, I talk about Riemann surface. Later, I will explain why it's related to actually a Riemann surface, like conformal classes. And then I also put a marked point on these surfaces and put On these surfaces, and possibly also some weight, alpha j. So, this will be the morphism. So, of course, the boundary of these surfaces are just disjoint copies of circle. So, you get something with objects. So, I draw this picture. I have a surface with four boundary pieces. Two of them have positive orientation and I call them outgoing. And two of them have incoming, has negative orientation. As negative orientation, I choose them to be negative orientation, which means incoming. So, this is a morphism. I view this as a morphism between these circles. So, what is this conformal field theory functor? It's going to be a functor which to a disjoint union of circle, of n-circle, is going to map to the tensor product of a certain Hilbert space, which I call separable. Space, which I call separable D-Silver space, which I denote by H curly. So number of tensorial products corresponds to the number of boundary circle of a circle you take. And then if I take a Riemann surface with n boundary circle, I want to associate an amplitude or which will be an operator, a linear operator, which map A tensorial number, a tensile power of copy of H to the tensile power of copy of H, and you will map the number of them will be incoming, the number of incoming boundary components mapping to the number of outgoing components. So for each incoming component, you view a copy of the Hilbert space, and if you have two, for instance, incoming components, you consider Incoming component, you consider the tensor product of this H, a tensor with H, and you map to the tensor product of H with H of the outgoing circle. So H has to be thought of as a Hilbert space attached to a circle. And you also ask that this operator, this A, is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator. So, there is a possibility that there is no incoming boundary of no outgoing boundary. So, if there is no incoming boundary, you define A to be just a map from C to a M copy of the Hilbert space. If you have M outgoing boundary and no incoming boundary, and respectively, if you have no outgoing boundary and N incoming boundary. And incoming boundary, you map a tensor product H to C. And then the last thing is that you ask that the amplitude, if you change the metric conformally, you choose another conformal representative, it should also multiply the operator just by a number, and this number should be the same conformal anomaly as before, where you integrate on your surface with boundary M and with the same C. C is going to be again. And with the same C. C is going to be again this central charge, which is something attached to the conformal field theory. So, what this means is that the morphism, maybe they are not really Riemannian surfaces, but it's better to think of them as Riemann surface, so conformal classes. And I will attach to a conformal class, so to a Riemann surface, not really an operator, but array, a line of operator. Remember, I talked about line section of line bundle. Talked about line section of line bundle before, and here I want also to view it to view them as an array of operators. Colon, yes, there's no contribution from the marked points in that change. Ah, yes, you're right. Sorry. There should be the same contribution of the marked point contained in the M. Sorry, I forgot it. Thank you for the. So we call this AMG the amplitude of A M G, the amplitude of M J of M with the conformal class G or the metric G and X alpha. So now I said a conformal filter should be a functor. So you need to satisfy the functorial property. It means that the functorial property needs to satisfy this thing that if I glue two surface, so there is a canonical way if you want to glue to a complex surface with or to conformal structure where you have a geodesic. Conformal structure where you have a geodesic boundary. In fact, you don't really need geodesic boundary, but anyway, you can glue two complex structures like this, like I drew. And you want to drew them with the outgoing boundary component. You want to glue them only with the incoming component so that when you glue them, you really get a good complex structure. So, how you do this? You take a complex chart which You take a complex chart which maps the blue neighborhood here in the first component of my point here to a neighborhood of the unit circle in C, but in the interior of the unit disk. And purple here, I map it to a little neighborhood of the circle outside the unit disk. And I just glue it like this, so that I put the complex structure of C to make my gluing. And I want that if I glue this complex surface, I ask that the operator, the amplitude I obtain by gluing, is just the composition of amplitude, the composition of operator. That's quite simple. So all this define what should be a conformal filter in the sense of Segal. So it looks pretty simple. Another remark is that I can also glue, self-glue. So if I have, for instance, Self-glue. So if I have, for instance, an outgoing blue piece, which is the force component of M, of the boundary, here on the right bottom on my picture, and I want to glue it with the right top boundary D3 of M, which has the incoming component. I can also make a self-gluing with the same procedure as above. I obtained this M tilde here. I created the hole here. And then I added And then I ask that the amplitude I obtain when I do this is a partial trace. So, of course, this partial trace needs to make sense. So, you need a bit more than Hilbert Schmidt to be able to do this. So, I have to add a certain trace property also on this operator. They need to be such that this partial trace makes sense. And the partial trace is just that because you have tensorial products, you can just take two of these components, the one corresponding to three and the one. Component: the one corresponding to three and the one corresponding to four, you get a bilinear, a bilinear operator if you want. And I can just define a trace on this. To give you a better sense of it, I want to explain what this is if this Hilbert space corresponds to L2 of a measured space, which practically will be the case actually in our work. So, omega. So, omega will be, you have to think of omega as the set of fields on the circle. And omega, really mathematically, what it will be, it will be a Sobolef space on S1, and it will be H minus epsilon of S1, where epsilon is any positive number. And we will put a certain measure on it. So, if you take this Hilbert space to be L2 of a measured space in general in a segal axiom, In a sequel axiom, you can view, because it's a Hilbert, because you have a Hilbert Schmidt operator mapping a tensor product of H to another tensor product of H, you can also view this operator A, this amplitude, really as a function, an L2 function. It will be an L2 function on M plus N component of omega. Okay, it's just this correspondent between Hilbert-Schmidt operators on a manifold, for instance, and the L2 function on the manifold. function on the manifold times the manifold essentially. So if I view this amplitude really as function on the field, I will cover this heuristic from Feynman integral. And practically, if I want to, what is the composition of operator if I view... So really A here is like a Schwarz kernel if you want. It's the Schwarz kernel of my operator. Except that the point are not like when we work in geometric analysis on a manual. We work in geometric analysis on a manifold. The manifold here is really the set of fields, so it's really infinite-dimensional. We are really working in a field theory, so the point are functions. Okay, so now I come back a bit to physics. Omega should be the space of field on S1. And if I do a composition, for instance, of these two surfaces, for instance, an annulus, a cylinder with a pair of points like I draw. Like I draw. If I glue them, I get another pair of points. And the amplitude, when I view it as a function on three copies of the set of fields, it should just be the composition of operator. And the composition of operator, it's easy to see the Schwarzkernel how it is. It's just the integral in the phi variable here on the set of field of S1. And it's just when you compose two operators, you get a pairing of. You get a pairing of the Schwartz kernel, if you want, in one of the variables. So it's just the same thing here. Now, there is a kind of theorem in physics which tell you how it's quite amazing, actually. It's really tell you if you take a conformality theory, whatever it is, there should be a way to give an explicit expression of it. So one should be able to compute the correlation function. Compute the correlation function. Of course, the formula is a little bit complicated, but it's explicit. So it means that any conformal field theory is really integrable in some way. So the partition function, this ZMG, which remember was the integral of all possible configuration of this exponential alpha 1, x1, sorry, exponential alpha 1, phi at x1, exponential alpha2, phi at x2, and so on. It should be a sum over Be a sum over something called the spectrum of the CFT. I'll come back to what it is. Delta is a number, positive number here. And delta one, I mean, it's a family, actually. Delta one, delta two, delta n are positive number belonging to what is called the spectrum of the CFT of two things. So one is this rho delta alpha. So alpha remember of this angle or weight in the beginning. Or weight in the beginning, delta or this parameter in the sum which belongs to the spectrum of a certain operator. This operator will actually be an operator coming from the Viraso algebra. And then you get the integral of something called the conformal block, this blue thing I denote it by F delta alpha QX. So delta alpha are just as above. What are Q and X? So X are the mark point. And Q, they will be moduli parameter. Remember, I said. moduli parameter. Remember I said that z, the correlation function should be a function on the moduli space. Or because of this conformal anomaly, it really amounts to just know it on each conformal class. So here big n is the dimension of the moduli space of complex structure with mark point. So if I have genus H, a surface with genus H and n mark point. And n mark point, the dimension n is three genus m minus three plus n. It's the complex dimension. So it's a complex manifold, the modular space. So what are these rho delta alpha? It's a product of three-point correlation function on S2. So I draw the sphere here with three point. So it's a product of n of them. Sorry, not yeah, of n of them. I will come to back to it. And what are these blue thing? This F delta alpha QX. They are called the conformal blocks of the theory. And the conformal blocks, they are holomorphic function of the moduli parameter Q and X. So QX are complex coordinates on the moduli space. So X are the mark points, if you want. And Q, they are a bit like Fensch-Ninsel coordinates, but actually they are not. They are called the plumbing, the plumbing. not they are called the plumbing the plumbing parameter in the sense of word part and if i have a bit of time i'll i'll explain you a bit later what what they are so conformal blocks uh they are really something which is universal they are of they are a holomorphic function or holomorphic they should really be thought as a holomorphic section of line bundles of on moduli space and and they are really a universal object depending only on the representation theory of Verazo algebra. Theory of Verazo algebra. So if I come back to my formula above, it means that this correlation function should be something in terms of some square of a holomorphic function which is universal. In some sense, it does not really depend on the conformal field theory you choose. They just depend on Viraso algebra and the central charge. And somehow the conformal field theory should be somehow represented by this rho, this rho delta alpha. rho this rho delta alpha which we call structure constant and the structure constant is just the the three point correlation function on the sphere so everything should be in the end reduced to the sphere with three point this is what the physicist kind of solved using representation theory and heuristics from Feynman integrals okay let me Let me move a bit. So, what is the spectrum of the theory and this delta one, delta two, delta n? So, the spectrum of the theory is actually the spectrum of this operator H0, and H0 is L0 plus its adjoint, where L0 was an element of the Viras-O-Ro algebra, and it's a representation, a representation of one of this Viras-O-Ro element into as an operator on this Hilbert. As an operator on this Hilbert space H. If I remember in the beginning, I defined the Viraso algebra, they were generated by this Lm. Here it's this L0, the one which is very important. So what is the idea behind this? So L0 is like Z DZ, is it? Yeah, yes, exactly. Okay. At least for the width. Yeah, you're right. But you need a. But you need to be a certain representation of this in this Hilbert space H. And I will show you the formula below. So, what is the idea behind this? Take the sphere with four points. Split it in the middle at the equator. You get two half-sphere as I explained before, M1, M2, with two marked points each one. And I put an incoming boundary for one and outgoing for the other. The correlation function. Uh, the correlation function in the physics heuristic tells you that it should be the integral of the amplitude of the upper half sphere integrated against the amplitude of the lower half sphere. You remember here because the half-sphere has only one boundary, we get just one copy of H, it's not a transfer product with many terms, just one. So, it's just an L2 product on omega, the space. L2 product on omega, the space of field. And now I want to do a Planch-Rel formula for this. I want to decompose this product using the spectral decomposition of this H0. So what happens is that this H0 admits a full eigenbase, which I denote by C delta. Delta is this parameter belonging to the spectrum. And nu, nu tilde is parametrized by something called the Jung diagrams, Jung tableau. So they're just, if you want a If you want a series of integers, finite number of integers with decreasing, which is decreasing, you get a full, you have to think of them as when you diagonalize the harmonic oscillator, basically. So this C delta nu nu tilde, it's an eigenbasis of H for this H0 operator in this representation of the Verazo algebra. Viraso algebra. And now I want to. There's something which is quite magical: is that if I look at the amplitude of the unit disk with Mark Point at zero and with a certain complex alpha, so I have to move to the complex somehow for this alpha, for this angle. It turns out that the amplitude is going to be this sub psi delta empty set empty set, which is the highest weight. Highest weight element for the Verma module. This generates a Verma module, this P delta Nu tilde in representation theory. So, what is quite amazing is that this C delta, the first one, the main important one that you use to diagonalize H0, it's actually an amplitude for the unit disk with a mark point at zero. So now, because you have a product, an L2 product of, for instance, A. An L2 product of, for instance, AM1 with this C delta, for instance, if I take nu and nu tilde mt, I take the case with no Young tableau, I'm going to get a pairing of amplitude. And I know, as above, that a pairing of amplitude is the amplitude of the glued manifold. So it means that somehow this M1, what happened is that when I pair with this C delta empty set, empty set, this primer, this highest weight eigen. Highest weight eigenvector is going to be corresponding to adding a disk with one mark point to my circle, to my boundary circle on M1. So I'll show you on the picture here. It means that this L2 product of M1G with this highest rate vector is going exactly to be the amplitude of the sphere with three points, x1, x2, and 0. And this is how you see we. And this is how you see where the three-point correlation function comes back. This raw element that I saw. And then the descendant, the one that you get for this Jung tableau, they will be a bit like you will start with the P delta empty set and you apply the whole Viraso algebra to them. You get representation into H a little bit when you digonalize the harmony. When you digonalize the harmonic oscillator, you apply a creation operator. You start with the first one and then you create the other one by applying other operators. The digonalization of H0 is the same. You get this P delta, which is really the amplitude of the disk with one Mach point. And then you apply iteratively many copy of representation, actually two representation of Razoro generators, which are certain representation into H, and you actually generate all. And you actually generate all the eigenbesis of your H0. And what is important? Okay, so now it depends on your conformal field theory. Certain conformal field theory have discrete spectrum, certain not. The one that we are interested in have actually continuous spectrum. So they will really be, delta will be a real parameter. And they will be really a scattering eigenfunction. You have to think of them as scattering eigenfunction, as I will explain a bit. I will explain a bit. And somehow, there is something called Wad identity. I don't want to go into detail, but which tells you that when you pair the amplitude of the sphere with two Mach point with this highest weight vector where you have applied many times a Verazo element, a non-trivial Verazo element, you can actually compute it by algebraic means. compute it by algebraic method and you you you gain you again get uh the the pairing of the amplitude with the highest weight vector psi delta times some explicit factor a blue one which is something algebraic coming from commutation relation of the rasso algebra and one which is uh just powers of the marked point basically the mark point remember were the point outside the unit disk so what it is So, what it is, and somehow the conformal blocks, they will come from this W nu tilde, from these algebraic factors. So, this blue thing produces conformal blocks. And word, it's called in physics, or it's called the vertex operator algebra. This word identity. Okay, so now let me come quickly to Leuville field theory. It's a special conformal field theory that has That have been worked a lot in the 80s in the physical sense, but only recently in mathematics. So, the action is the action that you get for the uniformization of surfaces when you try to minimize this action. So, it's the integral of d phi square plus q over 4 times the scalar curvature times phi times exponential of gamma times the field. So, gamma is a parameter between 0 and 2, and q is going to be gamma over 2 plus 2 over gamma. two two over gamma so all of these are positive numbers if you try to minimize this action you will find the phi which uniformize which is the conformal factor which uniformizes the metric now you define the Feynman integral like this of course at the moment everything is just formal at least the form of the Feynman theorem is not well defined but there is a recent theorem which was proved by FranÃ§ois David Anti-Coupien RÃ©my Rod and Barcelona Vragas in 2016 Vargas in 2016 for the sphere, and then David Roden Vargas for the torus. And then we did the general case for hyogenus with Roden Vargas a bit later, which say that there is a way of a probabilistic definition of the Feynman integral, which means of the correlation function in all genus under certain conditions on the angle, on this alpha i, this conformal factor, this weight. Then to be bigger than q times the Euler characteristic. Q times the ULAC characteristic. And the definition is as follows. I don't want to spend too much time on it, but because I'm a bit don't have much time. But it's something involving the determinant of Laplacian. And then you get an integral on R times an expectation on a certain probability space of some random variable containing three terms. And the most difficult part here, so they really are defined so that they. Really are defined so that they should represent what the Feynman integral is. And this is really a well-defined object mathematically. They are defined using the Gaussian free field. Gaussian free field is a random field, which is a random combination of eigenfunction of the Laplacian using IID Gaussian. And lambda k here or the eigenfunction of the Laplacian. And the most difficult part is this red thing, this red thing, because you have the exponential of the field of the golden. Of the field of the Gaussian-free field to define. And for this, you need some work of Jean-Pierre Carrin. The covariance of this Gaussian-free field is given by the green function of the Laplacian. So you want to view this red quantity as a random measure. You need to use this theory of Jean-Perquerin. It's called the multiplicative chaos. And the center of field for the Feynman integral should. For the Feynman integral, it should be the constant plus this Gaussian free field, which is a random field, which is an orthogonal constant. Again, it's a random combination of eigenfunction of Laplacian. So once you define this like this, here is what we can prove. Basically, we can prove everything that the physicist did. So first thing, there exists a Hilbert space H, which is L2 of the real number time. Number time a certain probability space. L2 of omega in this probability space is really a Fox space. So it's this omega is just the set of sequences or two sequences. And the probability measure is just the infinite tensor product of Gaussian. So it's actually representing a measure on the negative sobox space on the circle. Just viewing the random field on the circle as a random combination of four A modes. That's the first thing. There exists a Hilbert space attached to this circle. So this is good for the Segal axiom. For each circle, we have a natural Hilbert space. Second thing, there exists a probabilist definition for the amplitude of a Riemann surface with geodesic boundaries and mark points using a conditioning on the boundary. Using a conditioning on the boundary. And basically, what you do, you take your Gaussian-free field, you decompose it into a Gaussian-free field with Diricle condition on the boundary, I call it Y, plus the harmonic extension of phi, which is the boundary value of your original Schenfield field, minus a constant. And the constant is the constant coming from this natural constant coming from this decomposition. Decomposition. And then, so you take your original expectation that I wrote before and you integrate away the Dirichlet part. If you integrate away the Dirichlet field this way, you get a conditional expectation and you get a function of phi, which is a field now on the circle. And you get this actually, this phi, which is a random combination of three modes. Now, the third part in the theorem is that. The third part in the theorem is that actually using this, we prove that the second axiom for the gluing of the amplitude actually holds. The fourth thing is that there is a unitary representation of H0, which is the L0 plus L0 star, the sum of the other element plus its adjoint, as a self-adjoint operator on this Hilbert space, which is written as follow. So it's a Laplacian on the real line plus q square is just a constant. Remember, q was this positive constant. constant remember q was this positive constant plus plus a p0 p zero is an infinite dimensional harmonic oscillator and plus a potential i mean time this potential which is green which is purple is exponential gamma times the c is the the the the the the real constant and v of phi is a is a potential uh on uh it's a positive operator if you want uh which which is which is living on this omega probability space. On this omega probability space. So it's actually potential when gamma is less than square root of two, and when gamma is bigger than square root of two, in fact, it's a measure. So it's a quite wild thing. And what we prove is that there is a full spectral decomposition in terms of scattering eigen space. The spectrum of H0 is a Q square over 2 plus infinity. It's purely continuous. And the eigenvector or generalized eigenvector, and they are actually are. And they are actually all analytic extensions in alpha of the amplitude of the unit disk with one mark point and weight alpha. And the analytic continuation is to alpha belong to Q plus I times the red line. And I think I'm okay. I'm probably a bit over time now. And just maybe to finish, what we show in the end is that the correlation function. We show in the end is that the correlation function has the expected formula that the physicists tell us. It means that we can write them as integral over r to the power of the dimension of the moduli space time a product of three-point correlation function and the square of the conformal blocks. And these are the three-point correlation function this C. So basically it tells you that the physical the The physics formula are actually correct using this. And the conformal blocks can be written as series of characters related to the Virasor algebras. Okay, and what are these Q which appear in the conformal block? They are actually the complex parameter for moduli space of genus H and N mark points, and they are called the plumbing parameters. point and they are called the plumbing parameters of Marden, Croix and Robert. Basically you split your surface into pieces like pons pair of pants and you and you plumb them using a cylinder which are which are annulus with parameter Q and you have an argument of Q which is a twist and the modulus of Q is the length of this cylinder that you put. So the result you So, the result you obtain is actually associated to a given pond decomposition. And I think I should stop now. Thank you very much, Collin. Very impressive indeed. Does anyone have any questions? Sure. So, Colin, you said at the end there that you're able to do the computations that the physicists had claimed. Yes. So, I remember in Polyakov's paper, he does his computation. Polyakov's paper, he does his computation, I think, from Q. His computation of Q, he says that it's 16 minus n, where n is the dimension of the universe, which he had left unspecified. And so his computation explained why the universe was 16 dimensional. So what dimension is the universe in your computation? Here, okay, there is not really a universe here. Actually, okay, we have another paper where we are. Have another paper where we relate to Polyakov partition function. Partition function of Polyakov should be something which is a bit like a two-dimensional quantum gravity. Here, what I explain is more like really just the part about Louville conformal field theory. So it's one conformal field theory. If you want in Polyakov, he defined only the free field in some sense because he just used the determinant of Laplacian. The free field is really just determinant of Laplacian. The free field is really just determinant of Laplacian, free field theory. Here it's more complicated because it's a theory which is non-free. I mean, there is really an interaction, a non-linearity, which is this exponential of the field. But what is really nice in this is that it's not a perturbative theory, if you want to. Usually, you do expansion, you know, like semi-classical expansion in a field theory to say something because you're not able to define actually the field menu. Because you're not able to define actually the Feynman integral. What is really amazing here is that actually one can define the Feynman integral using a probability, and then after this, we recover everything that they obtain. I don't know, I'm really amazed actually about what they developed. Everything in the end make perfect sense. So, you said that this was offered the Louisville field theory. So, I have no clue, but there are other field theories. Clue, but there are other field theories. Does your analysis work for other field theories? Actually, okay. What I explained in the beginning, the physics heuristic, it was developed by Belavin, Polyakov, Zamlochikov in, I think, in 84. It's a paper which has cited an amazing amount of time, like something like 16,000 or something. A lot of people have worked on it, and they developed. A lot of people have worked on it and they developed something called the conformal bootstrap, which is a general approach if you want to solve any conformal filter in dimension two. The problem is it's a bit at the holistic level. So if the spectrum of the theory is discrete, maybe you can use a not so complicated representation theory and do what the physicists try to do using just algebraic method. The problem is in this case, The problem is in this case, this H0 here, as you see, it looks a bit like a B Laplacian. So it really has continuous spectrum due to this C parameter, the zero mode parameter. So it really looks like a Laplacian plus an exponential gamma C, which has scattering in minus infinity and confining potential at plus infinity. So you really get continuous spectrum. And it's not clear at all if you want that even this formula that Even this formula that I wrote, this integral for the partition function in terms of the spectral parameter, that this even makes sense. Even the conformal block, actually, if you look in physics, even in algebraic geometry, they are just formal series. I don't think they know how to prove that they converge because the coefficients are really extremely messy algebraic numbers. And in fact, a consequence of A consequence of our proof, which shows really scattering theory, is that the conformal block exists almost for almost every p. So, somehow the fact that we have a spectral decomposition, it means that you have a Planchrel theorem, a little bit like Arish Chandra theorem for SL two. And this actually implies that the conformal block has to converge for almost every P, which I think is something which was not known in algebraic geometry. Was not known in algebraic geometry and even in physics. So, just the message is: there is a general approach for CFT by Belovin-Polykovs-Mochikov, but if you want really to solve it, especially if you have a continuous family of primary fields, like the spectrum is continuous, I'm not sure mathematically you can do it like this. I mean, you really need to do something. Something more than you've done, you mean? Or? No, no, something. No, no, something along the line we've done, but I mean, we've done it for the Louville theory. I mean, the problem is for the other theory, it's not so clear if there is a good expectation, if you can really write the Feynman integral as an expectation of a random variable. So why is that special to the Liabil theory? Well, for instance, okay, let me come back, for instance, to just this action, you know. This action, you know, the physicists, in fact, what they do, they also take gamma to be complex valued. They say that the theory should even complexify. For instance, if you take gamma equal i times a positive number, it's related to since to since to sign-gordon theory and things like this. If you want, you really get something complex valued, so we cannot use a probability to define. Cannot use a probability to define, we don't get a positive thing. So we cannot, there is no Feynman integral. We don't know how to make sense, but the physicists know somehow that the theory should exist for gamma imaginary, for instance. So it means that there should be another way to describe it. And some people work, for instance, on the random curve, for instance. They try to make it using random curve along the line of the work of Schaden, for instance. So I don't know, it's not so clear. So I don't know, it's not so clear in general. Here it's it's a it's a bit amazing that there is a probabilistic representation, but uh in general uh all right I see could I ask quickly Collins what what do the physicists refer to that as this sort of where they complexify this gamma parameter is it also called like some kind of complexified Louisville quantum field theory or is that yeah for them I think it's uh Louisville theory but uh for different uh Theory, but for different central charge. Thank you. But I don't think I'm not sure they know everything about it. You know, for instance, if gamma is purely imaginary, I don't remember if it's a unitary theory. But if gamma is not unique, it's complex but not imaginary, for instance, typically the H0, if you want, is not going to be self-adjoint, maybe. I don't know. I mean, it's going to be a messy operator. So it's I don't know. I think there are many things to be studied there that are still really not well understood. Unfortunately, it's a little bit like hard work. Yeah, of course. Can I just ask a quick question? You had these analytic continuations coming up at some point. So why do they come up or how do they come up? Yeah, so this is again something quite amazing in this because when alpha is real, the only Because when alpha is real, the amplitude of you can define the amplitude when alpha is real, for instance, for the unit disk. Because it's a probabilistic, it's just an expectation of a random variable. Now you can extend it a little bit in alpha using this integral. But then if you try to move too much, it does not make sense as a probability object. But now, this d alpha, actually, what we show is that it's a general, it's an eigenfunction of this H0. So if I come back to this H0 in the end, This H0 in the end. This is this operator. You know, it's a bit like in scattering theory when you have a generalized eigenfunction, but which is not on the continuous spectrum, but outside. You see? So this d alpha, this amplitude for the disk, it's a generalized eigenfunction, but not L2. So it's outside the spectrum. And now what you can show using scrutiny theory is that actually this generalized eigenfunction extends to the whole. My picture is here. Uh, it's my picture is here actually. It's so the amplitude of the disk is, if you want, correspond to alpha to be uh between zero and q. So it's it's uh in the physical sheet on the real line. And then using scattering theory, you can actually extend alpha. Alpha is like the spectral parameter, and you move it up to the line q plus i r so if you want this extension is relating uh this. This spectral representation, which is this discomplitude with alpha equal to Q plus IP for P real, to the probabilistic regime. So we can really, then they talk one to each other and we can use analytic contribution from one to the other, for instance, to get this world identity and so on. I mean, one really need to play if you want, one really need to play both with the probabilistic uh method and the spectral method at the same time. The spectral method at the same time using analytic continuation from one to the other. And in some way, the public could not solve this problem alone. They really needed a scattering approach. And a scattering theory guy could not solve it because if you don't have the probability method, you ca you cannot work out uh this integrability. The fact that uh h zero you can solve everything uh using the Verazo algebra and you have this representation. And you know, this representation. Thank you. All right. Anyone else have any questions? Just you said to solve the quantum field theory or conformal field theory. What does it mean to solve? To solve means find a formula for the correlation function. And okay, I should add one thing. You know, in this bootstrap formula, as I said, the result is. I said the result is associated to a point decomposition. So you want to remember, I wrote the formula in terms of this conformal block, their expression over the moduli parameter, right? But this is associated to a certain decomposition of your surface into a pair of points and disk with smart points and cylinders, right? But now when you have a surface or the moduli space, you can choose another point decomposition. And the problem is, and actually that's And the problem is, and actually, that's one of the main problems for the physicists: is that they find this formula, but now what if you take another bond decomposition, you get another formula? Is it the same? And for them, and in fact, it's very hard to prove because the formula, the conformable are extremely complicated objects. So they try numerically. But what follows from this is that because we know that the correlation function is actually a mathematical object, now it's an expectation of a random variable, it means that actually Random variable, it means that actually this compatibility holds. You see, the main difficulty actually for the physicist is this compatibility thing that if I take two point decomposition, I want my result to be the same. In some sense, they find necessary condition on what should be the partition, the correlation function. But they're not necessarily able to say that this condition. Necessarily able to say that these conditions are actually sufficient because you need this compatibility. And what follows from this probabilistic definition and the fact that we recovered the formula of the thesis tell you actually that this compatibility holds. And yeah, solving means getting formula like this. So if you see, if you want, here it shows that this is an integrable theory. You can really compute it. Theory, you can really compute it completely. Are all CFTs supposed to be integral? Yes, yes, I think so. That's the idea of this conformal bootstrap method. Everything should be related to these conformal blocks, which is just something related to these are series associated to characters of representation of Azure algebra, and this product of this three-point correlation function. Three-point correlation function. And for instance, for Louville, you get an explicit formula. It's called the Diozizi formula. I didn't write it, but it's this theorem here. It's something like a hypergeometric function. But you have also, for instance, a Todar field theory and Todar field theory. There should be also a similar representation and with a certain structure constant. But they are not all known. For Louisville, it's known now, but for certain other ones, I don't think it's known, for example. For easing model, Known for example for easing model, easing model, also maybe it's known. Okay, very impressive. So thank you again, Colin, unless anyone has any more questions.
