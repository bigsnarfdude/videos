On harmonic analysis of translation invariant valuations and geometric inequalities. It's joint work with Thomas van Rovan. Please. Okay. Yeah. Thank you very much, Daniel, for the introduction. Also, many thanks to the organizers for giving me the opportunity to speak at this conference. And as Daniel already mentioned, I will talk about harmonic analysis, translation, and brain evaluations. Translation invariant valuations. In other words, I will discuss how valuations behave under the action of the group of rotations and then how this can be used to prove certain geometric inequalities. And as again already mentioned, this is joint work with my former advisor, Thomas Manner, who might be in the audience too. I would like to divide the talk into two parts. And in the first part, I would like to recall some necessary aspects of algebraic theory of evaluations on convex bodies that are necessary to put our results in some context. And in the second part, I will present our results. So let me begin with reviewing. Let me begin with reviewing reviewing some background from algebraic to evaluations, which is a modern theory that developed mainly from a series of fundamental articles of Seman Alaskar from the beginning of the millennium. And we will study the space of continuous translation invariant valuations on convex bodies. So on this set, the evaluation is a finitely additive in the following sense. In the following sense, complex valued functional finite relative measure on convex bodies. So, it's finite relative in this sense. Whenever this is actually well defined, whenever K and L are convex bodies, such that again, they're union as a convex body. And now, fundamental theorem here is that this space is graded, and namely, it's graded by the degree of homogeneity of evaluation. So, by subscript k, I will denote. By subscript k, I will denote the subspace of k homogeneous valuations. And it was shown by Peter McMullen that modulo taking linear combinations, the degree of homogeneity of evaluation, of continuous translation variant evaluation is an integer and moreover is this integer is non-negative and bounded from above by the dimension of the underlying space. And to present some examples, you can just basically You can just basic examples are the mixed volumes. So, mixed volume is just the polarization of the volume functional of the Lebesgue measure. And then you just fix certain bodies C's, and then you apply to your convex body the following mixed volume. You just plug your body K times, and then take the mixed volume with these fixed bodies. And then it is in this exercise that this is actually K-homogeneous continuous translation invariant valuation on convex bodies in particular. On convex bodies. In particular, if there are no free slots over here, then you just have a constant. And again, it's an easy exercise to prove that actually all zero homogeneous evaluations of this type are constants. And similarly, but this is on the contrary, much more involved result due to Hadwiger. Also, the top degree space is one-dimensional and they list spanned by the Lebesgue measure. And now there is a natural action of the generally null group on the space of valuations. Just an element G of the group acts by precomposing the valuation with its inverse because we want to have a left action. And obviously, this action preserves the degree of homogeneity. The degree of homogeneity because of the interaction, but it also preserves the parity of evaluation. So you can decompose any evaluation into its even and odd par, and obviously, also the parity will be preserved even and odd, I mean, with respect to the reflection in the origin. So in other words, these guys, these subspaces, are GLN representations. And then what Samuel showed in 2001, that those subspaces, those GLN modules, GLN representations, Modules, GLN representations, are irreducible, which means they are in general infinite-dimensional. So, this means that they contain no invariant closed subspaces, of course, other than the trivial ones. And this is really deep theorem. The proof is terribly complicated. And this result is really fundamental to the whole theory. And even during And even during today's talk, we will see a bunch of very important and interesting consequences of it. So, the first one, and Samuel's original motivation for proving this result, is the solution of McMullen's conjecture that says that the mixed volume, the examples of valuation that I showed on the previous slide, they actually already spanned a dense subset of the space of valuations. So, in this connection, let me point out that the space of valuations is actually Banach space as a result, as a consequence of McMahon's decomposition. Of MacBoll's decomposition and mixed volume span and then subset there. Another consequence of irreducibility theorem is that smooth valuations, smooth vectors of this GLN action, so smooth vector valuation is called smooth when this mapping from, so this gives you, if you fix phi, this gives you a mapping from the G from the Lee group GLN and to this Banach space evaluation. And then all smooth, whenever this mapping. Whenever this mapping is smooth, then the valuation is called smooth. And then it is a consequence of our disciple's theorem that those smooth vectors that are dense in the valuations, they are precisely representable in the following way. Namely, that they are either multiples of volume plus functions of this type, and this is just the integration of some differential form over the normal cycle that was discussed by Joe in his talk. So let me just briefly recall that the normal cycle of recall that the normal cycle of a convex body is an n minus one n minus one dimensional naturally oriented Lipschitz submanifold of the of the sphere bundle so you can integrate n minus forms over it and if the form is translation invariant this actually gives gives rise to a translation invariant valuation and you can verify smooth n more then it's the result is that that any smooth valuation is represented That any smooth valuation is representable in this way. And one more thing I want to stress out is that there is a natural topology, again this is a general representation theoretical framework, on the space of smooth vectors, which is stronger than the one induced for the Banach space of evaluations. And I will just assume for the rest of the talk that the smooth vectors For the rest of the talk, that smooth evaluations are equal there. And now, why this subspace of or the space of smooth evaluations is so important? Because as observed by Samyan, it can be equipped by certain algebraic structures. So, Samyon defined a natural product on this space that is commutative, associative, and respects degrading. It has also continuous and it has rather simple geometric meaning. Geometric meaning, which nonetheless I prefer to omit for today because we will not strictly need it for the rest of the talk. But instead, let me mention another important result of Semyon, and it was later reproved by Andras Bernick, namely that the product also satisfy a version of Poincar√© duality. So if you consider a K-homogeneous smooth valuation which is non-zero, then there is always valuation of the complementary degree. Of the complementary degree such that their product is non-zero. And this is again strong, very strong, important statement which uses whose proof uses the full irreducible term in its full generality. And later on, it was observed by Jofu that it is precisely this statement that is responsible for very deep and actually very useful connection between algebraic evaluation. Algebraic evaluations and an integral geometry. But I don't want to talk about this today. And then remarkably, there is another version of the product evaluations, the so-called Bernick-Fou convolution, which has similar properties as the L-squared product. It's also associative, commutative, continuous. And it admits, moreover, simple description in terms of the matrix. Moreover, a simple description in terms of the mixed volume. So, what you do, you just take two mixed volumes and you want them to be smooth. So, the mixed volumes are smooth whenever those bodies that are plugged in have smooth boundaries with positive curvature, strictly positive curvature. And then, what do you do multiplying those two mixed volumes? You just modulate some positive constant, normalizing constant. You just collect all these bodies into one single volume, whenever this makes sense. And whenever you exceed the number of salts in a mixed volume, this is just this is just. in a mixed volume is just this is just zero so so simple is the is the product is the is the product in terms of convolution product in terms of mixed volumes and uh during my talk we will mostly be occupied with this with this convolution prop and now those two algebraic structures the all-screen program behind full convolution they are in some precise sense dual to each other namely uh semi-defined a version of fourier transform for well A version of Fourier transform for evaluations. So we showed that there is a natural isomorphism of the space of valuations, which is actually an isomorphism of algebras when the source of equipment with the product and the touch with the convolution. So it intertwines those two products. And it also commutes with the restriction of the GLN group to SON. Actually, this can be strengthened. Strengthen, it can, I mean, by twisting the target space button by one-dimensional sub-space of densities, the Fourier transform can be rewritten in a formula that actually co-medes with the whole group GLN. But for our purpose, this is sufficient. And then another property of the Fourier transform that it maps isomorphically to each other subspaces of complementary. Subspaces of complementary degree. And as you expect from a Fourier transform, it also satisfies the following inversion formula. So square is identity on even valuation and its minus identity on odd valuations. But then there is even more stress. So already now you can see that there is a lot of algebraic structure on the space of smooth valuation, but there is even more. even more and namely there is the there are the following properties that in this full generality they are still a conjuncture that was first probably first formulated in my recent paper but most likely it had been considered before because as you will see those properties they just resemble or are in some let's say formal analogy with counterpart statements in in other tourists Counterpart statements in other theories, in particular in the theory of cohomology of compact colour manifolds. So what does it say? Well, consider an integer k non-negative integer which is less than the half of the dimension of our space. And then consider the following n minus one homogeneous valuations. They should be smooth, so again, this body, this. smooth so again this this body this body plugin mix volume is smooth in the in the in the sense i mentioned before and then we already know that there is a fourier transform which maps isomorphically these two spaces to each other and minus k-homogeneous violations to k-homogene violations but then the statement the claim is that there is a there is another huge family of isomorphisms that is induced by by by mapping in the convolution sense mapping in the convolution sense taking product and taking convolutions with those with those mixed volume n minus one homogeneous valuation so so you just take your phi n minus k homogeneous valuation and then you just multiply with the proper number of the right number of of those guys and the claim in order to end up in this space of k homogeneous valuation in the complementary degree and the claim is that this is an isomorphism and then you can ask you can just compose this isomorphism You can just compose this isomorphism with the product pairing, with the point current pairing, and then you can ask what's its parity, what's its signature. And with this, I'm getting to the second part of the conjecture, so-called Hoch-Riemann relations. And they say the following. So if the evaluation, if my evaluation phi is primitive in the following sense, so what do I do? I just apply this, this conjectured isomorphism. Isomorphism. So this is still not zero. If phi is non-zero, this is still non-zero. And then I apply once more, once again, this guy, this mixed volume. And if this is zero, then evolution is so-called primitive with respect to those guys, respect to those bodies. And then the claim is that the pairing, this composed pairing, so I apply this isomorphism and take the pairing with the valuation itself or with its bar if you want, then this is This is already a zero homogeneous violation, so a number, and it's actually a real number because those guys are reals, and I'm taking the complex conjugate here. Then this is positive or negative depending on the degree k. And now I should believe that this might be true. Well, it's been actually already proven in special cases. So, first, Simeon proves Harlash's theorem for Theorem for in the special case where all those bodies are actually Euclidean walls. And he also assumed that the valuation phi is even. So then he showed that there is such an isomorphism. Later on, the assumption of evenness was removed by Berning and Brecker. And as for the Hodge-Riemann relations, the Herblochester is known for the case of Euclidean balls, when all the bodies are Euclidean balls. When all the bodies are Euclidean balls. And then recently I was able to prove Hud-Riemann relations again in the case of Euclidean balls and under one of the following assumptions either for even valuations or for n minus one homogeneous valuations. And as for the general case, for general bodies, we proved recently together with Thomas that at least in dimension for k equal 1. for k equals one in codegree one the conjecture is true and for this you just need to you just need to this basically follows like module some general some some standard some standard valuation theoretical fact uh from the from alexandrov proof of the alexandro-fenkel inequality so so essentially this conjunction for k equals one is alexander-fenkel inequality or generalized slightly generalized and independently this was also And independently, this was also observed by Simeon. And finally, and this is what I would like to present today: we were able to prove Hutrium relations in the case for the Euclidean balls without any additional assumptions, so for any valuations. So how do we do it? Well, as I mentioned at the beginning, we study how the space evaluations behave under the action of the group of rotations. So, in order to present our results, let me assume for simplicity that the dimension of our space is even. There are counterparts of everything what I will tell you, also for odd dimension. But just for simplicity, let me assume this. And then the irreducible subs. Now, you have the space of valuations, of let's say of our homogeneous valuations, and these spaces are reducible or if you restrict to a given parity these spaces are reducible under the action of the full group GLN but it's certainly reducible under the action of this small compact group and according to the the general Peterwald theorem it actually decomposes into into direct sum of irreducible subspaces of the of the special of the gun group and now the the irreducible The irreducible representations of the special auto-agonic group are parametrized by the following set. This correspondence can be precise using so-called highest rate. But let me just say that this set of L tuples of integers is correspondent with equivalence classes of irreducible representations of SOL2L. So these are some increasing integers, not Increasing integers, non-negative integers, and the last one can be positive, but still, can be negative, but still in absolute value less than the L minus first one. And then Sebu and Alaska and Drus Bernick and Franz Schuster, they precisely characterized which irreducible subspaces from this set appear in the decomposition of R-homogeneous and minus R-homogeneous valuation. So, first of all, the decomposition. Valuation. So, first of all, the decomposition of those two spaces are the same. We already know this because we already know that there is a SON interquiring isomorphism between those two spaces for the transform. And what they showed that the weights, the arguments of substances, they actually appear have to satisfy the following three conditions, actually. So, first of all, the first integer is never one, and the second one is at most two, and then moreover. And then, moreover, there is only the number of non-zero slots in this L-tuple is at most R, and R corresponds to the degree of homogeneity. And moreover, each of these representations appears with multiplicity ones, where there's just one copy in each irreducible, in each decomposition of any of these irreducible representations. Irreducible representations. And well, now what we do, we construct in each of these representations some some non-trivial vector, some non-trivial valuation. Moreover, we construct the so-called highest weight vectors. So if you do these choices in order to make this correspondence, this L-tuple and irreducible representation somehow explicit, then you Explicit, then you do some choices. And if you do these choices, then in your representation, there is a distinguished one-dimensional subspace of the so-called highest-weight vectors. And this has some advantageous properties. And we construct precisely those highest-weight vectors. So, how do we do it? So, we want to, so we know our priority high-value vectors are smooth, so we want to construct some smooth evaluation. So, we will construct differential forms on the sphere bundle. And for this, we use the so-called notion of double forms. So, this just means that we just twist our space of differential forms that we are interested in. We just build some elements here with just skew symmetric complex valued forms on Rn. And we will see in a second why this is useful. Is useful here. So maybe something at first, some technicality. So we just use complex valued coordinates on these two copies of Rn where we embed the sphere bundle. So just the standard complex value coordinates, these for the first component, zetas for the second one. And then we consider the following double forms, namely elements of this space. So for any subset of indices that appear. subset of indices that appear that appear here and indices for for the for in the complex coordinates they consider following double forms so we just so this is just uh these are just the coordinate coordinate coordinate functions and the differentials and we twist it in any case with it with with this dzi and so with with with those one forms from this from this those one forms from this from this from this from this twist and in our construction we use those special those special actually just those two special sets so in capital k i just consider the first k indices without bars so just those two guys corresponding to the first row here and then j is just the rest just the complement in this set of all indices and then we define the following form just by this very simple formula Just by this very simple formula. So we consider some powers of these double forms. Well, they are now double forms. So we can take powers and they will no longer be zeros in general because they are skew symmetric in the first part, but also skew symmetric in the second part, at least for this one, for instance. So you can consider powers. So we can consider the following product of powers of those two double forms. And then you can count that there is actually n. is actually n in total of them so the the the overall power is n so in the in the second in the second factor of a double form factor you will have to have the following expression the following determinantal expression because there whenever you have some repetition then then you just get zero so which in the in the second factor we necessarily get this and then we just factor it out and whatever remains in the first factor we just denote by omega rk and then just uh we just multiply We just multiply it by some power of the first spherical coordinate. And now we prove that this form actually defines a non-zero valuation. So it may happen that even non-zero form defined by this construction a zero valuation. But there is a very useful device to distinguish what forms give you zero valuations based on the so-called Riemann differential due to Bernie Ken. Uh, due to Bernie Kendre. And so we can explicitly compute the Riemann differential of our format and see that it's non-zero. So it actually defines non-zero violation. And we can also prove that it's a highest way vector of the desired highest way. So in other words, we just construct highest way vectors corresponding to all these highest weight that appears in this all-carbon-chister decomposition. As for jokes, they are just invariant, so we are. For those, they are just invariants so they are just the intrinsic volumes that were also discussed by Joe in his talk. So they do not really fit into our into this description. So we prefer to omit them. And as for the other ones, well, they can be easily constructed just from those. So I will also omit those in the statement of this term. And I already mentioned that we can actually explicitly compute the action of Riemann. The action of Riemann differential, for instance, on this on this form. And this is really where the double forms come into play. So, not only that this expression is so simple, but if we express everything in double forms, we can also perform explicit computations on it, which is, so, for instance, the computer, the Riemann differential, it's a tricky task in general, but using double forms, we can manage. manage and but we can we can do better namely we can we can also explicitly evaluate the algebraic structures i i was i was uh i was reviewing in the in the first part of my talk so first we can compute the the point carry pairing of of those of those highest weight vectors so just just taking the the the has weight vectors so complementary degree Degree. The only non-zero pairing is, of course, on the spaces by Schurz-Lama, of course, on those spaces that are isomorphic, on the isomorphic SON representation. And again, we can compute this explicitly, and we get this is some positive number a, which again we know explicitly times minus one to k. Further, we can express explicitly the action of Fourier transform. The action of Fourier transform on our valuations and getting the following simple formula. And finally, we can express again explicitly what is the action of this Lapschetz operator with respect to the Euclidean ball. So taking the convolution with the following mixed volume will give us again a high-weight vector from our family times some. From our family, times some positive constant that is again known explicitly to us and printed in our preprint. And now a consequence of this is that almost immediate consequence of parts A and C of this theorem is that we can show Hutch-Riemann relations for evaluations. Because Because we know what the action of this Lefschetz operator is explicitly, and we know that so we just act, we just start with some n minus r homogenous volation, we apply it multiple times, and then we get until we get to the complementary degree, we are just getting some positive numbers here, and then just we have to. Numbers here, and then just we have to pair it with the complex conjugate of the devaluation we began with. And this number, so we are getting some positive number times minus one to k, which is precisely the kind of behavior we need. So a consequence of the previous term is the following statement that whenever the evaluation is primitive in the following sense, and here I just using the definition, the very definition of convolution product in terms of. Of convolution product in terms of mixed volumes. I just collected all those balls into one single mixed volume. So this is the same as the product of mixed volumes with one single volume evolution per modulus, some positive constant. So I can just express the primitive condition like this. So whenever the valuation is primitive in this sense, we show that this pairing. This pairing, this pairing composed by this, applying this isomorphism and then taking the Alaska-Point pairing is either positive or negative, depending on K. And there is another consequence of this, namely that as pointed out to us by Ramon van Handel, this can, at least for K. k at least for k equals 2 this can be strengthened a bit namely you can just by some some some simple cons consideration some simple algebraic considerations you can just replace one of those balls by a general convex body provided you know howlations and how left in degree one in the full generality which we do so if you do this then you can replace one of the balls by general convex body Replace one of the balls by a general convex body, and in particle, this gives you that the general conjecture that I presented before is true in dimensions at most four. And now, as observed by Samyan, the Haud-Truman relations, they can have very explicit geometric meaning. So, for instance, in 4k equal 1, the Haud-Truman relations again, so conversely, Again, so conversely implies the Alexandro-Fenkla inequality. And then there are more inequalities derived by Semeon from the results that we had previously had before, not in this generality, but you can easily generalize them using Hoch-Riemann relations in the generality we now have. And namely, if you use Hoch-Riemann relations for codegree 2, then you can just consider. Codegree two, then you can just consider the following smooth codegree evaluation in R4. So just if you erase this m, this is two more n minus two homogeneous valuation, two homogeneous valuation in R2. And if it satisfies the following condition by multiplying by m, if it's primitive, then Hotchumann relations immediately gives you the following geometric inequality for among mixed volumes of mixed volumes of certain bodies, K is NL. And this is basically what I wanted to present. So I would like to thank you very much for your attention. Yeah, we thank you. If somebody wants to ask, please raise your hand or just not. I think Leo already has raised his hand. Yes. Yes, hi. So, maybe you answered it. I don't know, but so the valuation you showed there are of the form integral on the normal cycle of a form. And then when you do the product or the convolution, does it correspond to some kind of wedge product of the form or something like that? It does something like that. Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, there is a exactly. So, there is a Exactly. So there is a rather simple formula for the convolution product, which is due to Andraspernik and Ludwig Heka, I guess. Or maybe it's due to Chofu. I'm not sure now whether it appears, but it's yeah, it's basically model taking some something like that. Yeah. So Hodge star. Okay, more char than you is just a wedge product. Okay, thanks. So I think Joe was next. Yeah, hi, that was very interesting. So I guess you can tell, for example, which of these special spaces, these fives, are even an odd from your Fourier transform stuff. And do you have any thoughts about what the Crofton measures might be for the? Might be for the even ones. You mean for the high state vectors? Yes, that's right. No, so no, not explicitly. Not explicitly. So, so there are, so you can, I mean, you can. So you can, I mean, you can represent valuation the even ones, the even valuations also in terms of claim functions, right? Klein functions. And then the Crofton measure is just apply for that matter, the signal consent transform. And so no, I don't know, I don't know. So so I so no. Actually, we have not even related to the to the claim function. So so to the claim function so so so right so so most pro so there is this construction of highest weight of highest weight uh uh highest weight vectors uh for function among functions on on grass mandates but uh it might be that uh that it uses like you know like different different sort of like different choice of the of the maximal torus and so on so so I don't know I don't know I don't know any explicitly about so what do you use from the technical viewpoint in order to determine the Fourier transform of these highest weights so so it's basically generalization of your argument with your argument with Andres and at some point we need to use the compatibility of Fourier transform with the whole group GLM but just at one single point and then what we use is just some kind of induction and I actually printed it so I have one more slide here so we can we can explicitly compute So we can explicitly compute the, because I promised it in my abstract, so we can also compute explicitly the action of some natural pullback among inclusions and push-forward projections. Again, there are some explicit expressions like this, and then we know that those two maps are compatible. They are intern quiet by the Fourier transform, and then gives you some framework for induction. So, this is mostly what we use for the computation of Fourier transform. And you use the extra. And you use the explicit formula one has for the query transform in two dimensions, right? Right, right. So you start in dimension two and then just, right? So this inclusion, this, for instance, this pullback along inclusion relates valuations in dimension n and valuations in dimension one less. So exactly. So you have not only induction. not only induction in dimension, but also in the in these numbers case, right? So because this also lowers k. Yeah, so thanks again and it seems that we have a break and after this you And after this, Julian Scheier will continue. So, in Frankfurt.
