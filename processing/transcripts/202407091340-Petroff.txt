Great other ideas to chemical environments. Oh, sorry, this is just a vertical slice of mud that I pulled off of a beach in Massachusetts. So basically you have a bunch of things like oxygen and sulfate and things like that that are up in the water. They diffuse down. As they diffuse into the mud, they're consumed. And so you get a bite scale coming out of it. So every couple of millimeters that you go down into the sediment, you get a chemically distinct new environment. New environment. So the bacteria that live within this, you know, there are a billion bacteria per cubic centimeter, and they have to position themselves relative to the surface quite well. And so there are a few different reasons that the microbes need to move up and down through this to position themselves. The most obvious one is that these gradients change. So if this is what option looks like in the middle of the night, if you come back in the morning, sun is shining on the surface, photosynthesis is happening. Photosynthesis is happening, and so you get a source of oxygen, and so now all of the bacteria that were living just below the penetration depth of oxygen need to move down about a thousand body lengths every day. So, this has been going on and on for four billion years. So that's like a trillion bacterial generations. And it's been really, and so clearly it's very useful to know the difference between up and down. So, nature being convoluted and completionist, not only have they figured out how to tell the difference between. Not only have they figured out how to tell the difference between up and down, they found sort of every possible way of doing it. So you can just measure gravity directly. If you're interested in the chemical gradients, you can measure those directly. You can measure the light gradients as light is absorbed by the sand grains. And the weird one, which is the one that I'm focused on here, is a geomagnetic field. So I have a terrible sense of direction, even at the best of times. I think north is that way, but of course it's not. We're in the northern hemisphere. In the northern hemisphere. So, north is more like that way because the field lines are curving back towards the center of the earth. So, if you swim due north, you're mostly swimming down. If you swim due south, you're mostly swimming up. And so the bacteria that I'm interested in are using the geomagnetic field to move up and down between different bands. We can talk about why if you're interested. Here we're going to focus on how. So, this is really nice in a sense. You can tell the difference between up and down. You can tell the difference between up and down by coupling your motion to an external field. And you've got a number of different choices. But whatever choice you make, you're going to have to balance motion along that field with motion around all the sand curves. So how do you balance obstacle avoidance with motion connected to an external field? We're going to study this experimentally, and we're going to use this bacterium right here. Its name is Magnetoglobus multicellular virus. This multicellular varus. And you know, it's a spherical thing. You'll see a scale bar in a second. This one's probably about four microns in diameter. The weird thing about that is that this is not a bacterium. This is a group of about 20 bacteria. So you can vaguely see reticulated lines here, and those are the separations between individual cells. So this is a multicellular species of bacteria. As the bacteria within the colony grow and divide, the entire colony gets bigger and eventually divides symmetrically. And eventually it divides symmetrically. So, this is an obligately multicellular bacteria. Weird. There are beautiful questions you can ask about how the cells are packed in these little colonies. If you look at them head-on, you can see nice spiral patterns of the cells are twisted about in these helices that wrap around the entire colony. It's really beautiful, and I have very little intelligence to say about it. So, taking a step forward, let's just focus on magnetotaction. Let's just focus on magnetotaxics. So, to be magnetotactic, you need two things. You need to be tactic, you need to be able to go through the lung. So, the outer surface of each individual cell within the colony is covered in about 30 flagella. So, a colony has between 1 and 2,000 flagella that coat the entire thing. And they spin to pull and push the entire colony through the water. So, that's how they move. You can see these little black dots. You can see these little black dots within this is a transmission electron micrograph. These little black dots correspond to magnetic particles that these bacteria have precipitated, depending on how this one, the particular life history of this individual, it's either magnetite or driftite. So these little magnets give the entire colony a permanent magnetic moment. So the entire trick of magnetotaxis is to swim in the same direction as your magnetic moment. As your magnetic moment. Here's what that looks like. So here's a little cartoon. You're swimming in some direction U, you've got a magnetic moment M. Let's say that you're misaligned with the ambient field. So there's a magnetic torque that rotates the colony to align with the field. And as it does that, it's going to swim forward. So here's what that looks like. I'm going to start off with a magnetic field pointed straight upwards. And about halfway through the video, I'm going to turn the field to the right. And you're going to see a blue line that shows the average direction that the bacteria are. The average direction that the bacteria are swimming. Oh, and this is one little minute where it was column there for this fall. So they swim upwards. Looking at this, it seems like there's a pretty low rotational diffusion coefficient. You can measure it, and it is pretty low. Now we turn it, and the entire flock realigns. Yeah, it's weird. Like nature weird in tooth and claw and whatever the hell these guys are covered with. These guys are family with. So, the mechanism for this is quite simple. You know, it's been known since back around the 1980s. So, all it is is it's a balance between the viscous torque on a sphere as it rotates through the fluid. So, you get 8 times UA cubed, and you've got a magnetic torque of m times b. So, balancing the two gives you the rate at which you align with the field. And this is nice. These bacteria are not sensing. Bacteria are not sensing the magnetic field the way that I'm sensing the light in the room. They're not burning calories to sense the magnetic field. They're just aligning to it just like a compass. And then they're swimming in that direction. So this is magnetotaxis in a bulk fluid. These things don't live in a bulk fluid. They live surrounded on all sides by sandburns. So about a year or two ago, we published a paper on how they interact with just a single surface. I mean to just give you Surface. I mean to just give you some intuition for that. And then we'll get into the more interesting case of what happens in a complex network of poles. You have a solid line here. If you measure the rotational diffusion coefficient, sort of naively what you would expect is if a wall does nothing but prevent motion through the wall, just giving you a normal force, then these things would swim towards the wall, hang out there for about a minute before rotational diffusion turned them around, and then they'd pop away and And turn them around and then they pop away and hit again. They don't do that. They build up in this little band where, you know, this is, I think this is about 100 micron here. Yeah, it's about 100 micron here. So they hit the wall, and so what's happening here is you've got a colony, it's covered with all these flagella, it swims forward, it hits a wall. Now, all of a sudden, all its flagella are rebuilding against the wall. There's now a net torque on the colony that twists it away and it turns it away from the wall. Away from the hole. But there are nice experiments that you can do here. You can increase the magnetic field to decrease this line scale, and you can see that you can compress everybody towards the wall. You can even have some fun and increase the magnetic field so much that the distance you swim away from the wall before you come back at it becomes smaller than the diameter of an individual colony. And then they're just plastered up against the wall. And you can watch how they shake over there. And you can see that the rotational diffusion coefficient increases by about an order of magnitude when they're in contact with the surface. In contact with the surface as opposed to when they're. But, you know, all that's fun, we can talk about it more if you want. But the basic physical picture that emerges from how you interact with a flat surface is just delightfully simple. You align with the ambient magnetic field, you hit the wall, you're randomly turned, and then you escape in some direction. And then you just do that again and again and again. So if you want a physical, oh, here's a picture that'll give you a reputation. So this is the trajectory of one colony. So, this is the trajectory of one colony returning back to the surface. And so, it's deterministically and smoothly turning towards the wall, and then it's going to pop off again. And these are just sort of jumping up and down. So if you want a physical analog to this, you can imagine sort of a rough plate that you're vibrating. You put a grain of sand on it, it moves deterministically in the air, hits the surface, and gets a random kick. So they're just sort of bouncing around like fools. Characteristic line scale here is just the turning rate. Scale here is just the turning rate and the swimming speed. So, what happens if you're in some sort of natural porous geometry like this? You're surrounded on all sides by sand coatings? So, there are two things going on. You're aligning to the external magnetic field, and you've got some rate at which you do that. And you're being scattered whenever you hit a wall. So, if you take the ratio of these two rates, you get a number that we're going to call the scattering number. And you can work out exactly what it is. We know gamma is just balancing viscosity with magnetic torque. The denominator here is just how long does it typically take you to swim between one sand grain and the other. So that's going to give you the rate at which you're randomly rewinded. So how should the trajectories of these through this porous network depend on the value of the scattering number? So, you know, you can do an easy case unless you say the scattering number is zero. You're not aligning to the magnetic. Is zero. You're not aligning to the magnetic field. You hit one wall, you randomly reorient, you hit another, and you just sort of bounce about, and you're just doing period fusion. No surprise there. There's no net drift motion, you're not aligning to anything, and so you're not moving in any average direction. If this number is infinity, then you swim towards a sand grain, you hit it, and now you just wait for the sand grain to get out of your way. To get out of your way. Right? It's not going to do that. And so, at infinite scattering number, the drift velocity through the porous network should also be zero. So if you take the average of zero and infinity, you get one. And so if you make the scattering number something of order one, you'd expect them to sort of pop through here reasonably quickly. Let's see if we're right. So we can control the scattering number experimentally because I can control what the applied magnetic field is. Control what the applied magnetic field is, so I can control gamma, and I can build microfluidic devices to make the pore size any diameter that I want within reason. So here's one of my microfluidic devices. It's just a square lattice of pillars. I can just highlight those a little bit. So I've got my square lattice. So the spaces between these pillars is my looping network. And the question is: how are you going to move through this? Question is: How are you going to move through this? So if you've got very good eyes, that's a magnetoglobus right there. That's not. That's something that got stuck in my PDMS. So I'm just going to subtract out the background, and now you can see two columns. I'm just subtracting out the background and convolving with a Laplacian and Gaussian filter just to highlight things a bit. Here's my scattering number. So here it's very low. So it's about 1 over 20. So it's about 1 over 20. So you can think about this as you would swim about 24 diameters before you align with the magnetic field. So you hit this wall, you would try to swim all the way over here before you return back towards the magnetic field. Clearly, you're going to hit a bunch of stuff along the way, so this should be pretty diffusive. The magnetic field here is to the right. And so if we start in the movie, you see things just sort of popping about. See things just sort of popping about and sort of running it in every which way. And they just kind of do that for a while. So you get some lucky ones that sort of pop ahead quickly. You'll see, you know, you've got some winners, you've got a bunch of them that are still trying to find the entrance. It is to the right. Stage right? I don't know. I'm not a theater person. That way. Sorry? Oh, sorry. This is 300 microns. The distance between here and here is 2.5 millimeters. Alright, so now let's turn up the magnetic field by a factor of 60. So now we're at a scattering number of 4. So you hit a wall here and you try to jump from about here to about here before you realign with the magnetic field. Here's what that looks like. Here's what that looks like. So now they're moving quickly through the open boards, but then they hit a wall and they get stuck there for a while. And you can see that some of them are getting stuck for quite a while. Some of them are getting lucky, but a bunch of them are getting stuck. So if you average all of their velocities through this pore space, you're being slowed down by a bunch of laggins. All right. So here's that magic number one, or as close as I could get to it by pulling bacteria out of the mud, sticking them into a microfluidic device, measuring what their magnetic moments are, and trying to do that in 20 minutes before the start of the experiment. I couldn't get you one, but I got you 1.1. My students. I helped. So, in this case, the sort of size of the jumps that you get are of order the radius of the port. Order the radius of the pore. And now you can see that they just sort of pop through here with remarkably little trouble. If you watch this for a minute, there are a few bacteria here, a lot of bacteria here, some strippers, but definitely fewer here than here. There seems to be a wave moving through this. There's some non-zero drift belox. Okay, so it seems that drift beloved. Okay, so it seems that drift velocity is somehow correlated with what the scattering number should be. And it sort of roughly matches our intuition. It'd be nice to quantify this bird. Oh, okay. So that guy there, that's a marine ciliate, erostidia. I wanted to include that here, so you can't buy these bacteria. If you want to study them, you start with a bucket full of mud from the swamp, and you stick magnets next to the side, and then you pull, then you pipe. And then you pull, then you pipette fluid away from the surface of the magnet, and you design a microfluidic chamber to turn the thousand species that you're loading your microfluidic chip to a high enrichment of the one bacterium that we care about. And every once in a while, a cigleate gets in there, and then it brutally devours the MMB as it gets. It's like watching lions eat the zells. I think that's important, actually. We can find a theater and we'll talk about it. Now we'll buy the theater. Now I'll buy this, whatever my document. All right. So we want to quantify this in some sort of a meaningful way. So my lattices are big, but they're not huge. So it's sort of difficult in all but the most egregious cases to measure adrift velocity from the sort of average motion of colonies through the entire lattice. So let's focus on one individual port. So this is at that lowest gap. So, this is at that lowest scattering number, so everybody's pretty diffusive. So, here we go. Somebody pops in, they bang about, hit the walls a whole bunch, and eventually escape against the direction of the magnetic fields. Somebody else comes in, pops in a bit, and then escapes in the positive direction. So the first one was unlucky, the second one was lucky. There's an obvious one-dimensional model that you can make here. We did the obvious things, you just say that there's Obvious things. You just say that there's a line of pores, and there's some rate at which you move in the direction of the magnetic field, and some rate at which you move back. So you can measure what k plus and k minus are, then you can get the drift velocity and the diffusion coefficient. So in the next slide, I need to start recording the drift velocities. Keep in mind that the way that I'm doing that is I'm measuring k plus, I'm measuring k minus, and then inferring what the drift velocity should be. What the drift velocity should be. So, if we only care about the pore scale of dynamics, then let's look at things on the scale of pores. So, here's just one little section of it. These pores are about twice the size of the ones that I just showed you, so that affects what magnetic fields that we're using. But, so here is one colony, one magnetoglobus colony. And if we watch them zip about, we can track them. So I know how many are in this chamber, how many are in this, and since I'm tracking them, Common area of this, and since I'm tracking them, I know when they move in the forward direction or in the backwards direction. That got weirdly pixelated on the projector. It looked nicer on my screen. But it's okay. We need it necessarily. So, we can measure k plus and k minus by looking at the rates at which they move from here to here and the rates at which they move from here to here. And then we can do that for a bunch of different magnetic fields and at a few different chamber diameters. It's actually a very difficult experiment. Diameters. It's actually a very difficult experiment. We have to change the chamber diameter for non-obvious reasons that we can talk about. But we change it by a factor of sort of two. And if you measure the drift velocity, or you infer the drift velocity from k plus and k minus, as a function of sc, it's rate of zero where it's zero. That's nice. That's exactly what you expect from symmetry. But in order to set up these magnetic fields, then you actually need to cancel out Earth's magnetic field, and you need to cancel out the magnetic field that's actually. To cancel out the magnetic field that actually throws into the microscope objective that you're using to watch these things. So, 0 is 0 corresponds to: we did an okay job making our magnetic field. It seems to go up. My students, who I think are listening right now, are working on filling in this gap a little bit here. But I think that this number is smaller than this number. So it kind of looks like it goes up and comes back down. Neat, so it looks like there might be some optimal scattering number to move quickly through this number. Number to move quickly through this number. So that's a lot of slides about just looking at data. There's no sort of a model going on here. But we have a model. It's not what I told you about at the beginning, where you turn deterministically through the fluid, you hit a wall, and you randomly scatter. And so you've got, so this is simple differential equations. This just swim in the direction of your magnetic moment. Magnetic moment turns in the direction of the magnetic field. And. And here we have non-dimensionalized time by the rate at which you align with the field, and distance by how far you swim in that time. So the radius of the pore becomes the scattering number. This is a thermalized simulation. So you can see there are more colonies here than here. So k plus is currently greater than k minus. And so you can simulate this for a bunch of different, for a bunch of different scattering numbers. And here's what you get. And so there are no fit parameters here. This is just a No fit parameters here. This is just a pure comparison between observation and a simple model for hit the wall, turn around. It looks okay. So, you know, we can be a little proud of that. We have some data points. We have a line going through them, and we understand the two. I'm a little vain about this plot. I think my students did something impressive here because everything I started by telling you at the beginning of the talk. By telling you at the beginning of the talk, it's useful to go quickly through a porter space. You need to do that to outrun oxygen, you need to do that to position yourself well. Making your drift velocity large is evolutionarily important. If that's not nonsense, then this is a one-dimensional slice of a fitness landscape, and it's got a local maximum. So presumably, natural selection should tune. Natural selection should tune this scattering number such that you're right about here. Okay, there's a nice way of writing that, which is there are some variables here that natural selection can act upon, the cell size, the swimming speed, and the magnetic moment. And there are some environmental parameters like how big of the pores around you, the geomagnetic field, and the viscosity of water. This is how we're trained to. You know, we're trained to think about evolution, right? Like, my body would be a different shape if I grew up on a different planet. Your phenotype matches your environment. And here you can write that down in at least a way that's dimensionally correct. Is it actually correct? I don't know. Or I don't know. I think I've got a good guess. So all this comes down to, this is my last slide. So you should tune your turning distance to be able Tune your turning distance to be of order the poor size. We can measure the swimming speed, size, and magnetic moment. And so if these three, so we've got these three numbers. If we calculate this ratio, it should be, you know, more than a micron, less than a couple millimeters. So we can do that. And it's about 100 microns. So maybe natural selection did two of these parameters to line up here. A little bit encouraging. A little bit encouraging. There's one more thing we can do. So, if you so, on that second slide I showed you, I said natural selection had found every possible solution for telling up from down. It's even more convoluted than that. It's found every possible solution multiple times. So here are two other magnetotactic bacteria. This one's called Magnetococcus, and this one is called Magnetosporimum. This is multicellular, these are unicellular, these are not closely related. These are not closely related. This is like comparing a horseshoe crab to a butterfly to a cicada. They are separate. They evolve magnetotaxis independently. These two are pretty well studied. So if you look up what their swimming speeds, magnetic moments, and sizes are, they vary tremendously. Speeds vary by an order of magnitude, magnetic moments vary by an order of 25, sizes vary by an order of 5, aspect ratio vary. Order of five, aspect ratio varies by a factor of six. You look at their turning distances, they're all the same to within sort of 10-ish percent. So I think this is natural selection tuning the phenotypes of magnetotactic bacteria to swing quickly through pore spaces. I don't know how to end it, but I think Darwin was onto something. So, this is where we got our mud. Here are some students. I'm humiliated that it was stormy when my students. Was stormy when my students and I collected mud. So, none of these students are actually the authors of this paper. So, I'm sorry if you're listening. Thank you. Do we have a few questions maybe while I say I would like to know about the dependence on the shape of your pore? You know, it kind of worries me a little bit that you're. worries me a little bit that your pores have like these like four edges that might be creating a kind of chaotic billiard, let's say. If you think about dynamic billiards. Yeah. So it looks like a chaotic structure. So I wanted a square lattice because those are pretty easy to sort of get a bunch of lattice spaces on. If you just make a square lattice of circles, there's a shortest path that you can swing. Shortest path that you can swim directly due north where you miss every obstruction. So I just put in those little square walls just so there's not a direct path from one side to the other. You don't have to put one after the other, but like sure, yes, there are other choices that I could have made. It's just that they come back, remote. So I was wondering if this coming back is due to the shape of the port. So I showed you one pore shape. We actually do three different pore shapes where we go from more from. Go from more from so I started with a circle, so I did most of these experiments with circles. I've got some which are sort of squares and flat in front of it, and some which are squares that are rotated 90 degrees. And the curve that I showed you actually doesn't change meaningfully at all. And you can understand why. The ways that you're interacting with these pores, if I had a longer talk, I could have shown you the histogram of the positions in the pore. And it's basically just you build up. You build up to within a scattering distance of the end. So, a scattering distance one just means you're hanging out mostly, banging around in the spaces in the north-facing half of the core that you're in. And that sort of thing. You're not in contact with the walls for all that long. So, you're right, maybe we should try different core spaces, but you know, from shapes. Yes. I think we should keep questions for the discussion. For the discussion, I know there will be many quotes. Thank you. Thank you very much, Addison. And we are now ready to listen to Massey ECC ECC telling us about building creations. Thank you. So I'm going to try to explain what this title means, really. Maybe that's a good start. And so now we're back to completely different stories. Completely different Google in progress. That's Alex.
