I'd like to thank the organizers, of course, for organizing and for inviting me. I've never been to Bank before. It's very lovely. So I will be talking about Killie Incidents Props. And this is based on a paper which hopefully will be on archive very soon. And this is joint work with Alexei, Sabrina, Tobo, and Johannes. I say their first name, first names already. Their first name, my first name, so I write their last names because I can't pronounce all of their last names. So I am going to start with this graph. And I have this graph, and I want to use it to define an incident structure. Okay, and I want to define this. Okay, and I want to define this incident structure using the vertices of this graph as the points, and then some cliques in this graph as the blocks. And you may notice that so we look at this graphs and we ask what are the cliques. I mean, we have edges, right? Have edges, right? I'm going to define those as trivial, and I'm not interested. And the only other thing that we have there is our triangles. And in fact, you can see that each vertex is contained in exactly two triangles. So we look at this vertex, it's contained in this red triangle and this green triangle. Okay? And so. And so I make an incidence graph. Here are my vertices. So let's call this one one. And it's going to be adjacent to this red triangle and this green triangle. Okay? And then these two vertices, let's say two and three, are also incident to this red triangle. To this red triangle. Pretty simple. And I mean, incidence graphs such as these have been studied quite a bit. But what I get here is going to be a 2, 3 bi-regular bipartite graph which is very nice. Which is very nice. And that's something that I want something. I want to get an incident structure with some nice properties. In particular, I want it to be biregular. And now I'm going to give you another example, which I'm not going to draw, because I don't think it's necessary. I'm going to take K7, and I'm going to tell you. Okay, and I'm going to tell you the same thing. I want to make an instance structure where the points are going to be the vertices and the blocks are going to be some cliques. And I just say some cliques, right? Obviously, there is a seven clique. The whole graph is a clique, right? We could take that as our block. That's going to give us a star. I'm again going to define this as trivial. Define this as trivial, and I'm not interested. So then it's not clear what cliques we want to take. I'm not necessarily going to take all the cliques as my blogs. And so instead, what I'm going to do, instead of looking at my graphs and Looking at my graphs and trying to figure out what the incidence structure is that I want, I'm going to define something called Kaylee incidence graphs. So what's going to happen is that we start with the Cayley graph, and then the sort of the connection set of the Kaylee graph is going to tell us how we want to make this instance graph. I'm just very I'm just very well. I'm not quite gonna define a killigraph. Other people have done that. So we have a group, we have a subset, and I'm gonna assume that it's inverse closed. And then the K liga has vertex that equal to the group, and then g and h are adjacent if h inverse g is in the subset. Okay, so that's a Kelly graph. You may notice that both k7 and this graph are Killigraphs. Um and so like I told you, it's not it's not clear how we get our incident structure from this graph, but we do get one and I will tell you that this is the smallest example of a Cayley graph that's going to give us a Cayley incidence graph that's non-trivial in a way. Cayley incidence graphs do not arise from any Cayley graph or from any group. From any Kayleigh graph or from any book. So let me give you a definition. And this is pretty recent. It was defined last year by these authors here. And so the story behind this is kind of that my friend Sabrina and I, we have talked about We have talked about working on something together for a long time. And I like Haley graphs, and she likes bipartite graphs. And we thought about this for a little bit, and then she found this definition, and it kind of was, it seemed like exactly the right thing. In this paper, they use these graphs. They sort of, the paper is about construction. The paper is about constructing bipartite expanders. So they define those graphs in order to do that. They don't really, they're not really studying their sort of properties on their own at all. So what we are doing is pretty new. Everything I'm going to tell you is pretty basic, but still new. So it's kind of cool. Okay. So we take a group. Okay, so we take a group and we're going to take a set of subsets of this group. And these subsets are going to satisfy the following. They all have the same size, which we're going to call K. They, so every pair intersects in exactly the identity. So all of them contain the identity of the group, but if we forget about the identity, they are a partition of some subset of the group. And I might refer to it as a partition. I also might refer to these things as cells. They're not quite, but they're almost that. And then there is sort of a weird condition. Weird condition that for each cell and each element in this cell, if we sort of translate the cell by the inverse of this element, this is going to be also in our Be also in our partition. Okay? It seems like kind of an arbitrary condition, but it is going to give us what we want, basically. Okay, so we have taken a group and a set of subsets of the. And the set of subsets of this group satisfying these weird conditions. And then we're going to define a byproduct graph on vertex sets. I'm going to call the two sides of the vertex gamma and beta. So gamma is just going to be the group elements. Those are going to be the points. Elements. Those are going to be the points in the incident structure. And then beta is going to be a set of translates of these cells by the group balance. Okay. Um Um and then the Cayley incidence graph denoted by CIN of GM pi so it has So it has vertex set gamma union beta and then a group element G is just adjacent to this translate G times C for any C in the partition. Okay. And so this condition here, so these cells here, they don't have to be inverse closed. But this condition tells us that if we take the union of the cells, that set is going to be inverse closed. Okay, so we're going to define the underlying Cayley graph of this Cayley incidence graph and the k graph of this group. The kick graph of this group with respect to a set that I'm going to call Si, which is just the union of the Ci and then minus the identity. Okay, so what we've done is that uh so that's a supply. Uh sorry, that's S supply. Let me just throw it right there. Sorry? Which one? The S is equal to we've defined the Kaylee instance graph using a group and some partition, but we can also start with the Kaylee graph, look at the connection set, and ask Can we partition the connection set in a way that gives us something like this? That satisfies these additions? Okay. What we get is going to be an incident structure, like I mentioned, and it will always be biregular. Bi regular. So the vertices have a fixed degree. So the points have a fixed degree and the blocks have a fixed degree. And the degree of the points is going to be the number of cells. I used L usually for the number of cells. And the degree of the blocks is going to be the size of the cells, which is K. Which is k. Okay? So our first example that we saw was an example for this group here, that three squared. With finaxes that these are strings, not it's not twenty and ten, it's two zero and one zero. 2010. And the partition that we take is this one. So we have this would be one cell and this would be another cell. So then we add the identity to them both. And the reason why we could sort of look at it and pick out the good cliques is because each of these cells is actually inverse closed. Each of these cells is actually inverse closed, we could sort of color the triangles that we got in a natural way. And now I'm going to return to the K7 example. So this is a K graph for the cyclic group on seven elements where the connection set is everything, right? Except for zero. And the partition that we're going to take is the following So we have zero, one, and three, we have zero, two, and six, and then zero, four, and five. And so, what we're going to get is a 3-5-regular graph, because we have three cells and each one has size 3. So, it's actually a 3-regular graph. And I'm going to draw it for you, and maybe some of you might recognize it, possibly. 14 vertices. What? Does it have 14 vertices? Yes. Is it the Haywood graph? Well, you spoiled my. Well, you spoiled my I guess I don't have to draw it now, I can just throw it on the ground lead a group now. What? Crystaline. Yeah. Yeah. It is a human draw. Very good. The Hewitt graph is, some of you might know, the incidence graph of the final plane. And here's our first theorem. Achilles graph For a complete KL graph. So if we start with the complete, if the underlying KL graph of a KD incidence graph is complete, then this K incidence graph is A 2MK1 design, also called the Steiner system. Okay. And this is kind of cool because the complete graphs are really like the most boring graphs, right? They you're You're thinking about kv graphs, and the complete graphs are your like most trivial examples, but they're giving us something that's very non-trivial. Okay, so What would be K there? Sorry? Oh, yes. So K is going to be the size of the cells. Any they all have the same size. So in this case, we are going to have k equal to three because it's these elements plus the identity. Identity. In this case, they also have size 3. So K is 3 here. Yeah. So what we want, I mean, the thing is here that the conditions for which these Kaylee incidence graphs exist, they are pretty. Exist, they are pretty restrictive. So, sort of given that we don't have the most trivial cases, which is that we want to assume that K is at least two. At least two, wait, k is at least three because if k is two, each cell just contains the identity in one other element. And what we're going to get there is a subdivision graph of the underlying period graph. That's kind of simple. It's, you know, we kind of want to exclude that case. We also want to assume that. We also want to assume that L is at least 2, because if we just have one cell, then it satisfies the conditions if and only if it's a subgroup, which means that either it's the whole group, and then the K Lians in this graph is going to be a star, or it's not the whole group, and then the underlying graph. It's not the whole group, and then the underlying graph is not connected. We so the Cayley instance graph would be a disjoint union of stars, also not very interesting. And we do want to assume also that the underlying Cayley graph is connected. And with these assumptions, not all groups. Not all groups have KDSS graphs. And as far as I can tell, it's exactly the dihedral groups that don't have them. Everything else that I've sort of checked, they have some, but not very many. But the dihedral groups seem to have none. And I think we can kind of easily prove that they don't have it. That they don't have it. So now I just want to give you a few facts about these graphs, which I think are kind of cool, and then I'm going to pose a few questions. So let's number them. Five number one. Does everyone know what I mean when I say the halved graph of a byproduct graph? The halved graphs. So we have byproduct graphs, and we take them. Particular graph, so we take this distance to graph, and it gives us kind of these two at least two components, and those are the half graphs. So the left half graph, I also am assuming that when I have an incident structure, obviously my points are on the left and my blocks are on the right. That makes sense, right? That's obvious. So the left half graph. That's going to be the graph that's induced on the group elements is just a killigraph. Okay. This one is not so hard to imagine that. Not so hard to imagine, but it's true. A k instance graph has birth at least six. Now, these graphs are quite regular, and in particular, we want to kind of look at what happens when they're regular. And in fact, a regular HNS graph Of an abelian group is going to be a killograph and I am pretty sure that it's. Sure, that it's going to be the Cayley graph of the generalized dihedro group sort of on this abelian group. At least I know that the Cayley instance graphs for the cyclic groups are Cayley graphs for the dagbo groups. For example, this example of K7. Because the final or the Hebrew graph is a Kaylee graph for Haile grapper, the dihydra group of optic reset. And then there's sort of a converse of this, is that if we have a Cayley graph that is bipartite and has birth at least six, it will be a Cayley incidence graph or something. Be a Kaylee incidence graph or something. How am I on time? Not very good, okay. There are some spectral things, which I'm just going to tell you: is that we can determine the spectrum. Determine the spectrum of the Keynesian finesse graph from the spectrum of the underlying Key graph. And then, sort of, the last one, and this one is about symmetries. The group G that we start with is going to be a subgroup of the automorphism group of our Killian sides graph. And it acts regularly on the left side vertices. What it's doing to the right side, we kind of have no idea in general. So that leads me to the few questions that I have. Um so the first one is kind of vague. Um so which group properties are good for finding Keylians in a square? And I asked this question because, like I said, the dihedral groups just don't have them. All of the groups seem to have some. But I can't even tell you whether we'll get more for abelian groups or non-abelian groups. The only conjecture I have in my mind is that. Conjecture I had in my mind is that it looks like groups that have odd order, like odd composite order, so an odd order that's not a power of a prime, have more than other groups for some reason. So second question is what's the right half graph? What's the right half graph? We know that the left one is the Kaylee graph. We don't really have any idea what the right half graph is, even whether it's vertex transitive, whether it has any symmetry, whether, I don't know. So So this thing kind of begs the question of when is a regular Cayley incidence graph not a Cayley graph. And the only examples that I found for this are some graphs. are some graphs for the group, the non-abelian group of order 21 and a non-abelian group of order 27. Both odd orders, by the way. And I've checked all the groups, all groups of order ML16. And then the last one, we have sort of, because of this thing, we can look at a problem kind of equivalent to the GRR problem. Equivalent to the GRR problem. So, when is the automorphism group equal to this group? And there are examples of this, and there are also examples of the automorphism group being large. Okay, and that's it. All right, I think we're all going to
