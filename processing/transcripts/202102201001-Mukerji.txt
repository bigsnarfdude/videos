Finger with your with your left hand, and then you take uh color three and or yeah, we can take color three and put color two inside color three, right? Like that, and then color three inside color one. Color three inside color one. While you do that, you know, things might want to pop out, but you kind of hold them together. So this is one corner. Anyone have a problem with that? It's the same as you did on your cube, nothing is different. And once you have that, you turn the structure over to the other side. And basically, just do the same. So one inside two. I'm not locking yet. I'm just placing it. Two inside three and three inside one. So this is how it is before you lock it. And then just And then just it's pretty obvious which pockets it goes into one two three Actually, you can even play. Actually, you can even play with it later on if you cannot make it right now. I got it. Fine. You got it? Good. Good. Wonderful. Good to know that. Yeah. So I will actually move on to my website and show you how to make bigger polyhedra because with this kind of time, this is all I can do. We cannot really construct one, but you will leave with enough. You will leave with enough curiosity and knowledge to make your own. So, I want to back up a little bit. Before that, let's identify this triangular pyramid. See how this is made up of two triangular pyramids, right? So, the polyhedral structures that we'll be making with Sunobe units are not the pure polyhedra itself, but based Itself, but based on those Platonic and Archimedean solids. So they would have to be, it would be what I like to call a pyramidized version of the polyhedra. So they are not going to be your plane polyhedra. So if you were to imagine the base of the pyramid, so the base of the pyramid is a triangle, right? So So we are going to triangularize each face of the polyhedra, whatever. Let's say we are making an icosahedron. That's easy because they're already made of triangles. But let's say you have a cube octahedron. It consists of squares and triangles. The triangles would have a triangular pyramid on it, and the square faces would actually have. Square faces would actually have four triangular pyramids on it. That's how the structures are. And it'll make more sense when I go to my website and walk through the article a little bit. So, and then another thing to remember is that for any other structure other than what we made just now, I have to take out one of the units. Let me take out this one. So, for any other structure that's higher than six units in number, instead of making, remember how we made a mountain fold here? That really has to be a valley fold. There's no other structure that you can make with a mountain fold. So, when you do that, your unit is actually going to look like this. What I'm going to do now is share screen and walk through a couple of articles from my website. Okay, so can we yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure it's coming as full screen for you all, right? So that's my website. I've had it up and running through various hosts since 1997. It's very well liked by modular origami lovers because back then there weren't that many websites on modular origami. And I have tried and maintained it through so many years. I've had changes. I've had a change of hosts and things like that, but it's also very archaic. It's not like a modernized website, but people tell me that's what makes it unique and I shouldn't make it look like any other website. So I've stuck to this. So if you go to the main page, and then on the left, there's a bunch of menu items. There's an item called instructions. And that one, I'm going to click on that. And that one, I'm gonna click on that. It has all these free instructions for folding many things. But at this time, what I want you to look at is on the right, I have some resources. And then there is something called a Sunobe guide. There's something called a color chart. These two will be very useful to you if you want to make larger structures. So let's go to the Sunobe guide. Sonobi guide. And these are available for free to all. Let me minimize this. Anyway, so these are all the structures that you can make with a Sonobi unit. So what we constructed just now also has another name. It's called the Toshi Takahama Juanita. Toshi Takahama jewel, the hexahedron that we just made. And then I've explained how the creases are on the parallelogram for that. So we put all these we already had, but we put a mountain fold. Then for the cube, which we just constructed, we don't need any fold on this square area. So these two we have already constructed. I've said how many units you need. So for the joule, we need three, for the cube, we need three. We need three for the cube, we need six. Then, with 12, you can actually make a large cube and you can also make an octahedral assembly. So, for the large cube, you just need that one mountain fold, but you would not need these two additional folds that we had put in and. And the fun thing also, another fun thing about these units is from this large cube on is see that diagonal fold that we talked about, which is either a mountain or a valley. It's very important to remember that whatever polyhedron structure you assemble, that is going to lie along the edge of a polyhedron. Polyhedron. And if you can remember that, then the construction becomes easy, the understanding of the construction. So that last trees that we put in, either a mountain or a valley, that is going to lie around along the edges. So for instance, for the large 12-unit cube, that fold is going to correspond to the edges of a cube. So, I would recommend if you try larger structures, you can either do the 12-unit large cube or the 12-unit octahedral assembly. So, in an octahedron, it's basically made up of eight triangular faces. So, in your case, each triangular face will be a triangular pyramid rather than a flat face. So, that will give Face. So that will give you an octahedral assembly. Then we can go to icosahedral, which is again, you know, an icosahedron has 20 triangular faces. And so your structure, each faces will also have a triangular pyramid. And I've also told you how many units to make. So for that, you'd need 30. So obviously. Need 30. So, obviously, you never should try and fold in one sitting, then you get burnt out. What I do is fold a few units, leave it in a jar, come back another day, fold a few more, and then finally one day assemble it, assemble them, and then there's this beautiful structure waiting for you. So, for all of these, I've mentioned, you know, what, like I said, it's going to be a value. Like I said, it's going to be a valley fold for any structure higher than 12 or higher. That mountain fold we made for the die pyramid will actually become a valley fold. That is, you'll fold towards you for the other structures. Then the spiked pentakis decahedral one is 60 units and it's a little bit challenging. Once you've mastered these, you may try that. And then there's also a 90 unit. Then there's also a 90-unit assembly, which is really just a soccer ball, I'd like to say, which is the truncated icosahedron. But each pentagon and hexagon has been sectioned up into triangles and then made into triangular pyramids. And if you look at the, you know, what people call the Buckyball or the Edcott Center in Florida. The Epcot Center in Florida, Disney World. They're all a huge, huge polyhedron with triangularized faces, and each triangle has a pyramid on it. In the Epcot ball, of course, the pyramids are not right isosceles. The pyramids could be anything. They would be isosceles triangles each face, but they don't have to be right isosceles. Face, but they don't have to be right isosceles. So basically, you could fold any bucky ball. Bucky balls are consists of pentagons and hexagons. And then I also have some assembly basics, like how, you know, what I talked about, how they go together in a cyclic manner. And then And then you can refer to this for your structures. I'm going really fast, but that's the scope of this class. And then I finally have some pictures. So these are obviously with other Sunovi units with different patterns. So cube is what we just made, but this is with a different pattern. All of these are also in my first book, Marvelous Modular. Book marvelous modular origami. The whole all of how to make any sonobe. Lots of, I have lots of Sonobe variations in this first book of mine by CRC Press. I actually have seven books, but we don't have time to talk about that. You can find out more from my website. And so this is our six-unit structure. This is a 12-unit icosa. 12 unit icosahedral, I mean octahedral structure. This is a 12 unit large cube structure. And then here we have a, I believe this is a 90 unit dodacahedral assembly. What else do I have? I think that's all I have over here. And then what we could do is also quickly go over the color guide, which is very interesting. Interesting. If you want your colors to be distributed in a homogeneous manner, you might want to follow this chart. So I have cubes showing in a three-color scheme and a four-color scheme. Then we have an octahedral hedral structures with three and four color schemes. Then we have the icosahedral in three, five, and six color schemes. And six color schemes, and do decahedral with three, five, and six. So I think now if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer. But I think as far as the time limit of the class, I need to stop my presentation right now. And I will unshare, stop sharing the screen. Sharing the screen. Thank you so much, Munakshi. That was absolutely amazing. I mean, I'm just thinking for myself. My mom is a teacher. She teaches grade three. And these structures that need a large number of units to fold, I think I can get her to do them with her students and they can fold one together. It's a nice group project. Yeah. Yeah, it would be a nice group project. Yeah, it would be a nice group project. Thank you so much for that. If anybody has any questions, please. No, I just wanted to say thank you. I've made my two. I didn't have origami paper, so these are my. Yeah, I actually would love a screenshot if one of you want to take a screenshot and send me with everyone holding up their models. Their models, that's how I'd like it. So, if you please turn your videos on and you know, show off your structures. You can have a screenshot. I'm not doing the shot. Malia, would you please do it for me? Yes. Get even closer. Okay. Okay, I've got three screenshots. All right, please send them to me. Thank you so much for being with me. I hope you enjoyed it. And it would be wonderful even if a few of you go ahead and make few, if not all, make larger structures, at least up to 12 units. It's not too bad. 12 units isn't too bad. So thank you everyone. If we can give a round. Thank you very much. If we can give a round of applause, virtual or actual, to Minakshi. Thank you so much, Minakshi, once again. Thank you for having me.
