The speaker is David Fara from UFMG. Exactly. To speak on intercritical homogeneous NLS. Thank you for the introduction, Stephen. So thank you. First of all, I want to thank the organizers for the nice invitation, Cocressia, Claudio, Miguel. It's a really pleasure to be here, staying participate at this wonderful conference, in this wonderful place. Thank you all. So, today I'm going to talk about an equation related to the classical analysis equation. My main goal here is to present the results that we have up to now and also some other directions that we can go. Okay, so this is the summar of my talk. So, first I will introduce So first of all, introduce the equation, then my plan is to talk about some local opposing results, global opposing, blow-up, and scattering, and also blow-up in this critical space here. Okay, so this is a joint work with three PhD former students, Sonicael, Cardozo, Carlos Gruzman, and Lucas Campos. Lucas Campos, and also Jason Murphy and Simon Cohey. Okay, so this is the equation I'm going to consider today. So this is the classical NLS equation. But here in front of the nonlinearity, we put this singular potential here, which is x to some power, and this power is positive, and minus b, where b is positive. Minus B where B is positive. So actually, we have a singularity here, the LG. Let me say that this model also arrives in some physical applications. And of course, when B is zero, this is the classical analysis equation. As in the analyst equation, we have the scaling variance. Simone already, I think Maria already. Already, I think Maria already mentioned the scaling of the equation today, so it's the same here. So we have also can rescale the solution so that we have also a solution and can compute the Sobolev norm where this scaling is invariant, and the Sovolev space is this one. This is what we call the critical Sobolev space. So it's very similar to the NLS equation with this B here. This be? Okay, this is. We, I think, all in this room already saw this before, and this, and then we classify this equation when Sc is 0. We say that this is the electron critical, when SC is 1, this is the energy critical, and when SC is between 0 and 1 and 1, it's what we call the intercritical equation. So we can rewrite this in terms of We can rewrite this in terms of sigma, and we have this relation signal. Already now. And then we also have conservation laws for this equation. We have the energy, the mass, but we don't have momentum. Unless B equals zero, we don't have momentum. We'll come back to this part later. Okay, so let me mention some results for the local opposeness. So it starts with GNU. So it starts with Genou and Stewart in 2008. So they prove ungoplessness in H1 using the abstract theory from Kazanan's book, for example. Then with Carlos and also a recent paper of Lucas, we are able to prove this well possessed using the classical history as a space, which is this one. And then we have And then we have like one thing that we need to use, let me try to explain. So, after we use the regular strike estimate that we have for the Schoeny equation, then we try to use this to prove nonlinear estimates, to estimate the nonlinear part. But the nonlinear part, we have the singular weight, which is x to the power negative p. So, this weight does not belong to any p. So, what we need to do, we need to split these two parts. So, around the origin and outside the origin. So, we can. The origin and outside the origin. So we can manage things and then able to close the estimates for the non-linear for the non-linear act. So then we also have the HS theory, which was done by Guzman, Jean, and King, very recently. Also needs tricked estimates in solvent space. So there are other ways to avoid the integrability of this x to the power negative p. What we can do. Power negative b, what we can do, we can use weights of electric spaces and also Lorentz spaces. This one way to avoid this. And very recently, in collaboration with Lucas and Simone, were able to recover these results that they have in weighted sublab spaces, in Lorentz spaces, in the regular sublab spaces. So we need to do like split denominator in a verifiable way. Okay, then Okay, then in collaboration with Kaus and Mikael, we have the HS theory, the theory in that space here. We'll explain why this is important later. And very recently, also in this paper with Lucas and Simone, so we have we also proved the HS theory in the homogeneous space. Okay, so let me go back if we want. Let me go back. If we want to study the H1 global opposition H1, what we need to do is to see what we can do with the energy, for example, how we can control it. And one of the first parts is how to estimate the term that appears in the energy, second term, the potential term, where we have the integral with this single weight here. So this goes back to these two works here. To these two works here, like when I started to work with this equation in 2015, and also Genou 2012. So we are able to prove Galiadoni-Ember inequality related to this type of problem. So we can consider this x to the power negative p here and still have a Galliadon-Emberg inequality where the best constant is given by the solution of a unique non-negative radially symmetric solution of this type. Symmetric solution of this type of Libya equation. With this in hand, we can use, well, this is a generalization of the classical Weiston result in 83. And then with this in hand, we have the usual global robustness for small data, where we can quantify how small the data should be to have global robustness. So, this is always related to the ground state here. This is a combination of the L2 norm and Of the L2 norm and the energy. Okay, and well, this is the same paper by Genu, and this is a generalization of the work of Weist in the 2Critical and also a home-equipped ankle in the intercritical case. As you can see here, if you take sigma equals to 2 minus V over N, so we saw that S sigma should be 0, right? So both conditions are the same. So this is the mass, less than mass of the ground state. The mass less the mass of the ground state, and this is the L2 norm less than L to normal, which is the same. Very good. And then we have also finite time blow-up if we are above this second condition here. So in this case, it was proof in that same work for initial data in H1 and also in the view space. And then it was generalized by Was generalized by Gene, not generalized, but changed the assumptions for H1 with radial symmetry and also in dimension and greater than equal to 2 and non-radial for dimension 1. So this is a generalization of these results here for the classical analysis equation. I say Tsutsumi, Ogao Tsumi in these both papers here, and Homer Guden. Homer algorithm. Okay, then things start to be a little bit different than what we have for the regular Schrodinger equation because now we see that we can have results that we still don't have for the classical analysis equation. For example, we can still prove blow-up for no radial data if we restrict our sigma view. sigma b right and more recently with mikael we proved that in the in the l2 case with negative critical case with negative energy we can prove blow up without the radio assumption so you can remove the radio assumption and still have the blow up result so which is quite interesting because we don't have this type of result for the regular analysis and in the proof you see that we need this B2 We need this B to be something negative, and you see that the bound that we have grows when B goes to zero. So we cannot complete the result, which is quite interesting. So yeah, at that time we start to look at this problem, try to figure out if we can prove the same results that we have for the analyze equation for this model. Then we start to realize very, very centrally that we can go further. Can use, we can prove the results that we don't have for the analysis. Okay, so this is the comment here. These both two results we don't have for the analysis equation, not yet. And let me mention some now about scattering. So scattering we have at least we have two different approaches to study this problem. To study this problem, we have this: the first one, which is the concentration compactness rigid method, the vacanic method for the dispersal equations. And using this approach, so with Carlos in 2017, we considered the 3D cubic case, and then we considered in the critical case, the entire regime. And then more recently, these three authors here consider the energy-critical case for dimension 3. Case for dimension 3 and also the non-radio, the non-radio case. So it was considered by Miao, Murph, and Zeng in the 3D cubic. And then for the intercritical with Cardozo, Guzman, and Murphy. Very recently, we extend these results for the entire intercritical regime. And there is also a paper by Guzman and Murphy, where they considered the energy critical case. What I want to mention is that, okay, this is a generalization of all. Okay, this is a generalization of all these results, classical results for the Schwarny equation that covers all the setting here. But one comment, very important, is that the approach to consider the non-radial case is completely different than the one that we use for the NLS. Because for the NLS, the approach is to use the conservation of the radio that we don't have here. So we need to do a completely different strategy. Completely different strategy to complete the argument. That's the idea. So actually, we compare with the, instead of compare using the moment, we compare the solution, like to do the perturbation t, we compare the solution with the linear evolution. Because if we have this x to the power negative b, and if the shift that we have from the profile composition goes to infinity, this goes to zero, right? If we have one over something. One over something. So that's we use this to compare to make this theory works using this type of technique. That's the main idea, why it's different, that we don't have this for the NLS, for example. And here, also a result that Carlos and Jason proved, where they considered the non-radio scattering for the energy-critical INLS, and this is not. NLS, and this is not known, not yet, for the NLS approach. Another result that we can have better than the NLS. Okay, so the second approach is the Virio Mohavetz method introduced by Jason and Ben Dodson. And we have this, so the radio case was proved by Lucas in 2021 and then In 2021, and then for n greater or equal than 3, for n equals 2, it was proved by Dean. And then the non-radial case, so Jason considered this, first considered this in the cubic 3D cubic case, and then it was generalized by Lucas and Mikael in the same year. So, okay, so all these results were already obtained by the NLS equation, right? By the NLS equation, right, for this in these papers here. And one thing that is interesting here is that when we consider the non-radial case for the regular NLS, you need to use this interaction Mohafi estimate to complete the argument. But here, the same strategy that you use for radio, we can use for the non-radio. You don't need mohawks estimate. So we have a, as far as I understand, we have like a As far as I understand, we have like a trade-off. I mean, to precede the local closeness, you need to do more computation because you need to take care of this x to the power negative. But when you try to use this virial mohab else estimate, it's much more easy. So at some point, because essentially because let me go back here to the Essentially, because we have this, at some point when we use the Mohavetz estimate, this Mohavetz approach, we need to estimate this quantity here, the potential term that comes from the energy outside the origin with a rate of with x, modulus of x very big. So here we have this control for free because we have x to 1 over x for x greater, for x very large. So we have this for free to estimate. So, we have this for free to estimate that time. That's the idea. So, sometimes when you, when you, well, in the radio case, what we do, we try to compute this uniformly using this radio, like Galiadon, radio-Galiadon-Bag estimate developed by Strauss, for example. So, we use this to estimate this for large outside the orange. So, the idea here is that we can control this outside the orange without using this. So, this is the main observation. The main observation that allows us to use this method here without going to this Mohave estimate. Okay, so now I want to talk a little bit about this blow-up in HSC intersection with H1 dot. So the idea is the form. So, the idea is the following. Okay, so if we consider the local theory that we have from this paper, so we show that since this is not the critical space, we are not in the critical space. So, we have that if the time of existence is finite, then we must have blow-up of the norm of the solution at some point. And also, we have some rate here, which is, we know, we don't know exactly. Is we don't know exactly. In this paper, we didn't know how to compute exactly this value here, but we have some rate that says that this norm goes to infinity. And the problem is that, okay, so since this norm is the sum of two norms, so can we decide which of the norms goes to infinity? The HSC norm or the H1 norm? So actually we will. Actually, we want to prove that this norm goes to infinity, the critical norm. So, this was done by Martel and Rafael back in 2008, and they proved that this situation happens for the classical analyze equation that we have to prove up of this form. So, we try to use this strategy to have the same result for the analyze equation. And what we have at some point we saw that we We saw that we were able to do using the same assumptions as META and Hafile that we are in the critical regime and with radial initial data. But then after that we realize that we can also consider the non-radial data with some extra assumption in the integral case here, where the sigma, the power of the non-linearity is. So in this In this setting here, we can prove that if the energy is negative, then the maximum time of existence is finite. And moreover, we have that the link soup of this norm, the critical norm, will show us that the result. And some comments. Well, this is completely, this is in a sharp constraint to the mass critical case because for the L2 critical case, So the L2 critical equation, we have that the L2 norm is preserved. And here we have that the critical norm is not preserved anymore. Actually, it goes to infinity if you are not in the L2 critical equation. And then we also have that if for B large, so this assumption, you are actually not introducing another assumption. Let me try to explain this. Let me try to explain this. For example, if B is greater than 4 over N, then we have that this guy is less than this. So the result covers all the integrator regime. So for large B, actually we have the result for the entire integral regime and non-radial keys. But if B is small, then we don't know yet what happens. So recently we Recently, we realized that if it goes back to the result of Mel and Hafael, they actually proved that the limit goes to plus infinity. At that point, we are only able to prove that the link soup goes to plus infinity. But right now, we already know how to prove that actually the limit goes to plus infinity for this equation. And let me Let me make another comment here. Oh, okay. So, how to prove this? Okay, so we have two main theorems in this direction. So, let me show you how to prove that result. Actually, we prove a stronger result. If we assume some bound, I mean some lower bound for the growth of the gradient of the solution, there are two normal. Of the solution, the actual norm of the gradient, then we can conclude that the critical norm also goes to plus infinity. But we need to assume this assumption here at this point. And then using this, let me make some comments about this assumption. So, well, for the classical analysis equation, this is true. This is automatically true because we have the theory in HS dot. So, in this, when So, when we wrote that paper, we don't have the theory here for the ionological equation. But now we have. So, with this new paper here, so we already know that this bound is always satisfied. So, it is not an extra condition. And okay, so moreover, if we go back to this result of Hanui Tayashi, they actually proved that if you are in H1, then we That if you are in H1, then we also have that problem. So that's the first indication that we should expect that problem, which is actually proved in this paper here. Okay, so let me show you how to prove the theorem one assuming the second theorem. Okay, so what we do is if If this norm does not go to plus infinity, then we have a bound. And then we rescale our solution with this whole t here such that this scaling makes this norm invariant. So we have a bound automatically for this norm. And then we choose this whole T such that this norm is also bounded, which is always one. That's the idea. Right, that's the idea. And then we use the local theory in that spaces to show that there is a t independent of t, the time of existence, such that the solution cannot go above this number, which is what we have the solution. And then we make a computation and see that we have this bound. And since we have that bound, we use theorem one to conclude this, right? But this is a contradiction with Contradiction with this assumption that we have here, right? So that's the idea. So, okay, so how many minutes I have? I think I'm running out of the time, right? Five minutes? Yeah. Okay, so let me just very quickly explain how to prove this theorem too. So, okay, so So, okay, so the main obstacle again, as I said, is how to manage that term here, x to the power negative b. And the main tools are the following. So virial type estimate, which is very familiar. You consider a function that behaves like x squared, close to the origin, and then at some point it vanishes, right? And then you rescale this solution. Then we want Then we want you make some assumptions on this function here, such that you can compute derivatives and see how we can manage the terms. And the main strategy, following the work of Mel and Hafaio, is to deduce this type of estimate. So to deduce this type, I mean, you need to compute the second derivative of this quantity here and say that this is plus the L2 norm of the gradient. L2 norm of the gradient and the energy which is conserved can be bounded by this guy. So look at this guy as I mentioned you before. So we can control this guy in H1 for free because we have that x is away from the ordinance. So this is below, this quantity here is bounded by 1 over x to the power b. So we have this for free. That's how we manage the non-radio case. So we make some comparisons. So we make some computations. This is pretty straightforward. And then in the radial case, it's very easy because then we can rewrite this as simply this quantity here, which is actually bounded by the normal degrading square since we have a bound for this guy. We're assuming this. Very good. So this term is very good. And in the non-radial case, we need to be a little bit more careful. So let me try to. So let me try to explain. So we decompose this second derivative in four parts. So one is P, which is this quantity here, that we want to investigate this quantity, this guy minus this quantity. And then we need to bound these three guys. So it's a simple computation shows that this k1 is negative, should be less than or equal to 0, and k2 is bound. And K2 is bounded by this guy here. And again, that's the idea because since this is one of the terms that we want, right? This part here. This is the term. And then for the other term, for this is K2, right? And then for the other terms, so how to bound So, how to bound this guy here? Ah, so sorry. So, this other term, the k3, this is bounded by this guy here, right? Which is just how we construct this function here. So, then we need to bound this, this guy here, which is somehow related with scaling variant more campanato type thing, which is this. Then we need to control. We need to prove an inequality like this. So, in the radio case, it follows using exactly the same strategy as Hafayo and Merl. But in the non-radio case, then we need to be a little more careful. It's actually easier in the non-radio case because we have this decay. So, how we do it? We split, we consider these rings here. Rings here, unloose here. And then, well, we use the interpolation estimates: we have this, this decay here, and then Algaliado-Ninebeck type inequality here. Then we end up with the quantity that we want to control. And then we split this guy here using an Young inequality, right? So we have two terms. And then we sum over We sum over all the possible rings to cover all the domain integration here, x, very equal than r. Then, in each bound, in each of the terms, we have these two series here, and this is convergent, and this is also convergent. And this is how we get the estimate we want. It was very uh wiki. But if we want to discuss, we can we can discuss later. can discuss later. So I think that's it. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe we can squeeze in a question or two if there are any questions. So so for the for the program you consider Alternatively, you consider verbosness in the critical space intersected with H.1. Do you fall with a critical space? No, we don't have to have a space. Not just in the critical space. But because of the integer ability of this extra coordinate. But that's except that you can wield the audience. Yeah, so maybe without using sublime spaces, maybe it's possible. Yeah, but it it's only in the not in the critical piece. It's HP. It's S greater than S C. But not in the critical piece. Good question. Should be possible. Yeah, using that. I think so. Are there questions?
