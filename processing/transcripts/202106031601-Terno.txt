This session is Daniel Turnow discussing why astrophysical black holes do not have horizons and what it means if they do. Okay, I suppose that the time started to run. So, Laura, thank you for the introduction. It's very nice to see you after a while, even only virtually. And yes, my talk today is astrophysical black holes, maybe from the point of view of quantum. Maybe from the point of view of quantum fundamentalists. What does it, well, why we think they don't have horizons and why it's so interesting if they do. So I have to thank for support, first of all, Asian Office of Aerospace Research of US Air Force that supported me in dry times, SASTEC that supported me in fun times and also through the pestilence, and ARC that might see just my That might see, just might see me through the horrible times. And thank you for coming at those strange times of the day across the globe. Okay, so this one doesn't work. So we know that astrophysical black holes exist. Strictly speaking, that means we know that there are dark compact objects that on the available scales look like black holes of general relations. Black holes of general relativity. What we do not know is that they have any of typical or ideal black hole properties. Now, for reasons, both theoretical and ideological, with information loss paradox being one of them, and I'm not going to discuss it, there are alternatives. Horizonless, more or less exotic compact objects. And now it's And now it's not just a fringe question, but rather part of a mainstream research program. And I have an issue with the word exotic, and a little bit down the road, I plan to return to this adjective and argue that it is not as exotic as we might have seen. So let's start now. Let's start with the outline. The time is short, so I'll start with a zoo of black holes and ultra-compact objects. Then we'll focus on probably the main question: what happens if you're taking horizons seriously? And I'll discuss the self-consistent metric and what follows from it. Just consistency sometimes is a very strong mathematical tool. And then I'll come to the implications. And that's exactly the point why we believe that. point why we believe that it's unlikely that black holes exist and why it will be then very surprising and interesting new physics confirmed if they do have the prescribed properties. And of course, summary and omissions and open questions and I'll start with the naked self-promotion of me and my colleagues. So I think the summary or the basic idea Summary of the basic idea of the approach was described in the paper with Valentina Robb, my student Sebastian Merck. More details can be found in these sources. And now we are writing a review paper, which we promise to put out sometime by the end of July. I hope it will work. So let's determine the rules of the games first. The games at first. And we're working in semi-classical physics, so classical concepts are still meaningful. Metric might be modified by quantum effects, but we take as a starting point that the resulting sort of curvature satisfies the semi-classical self-consistent equation where we have standard Einsteinian left-hand side, maybe modified by additional. By additional terms that today I'm going to ignore, balanced with the right-hand side, energy-momentum tensor, which is the expectation of some quantum operator. And again, I will be mostly concerned with its existence, not its exact form. But I just will say that it's not some perturbative, think about it, not as some perturbative term, but the end. Perturbative term, but the entire matter content of the theory. And we still assume the dynamics of the collapsing matter is described classically using, say, this self-consistent metric or any other approach. So we introduce quantum, but only to the extent that is absolutely necessary. Well, a quick reminder: we know that space-time tells matter how to move, and matter tells space-time how to curve. Somehow to curve. So, we, for example, be interested in the energy density and energy-momentum tensor in general, with perfect fluids being one example. We know that reasonable, or presumably reasonable, energy-momentum tensors could satisfy a whole bunch of energy conditions, more or less going around the point that energy density is non-negative. Negative. In particular, again, there is a whole zoo, not exactly hierarchy of them, with particularly interesting. The weak energy condition, which tells that the energy density is positive for any massive observer, and then the null energy condition, where we replace those vectors with null vectors. Now, black holes come in many varieties, and that's part of the reason why. Why any statement or any question might sound provocative. So, from the vintage idea that that's something that traps light by its own gravity to classical idea of say Schwartz black hole and the collapse of classical matter. In this case, black hole is just part of the space-time which is inaccessible. Which is inaccessible for future null infinity or for observers, which move outside to the past of this future time infinity and the boundary of the inaccessible region is the event horizon. And as we know, while from the point of view of collapsing or co-moving observer, it takes only time, a finite proper time to cross the horizon and then be crashed by singularity. Be crashed by singularity or do whatever science fiction movies prescribe from the point of view of the external observer, let's say Bob, that hovers somewhere outside the black hole, collapse is never complete, horizon crossing never happens. The problem is that the event horizon is a concept that is not locally observable, and you need to know the entire life story of the universe. Apparent horizon, which is Apparent horizon, which is indeed the boundary of trapped regions, so trapped light, is at least quasi-locally measurable for members of an advanced civilization. And again, I remind you that normally if we now plot it in two plus one dimensions, if we consider light sent outside and inside, then we start all of us on the boundary of a spherical shell. For a spherical shell, that obviously outgoing wavefronts take larger and larger areas unless we have a massive compact object inside. And then even outside light bends backwards. Boundary between normally and abnormally behaving light, outgoing light, is marginal trapped surface with additional fine print. Fine print, it's the apparent horizon. In general, it's rather non-trivial and not always naturally identifiable surface, but in spherical symmetry in which we work, it's pretty non-controversial. The problem, of course, is that it's inside the event horizon, so not very practical so long as the null energy condition is set. Null energy condition is satisfied, as is one of the standard assumptions of the classical general relativity. That also constraints the alternatives. If we use some classifier that shows how horizonless objects or potential horizonless objects can be close to the black hole under a reasonable list of assumptions, like absence of exotic matter, no modified gravity, that's absence of weird fields. Lapsence of weird fields, and so on. We get that this smallness parameter is greater than one eighth. You relax some of those assumptions, you can get closer. But, well, in modern exotic theories, it ranges between one for neutron stars to 10 to the minus 40, 10 to the minus 60 for the exotic models. And again, reminder that interesting times. Reminder that interesting times happen when the null energy condition is violated, because event horizon may exist, may not exist, but it is inside trapped regions. On the other hand, singularities are not mandatory. So that provides, of course, opportunities for zoo of objects without event horizons. Regular black holes, it's probably the most typical name. And we And all the alternatives, objects without horizon but very close to it, are exotic because to produce them with interesting or sufficiently reasonable properties, we need either modify general relativity or assume that the matter violates the null energy condition. Of course, it's also now it becomes an experimental question where people try to distinguish between black holes, objects fixed. Holes, objects with horizons, and other stuff. But we focus, well, we focus on black holes, particularly because somehow it was taken for granted that geometry around black holes is just geometry prescribed by classical general relativity. However, if we take two very innocent assumptions, one assumption B, everybody takes without thinking at all that those are regular. At all, that those are regular surfaces and that curvature invariance are finite. And we insist that to be at least observable, at least in principle for distant observers, those tracked regions, characteristic features of black holes, should be formed at finite time of this distant observer. Consequences are quite dramatic. So, if those physical black holes exist, Black holes exist, then what? So we follow the standard assumption that we are playing in the semi-classical regime, and the left-hand side of the Einstein equations is just Einstein. We assume that curvature scalars at the horizons, at least the apparent horizon, are finite and trapped regions form at finite time of distant observer. Essentially, we're adding one requirement to what for all of To what for all of, I think, for the first to call physical black hole. Now, most of all, all of what I'm showing today is spherical symmetry simply because it's easier. In particular, mass is invariant parameter of this metric, and the function h will, which is typically non-zero, will play a role of integrating factor when we go from one coordinate system to another. Another. So we focus on two curvature scalars. One is trace, one is square, which is slightly different combination from what people usually consider, but on the other hand, directly related to the invariance of the energy-momentum tensor. By saying that, again, spherical symmetry allows you to work relatively easily. Relatively easily. We have interestingly useful combination of components of energy-momentum tensor, and we find that they all have to go to zero together or diverge in the same way. And more specifically, more careful analysis shows that they can diverge only in two ways, where scaling of divergence is given exactly by this function f, the one minus, okay, so gravitational radio. Okay, so gravitational radius over R. Apparent horizon, of course, sits at the point f equals zero at the gravitational radius. So only two classes of solutions which are consistent with our requirement of regularity on the horizon and its finite formation are possible. All of them will exhibit the violation of the null energy conditions. A class Class K equals zero gave us a lot of hopes because Abenisha calculation of energy momentum tensor for Hawking radiation on the background of the Schwarzenegger black hole by Levy and Ore showed that as we approach the horizon, those components coincide and they all go negative. So plus or minus, again, it's optional. Again, it's optional. Well, you get from convergence. To get real solution, you have only minus sign, and this is what is responsible for violation of the null energy condition. Two types of metric in TR coordinates, in the Schwarzschild coordinates are possible. Both require divergent, logarithmically divergent function h and mass, which around Which around gravitational radius behaves as minus something, either square root of x or x to the power three halves, where x is the coordinate distance radius minus the gravitational radius. Partially, those parameters are constrained by consistency of the Einstein equation, giving us a nice example, nice result for evaporation. For evaporation, and they can be, at least in case of evaporation, partially identified by comparison with the standard semi-classical results. Of course, if we want to work easier, most convenient coordinates are retarded with retarded coordinate U for accretion and advanced for evaporation. Advanced for evaporation. What turns out that one of the standard examples, you work in the outgoing coordinates, it means you are, you pick up v geometric with decreased mass. That's a standard example of operating system. It's very nice, but it cannot describe near horizon environment if this horizon was formed at finite time t. Well, simply because it doesn't. Well, simply because it doesn't validate the null energy condition. And if you tried by force to write coordinate transformations between the Schwarzschild coordinate and those coordinates, you get complex valued functions. One curiosity, we have finite infall time and that means final redshift. Well, sorry, finite info time for photons, for massive particles, finite time unless they're too slow. And not unexpected. Not unexpected energy density, pressure, and flux for a static observer are divergent if it's k equals zero solution and finite if it's k equals one solution on the horizon. What does it mean? Again, more, what are the implications? One of the implications is that if you track what happens to infalling observer, which we call ELISE, Which we call ELICE, that a rather straightforward chain of calculations shows that ELICE hits the firewall. Expanding trapped regions lead to divergent energy, density, and pressure and flux as seen by the infalling observer. You don't have to assume anything. You have expanding horizon, semi-classical black hole, you have a firewall. Works for both types of solutions. Works for both types of solutions, and you have perfectly finite and probably small values for infalling absorber into an evaporating black hole. With combination of this and bounds on violation of the null energy conditions, you get that you violate those bounds. So firewall is a regular. So, firewall is regular, curvature is regular, bounds on analogy conditions are violated, and that means once formed, semi-classical black hole cannot grow. You have to take your peak. Black holes do not grow, or semi-classical gravity is broken at the scale of the horizon. Those are the alternatives. Formation, of course, is very interesting. Is very interesting because to form, we need to violate the null energy condition. So, for example, if I'm trying to track, like in usual pictures, co-moving observer that sits on the boundary of the collapsing region, then at some point, nature of this matter should be totally changed. And then, what? I don't know. There are additional interesting features, but one is that we need both types of. One is that we need both types of solutions. That if we carefully write the basically definitions and follow development of mass, we see that at the formation point, physical black hole must be k equal one solution op and now typo. And once we move from this point onward, if we want to have a dynamical black hole, it has to be k equals zero solution. So we have this k equal one to a k equals zero. equals one to a k equals zero. Apologies for the type of solutions. Infall for most observers takes finite time according to a distant clock. Thin shell collapse is possible, but again, as the infall, they take time, which is comparable to the scale of evaporation. And that's another interesting thing that might return later. Final weird property, surface gravity. Gravity surface gravity is very important. Uh, we'll see why. It defined in two ways: uh, either in affinity of null geodesics on the horizon, or five minutes left. Perfect, thank you, or or peeling, a proper description of peeling of null geodesics near the horizon. Two definitions, two are very reasonable, obviously, well, not obviously, but rather nicely, when we have state. Nicely, when we have stationary space-times, and it means we have Killing vector fields and Killing horizon, those two definitions are equivalent. A more poetic interpretation of surface gravity is that the force per unit mass as measured at infinity to keep the observer stationary just outside the horizon. And for Schwarzschild black hole, it's one over four m. All is nice and well. All is nice and well, but we are interested in dynamical situations, and it's a bit controversial how to define them there. Why, again, surface gravity is useful? It's useful in classical black hole physics. It plays a key role in black hole thermodynamics, subject of zero law and key ingredient of the first law. It plays a role in Hawking radiation. Hawking radiation. It's essentially up to rescaling in units, it's Hawking temperature. So we need this quantity. There are two groups of definitions which exploit either peeling property or peeling vector property, horizon property. So peeling surface gravity described by several authors, one is Kropoliberati visa. That's essentially the definition. That's essentially the definition. It exploits the fact that the derivative of time over distance, coordinate distance as we go to the horizon, should go to infinity. And there is another definition which is based on the existence of the so called Kadama vector field, which is as similar to Keeling as possible in spher defined in spherical symmetry. Defined in spherical symmetry. The problem is that peeling gravity, if you follow the definitions, because of finiteness of infall time and finiteness of transition for photons, diverges both at k equals zero and k equals one solution. And if you use Kadama surface gravity, which we calculated just recently, it's zero at the formation of the black hole and then still. Back hole, and then still smaller than the classical or stationary value. We don't really know what to do with those results, but here they are. So, I think it's a good time to summarize. So, if physical black holes exist, then they are quite weird. And that's probably weirdness might be a good argument to claim that astrophysical black holes are not. Holes are not really black holes. First of all, black holes with horizons require as exotic matter as wormholes or almost any of the exotic compact objects for their existence. Weirdness is not a property of the alternatives. Actually, you seriously have to deviate from the known, what we know about quantum field theory and meta to obtain black hole, not to. Black hole, not to fake it. But we clearly know that some of the popular models of regular black holes are wrong simply because they violate one or other consequence of having an apparent horizon at finite time. Once a semi-classical physical black hole is formed, it stops growing. It can only evaporate. At the horizons, we have finite redshift. It's finite. Redshift. It's finite, but very big. Interesting question: whether it has any observational consequences, and that's what we would like to understand. And finally, well, consequences of this fact, collapse from the point of view of distant observers happens in finite time, but it takes a very long time, so possibly not yet. And surface gravity generalizations are problematic. Generalizations are problematic. Well, to say at least problematic, and that means we are not really sure what happens to the Hawthorne radiation if we have those physical black holes. So, I hope that I convinced you that I don't have to convince you that they are interesting. I hope at least to provide some arguments why they are seriously weird. And I just have to. And I just have to thank you for the attention and show some of my collaborators in this collaboration that the sun never sets on. Writing just causers, Robman and Vicar Hussain in Canada, my students past and present, and well, and Valentina, who is now in Melbourne, plus friends all over that help me. All over that help me with their comments, suggestions, and discussions. So, thank you. Thank you for your attention. Okay, why don't we thank Danny? And then we've got time for one or two quick questions. Okay, so you'll manage. Yeah, if you've got a question, raise your hand, the icon, and you'll slide across. Oh. Yeah, Alex. Hey, Danny. Thanks for the nice talk. Good to see you. I had a question. You made a comment that either semi-classical gravity is wrong or breaks down or the black hole has to keep growing or something like that. Do you mind just So, what we get is that if the black hole grows, so it's formed, horizon exists already, and it grows, infalling observer will detect divergent energy density, pressure, and flux. So, scorvitches calories will be regular, energy density will diverge. And that's calculated within the semi-classical yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then we also know that there are results in quantum field theory and curved background, well, in quantum field theory in general, that bound violations of basically bound violations of the null energy condition. And we have divergent and negative energy density. So when we plug what we know about how this divergence comes about into the equation. About into the equations that provide the bounds. We get that again, and we can consider spaces of small curvature and everything is regular. We get that one side of this equation diverges logarithmically and another side should be finite. So the bound that quantum field theory on curved background should satisfy fails. Okay. And then the consequences is that either. And then the consequences is that either the theory is wrong or the process is impossible. And on that ground, I cannot tell which is true. But both of you, do you have an opinion or a belief or a hope? I don't know because about 2005, Ashtakar and Boujoval provided like elegant but more hand-wavy arguments why semi-classical gravity breaks down on the horizon scale. Horizon scale. So it might be a mathematical expression, but again, it's just a bit like a Bell theorem. It's a result that if you put A, B, and C together, you know, the eggs are broken, but whom to blame? We need further research. Cool. All right. Thanks, Gary. Okay. And Tim, if it's a quick question, you can go ahead. Otherwise, maybe. You can go ahead. Otherwise, maybe wait till the discussion. Just very quickly. I mean, we know that what we think of black holes do grow from gravitational wave observations. So I see. Yeah. Though probably I should have said it. So if we believe this result. This result that means those are astrophysical black holes, but they still don't have a horizon because we don't have that the point. The whole interest in those types of questions is because we don't have a smoking gun for the horizon. We know that there are very compact objects. And if we go to my last slide, we have this picture of different. Picture of different objects that are arranged by how far they are from where the horizon should be. And we know that, let's say, this corner is out, but everything else is a fair game. So, yes, astrophysical black holes grow, and if we accept that they're described by semi-classical gravity, then we should conclude that they don't have the horizon yet. Yet. Okay, thank you. Why don't we think again? Thank you. So I'm going to stop sharing the screen.
