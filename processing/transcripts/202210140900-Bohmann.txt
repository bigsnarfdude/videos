And we start. Thank you. And we're starting in a really great spot here. It's my pleasure to introduce Anna Marie Bowman from Vanderbilt University, who is going to speak on free loop spaces and topological, social homology. Great. Homology. Great. Thank you, Maria. Thank you. Right. So, as Maria said, I'm going to talk about free loop spaces and topological cohox geodomology. I want to start by saying that this work is joint with Tina Gerhard and Brooke Shipley. And I also want to start by saying that one of these things is more familiar to more people than the other. So we're going to start there with the free loop spaces. So free loop spaces. So, free loop spaces. You like the other one? It's coming, don't worry. Right, so given a space X, the free loop space, which I'm going to denote by L of X, so L of X here, this is the free loop space on X, so free loop space. Space is, well, it's the set of unbased maps from the circle to X. So just loops in X. And of course, this isn't the free loop space on a space X. This is an important construction. It comes up in like, you know, math physics. And it's the main object of study in string topology, which I guess is the reason why I'm. Which I guess is the reason why I'm talking about it here, because of its stringiness. And it also has important connections to geometric topology. And it's one of those that I want to use as sort of a motivation for what I'll tell you about freedom spaces today. So that particular connection to geometric topology is a theorem of Gromol and Meyer. And Meyer from 69. And what does it say? It says that if you have unbounded Betty numbers for the free loop space on some manifold M here, so here. So, here M is a compact, simply connected Ramanian manifold. So, if you have unbounded Betty numbers on M, that this implies that there are infinitely many. Infinitely many distinct closed geodesics on M. Okay, so you know the Benny numbers, of course, are the dimension of the homology groups over a field, and so this means that. Over a field. And so this means that if we can understand stuff about the homology of the free loop space of our favorite manifold, you know, it's giving us some information about the geometric structure of that Riemannian manifold, about its closed geodesics. So this is one of those sort of classic theorems in algebraic topology, which says something that like it's sort of a homotopy invariance is actually telling us something quite geometric, which is always cool. Okay, and so then there's There's a whole bunch of work that computes stuff about the homology of free loop spaces. So a whole bunch of work on homology of free loop spaces over fields for different X, for different K. So maybe just to mention some particularly important names here, or some names that I have written down. I have written down. So, work of Ziller in 77, some work of Larry Smith in 84. There's lots of different people have computed lots of different homologies of free loop spaces. One particular result I want to highlight here, sort of an example theorem on this subject. This is work of let's. Let's see, of Kiribayashi and Yamaguchi from 97. And what does it say? So it says, suppose we start with the simply connected space X. So almost everything that I'll say, you know, all day today is about. Then I'll say, you know, all day today is about simply connected spaces. And there are some things that you can extend a little bit, you can push a little further. You know, maybe I'll mention that, but simply connected is often necessary. Okay, so you have a simply connected space, and suppose you know what its cohomology is. So in particular, you know that the cohomology of X over some field K is an exterior algebra based on two generators. On two generators, x and y over k. Here, I want the characteristic of the field to be greater than three. And I want the degrees of my exterior generators. Well, I want x to be the lower degree one and then y, just for convenience. And they also, the degree of y has to be bounded by twice the degree of x. Twice the degree of x minus 2. So I have this sort of inequality on the generators. Then what they show is that just knowing this fact about the homology, the cohomology ring of X allows you to compute the homology of the free loop space on X. So in particular, the homology on the free loop space on X is given by exterior algebra on the same generators. Same generators, tensor with a polynomial algebra on two more generators, hat, y hat. Here, the degree of x hat is the degree of x minus one. Same deal, the degree of y hat is the degree of y minus one. And let's see, and this is an isomorphism. Maybe I should make it an. Should make it an isomorphism sign because, you know, it's an isomorphism as co-algebras. So let me say a little word about this because, of course, I'm telling you this is an isomorphism as co-algebras, but I said this was the exterior algebra, which of course makes no sense. But the exterior algebra, exterior algebras and polynomial algebras are both hop algebras. And so I'm looking at the underlying co-algebra structure of these hop algebra. Underlying co-algebra structure of these hop algebras here. And I'm making the claim that, of course, the homology of a space has a co-algebra structure and that I'm identifying this co-algebra structure here. So that's that's the way in which this is a sensible statement. Okay. Right. So the work I want to any questions actually before I move on? I think I would expect a sort of closure duality result to give me something about the maybe homology of based groups on the space. Do you have any sense of how, like a sort of a, what do I want to say? Cobar spectro sequence? Or no bar spectrosequence. Do you have any sense of how this is does this go through that at all? Does this go through that at all? So, Jonathan is asking if this is like somehow related to Kazool duality and a bar or a cobar spectral sequence. And it is not unrelated. So, I would say that if you want to know about Kazoole duality type results here, you should look at work of Hess Shipley and Pehu Bayindar, I think. I think that's their work together. And I will also say about Say about how Kurbayashi and Yamaguchi proved this result, they use an Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence argument. That's what that's what this is coming from. And I also say that some of these ideas will again come up in stuff I say a little bit later too. So hold those thoughts. In particular, I do, I want to tell you about a theorem that Brooke and Tina and I proved. That is sort of a similar flavor of theorem. So we start with X simply connected and a field of characteristic P. And let's suppose we know the cohomology of X. So the cohomology of X. Of x over with k coefficients. Suppose this is an exterior algebra on now a bunch of generators, which I'll call xi1 uxi n. I have to put some sort of order on organization on these generators. So, first of all, I'm going to assume that they come in increasing order of degree. So, these are generators in odd degree. And I need right, so the degree of xi1, xij is ij and ij plus 1 greater than or equal to ij, right? So they're in increasing order of degrees. Okay, and then I have a complicated inequality. The complicated inequality. We'll tell you what it is. So if i n, so the degree of the topmost guy plus the sum of the degrees of everybody, right, divided by the degree of I1 minus one. This is a ridiculous thing, but this is just what works out. If this is less than or equal to p. So if p is very large compared to the degrees of all of these generators, Of all of these generators. Then we obtain calculation of the homology with k coefficients of the free loop space as the exterior algebra we started with, xi1 to xi n tensor with a polynomial thing on general. On generators that correspond to each one of these things, but shifted down one. Right, so here again, the degree of Xij hat is the degree of Xij minus one. And now, unfortunately, this is only an isomorphism of Of as modules. So we're not quite able to compute that the co-algebra structure here on this tender product of hop algebras, that that co-algebra structure really is the homology co-algebra structure here. I suspect it's true, but the spectral sequences are annoying. Over k. Yeah, yeah, that's right. So as Yeah, that's right. So as K models, exactly. Of course, that's enough to calculate the Betty numbers. So, you know, if you only ever care about Betty numbers, then you don't care about culture. But at least we're covering that thing. Yeah, so that is an excellent. That's exactly the remarks I would like to make next. So, right. So, for two generators, it's the same. It's the same in degree when the characteristic is five, and it's different. It's this is a bigger range in the case where the characteristic of p is larger, right? So for two generators, we get a broader range of degrees. When p is greater than five. When p equals five, I think we recover exactly the same degrees. So, so yeah, so in some sense, it's a it's a bit of a generalization, but of course, Kurobayashi and Yamaguchi do get the co-algebra structure, and we're not able to obtain that yet. I should also say that, you know, like, what are some examples of spaces? What are some examples of spaces that have this kind of a structure here? You know, there were no such spaces, this would be not a very exciting result. So, you know, you can recover stuff like, you know, calculations of free loop space on some, you know, classical Lie groups like SUNK and H, like homology of like the free loop space on NK, things like this. You know, here for P a lot bigger than N, which I think is like, I don't know, like I have in my, I have in my notes, at least for one of these cases, but now the p like greater than or equal to n squared plus 2n minus 2. Something along those lines is like more or less the degrees where this happens. Great. So, this is a theorem that's about trying to understand the homology of free loop spaces. So, now I want to tell you, I told you briefly that Kirby Ashi and Yamaguchi's result is coming from an Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence calculation. Our result is also coming from spectral sequence calculations, but for a different spectral sequence. So, in fact, so it comes from calculations with a spectral sequence that we get by viewing the free loop space as that other thing that appeared in my title, which is topological cohoxial homology. So, result of spectral sequence. Really, it's a spectral sequence collapse from a spectral sequence obtained by viewing these free loop spaces in Ah, in terms of topological cohawshield homology. So, topological cohawk shield homology is like a mouthful and a lot to write. This is abbreviated co-th. I mean, you know, maybe you should abbreviate it with the co- on the inside, but like that looks totally. It with the co on the inside, but like that looks totally dumb. So anyway, we do it this way. So, what is topological cohax shield homology? This is an invariant of co-algebras. So, I'm gonna remind you very briefly about co-algebras and sort of wave my hands a little bit about how these are related. How these are related, how say something about, maybe I'll say something about co-th, but then I'll tell you, like, you know, about the relationship to free loop spaces and sort of what goes on there. Right, so what is a co-algebra? Very, sort of very briefly, I mean, you should think of a co-algebra as the thing that is dual to an algebra. So, what's the job of an algebra? The job of an algebra is to have a multiplication. So, the job of a co-algebra is to be a thing that it has To be a thing that it has a co-multiplication. So the co-multiplication, say if my co-algebra is called C, the co-multiplication I'll call delta, and that should be a map from C to C tensor C. Say I'm working over some ground field K, and so then my tensors are going to be over K. And then it should also have a co-unit. So, you know, a unit. So, you know, a unit is like a map from K into my algebra. So a co-unit is going to be a map from C into K. I'll call that epsilon. So here's an example. If I take, you know, I can take C to be an exterior algebra on one generator over K. And then, you know, my co-multiplication has to go to like the exterior algebra tensor itself. And what am I going to do? I'm going to send, determine by sending this class x. This class x to say one tensor x plus x tensor one. Here, maybe I want the degree, I mean, doing this, doing this graded, and I want the degree of x to be odd to make my like alternating sign rule things work out for me. Okay. So, and then I guess the co-unit is the like kill X map. So, in algebras, we've seen this. Um, we've seen this week, in fact, that like there's a very classical invariant, which is Hochschield homology. So, Hochschield homology. This is, you know, a classical invariant algebras. And if you've seen a construction of Hawkshield's homology before, Construction of Hochshield homology before, you'll know that what is it built out of? It's built out of my ability to multiply and my ability to know what the unit is, and that's it. So, this has a dual, which is cohox shield homology. So, this is a classical invariant of co-algebras. Cohax shield homology in this census is originally due to DOI in the 80s. And you basically take the definition of Hawkshield homology and you just turn all the maps around. So, you know, where you had a Hochschield chain complex, and now you have a co-Hochshield co-chain complex. And what is it built out of? It is built out of co-multiplying. And we've also seen this week that Hochshield homology has a topological variable. Homology has a topological variant where I think about, you know, instead of working over a ground ring, like the integers, I work over the sphere spectrum. And then I can, instead of taking just sort of classical algebras, I can take topological algebras, algebras and spectra, and I can play the same game in cohax shield homology. So we have topological. So we have topological versions of both. So THH, this is for algebras, for algebra spectrum and co-th. And this is the dual version for co-algebra spectra. Right. So THH, you can think of it as like, you know, doing the simplicial version of just trying to understand the multiplications. It's the cyclic, the cyclic bar construction on your spectrum. This is the cyclic co-bar construction. And then, of course, to get the underlying spectrum, you have to totalize instead of geometrically realizing. But again, you should think really. Realizing. But again, you should think: really, what is it built out of? It's built out of the fact that I knew how to co-multiply and I knew how to have co-units. And that's all the structure that I needed in order to define this. So one really important feature of THH, so, is that THH is connected to free boot spaces. So So there's a beautiful identification which goes back to work of Bucksted and Woldhausen, which says that if I take THH of the suspension spectrum of the base loop space on X, right, so here's based loops. So of course, the base loop space on a space X, this has an algebra structure given by like loop concatenation. So this is the sort of thing I can take T. So, this is the sort of thing I can take THH of that this is equivalent to the suspension spectrum of the freedom space on X, this drawed baseline. So Bolkstedt and Waldhausen, I think are where these ideas go back to. Right, so topological Huckshield tomology comes from, or you know, gives. Comes from, or you know, is one of the ways we can obtain free loop spaces, you know, at least stably, which is all we're thinking about because we're doing homology here. But when you took the base loop space on your space x, like even if x was like pretty small and pretty finite, that's not. It's pretty big and pretty not finite. So one thing we can do is we can observe that x itself, it's almost assuredly not an algebra. That's like something quite special for a space to have a multiple. Special for a space to have a multiplication, but any x we'd like always has a coalgebra structure. And that coalgebra structure is just given by the diagonal. Any space x is naturally a co-algebra. Right, so I take the diagonal map. That's a map from x, x cross x. And then I have a unit map, or sorry, a co-unit map, which is the squash x to a point map. And so this makes it, I mean, this is a co-algebra in the category of unbased topological spaces. How I've written it down. But what this means is that. But what this means is that, you know, we can't just take your arbitrary space x and think of it as an algebra and apply like Hochschule hospitality or topological Hochschule hospitology, but we can think of it as a co-algebra and apply the dual invariance. So we can look at, you know, the dual like OH, OTHH type invariance. So, you say S is not base, um, this is an unbased space. Now, I'm gonna add a disjoint base point so that I can like do homotopy theory things. Um, so if I choose this x-row, there's no choice. So, there's no choice, right? This is just the squash everything in X to a single point map. If I based it, I would put a disjoint base point here, and then I would have the squash X to a point and keep the disjoint base point disjoint, and I'd map. The disjoint base point disjoint, and I'd map to the zero sphere. Right, so uh, in particular, uh, there's a result of maybe I should put these names in a slightly different order. Uh, let's see, work of Kuhn of well Keywich Hess and Shipley. Hess and Shipley tells us that if I look at the co-th, so the topological co-Hawk shield homology of the suspension spectrum of X adjoined a destroyed base point. So here's my destroyed base point. That this is weakly equivalent to the suspension spectrum of the free loop space on X. And here Here, let's see. So it's these folks. So Nick Kuhn and Carrie Malkiewicz, they do this for X simply connected. And Hess and Shipley show this for X, a nilpotent space, or otherwise, sort of sufficiently, you know, so this is telling us like high one of X. High one of x can be non-zero, but it has to act super nicely on all the higher homotopy groups. So it like really wishes it were simply connected. That's how I think about that. Right, so what does this tell us? This tells us like if we take this, we're taking this co-algebra structure, basically, you know, adjoining a disjoint base point suspension spectrum. Now we have a co-algebra in spectra, and we can take this sort of co-THH invariance, which you think of as sort of something very classical and like the natural thing to do with the co-algebra. Natural thing to do with the co-algebra, and we obtain the free loop space. Okay, so this tells us, you know, trying to understand stuff about cotiage is like about, in particular, we're trying to understand stuff about three loop spaces. So, in some earlier work with Amelia. Amelia Hogenhaven and Stephanie Siegenhagen, Tina and Brooke, and I developed a spectral sequence that was for computing THH, co-THH, excuse me. So previously, me and Anthina, Gerhardt, Amelia Hogenhaven, Chibley. So triple Sentine Siegenhagen. So we developed a spectral sequence, which we call the Hobbuxsten spectral sequence. That's That's for trying to understand the homology of co-THH of your favorite co-algebra spectrum. What does it look like? The E2 page is given by the classical algebraic cohort field homology of the homology ring. ring or the sorry the homology co-algebra of k right with coefficients over your favorite field and it's trying to compute the homology of coth of c ordinary homology with coefficients in k so here c is a co-algebra in spectra and And I've drawn this little wiggly arrow instead of the canonical, like double arrow, because convergence is a problem here. But we do obtain convergence. So convergence is okay under the assumptions that if C actually is the suspension spectrum of a simply connected space X, we can show the convergence hold. We can show that convergence hold. So, for example, this is called the co-bucksted spectral sequence because you can see that it's, if you're familiar with the Buckshed spectral sequence, that goes from the Hochschield homology of like the Hochschield homology of the homology of algebra spectrum to the topological Hochschield homology. So, this is sort of the dual sort of situation. So, this is sort of the dual sort of situation to what you see in the Buckshed spectral sequence, which is a spectral sequence for calculating the homology of topological Hochschield homology. There's a lot of instances of the word homology in Roe. So it's dual to that. This convergence problem, the reason that convergence is such a hassle, is that this is obtained as an instance of the Bausfield conspectual sequence. So I waved my hands at the fact that how did we Waved my hands at the fact that how did we get co-THH? We got it out of some sort of cyclic co-bar construction. So, some sort of like cosimplicial spectrum coming from C. And if you have a cosimplicial spectrum, you're entitled to a Bausfield-Kahn style spectral sequence, you know, coming from the very, the partial totalizations. And that's what this spectral sequence is. We identify the E2 page as such. But if you're familiar with Baus-filled. But if you're familiar with Baus-field-known spectral sequences, you'll know that convergence there is definitely not for free. It's a second quadrant spectral sequence, and everything is yucky. Okay? So, but you know, it is a spectral sequence, and we are okay to check, we have checked, you know, that you do actually obtain convergence in this case, the case where you have taking the suspension spectrum of a simply connected space. And so that's the case where the That's the case where the topological cohort shield homology is actually giving you the free loop space. So, we're okay to use the spectral sequence to try and understand stuff about the homology of free loop spaces. And so, in our recent work, Brook and Tina and I I'm just, G is Gerhard, I'm S is Shipley. We show that this is a spectral sequence with extra structure. And so then we can get a handle on some differentials. So this is a spectral sequence of what I'll call them Huff algebras over the co-algebra. Ah, the co-algebra given by the homology of x with k coefficients. So this is true under suitable flatness hypotheses. Which I won't spell out the flatness hypotheses in detail. Let's see. Right, what am I going to say? Let's see. Right, what do I want to say? I do. I should mention, you know, in general, when we define a Hopf algebra, classically, what we do is we say, like, we fix a ground ring, make a ground algebra, we define a Hop algebra over that. Here, we actually would have to define a Hop algebra over a ground coalgebra, which makes everything like, you know, a little different, but not really. I mean, you can sort of abstract the definition of like, what's a Hop monoid in some sort of symmetric modal category, and then it's that. So this is a, you know, a slightly different situation. Know a slightly different situation than you might have been familiar with. Right. And so, but what does it mean that it's a spectral sequence of hop anything? Like, essentially, what this boils down to is that since it's a spectral sequence of algebra guys, you have a Leibniz rule for your differential. Since it's a spectral sequence of co-algebra guys, that's the top part, right? The other one, then you also have a co-Leibniz rule for your differential. So, in particular, you have So in particular you have Leibniz and co-Leibniz rules. And so this extra structure means that we have a lot of restrictions on the differentials. And so we get the collapse result. So restricts this restricts the differentials. And so maybe I'll say this. So the original theorem, so our main theorem follows, so is like a corollary is obtained by observing that. That these restrictions on the differentials mean that the spectral sequence has to collapse when the input is, you know, when I have all those restrictions on all the various degrees. Sorry, collapses under the stated assumptions. So, just to go back, right, the main theorem was about computing the homology of the free loop space, which I can think, you know, in the case where C is, let's like play the fun colors game, right? So in the case where C, maybe not this color, in the case where C is the suspension spectrum of our simply connected space X, then this is. X, then this is the homology of the free loop space on X, right? This is the homology of the free loop space on X. And what is this? This is the co-Hochshield homology of the homology co-algebra of X. Right, so and I'll draw an actual convergence arrow because under the assumption that X is Convergence error because, under the assumption that X is a simply connected space, we actually do have convergence here. And so, our main theorem is that is really coming from the fact that this spectral sequence collapses under the assumptions about like what the co-homology of X is and it's like exterior in these generators and these various classes. And that comes from knowing that you have Leibniz and co-Leibniz rules for the differentials, so there's a lot of restrictions. Right, so the thing that you that we got is the answer is really just the co-hop. Is really just the co-Hochshield homology of that exterior co-algebra, right? Which you should maybe recognize. If you're familiar with this game, you might recognize as something coming from like the Hochschield constant Rosenberg theorem, which says that what should I get when I take Hochschield, you know, in the Hochschield homology case, it says like, what should I get when I take Hochschield homology of a free guy? I should get the free guy on the thing I started with, tensor with the free guy on the shifts of the generators. So that's where those things are. That's where all those things are coming from. It's that type of a situation. That for the most situation. Okay. Great. Emily. Are there suitable flatness hypotheses here to get something like so that you can define top algebras in something over a faux algebra? Or do you get that, like the symmetric monoidal structure on maybe on or on? Or on co-modules over things further? Yeah, so Jonathan is asking what's the job of these suitable flatness hypotheses, I think. So there's, and pointing out that there's several things that are like nasty and require flatness when you're working with co-algebra. So, first of all, like in order to sort of have a decent category of co-modules over a co-algebra, you need some flatness hypotheses just because like tensor products. Just because, like, tensor products and don't commute with equalizers, naturally. So, you need some flatness hypotheses there. So, that comes into it a little bit, but actually, a large part of the suitable flatness hypotheses are about trying to understand when you take the homology of like one page of your spectral sequence, you need to understand that you still have something that is like gonna be a coalgebra. So, it's it they come the flattenness hypotheses. It they come the flattening hypotheses mostly come here in order to understand the multiplicative multiplicative structure on the spectral sequence. To get the co-multiplicative structure on the spectral sequence, so to get the co-lagnance rule, that's like pretty much for free. I'm like ultimately working over some base field. And so like a lot of flatness hypotheses in the symmetric monodal category are kind of okay. Not all of them, but a lot of them are much nicer. But to get the alignment rule, to get the co-multiple. But to get the alignments rule, to get the co-multiplication structure on the spectral sequence, I need some flatness hypotheses relating the various pages one to the other to tell me that like I understand how the multiplicative structure passes from one page to the next. So that's the main thing. This spectral sequence is dual to the Buckshed spectral sequence construction. Our construction is dual to the one analyzed by Engelbeit and Rognes, in which they Engelweit and Rogness, in which they prove basically the dual theorem to this. They show that the Bucksted spectral sequence has a liveness and co-liveness rule. It's a spectral sequence of Hoff algebras. And there, for them, they require flatness hypotheses to understand the co-algebra structure. So we have sort of the dual thing where we need flatness hypotheses for the algebra structure on the spectral sequence. Right, in fact, actually, this is what I was going to write next. Is that? What I was going to write next is that we should compare this with the results of Engel-Weiden Rogness. Right, so Engelside and Ragnas have similar results about the Bucksted spectral sequence. There's all about the Bucksted spectral sequence, which of course goes from the homology, the Hauchiel homology of the homology of some algebra spectrum, A, K coefficients, and converges to the homology of THH of A k coefficients. And then this is a spectral sequence of Hoppe algebras. Of hop algebras. And here, this is over the homology of A. And then again, under flatness hypotheses. So you need like So, you need like n page to be suitably flat. So, this theorem is really dual to the Engel-Weit-Rognis theorem in many ways. Okay. So, how, so in order to sort of tell you a little bit about where this comes from, I want to recall just briefly where this structure comes from. And then our structure is mostly dual, but there's a couple wrinkles. Dual, but there's a couple wrinkles. So this structure comes from the identification. You can model THH, your favorite algebra spectrum, as you can take simplicial S1 tensor with A. So this is using sort of like spectra are tensored over simplicial sense. Geometric realize that. Rape. Right, so you're modeling THH as the simplicial circle tensor with a geometric realized, and then you know what you do is you can develop a cop type structure on S1, basically. Right, so you see sort of like a co-multiplication and a multiplication in the S1. and a multiplication in the s1 factor. You have to be a little, you have to be, you know, quite careful about the multiplication structure because s1, the simplicial s1, doesn't have a, it doesn't have like the multiplicative, sorry, about the co-multiplicative bit. You have to be careful about the co-multiplicative bit because there isn't a pinch map. Like the circle itself, if you just think as a topological space, there's a lovely map from like one circle to the wedge of two circles, which is pinch. But that isn't simplicial, at least not. Simplicial, at least not for like you know, the small standard model of S1. So you have to replace and like take some care to follow through on that. But that's but that's ultimately where it comes. And so what we show in order to understand sort of this dual structure is the dual result, which says that our co-TH is really the code. Is really the cotensor with S1. So for our dual case, we show that O THH of the suspension spectrum of our simply connected space X here, that this is really given by the totalization. The totalization of the suspension spectrum of X cotensor in the categorical sense with the simplicial S1 here. This uses an infinity category framework, whereas Engel, Weida and Ragnes were working in sort of your favorite nice model category of spectra. Right, and so what we Right, and so what we can show, we can show then that the same kind of like Hoff-like structure on S1 passes through to give us the required structure on the spectral sequence. So, the same structure gives the, I'll say, the Hopf structure on the cobuxion spectral sequence. Okay, so this is nice, and sometimes you should think, oh, wait, we should just dualize the angle by Rogness result. Angle by Rognus result. You might notice I made this claim only for the case where my co-algebra spectrum is the suspension spectrum of a space. In fact, and I'm assuming that X is simply connected here. And of course, angle-byte and wrongness don't have to make that kind of assumption. And this all sort of comes down to a very annoying and unfortunate fact, but like a fact of life. But, like, a fact of life, which is that the major sticking point here is that totalization doesn't commute with SMASH products. So, under the hood, in a lot of the stuff we do with algebras, is the fact that. We do with algebras is the fact that geometric realization does commute with smash products. They're both, you know, co-limity things. Totalization is a limit, smash product is a co-limit. Near the twain shall meet. It's sort of hopeless. And so in particular, what that means is that trying to understand these totalizations is a lot trickier and a lot more subtle than trying to understand the resulting geometricalizations. In particular, the The sort of the major technical point here that's happening is that geometric realization of algebra spectra is the same as geometric realization of the underlying spectra themselves. Totalization in, say, co-commutative co-algebra spectra, there's zero reason to think that it should generally be totalization of the underlying spectra. In this particular instance where I make these assumptions, I can prove that they agree. And so a lot of things. And so, a lot of things I can get a lot of very lovely, sort of formal results in this instance that I can't necessarily obtain for general co-algebra spectra. On the other hand, work of Maximilian Peru and Brooke Shipley shows that like most of the co-algebra spectra we know are almost suspension spectra of spaces. And so, maybe this is not so terrible. And so, they have a precise theorem that's telling you that, like, Precise theorem that's telling you that, like, you know, at least in all of our favorite model categories of spectra, like having a co-algebra spectrum is really very close to having simply just the suspension spectrum. So maybe that's, maybe that's, this fact of life isn't just just, this is just how it is, you know? So I want to like, this is a little bit hand-wavy, right? I'm saying Hop algebra structure on S1 gives some sort of Hopf type structure on the spectral sequence. Maybe I want to unpack a little The spectral sequence, they may want to unpack a little bit: like, what does this hop structure look like, just to sort of give you a flavor of where these things are coming from? And the point is that when you drill down, they're actually, you know, quite, it's sort of down-to-earth structure that's not hard to see. And then the work is in showing that you can retain this structure as you sort of pass through the spectral sequence and have it show up for you in the end. It shows up for you in the end. So here's sort of more explicitly what's happening. So I want to say I'll like make a little table. Here's structure on S1. Maybe it will be on S1 itself and not the simplicial guy because it's a little bit tricky. So in here we'll have structure on the suspension spectrum. The suspension spectrum of the free loop space, which remember this is the same as this is the suspension spectrum of x to the s1, so cotangent with s1. And maybe I'll put here that this is also coth of the suspension spectrum of x. So all these things are the same. This is the one where you can see most explicitly how structure on S1 is going to like give us structure on. A structure on the freedom space from us. So the structure on S1 is not very complicated. I can include a point into S1. So what happens when I think about like, what does this map from a point to S1, what does it do for me on like when I cotensor with this, with S1, right? Well, it should give me a map the other way because cotensor is contravariant from X cotensor S1. X cotensor S1 to X cotensor a point, but cotensor with a point is just X, it's just my thing back again. Right? And then I have, you know, like I have a fold map, F1, wedge S1, S1 here. This is the fold map. So this gives me a map. Well, it should go back the other way, right? The other way, right? So, you know, I'm gonna write that this is the free loop space again, right? So then I can think about it as going from, you know, X cotensor with this guy to X cotensor with that guy. So what is that? That's the suspension spectrum of the free loop space to, well, I get the suspension spectrum of the free loop space. I get like, you know, I get two copies, like one for each S1, but they're glued together along a base point. And what that corresponds to in Spectroland is that. In spectroland, is that these are like the box product over the suspension spectrum of x of the freedom space with itself. So this is like the symmetric monodal product in, say, co-commutative co-algebras over this co-algebra x here. That's one way to think about it. Great. Okay. I also have So before I say this, right? So these are like the pieces that are giving me coalgebra type structure ultimately when I pass to the spectral sequence, like tracing through these things, right? This is basically like a unit for this coalgebra, like over this co-algebra. So this is like the, this is like the unit of a co-algebra structure over this guy. And then this one is like a co-multiplication structure over this guy. So I can think about that because that's what that's giving me. About that, because that's what that's giving me. So, okay, so this is like you know, coalgebra over, you know, this gives me the co-algebra structure over the suspension spectrum of x. All right, so to get the other structure, I should go the other way. So, I can also, of course, smash S1 to a point. And then, what does that give me? That gives me a map the other way when I co-tensor. map the other way when I co-tensor with this map. So I get a map from the suspension spectrum of X to the suspension spectrum of X, you know, to the S1, which is the suspension spectrum of the free loop space. And I want to think about this as like a unit map of some sort of like algebra structure that the free loop space is having over this just the space itself. And then similarly, I can. And then similarly, I can get the pinch map. So the pinch map, of course, is the one. This doesn't work on the actual smallest simplicial model of the sphere. Yeah, the one sphere. So you have to like mess around a little bit. But it's not a big problem. And that gives me a map, you know, going back the other way from X cotensor with this guy to X cotensor with that guy. So this is the suspension. So, this is the suspension spectrum of the free loop space, box over the suspension spectrum of x, with the suspension spectrum of the free loop space, down to the suspension spectrum of the free loop space. And of course, what this looks like is this looks like a multiplication on the free loop space, but like over tensor over the space x. And so, this is the part that's giving me like my multiplicative structure. One thing I want to mention is that you know. To mention is that you know, here instead of the full, if I didn't, if I wasn't sort of basing this stuff, I could just take the disjoint union here and I would get a co-multiplication just sort of over the sphere instead of over x. So that's legit. But here, there's no sort of analog of the pinch map to a disjoint union, right? There's no good way to get to the disjoint union. So I really have to work over x in order to get, in order to see any kind of multiplicative structure. So that's. So that's that's a difference between this is like the algebra stuff. That's a difference there. Okay, and so you know in order to in order to like get all this stuff to go to the spectral sequence, you have to be a little bit careful, trace through your simplicial stuff, make sure everything is happy and meaningful in a homotopical way, but you do that and it's okay. Do that, and it's okay. I want to make two more remarks. So, one is like a very abstract remark, and one is a very concrete remark. So, I'll make the abstract remark first. So, abstractly, what these, you know, what we're really showing here, this is supposed to sort of sketch out for you, is that we show that the suspension spectrum of The suspension spectrum of the free loop space on X is a Hopf monoid in the infinity category of co-commutative co-commutative co-algebra spectra over the suspension spectrum of X. So these structure maps, that's what they're trying to tell us. Sort of, that's like the very abstract way of seeing what our structure actually is here. In contrast, the very concrete way of seeing what this structure is is that, you know, this structure is really quite familiar at the space level. This is so if I think about like you know the space level, I should instead of taking suspension spectra just actually look at the honesty disprep space and we can identify that this structure which is sort of happening in spectra and coming from this like cotensor of spectra with S1, you know, with simplicial sets, all that kind of nonsense. With simplicial sets, all that kind of nonsense is really boiled down to this co-multiplication, is essentially just the diagonal map from the free loop space to itself. Right, so any space at all is entitled to a diagonal map, including, of course, the free loop space. And then the multiplication structure is really coming from the loop concatenation map from the freedom space like crossover X with the freedom space. The free loop space, like cross over X with the free loop space down to the free loop space, right? So, what does this map say? This is, I guess, maybe we call it loop composite multiplication. What does this say? This says, suppose I have a loop that like, you know, goes through the point X, and I have another loop that also goes through the point X, it's like, you know, at the starting and the ending spots, then of course, if since I have this point in common, I can just go around them both. And that's a new loop, and that's the loop composite multiplication. And so this. loop composite multiplication. And so this loop composite multiplication is in fact what we're modeling here in this map from like you know the box product of the suspension spectrum of the free loop space to itself to here. But by seeing it sort of this way and coming from this cotensor with S1 stuff, you can see that it's going to pass ultimately through the co-box shed spectral sequence and give you this structure, which gives you this collapse map. So you can compute some homology groups. Thanks. Thanks. Thank you, Anna-Marie. Do we have any questions? Maybe we start here. Yes, go ahead. Um this is this so the next stop yeah. So the stuff, yeah, sure. Hi, Donovan. Hi. So the the free loop space, the homology on it has this like BV product structure and this like string product and all this stuff. Do you have any idea if this adds structure at all to the spectral sequence or gives you any more control over anything? I don't. So, yeah, I don't know if, right, there's like a whole bunch of different structures that frequency phases have. Places have. And maybe this diagonal and the loop composite are sort of some of the most clear, I don't know, ones. And I'm not sure if the other structure passed to the spectral sequence or not. Yeah. Cool. It's intimidating. No, it's about this involution on the loop spaces, like just by reversing loops. Can you track that in your last in your isomorphism? Yeah, I mean, could you tell what the involution is in that actually can show you in this isomorphism? Yeah. No, and so tracking the involution down to like the level of the homology, we have not thought about. We have not thought about that. I don't know. So, the question is: the question is: you know, the free loop space has an involution given by like, take your loop and run it backwards, right? And then that should do something on the homology of the free loop space. And we have this calculation of what the homology looks like in terms of like an exterior and a polynomial-like piece. And can we use the track? And can we use the track this involution through the spectral sequence in such a way to see what happens there? And the answer is: I don't know what happens. We have not tried that, but that's an interesting suggestion. Right, because then you know, it's sort of from a flop of the S1 term. So maybe you could see it co-simplicitly and then like hook it until it gets there. But we haven't thought about that. That's a good question. Good question. Any other questions here? Okay, well, if there are any questions in the virtual room, please unmute yourselves. Anybody? I don't know where the camera is. Wait, I do know where the camera is. Okay. Any questions? One more question. Okay. Last one. Sorry. Go ahead. Is there an S1 action here like there is in THH? I mean, I guess probably coming from precomposition with this cotensor or something. Yeah. So is there an S1 action? Well, and sometimes. Is there an S1 action? Well, in some sense, like yes, because every like the cyclic category is self-dual. And so like, I built co-th as a, you know, the totalization of a co-cyclic guy, but then that's really also like a cyclic guy. So probably there ought to be. But we haven't, we have not like initially, I, one of the reasons I was thinking that co-th would be fun to work on is because like, you know, my life started as an equity. Like you know, my life started as an equivarian life, and uh, um, and so I was like, oh, maybe we'll get fun stuff about S1 actions. But then we got, there was, there was, turns out there was a lot of subtle totalization stuff to deal with. And so, so we haven't gotten there yet. Um, but there's a lot of really, I mean, I do want to take the time to advertise the work of Maximilian Pechou, who and Elsgarba Indar, who are doing really cool stuff with like understanding a lot more about COTH. About COTH, and it's possible that they have an answer to your question that I don't remember right now. They have answers to many of your questions about COTH, I will say, many more than I do. Thank you. All right. Well, if there are not any more questions, then thank Anna-Marie again. Thank you.
