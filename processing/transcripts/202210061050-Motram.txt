It's got slightly hard to hear you actually. I'll I'll I'll assume that you you're okay for me to start? Yes, that's perfect. Okay. Okay, well um uh thanks very much. Thanks for the invitation to um at least virtually participate in this conference. It's been really interesting. The time difference has been a bit of a challenge over here, but I've been catching up online with the uh with the recordings, so that's great. Um, so um I as I think was mentioned, I'm at the University of Glasgow. I'm at the University of Glasgow. It would be great if Glasgow looked like this today. It doesn't. It's pouring down with rain, unfortunately, so I really would like to be in Banff. Anyway, so I will be talking about layered systems in a very different way from most people. I am looking at pneumatics and I'll be looking at trying to create, well, the goal of the project is trying to create layered pneumatics with other pneumatics and with other isotropic. Pneumatics and other isotropic liquids, so layers and layers and layers of macroscopic liquid crystals. And in particular, I'll be looking at wetting and de-wetting transitions. So, how can we transition from a layered system to not a layered system and then back? Okay, so all will become clear. Okay, so this is work with a few different people, theory people. The main work, to be honest, is The main work, to be honest, is hopefully you can see this: is Joseph, Joseph Cousins and Akshay Badwell. They're the postdocs on this project. Everyone else is kind of in some kind of supervisory role, theoreticians and experimentalists. And hopefully, I'll have time to tell you all about their work. Okay, so we've heard lots about liquid crystals, maybe not so much about the construction of liquid crystal displays. Obviously, a multi-multi. Obviously, a multi-multi-billion dollar industry in displays. We're used to displays coming from the very smallest to the very largest displays. These small displays in general are created by constructing an empty cell, so glass plates or plastic plates with a gap in between them. And then you fill the liquid crystal usually by capillary action in a vacuum. In a vacuum that it fills pretty quickly. And that's kind of okay. But then, of course, nowadays we have very large screens. And this takes a long time. So it can take hours to fill these screens by capillary action. And actually, even if you're not making a very large television screen or a display, a lot of the smaller displays, so for instance, this kind of iPhone display. Of iPhone display, and certainly the iPad displays, they're actually made on huge sheets, I mean, enormous sheets, 10-meter-long wide sheets, and then they're cut up. So, the displays are made as one very large display, and then they're laser cut into the smaller displays. So, filling liquid crystal displays has become essentially the filling is the time-limiting problem. Okay, so nowadays they don't really use this method anymore. Don't really use this method anymore. A slightly different method is used: the one-drop filling method. So, here you use essentially inkjet printing to print on droplets of liquid crystal in various different configurations, usually hexagonal. And then you bring the, so there your droplets are dispensed. They don't wet the substrate, so they stay as droplets or partially wetted droplets. Droplets. You then bring down the top plate fairly slowly, actually, relatively slowly, although we're looking for a micron or five micron gap. So compared to that, it's relatively fast. And then you just gently squeeze the droplets and they expand and fill the full display. And you kind of hope that there's no air bubbles there. I mean, of course, they try and do this in vacuum. And do this in vacuum. So, this is a really quite important process, and even though this is much faster than filling user capillary action, there are still problems. Okay, so what are the problems with this kind of method? It does save a huge amount of time, but there are still problems. And I'm not sure whether you can see this in the room. It's a bit tricky. This is just a test display where three droplets Where three droplets were placed down on this. So the dimensions here, this is about two centimeters by two centimeters. And basically, I've just highlighted there where the three droplets were placed down. And then the top substrate was lowered from the top and squeezed down. And they have spaceables, well, also edge regions to stop it squeezing too far. Too far, and then gradually it skies down, and there is liquid crystal filling the whole of this small cell. Now, the problem is, and I don't know if you can see this, there is a faint white region in a Y shape here. You may or not be able to see that. I've highlighted it just by putting a great big Y-shaped white symbol there. If I maybe turn that off. And if I maybe turn that off, you might be able to see it now. So, this is a problem. It doesn't look very bad here, but actually, of course, these liquid crystal displays, the tolerances to optical inaccuracies is tiny. So, they need to be absolutely exact. And this will ruin a display. So, we talked to this project sponsored by Merck, who don't make displays, but they make the liquid crystals in the displays. Merck, we're getting a lot of Merck, we're getting a lot of information from their clients, their display manufacturer clients, saying we want different liquid crystals because the ones you've given us cause these problems. And of course, Merck were insistent that it wasn't their liquid crystals, it was the display manufacturing process. So we were brought in to try and model this. This patterning here is called ODF mura, one drop filling mura, and it can seriously impair the optical performance. Seriously impair the optical performance. Okay, so how do we do this? So, this is the Joseph Cousins PhD project. We did lots of things that I'm not going to talk about. So, up here, we looked at just some really simple volume-preserving models of droplets, well, cylinders of liquid just merging and just saw how that happened, what the speed was, and classic fluid dynamics problems, but it gave us a huge amount of insight. But it gave us a huge amount of insight into what might be the problem. And it actually turns out that it's where the fluid moves fastest at the alignment layer, you can damage the alignment layer. And it was the damage of the alignment there that we're really seeing here. We also looked just in general about the flow in a single droplet being squeezed. And then this is actually this whole project here was about the Here was about the damage to the alignment layer, in fact, the time scales. So, we thought about the surface dissipation. So, those three things, those three parts of the project I'm not going to talk about, we essentially solved the problem and found out why things were problematic. But it did get us on to understanding and trying to understand droplets of liquid crystals. And one thought we had was: if this wasn't actually ambient air, the atmosphere. Ambient air, the atmosphere here, if it was an isotropic liquid, could we actually reduce the speed of the alignment layer and therefore help with this problem? So actually we were interested in filling this air gap, not with air, but with another liquid. And then we might, we at first were worried that we'd get a pneumatic underneath another layer of liquid, whether they would effectively separate out into two layers. Effectively separate out into two layers. So that got us on to thinking about this. So the setup I have is pretty simple, although there's a huge amount of complexity here. So what I've got is a sessile droplet, so a droplet on a solid substrate and a droplet of pneumatic liquid crystal, and then above that, surrounding that, is an isotropic fluid. Fluid. We actually can deal with not just an isotropic fluid, but another pneumatic that is missible with this pneumatic droplet. And what I'm going to look at is not even as we squeeze down, but as we change various parameters, can this droplet change its shape? So, as we check, particularly surface properties. So, a lot of the surface tensions and anchoring constants are temperature-dependent, so we're at the idea. Are temperature dependent. So, we're at the idea is: what if we change the surface tension in various parts of this? What will happen to this droplet? Okay, so as I say, we don't need to use isotropic. Oh, sorry, just one thing. As you'll see, the behaviour, as you might expect, I guess, the behaviour is all about the contact line. And in fact, even more so than you might think. You might think, because this is liquid crystal, there's elasticity in the bulk. Elasticity in the bulk, there's a lot of stuff going on at the free surface. All of this might actually affect the behavior, and it turns out effectively it doesn't. The contact line is the only thing that matters. Okay, so as I say, we could have an isotropic fluid on the top. We also have the model for a pneumatic, an immiscible pneumatic on the top. And we don't have the model, but it would be great to have the model for a smectic as well. So an immiscible smectic. So, immiscible, smectic, and pneumatic, and how they interact. Of course, there, the key thing is what's the smectic surface energy. Okay, so this is the system. And the key thing is, if we go back to our ODF, our one-drop filling method, and think about this system here where the drops are on here, could we actually get rid of stage two and three effectively and actually get some way of some manipulation? Way of some manipulation of the droplets that they actually create the layer on themselves by themselves. So, is it possible for us to manipulate whatever parameter and for the drops to wet the substrate? Okay, so what I'm going to do, there's a lot of work, we've published work on this already. I'm going to talk about static configurations. So, what's the stable configuration? Is it a sessile drop or is it a thin layer, a continuous layer? Layer, a continuous layer. And I'm actually just going to imagine that this is the passive gas, just as it is in the real experimental system. But everything is exactly the same if this is, certainly in statics, if this is an isotropic liquid. It doesn't have to be a gas. Okay, so important parameters here. It's not really a parameter. Beta, the contact angle, is something that comes out of the model that isn't. The model that isn't specified. What is specified are things like the surface energies, these interface energies. So omega Gs is the surface energy of the interface between gas and substrate. And Ns means between pneumatic and substrate, and Gn is between gas and pneumatic. And here's the surface normals, and here's the director. Okay, so this is just setting up all this notation. The key thing is that it's always about surface energy. We're just going to assume Rapini-Papilla surface energies. You can put anything into this, and you get fairly similar types of behavior. And just to point out here that our anchoring coefficients are these CGN and CNS. And these are the standard Mapini-Popular energies. Although I've added on what we call the isotropic surface tension. We call the isotropic surface tension. This is the surface tension if this was an isotropic fluid, plus the anisotropic part. So the ones that involve an N, the pneumatic, actually do have an anisotropic part, and the one that doesn't involve a pneumatic, the gas substrate energy, is just anisotropic energy. Okay, one thing about the notation here: when I have an anchorage. An anchoring coefficient as negative, that means planar anchoring is preferred, and when it's positive, then homeotropic anchoring is preferred. That will come up at a few points in the talk. Okay, so here's the general system. I have a not necessarily symmetric droplet. Well, it's a ridge, actually, because we're in 2D at the moment. And the key things I want to mention, and our director is in plane. And our director is in plane. It's in plane essentially because we've done some experiments and the director does look like it's in plane. And it's also because we actually, on this bottom substrate here, we've got planar aligned alignment, so rubbed align in this X direction. And so that's actually stopping twist. So we don't have any twist in the system. We can put twist in, it's absolutely fine. And it's just in this system, we don't need it. So the key things here are. So the key things here are connected lines. You'll notice here they're at locations D minus and D plus. They do not need to be symmetric around some origin. They can be anywhere. And what we'll see is that actually they are independent, effectively independent. And two different contact angles we can also have as well. Okay. And the one thing that will come out of this is not just eventually we'll find. Eventually, we'll find the director structure in the pneumatic. But the key thing is what's the free surface profile? So, this h is a function of x, h is this profile of the free surface. Okay, so we're going to do this by it's a static problem, so we're going to minimize the total energy, the free energy, and there are bulk and interface energies. I mentioned the interface energies before, the bulk energy is just going to be elasticity for us. Energy is just going to be elasticity for us at the moment. Although we've recently done some work on adding in an electric field as well, so you can start adapting the free surface with electric fields. And then finally, we also have an area constraint term. We've got a conserved mass. So we're going to minimize subject to an area constraint. So this is the Lagrangian for our calculus of variations, this total. Okay, here are the actual energies. The actual energies. So the bulk energy is this will be just the Frank Vassine elastic energy. There's also, well, we could have other energy terms here. And so, for instance, we could have some kind of conservative energy like a magnetic or an electric field energy here as well. I'm not going to use this in this talk. The energy of the gas pneumatic interface depends on the shape of the gas pneumatic interface, that free surface. Interface, that free surface, so that's h. But this is really just the integral, the line integral along the free surface of omega gm. And the pneumatic substrate, we're going to treat it as a flat substrate, and so it is just the integral of that surface energy along that substrate. And then the gas substrate, well, that goes off to, well, it could go off to infinity, but we put a limit on it. That's the limit L minus and L plus. L minus and L plus are the limits of the substrate. Okay, so nothing terribly new so far. These are classic energies. We have an area constraint, which is really just the total area under the free surface has got to be some fixed value. Multiplied by essentially a Lagrange multiplier, which is a pressure. As you might imagine, the volume constraint gives you a pressure like Lagrange multiplier. Lagrange Lagrange multiplier. Okay, so just in terms of the kind of constitutive equations here, I've already mentioned that the bulk free energy is just a Francocene. There's no twist in this system, so there's no K2. And we have, but we do allow both bend and splay to be separated, so we're not using a one-constant approximation. I mean, in the end, we do. I mean, in the end, we do that. We don't have to. You can still do all the analysis without that. And then the Rapini Papala terms, once you're in this geometry, the free surface surface energy obviously depends on the shape of the free surface, whereas the substrate pneumatic free energy surface energy doesn't depend, well, it does depend on the shape of the free surface, but it's flat. But it's flat, and so it's a substrate. Okay, so those energies go into the free energy. We then minimize with respect to, so essentially all of this energy, this total F here, plus the surface area, we use calculus of variations. Almost everything can vary. So the end points of the contact lines, the free surface, the director inside, everything's going to vary here. And so with every single variation, So, with every single variation, we get an equation. So, this is a classic minimization of elastic energy. Nothing surprising here at all. If you set k1 equal to k3, you just get the Laplacian. Well, in this case, just theta xx plus theta zz is zero. So that's fine. That's as you would expect. And that is just essentially a balance of torque. In terms of variations of Variations of the angles at the interfaces. These are independent, and you get two equations for one for each interface. And these are really just the weak anchoring constraints. You can see this from the bottom one. Just set k1 equal to k3, and you see this is just a minus theta z, and then the anchoring term here. So this really is just a weak anchoring condition. The reason why the top one is so complicated is because it's a curved surface. So it depends on the shape of the surface A. So, it depends on the shape of the surface H. Okay, so far, so good. This is what you would actually get with a fixed region. And then you get some things out of the calculus of variations which are a little bit different. You get the Young-Laplace equation for the pneumatic. And again, hugely looks complicated. And if we were to set CGN to zero, this would be an isotropic system. This would be an isotropic system, effectively, and you would really just have pressure balancing with surface tension. Okay, again, an isotropic classic Newtonian fluid, that's exactly what would happen. That would be the Young-Laplace equation. For a pneumatic, you get additional anchoring terms, and you also get the bulk elastic energy entering this equation. This is where something different is going to happen. As well as As well as variations of the free surface, we can actually vary the contact line locations. And so, at these points, you just do the minimization of the free energy and you get the Jung equations, which are the balance of force at the contact line. And again, hugely complicated, except you've really just got a couple of anchoring, pneumatic anchoring-type terms, and on the left-hand side, I've put the terms which. Left hand side, I've put the terms which basically would be there for an isotropic system. This equal to zero, these three terms here equal to zero, would effectively be what you would naturally have as the Young equation, Young balance law at the contact line. So that's the two lines, D minus and D plus. You could have a beta minus and a beta plus. The key thing here, and this, I think I've got, yeah, the key thing here. And this, I think I've got, yeah. The key thing here is that if we were to know the sorry if we were to know that the value of theta at the contact line, then this equation is local. This equation just says, if I know my theta, I solve this for beta, and it tells me what the contact angle is. And similarly, on the other contact line, if I know what theta is there, I can. Is there, I can work out beta plus. So it looks like we can work out our contact angles, which is a huge because once you've got the contact angles, that's not hard to solve after that. The tricky thing, of course, is we don't know what theta is at the contact line, because that's a huge, great, big problem solving in the whole of a domain to find out exactly what theta is at the contact lines. So if we were to know what theta was, we'd be happy. In fact, we would. Was we'd be happy. In fact, we wouldn't need to know anything else. We'd just need to know theta at the contact line. So, wouldn't it be great if we could know that? Well, luckily, we can. Let's just take a step back and let me just have a think about what happens at that contact line. Because the director at the contact line is so important, let's try and imagine what's happening there. But, first of all, let's think about just planar layers. Just planar layers. So, this is a classic problem of a hand cell. So, we've got hybrid alignment. So, we've got planar anchoring, weak anchoring on the lower substrate and a homeotropic weak anchoring at the upper substrate. And I get this nice, well, if it was a one-constant elastic coefficients, then I'd get a linear change in the tilt angle. That's absolutely fine, standard. If I reduce the height of this whole layer, The height of this whole layer below a critical value, this HC, then suddenly whichever is the weakest anchoring will break and it will all become either planar or homeotropic. Depends which is the strongest anchoring. So in this case, my weak anchoring on the planar substrate is slightly stronger. And because this is stronger, that's what wins. And it will always do this. As soon as I'm below this HC, and this HC. And this HC is, we know this analytically. Here it is. It's essentially a ratio of the elastic constant in a one-constant approximation plus this sum of the inverse of the two anchoring strengths. So if the anchoring is really strong, CNS and CGN are enormous, then you need to reduce your H to be very small to be able to break anchoring. Be able to break anchoring. Okay, so that's that's intuitive. If our anchoring coefficients CNS and CGN are very small, so these are large numbers, then H can be very large and we break anchoring very easily. Okay, so as soon as H, that thickness of our cell, gets below HC, then we're going to break the anchoring. Okay, so this is great. This is called the, or sometimes called the Barbary Barbaro critical thickness. Critical thickness. We've tended to also call it the Jenkins and Barrett critical thickness because it's also in a previous paper. And so now it's called the Jenkins-Barrett-Barbary-Barbaro critical thickness, which is a slight mouthful, but there we go. Now, the crucial thing here is now, of course, is that what happens in a droplet, here's half a droplet or half a ridge. And of course, as we go towards the contact. As we go towards the contact line, well, H is getting smaller and smaller. The thickness of our liquid crystal layer is getting smaller and smaller. So we're absolutely certain eventually to get below our HC. So eventually the thickness of our liquid crystal will get below HC. And so that's great. So what will happen is we'll always break the anchoring. And whichever anchoring is strongest, in this case, I've said the substrate. In this case, I've said the substrate anchoring is strongest, that will break, and suddenly I realize that in the corner region of my ridge, I will have a constant director. And that suggests I know exactly what the director is at the contact line. That's exactly what happens. So, we've run some numerical simulations as well as this kind of thought experiment, and this is exactly what happens. You break the anchoring in the corner. Okay, so that's I'm going to. Okay, so that's I'm going to come back to the Young equations in a minute, but the one thing, the one possibility that this might not happen, and so if the anchoring strengths are extremely large, which is unlikely to happen actually at the free surface, but anyway, let's imagine the anchoring is really, really strong, like infinite anchoring almost. Then the director will not break the anchoring at all. You'll get closer and closer. And what will happen is. Closer and closer, and what will happen is you'll get below the pneumatic coherence length. And if the director wants to be parallel to the free surface and parallel to the substrate, it can't be here. You get below the pneumatic coherence length, and suddenly you'll melt and you'll get a defect. So the only other possibility is actually to have a defect at the contact line, but you can work it out just using the parameters of a standard liquid crystal. Stranded liquid crystal, your anchoring needs to be very large to be able to get a defect at the corner here. Okay, so we're going to assume our anchoring isn't that large, that it's standard measurements, and so we're going to get this corner region of a constant direct. So that's great. So if we were, so here's lots of possibilities because the anchoring could be strongest on the substrate or on the free surface. Normally, it will be strongest on the substrate. It will be strongest on the substrate, but let's just consider everything. So, the first case is: what about if we have the strongest anchoring on the pneumatic substrate interface? We can actually manipulate that anchoring quite easily because there are lots of techniques for inducing strong anchoring and weak anchoring. But there, we either have, let's say it was homeotropic anchoring on that substrate. Anchoring on that substrate. So we know now the homeotropic anchoring is going to win. Theta at the contact line will be pi over 2. And our Young equation is this equation here. Now we know theta. I've substituted in theta. This is now an equation for beta, the contact angle. It's a cubic in cos beta. That's pretty easy to solve. Well, relatively easy to solve. I can solve this analytically. On the other hand, if I On the other hand, if I have planar anchoring on the substrate, theta equals zero, and very similar, I get a cubic polynomial in cos beta. If I have, oh, sorry, they can both actually be written in exactly the same way. There's a couple of signs that change. That's all that happens here. So we can write them both in this form. Okay, so in this form here, the left-hand side looks very, very similar to an isotropic Jung equation. Very similar to an isotropic Jung equation, and the right-hand side is all the liquid crystal stuff. So, this SN is normally called a spreading parameter, and I'll show you why in a minute. And then this term is some kind of ratio of anchoring and isotropic surface tension. But still, it's just a cubic in COSB. If you have stronger gas pneumatic anchoring, unlikely, but let's consider that, then what you get. Then, what you get is the possibility that the gas pneumatic anchoring is strongest. So that means the pneumatic director wants to align perpendicular to the interface. And so theta is pi over 2 minus the contact angle. The contact angle we don't know yet, but still, that's the contact angle. And now, rather strangely, you get a similar equation, and now it's just quadratic in beta. And you can have planar. And you can have planar free surface anchoring, and again, you get a quadratic in cos beta equation. Okay, so these are nice and simple. We can solve these equations. Both of those equations, again, can be summarized into what would be a kind of classic Jung equation if that equaled zero, and then the liquid crystal stuff on the right-hand side. Okay, let's kind of take a step back to that isotropic case. All I'm going to do now is actually say. Tropic case. All I'm going to do now is actually say essentially CNS is zero, so there's no liquid crystal anchoring. So this whole right-hand side is zero. That's the isotropic case. Very well known, done many, many years ago. People realized that the contact of a droplet or a ridge is governed by this Young equation, where SI is what's called the spreading parameter. So let's just plot beta as a function of Si. beta as a function of SI. It's fairly simple to do. Of course, you get to a point where SI is too large or too small and cos beta doesn't have a solution. So this is what you get. If the spreading parameter, if the spreading parameter is too small, then this doesn't have a solution. Beta, the contact angle will be pi over 2, which is what's called a de-wetting state. So you de-wet your So you de-wet your droplet. If the SI is too large, then beta again hasn't got a solution. The effective solution is beta is zero, and that's a wetting, wetting, a thin layer of liquid crystal coating my substrate. And in between, we have what's called a P state, a partial wetting state. So you get a kind of droplet. Okay, so that's what happens in an isotropic fluid. But of course, remember, what we're going to do now is put a right-hand side on here, which is either quadratic. Hand side on here, which is either quadratic or cubic, and that changes this whole diagram. And in fact, really interestingly, it changes it. Sorry, this is just labeling these different states, complete wetting, partial wetting, and complete de-wetting, wetting, and then complete wetting. When I have a liquid crystal, so I'll just give you a couple of examples, we suddenly, quite interestingly, you can get hysteresis. You'd imagine that might be possible. I've turned something that's actually linear into. Something that's actually linear in cos beta into a cubic. And so here's my cubic in cos beta. And really nice, I can get this hysteresis. I can get two possible partially wetted states for a single parameter, a single spreading parameter. I still get my de-wetted state up here. Still get my de-wetted state here. I still get my wetted state down here, but in the middle, I've got this hysteresis between. But in the middle, I've got this hysteresis between partial wetting. If I change the parameters, I'm essentially going to change the surface anchoring. If I change that slightly, I can get hysteresis from completely de-wetted to partially wetted and also from partially wetted to wetted. Okay, so all of this behaviour, this hysteresis has yet to be seen experimentally as far as we know, but that's what our experimental But that's what our experimental colleagues are doing. One reason, possibly, for that, is we need the anchoring strength to get to this kind of region here, we need the anchoring strength to be relatively large. And so we're looking at newer materials now to try and get the anchoring strength this large. The other possibility, rather than getting the anchoring strength large, is to get the isotropic surface tensions very small. And so you might imagine, how do I get? You might imagine how do I get the surface tension between my nematic and my isotropic fluid small? Well, if they were very similar fluids. So in particular, we're now looking at a pneumatic inside its melt, the isotropic version of that pneumatic. So you can do that by having top substrate. Okay, so we're doing that as well, thinking about how we get the surface ten the isotropic surface tension be quite small. Tension would be quite small. Okay, just where I am. Okay, so again, we get some hysteresis. That's great. We can actually go more. So what I've said here, all of this doesn't solve the direct in the ridge miraculously. We just don't need to do that. But if we did want to do that, and so for some optical applications, And so, for some optical applications that we're looking at, you do need to work out what the director is doing in the pneumatic region. We can do that in certain approximations. So, in particular, if we have a thin ridge, and this is actually quite common, so very small angles, you can actually find various solutions. We find something that's planar everywhere or homeotropic everywhere. And this effectively, if you remember, I said you could have these You can have these constant directors in the corners. Well, actually, those corners can fill the whole region. If our anchoring strength is weak enough, it just becomes a uniform pneumatic. So you can have planar or homeotropic. You can also have what we call a distorted planar. So we have these planar corner regions, but you do get distortions in the bulk. And we have distorted homeotropic as well. And all of these depend on the anchoring. All of these depend on the anchoring strengths, and so we can map all this out, all of these four different states, into a kind of phase diagram where we have on the axes either the pneumatic substrate anchoring strength or the gas pneumatic anchoring strength. And we get all of these states: so they're completely planar state, the completely homeotropic, and then these distorted states. And if our anchoring strengths get too large, then we get Too large, then we get completely wetted states. Two different wetted states. This is a wetted state where the whole system is homeotropic, and this one where the whole system is planar. Okay, so that and that matches with our previous predictions from just thinking about the contact lines. Okay, so quick, I think I've got a bit of time. Have I just a tiny bit of time because I know there's extensions. I've just a tiny bit of time because I know there's experimentalists who might want to see some of the experiments that have been happening. So, what we've done is for this case, we're actually pinning the contact lines. We can do this by creating a kind of a channel of in a hydrophobic substrate, a channel of PVA. And then we rub that so we have planar alignment. And then we put a fixed amount of volume of pneumatic, and we create a ridge like this. It's really nice. A ridge like this, it's really nice, and then we can really look in detail. What we do is, so there's pin contact line, so we can't go wetting, do any wetting here, but we can really look for these corner regions. And actually, what that means is this whole diagram can change. So, theoretically, we do this whole thing as well with pinned contact lines. We can't get the wetting transition, so these transition lines to the wetting move outwards effectively. And so, the now, the phase diagram looks like this. So, we still Looks like this. So we still get all these nice states. And what we do is we pick some parameters and work out where we are in this diagram. So this is an experimental picture, just a few cross-polarizers of the very edge of our region. And we've also done some, I'll tell you, we, I haven't done anything, you know, our experimentalists have done this, inferometer readings, and we can actually get the H, the profile. The H, the profile of the free surface as we approach this contact line. And we can fit that to the theory. And what we get actually from this is actually an estimation of our free surface anchoring strength, something that is very rarely measured. So this is the anchoring strength of the pneumatic to air interface. So we are experimenting up there. Okay, so in conclusion, what we have is Conclusion: What we have is well, wetting behaviour nematics seems surprisingly simple, but it's still got a lot of interesting stuff going on in there. Hysteresis that hasn't been seen yet, for instance. We can now do some predictions, not just of these anchoring constants, but the wetting behaviors when it actually undergoes wetting. In the future, what we're doing now is a pneumatic above a pneumatic. How does that feel things? The dynamics of wetting. The dynamics of wetting is something we're doing now. We're now not just having a ridge of pneumatic, we've got a rivulet flowing liquid crystal down a channel. And we can also have it driven by either gravity or pressure gradients. Okay, and that's me. So very happy to answer any questions. Thank you very much. I'm going to Do you hear me? Yes, yeah. Because you use 5 CB, I would guess that anchoring at air homeotropic anchoring is very strong, but also the anchoring on the PBA, orbit PBA should be also extremely strong. And I wonder if they could not. I wonder if there could not be you you probably know that when the two are calling are very strong, there could be an additional possibility, which is formation of order reconstruction. I know that usually it is between two flat two planar interfaces. So because it's not planar, I cannot even not imagine how it would be. But don't you think that such a thing could be also considered? We also consider? Yeah, absolutely. It could, but ordinary construction in thin layers, your layer thickness has to be around the correlation length of a pneumatic. And that's like 10 nanometers. And so that does happen, of course, because we're going down to zero. And that's what I mentioned before: that what order reconstruction in thin layers looks like here is essentially a defect. So it could be, but actually, that's. So, it could be, but actually, that's not what we see. So, if we were to have a defect, so we've done the modelling of that as well. If we were to have a defect, then the effective refractive index, because what happens in order reconstruction is because it's an exchange not just of the eigenvalues, it's an exchange of the refractive indices, you actually get a constant effective refractive index. And we don't see that. So, and we don't see that. So, we actually do see the refractive index change. So, we did look for that. Yeah. And it certainly could be a possibility. In fact, at the gas pneumatic interface, the free interface, we don't get a strong anchoring at all. We fit this with about, well, the strongest, it's 10 to the minus 5, which is definitely not strong anchoring. Okay, yes. And can I ask another question? How do you measure? I think that you are the colour of Colors, then you fit your colorimetry to obtain the experimental cube of thickness. I'm not showing the actual experimental process, but we use inferometry to do that. Okay, yes. Thank you. So it's about the interference. So basically, what happens. Well, maybe you know already. Well, maybe you know already, I'm sure, but yeah. Thank you. Please? For the application that you had mentioned at the beginning, I think droplet coalescence would be very important. And so I'm wondering if you had thought about that in terms of for the displays. The elasticity, I would imagine, would matter for the droplets to be able to come together without forming any sort of. sort of yeah yeah absolutely oh absolutely um so what we've done is we've we've done this this um uh simple can you you can see what i'm pointing at now yeah yeah okay so we've done this simple system we've done two or three droplets merging and we've done it both as um a um isotropic just to understand the speed because with a with an effective viscosity of a pneumatic just to understand the speed of Nomatic, just to understand the speed of them actually coalescing. And then we've actually now done pneumatic as well. And effectively, what we're doing there is a Healy Shaw cell. We're squeezing, it's classic fluid dynamics back 100 years ago, but now we've done it with pneumatics. And absolutely, you can get defects forming. It's rather interesting, though, because as you merge these together, the defects, if we could look on the top here, the defects actually don't like to be in the bulk, of course, they like to be on the edge. And so where you get the The edge. And so, where you get the two thing, two droplets coalescing on that cusp where they've coalesced, you get the defects being attracted to that point there. And they then follow that point as it goes off to infinity. So, you can get defect-free systems. And maybe one quick follow-up question about the spreading work. So, everything you showed was for the static case where you have sort of, but when you have dynamic, But when you have dynamics, then even for regular isotropic fluids, you have this advancing and receding contact angles, where it's also very sensitive to how the liquid interacts with the surface. Absolutely. So, okay, so this is really interesting because, yeah, we've done some previous work. Well, my colleague Stephen Wilson does a lot of work on contact lines in isotropic systems. And of course, as you say, you get hysteresis with isotropic. Say, you get hysteresis with isotropic contact lines when they're dynamic because there's receding and advancing contact lines. So, who knows what's going to happen if you've got the hysteresis of that contact line and you've got the hysteresis of actually this wetting transition as well, it'd be really interesting. We just haven't we haven't even tried that yet. Another question? I have one quick question. I have one quick question, which is now in the droplet you often consider the planar or homeotrophic anchoring. Often the polymer layers have some small tilt angle. How would that change the story? Yeah, absolutely. In fact, yeah, our experimental colleagues have to work really hard not to get pre-tilt. So, because we wanted to have symmetry, to be honest. But it's fine. I mean, if you've got a pre-tilt of just a few. Fine. I mean, if you've got a pre-tilt of just a few degrees, it doesn't change things enormously, to be honest. You do get, you do. So, what you have here is: I think, have I got it here? No. No, there's a picture, an equivalent picture of the whole region. You get a defect down the middle, and you can see it in the prediction here. And actually, what happens is that defect is very slightly moved to one side. But the overall structure, basically the same. If you could get pre-tilt of 45 degrees, which is hard to make. Degrees, which is hard to make, but anyway, then yeah, you would get a really interesting structure, very asymmetric structure, and actually an asymmetric ridge shape as well. I have a question about the sort of the more the manufacturing process at the beginning. When you have a bunch of droplets and you bring two surfaces together, do they get bubbles that form? Get bubbles that form all over the surface? Well, no, because if they did, they wouldn't use the method. Essentially, they do it in vacuum. And so they work really hard not to get bubbles. But can you imagine what they're doing here? I find it amazing. They're creating a gap here of about between five and ten microns of liquid crystal. Of liquid crystal when this sheet of glass is many meters in width and they're moving it down to within 10 microns in vacuum. This is why pneumatic liquid crystal displays are still dominant over things like Smectix or even OLEDs. The reason is it's cost them so much to build the factories. So much to build the factories, no one wants to tear them down. Thank you. Okay, then if there are no other questions, let us thank Majel and all the speakers of today.
