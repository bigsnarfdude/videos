I'm happy to introduce Chuck Paul Tang, who is from the University of Gards, who will give a talk about the rigorous creation of mutualism kinetics in the pressure in the presence of fusions. So please. Thank you very much. Thank you for the introduction and I'd like to thank the organizers for the kind invitation. To which I unfortunately, because of my visa, cannot come in time, I just received an email. In time, I just received an email yesterday that I got my visa, so just four days late. Um, I also apologize that I couldn't uh actively participate in the workshops because of the time difference, but I want to say that I'm really enjoying the talks that I recorded, so I watched them, most of them already. I really enjoy it so far. So, thank you very much. Um, in my talk, I'd like to give basically the Basically, the recent results I got with my co-worker, Bang Octoen also from Graz, where we look at the mechanism kinetics deriving from mass action laws in the case that we have diffusion. So here's what I plan to do. Wait, okay. So I start with the enzyme reactions and then the rescaling that I use and the formal derivation that we what we expect at the That we expect at the limit, and the main part we focus on the reverse derivation that we do, and then at the end, some conclusion and maybe some future work. So, the enzyme reaction is basically very common. It's well known that you have the enzyme combining with a substrate, basically generating an intermediate complex, which converts itself into a product and release enzyme, which can be reused to. This enzyme, which can be reused to again resolve the substrate. So, this is more like a circle. Here, I consider both case of irreversible and reversible reactions. Most of the time, I think in the literature, one sees most of the time the irreversible case, where you don't have this backward reaction from enzyme and product back to complex. But in some other works, you might have seen it, and in our work, basically, we treat them both the same way. So, when we look at this one, of course, for any chemical reaction system, one can always use the mass action law. So, let's first consider the OD setting, where we say the concentration depending only on time, so spatially homogeneous. And one can apply the law of mass action. Here, just for simplicity, I consider the case of irreversible. Then one can write down basically an explicit differential systems describing the evolution of the concentrations. The concentrations. And here one sees also that P is basically decoupled. So we can consider only the system of three concentrations. One important property is that we have the conservation laws here that the sum of enzyme and complex are constant for our time and from which we can compute the enzyme concentration using the complex concentration. So easy computation here. One very common assumption. Assumption or called quasi-steady state hypothesis, meaning that apparently one observes in experiments that the complex somehow reaches quasi-steady state or steady state very quickly. That means that the concentration of C stays the same. And from that one, we can compute C from E and S. And remember, E can be computed also. E can be computed, also can be computed also from C. So one can compute C using S and replacing that into the equation of the substrate concentration, we get this new equation for the concentration of substrate. Comparing to what is here, we reduce the whole system into a single equation. And secondly, the mass action law gives you the quadratic kinetics, or more precisely, bilinear kinetics, why this kinetics Kinetics while this kinetic gives you the sublinear, this is more fractional, and this is more simple. So, this one is the famous Michelinism-Menton kinetic, or I think it's also called Michaelis-Menton, Angry Kinetic, because discovered by Angri at the beginning of 20th century. And it's one of, I would say that if you look at a paper where they consider enzyme reactions or more generally catalytic reactions, you most likely Reactions, you most likely see this kinetic rather than the law of mass action. But this one is more like a formal derivation. So, can we justify that? And it's actually can be done quite easily in the case of OD settings. So, if we consider the parameter epsilon as the fraction of the initial enzyme and initial substrate, and we assume that to be small. And we assume that to be small, which is kind of biologically relevant because usually you have a very small amount of enzyme comparing to what is given as substrate, but it's still enough somehow to convert the whole substrate to the product. So that is a very relevant assumption. And then we can rescale the problem, we rescale the time, and then we rescale the enzyme, the complex, and the substrate in this way. So, what we get in the end is a fast-low system that you have seen already a lot. System that you have seen already a lot in this workshop. And of course, from here, one can use a well-developed theory for fast-low system to have much more than to assist. But what I just want to say here that when epsilon goes to zero, you can show that the solution actually converges to some s tilde, which solves exactly the equation of the substrate with Michaelis-Manton kinetic. So, this equation and the equation in the previous slide. equation and equation in the previous slides are the same. Okay, so this basically can be done. This can be done rigorously in the setting of ODE. Now concerning the PD settings, one says, okay, maybe the problem is not always spatially homogeneous, so that means the concentration should depend also on position. And one has to take into account diffusion. So from what I observed in the practice modeling when it comes to enzyme kinetics, When it comes to enzyme kinetics with diffusion, then people don't start from mass action law, but they start directly with the mecharismantin kinetics because it's so well known and well used in the enzyme reactions and simply add diffusion and say, okay, so this should be the one, should be the PD modeling for that. The question is, because the Michelin kinetics can be reversely justified from the mass action law with the QSS hypothesis, one can ask naturally, can we do One can ask naturally: can we do the same for the PD level? So, the short answer is yes to some extent, and the long answer is basically this talk. So, let's look more closely to this PDE settings. So, now here we start with the mass action law. So, the right-hand side basically bilinear quadratic kinetics again. And now we have the diffusion. Of course, I mean, one can already argue why can't you just add diffusion here already? Just add diffusion here already. It's actually related to some derivation from Boltzmann's system, but I would not want to go into details here. But this is basically the reaction between the systems when you consider the enzyme reaction with law of smart section and the ficken law of diffusion. So we consider the system to be isolated, so homogeneous normal boundary conditions and non-negative initial data. So now for the QSS. Now, for the QSS hypothesis, we have to modify it a little instead of assuming that the initial enzyme is small comparing to the initial substrate pointwise. We assume only that the average is smaller. Because if you assume pointwise, that means you have to force the initial substrate to be present everywhere, domain. But with this one, you can allow that basically, for instance, at the beginning, maybe the substrate is just in one small place. Maybe the substrate is just in one small part of the, or the enzyme can be in one small part of the system. And the enzyme can somehow be spiky, like it can be concentrated in very small region, but the total average is still small. So that is enough for our settings. So we do the same rescaling that we did for the ODE. Now, here, notice that I consider now is the case of also reversible systems. So the concentration of P is now relevant. The concentration of P is now relevant, and we also consider a case of slow diffusion in the sense that this original diffusion is of order epsilon. So, when we rescale to this D, it's actually of order one, but it could still depend on epsilon. That's why we write the diffusion coefficients here also depending on epsilon, but they are of order one. So, we have similarly, we have this reaction with the system now, but with the rescaling epsilon, then we are again in. Then we are again in the Faslos system framework, but now for PDE, which you have seen already from the talk of Christian Thomas a few days ago. And for this one, now, at least at the formal level, one can think of what do we expect as the limit system. So assume that we have all the convergences that we could do formally. And of course, here, I mean, it's very standard that when epsilon goes to zero, Standard that when f7 goes to zero, it's expected that this critical manifold is also vanishing, or well, I would say that this one should converge into the critical manifold, which basically means that this one equals to zero. And from that one, again, we can compute now C using S and P, because V now is the sum of the enzyme concentration and the complex, then it is not anymore constant because in the P D settings, the conservation law is totally. Totally. So do you wait? I see the chat saying that there's some problem with streaming. Do you can you still have to? Okay, okay, good. Thank you. So basically here we can compute C again using the substrate and product and now the sum of the enzyme and complex. And if we replace that into the system again, we get the formal reduced. Again, we get the formal reduced system now with the three equations, of course, because it's reversible. And now you see some differences already arise. But at first, in the very simple case where we assume that, okay, maybe enzyme and conflicts are not diffusing, and we are in the irreversible case. So that means that this term here disappearing. Also, there is no diffusion for V, so V is actually constant. And in that case, you recover exactly. Recover exactly this equation, so with mechanism kinetics for the substrate, which is exactly what people do when they simply add diffusion. However, there's a very special case where you have the diffusion for enzyme and complex are not present, and also it's an irreversible case. But as soon as DE and DC are the same or are different or they are not zero, then, well, when the, I'm sorry. Then, well, when the I'm sorry, here should be D C minus D E. That's a typo, sorry. Or D E minus, wait, D C minus D E. Yeah, that's true. So as soon as this diffusion of enzyme and complex are different, we should have a cross diffusion effect in the LIMI systems. So that's something that usually has been somehow left out in the modeling, in the literature. And here we show that: okay, the LIMI system, this should be the one. One. So, in the literature, so again, this is just a formal derivation. And in the literature, interestingly, I found only two references considering these problems of enzyme reaction with the diffusion, one paper in 2007 and the other one in 2018, where they show formally, okay, in the limit, you should obtain exactly this system. Our goal actually is to show that, okay, this converges. Show that okay, this convergence, this form of derivation is in fact rigorous. And this one belongs to some the fast ration limits that's recently very active. It's actually has been done, I think, starting from the 1980, but recently it's gains a lot of attention. So basically, it looks very much the same as this Faslo systems dynamics. For sure, it belongs, I mean, partly to that, but the approach is somehow more PDE and Approach is somehow more PDE and functional analysis rather than the geometric approach. And one of the reasons I believe that this one gains a lot of attention because the limit system are very different and very interesting of itself. For instance, here I listed the sum of the feature of the limit system that it could be. So it could be a reduced system, which basically is a reduction procedure. But it could be a system where you see in this. Where you see in the limit is some non-linear and cross-diffusion effects that you don't see from the original one. It could lead to also free boundary problems, Stefan type problems. It could give you some derivation of dynamical boundary conditions. It could give you different kinetics like what we're doing here or in the work of Cynthia and co-authors. And recently, it gives you even more sophisticated when the function. sophisticated when the when the function is behaving uh badly then you can get something very sophisticated analytically so but in in any way the the approach that we use here is more functional analysis or pde that it goes like this so you show that for any epsilon positive you have some solution for sure if you don't have it here then you can do nothing and the next step is very important is be crucial i say that to get uniform bound To get uniform bound with respect to epsilon. So the solution is bounded in certain spaces, but it's not depending. So the bound is not dependent on epsilon. And those bounds will allow you, if you have good enough bounds, then it allows you to show that, okay, f epsilon goes to zero, you have certain compactness. So at epsilon goes to zero, your solution converts it to something. And the last part is to show that that something that you obtain as a limit actually solves a limit problem. Problem. So that is the common approach. It's very natural. The most difficult part are basically these two, where you try, and it's crucially the uniform bounds. Okay, so that's why we start here, some uniform bounds where we use this functional analytic approach, trying to show that the solution are bounded uniformly. And for this system, the first thing we use is the dual. The first thing we use is the duality method. So, what we observe, maybe let me go back to the system a little bit. What we observe here that, oh, yeah, no, that's true. What we observe here that the singular term are appearing only on the equation of enzyme and complex, and they have a negative term, well, because of the conservation law. So, if you add them up, they're disappearing. The problem is the diffusion coefficient. The diffusion coefficients are different, so you don't gain too much, but you still can use something called the duality estimates or the improved duality methods to show that the solution is bounded uniformly in epsilon in this L2 plus delta, known both in time and space. So here, delta is positive, we don't know what it is. Here, delta is positive. We don't know what it is, but we know there exists something like that. And notice again that the equation for S, for the substrate and products are not depending on silon, well, explicitly, so there's not singular here. You can use the boundedness of or the L2 plus boundedness of the concentration and comparison principle to show that there are certain estimates. Certain estimates for the gradient. So, here, the gradient of substrate and product, and also the time derivative. So, basically, with the second lemma where we use a heat regularization, we can already show that the convergence of the substrate and the products to some limit functions. Well, so they're not even strong convergence in L2 plus. So, it's not really weak convergence, it's really strong convergence. Convergence is really strong convergence. So, for substrate and products, no problem. The problem is really for the enzyme and the complex. Well, that's reasonable because you have the singularity on the right-hand side here, which you don't have any bounds yet. And that's actually the main difficulty of the work here. So, what we have to do there? Well, first we look at it. Like I said, if you sum up the equation of enzyme and complex, well, you gain the right size basically zero. The right hand side is basically zero, but here you see that this Laplacian of something which is not a function of e plus c. So it's not a closed equation, unless, well, when d e epsilon and dc epsilon are the same, but that is very restrictive. So when they are not, apparently, or at least to my knowledge and to my colleagues too, some of them, that there's no gradient estimates can be derived just from this relation. From this relation. So then we have to resort to a different strategy, which we call a modified energy approach. So, what do we mean by energy approach? So, now if we look at this equation of E and C again, denoting A E by this and A C by this, remember that A C is just a constant, but AE depending on S and P, then we have these type of reactions. So, the idea usually is that you multiply the first equation by a first equation by a e times e epsilon to some power and the second one by a c c epsilon to the same power and you add them up so that you gain some terms that have some sign here problems here is a e is depending on s and p and it has no lower bounds or at least we have no idea how to show lower bounds because if we can show lower bounds we implicitly assume some boundedness of e and c which we don't have at the beginning so basically we Have at the beginning. So basically, we don't have that. So we use a modified energy function where we add something here to this AE that is depending on epsilon. So for any epsilon positive, it's bounded from below. Of course, when epsilon goes to zero, we want it to go to zero because otherwise it's not the right energy. But it's still for any epsilon, it's bounded from below, so we could estimate something. So basically, here the energy estimate is looks for. The energy estimate looks horrible. I'm sorry for that. But I just want to say, for instance, in the case that we choose alpha to be zero, if you look at this, if you look at the right-hand side, remember here we don't have yet the right-hand side is bounded. But if we could show the right hand side is bounded, then what we have here, we have that this term is of order f sine on. That means that it converts into the critical manifold. While this here, when q equals 2, for instance, this term disappearing. For instance, this term disappearing when z equals c, it's just a constant. So you gain the gradient estimates for c in L2, right? So that is something if we could bio this right-hand side. So in this case, where alpha is just zero, that's fine. Now for alpha is not zero, you could ask about the same thing. This right-hand side here could be easily bounded. But the problem with this is we gain still this convergence of this to the critical. Convergence of this to the critical manifolds. But for the gradient, we don't have anything because here we still have this factor in front of it. So for the second case, it is weakened the bounds that we need, but it doesn't give us the gradient estimate. So you see that in the results later. So now we consider the two cases. So you see that the limit system depending on the fact that if the Depending on the fact that if the enzymes and the complex diffusing similarly with the same rates are not in the limit system. So, we consider first the easy case where they are diffusing the same rate as epsilon goes to zero. That means that it's not necessary that they are the same for any epsilon, but when epsilon goes to zero, they are diffusing similarly. And for that one, actually, we can use some other improved duality estimate to show that, okay, the enzyme and complex are actually bounded in LQ for any Q. For any Q. And that is very, very good because then you can have also the L-infinity bounds for the substrate and the gradient of the substrate and the product. Another useful estimate that we can show that the gradient, the estimate of the gradient divided by some concentration is bounded. If you look at here a little bit closely, for instance, when Q equals to 2, you have to the minus 1. e to the minus one and a e is essentially uh s plus p so you need to deal with the fact that you have some uh some concentration uh in in in in the denominator and that's that's why this one is very helpful and using that basically now uh recalling this uh energy inequality energy inequality using the bounds in this case that d e epsilon and dc epsilon converging to the same Conversing to the same constant as epsilon goes to zero, we can bound the right-hand side. So, this is basically this lemma. You can bound the right-hand side, and from that one, you see already that the partial is converged into the critical manifolds with the rate of square root of epsilon in L2. And you have also the gradient estimates for C. Well, you don't get the gradient estimate for E from here directly because you still have AE to the power 1, and we have no. And we have no lower bound for it, so it's not immediate. Luckily, from this gradient from C, we can use another duality method to show that the gradient from E, that the enzyme can be bounded if we know that the gradient of the complex is bounded. So, thus, it's enough. And basically, in this case, we have the strong convergence of solution to some function, and these functions basically solve the. Basically, solve the Lime system with the mechanism and kinetics. And not only it solves this LEMI system, it's a unique solution. So, what we're saying in this case is that we have this convergence not only after a sub-sequence, but the whole sequence is converging. And also, we have the conversion to the critical manifold, which I rewrite it a little, with the rate of square root of epsilon. Now, okay, so this is more or less easy. Or less, well, not easy, but at least the easier one to deal with case. Now, concerning the case that DE and DC are different, then things become more yucky. Here I just have more than one minute. So I just skip this one and go to maybe the second one. When DE and DC are different, and we're in one and two dimensions, then we have some conversions. We have some conversions, or maybe what should I say? Okay, so forget about the higher condition here. In high dimension, we assume something more. But in lower dimension, like one and two dimension, what we could show that the substrate and the product are still converging strongly to some functions. But for the enzyme and complex, we couldn't get any strong convergence because there is no gradient estimates we could use. So the energy estimates are two single. SMS are too singular that we couldn't control it. But nevertheless, we could still show that the limit functions solve the limit system, but not in the classical or strong way, not even in a weak way. It must be a very weak way because of a cross-diffusion effect that we couldn't control. Nevertheless, it's still a very weak solution. So the limit system is still rigorous as a weak limit of the Of the approximating systems. But in this case, interestingly, even though we don't have the strong convergence of the solutions, but we still have the strong convergence of the grade of the critical manifold to the critical manifold. That's something we find very interesting. And that is only for us, it's only possible. It's only for us, it's only possible because we use a modified energy function. Without it, we don't know how we could do it. And finally, if we don't assume anything for the diffusion coefficients, then we still show that, okay, that the limit system is still a weak limit, but we couldn't get the strong conversions of the critical manifold anymore. We have only the conversions in the distributional sense. But that does something, well, it's still rigorous, but in a weak sense. In a weak sense. Okay, so to conclude what I did here, the conclusion is basically in this table. So, in the case of DE equal to DC, so in the limit enzyme and complex diffusing similarly, we have the convergence strongly, very nicely. We have the critical manifold, so diffusing strongly. When they are different, we have different assumptions. For instance, when they are different but very close to each other, independent of epsilon. Okay, so this constant delta. Okay, so this constant delta zero is independent of epsilon. Then we still have the strong convergence of enzyme complex substrate products, the strong convergence of critical manifolds. When they are a little bit enlarged, the distance between those are more enlarged. So it's not that small, but still bounded from above by something. Then we have a strong convergence again for enzyme and complex, but only weak convergence for. Wait, I think I Wait, I think I messed up here. It should be so the first row should be substrate and product, and the second row should be enzyme and complex. Sorry for that. But we all have only have weak convergence here. And in this case, we have only the convergence of critical manifold with the lower rate. And when we don't assume anything, then we have still strong convergence for substrate and product, but only weak convergence of enzyme and complex and also the critical manifold. And also the critical manifold. So basically, that's what we have done in this work, which will be appearing on archive very soon, I hope. So, for our look, we have looked only at the slow diffusion regimes, but of course, there are also other regimes of diffusion rates, which we think that our techniques could be applicable. So, we have to look at that. And since this one, to my knowledge, is actually the first work where we rigorously derive the mechanism. Derive the mechanism kinetics for enzyme reactions. So, I am convinced that the techniques could be somehow reused to derive also the similar kinetics in more catalytic reactions. For instance, like enzyme reaction, but you consider different intermediates or even with some suicide substrate. And of course, there are some numerical schemes that preserving these fast ratio limits would be desirable too. So, I think I should stop here. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you for this very interesting talk. And since everybody has an opinion about Michelis Menton, I expect many questions, please. Start with a comment, maybe it seems like this plea. Can you? This PD community doing this fast reaction limits, something we should speak more often to, right? If we talk about so fast PD dynamics, so it's a bit disjoint. I'm sorry. Maybe I could just mention that it's actually one of the goal so so this this work is supported by the the FWF and is basically a basically an international project between me and and and and uh Christian Kuhn. And Christian Kuhn, where we're trying actually to combine these two worlds somehow. So I would be very, very happy if that's becoming more and more prominent. No other questions, despite having to change many, so let's say more quickly again. We control this setting and overlaunch. Thank you. I think I've said that before I got myself. Yeah, I know this. Yeah, I know this like screen issue. Yeah, so I mean, you have a quite different scrub.  It is very fast. I mean, I can't tell it. No, actually, the boundary under Sunday, yeah, I know that. Yeah, that's funny. Yeah, it's not broken down. Yes, yes. Thank you for stuff I had to do so that it's quite a ring right there. Yeah, it has to be a little bit different. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. I think I hope so that one yeah, so there's more closure. I mean, there's a very bad lot to make it smaller solutions, but it's having a bit slower.
