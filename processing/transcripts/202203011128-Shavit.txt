Like to show that discrete models of a certain kind can describe both and then I will focus on a particular family of models that we studied and which provide for a unique opportunity, I think, for an analytic perturbative study of emerging scale invariants in a system with strong interactions by using beautiful random variables called Konmogov multipliers. So, incompressible hydrodynamics is described by the Euler equation. Is described by the Euler equation, which I guess you're all familiar with, and it can be written in terms of the vorticity. And in 1966, Arnold noticed an analogy between both Euler equations, one for an inviscid fluid and the other one of the rigid body motion. So, this is the equation of a rigid body motion in the reference frame of the body. M is the angular momentum, and omega is the angular velocity. And I'll note. And our notes show that both can be described as a geodesic flow on a Lie group with respect to a one-sided invariant metric. So I won't dive into this geometrical structure, but I would note that both order equations describe incompressible flows. They have quadratic nonlinearities and they both possess quadratic invariance. And similarly to the order equations are the two-dimensional. Equations are the two-dimensional incompressible hydrodynamic models where some scalar field, which I denote by A, so it can be the voltage in case of the Euler equation, a temperature or potential, in case of Adobe models, is related to the stream function in terms of some polynomial in the power m, where, for example, m equal to one is temperature and surface geostrophic. And of course, the velocity is related to the stream function. Is related to the stream function, and after we and A satisfies this transport equation, then after Fourier transform, they all take a similar form, which looks like that. And in 1969, Oberhov, who was inspired by Arnold, suggested to model fluid turbulence by chains of ODEs in terms of some vector field, which he denoted by U, and some three-rank tensor or gamma. So he wrote. Tenzo gamma. So you wrote an equation, a quadratic nonlinear equation for the velocity field in terms of the tenzo. And this flow will be incompressible if these entries are zero. And if these sums are zero in terms of some two-form gene union, then this quadratic form is conserved. Now, let me stop for a moment and talk about wave turbulence and show you that we can get the same form of equation for particular cases of interactions of waves. So usually, so wave turbulence, first of all, refers to the statistical theory of weakly nonlinear dispersive waves. And in the inner-shell range, it is usually described by a Hammond. It is usually described by a Hamiltonian, which is given as an expansion over the amplitudes of waves. So ak denotes the amplitude of the wave with wave vector k. And then the first, so and then we write the Hamiltonian in terms of polynomial expansions in the wave amplitudes. And then the first quadratic term sets the linear independent propagation of waves and also defines the frequencies, the linear frequencies. Frequencies, the linear frequencies, and then higher-order terms describe the nonlinear or give the nonlinear interaction. And for example, and we call a nonlinear interaction resonant. So we can think about the AK amplitude as an incoming wave in this cubic interaction and P and Q outgoing waves. And we will call this interaction resonant if the frequency of the incoming wave equals to the sum of the frequencies of the outgoing. The sum of the frequencies of the outgoing waves omega plus omega q, and then there should be also higher order terms in this Hamiltonian. And now we suggest to add strong wave turbulence, and I will explain exactly what I mean by that, of resonantly interacting triads of waves to Oberhoff class of models. So if we truncate the previous Hamiltonian at the third order, Hamiltonian at the third order and only retain triads of resonantly interacting waves. So the vertex of interaction VKPQ will be non-zero only if their interaction is resonant. Then the system has a symmetry where we can take AI to its envelope. And using this gauge transformation, we can turn the equations of motion into a system of the Oberhoff kind. So we will get a non-linear equation. So we will get a non-linear equation of motion for the amplitudes, and we can write it in terms of a three-rank tensor, which would be here Vijl. And this system is Hamiltonian, with this cubic Hamiltonian. So it also describes an incompressible flow. And due to that symmetry, we have a quadratic invariant of the motion, which is just given by the quadratic part of the original Hamiltonian. Part of the original Hamiltonian. And this system is already strongly interacting because it's already, it's given by a cubic Hamiltonian. Now, what is special about all these Obachov kind models, all hydrodynamic type models, is that thermal equilibrium is Gaussian. And this is even though the system is strongly interacting. And this might be a surprising fact. So in order to describe thermal equilibrium, So, in order to describe thermal equilibrium and then turbulence, we add white fossing to the Hamiltonian equations of motions and linear damping. And if we have a detailed balance, so if this ratio, so the white fossing has a correlation with the different amplitudes, which I denote by PI, and it's only correlated with the mode it acts on or appears in. It acts on or appears in its equations of motion. So there should be delta ij here. So if we have detailed balance, that means that this the ratio between pumping and dumping times the linear frequency of every wave equals to some constant, which I will call the temperature. Then the exact solution of the corresponding Foker-Planck equation is exactly Gaussian and not, for example, Gibbs. And that can serve as a starting point for perturbation theory. As a starting point for perturbation theory to study turbulence, which I will discuss in a few slides. So we will focus on a particular subfamily of models, which is a subclass of the models of the qubit models of resonantly interacting waves I introduced before. So we take this one-dimensional chain of interacting triads. Interacting triads and p and q would be integers where q is bigger than p and I'll take a idea interaction strength to be some real number. So this system conserves this quadratic function. And this quadratic function is defined by the recursion relations that wi plus w i plus p equals w i plus q. And then for i much larger than one, And for i much larger than one, I will focus on scale-in variant power law functions. So I will take wi to be some power law with respect to some real number lambda. And then the interaction strength Ai would be the same lambda with in the power of alpha i. And then due to these recursion relations, lambda should satisfy this equation. And these models can have many classical and quantum applications. Many classical and quantum applications because I can denote, for example, real space sites or spectral modes or masses of particles, number of monomers in polymers, and so forth. And if we consider the first two models, so if we take p equal to zero, q equal to one, then lambda is two. And then this is just a chain of doubling harmonics, which, for example, can be realized by a cascade of non-linear elements such as lasers. elements such as lasers. And if we take p equal to one, q equal to two, then we get a nearest neighbor interaction in a one-dimensional chain. And that sets lambda to be the golden ratio. And then the recursion relation we had before is just the Fibonacci sequence. Now to study turbulence, we inject energy or put white forcing and dissipation at very distant scales and then in dinertia. And then, in the inertial range, we would get the flux of the quadratic invariant. And because the nonlinearity is quadratic, then the flux can be described in terms of the third-order moment or the cumulant, which I did, or more precisely, its imaginary part. So I denote it by Ji. And we can find the expression of the third moment exactly analytically. So this is the form of the third moment, and it scales like. Of the third moment, and it scales like lambda to the power minus scale alpha plus one. And then we can ask ourselves what would be the cascade direction. So we just set the terminology. So if we pump in the middle of the chain and we dump at the two ends of the chain, then we will call the if the density of the quadratic invariant is a decreasing function in k from the pumping position to the dumping position, we will call this cascade direct. Position, we will call this cascade direct. And I will just remind you that in thermal equilibrium, the density of the quadratic invariant, it's average equals to the temperature. And to get an insight to the cascade direction in our model and the scaling of the density of the quadratic invariant, we can exploit another symmetry. So the Hamiltonian that we have is invariant with respect to. have is invariant with respect to ak goes to minus ak star and that provides the existence of an invariant subspace of solutions which are purely imaginary so if i take ak to be purely imaginary rho k is some real function then in an infinite chain there exists an interesting fixed point which is given just by the third uh root of the of the scaling of the third moment The scaling of the third moment that we saw before. And that corresponds, of course, in a finite chain to a constant flux or to the turbulent state. And that sets the scaling of the density of the quadratic invariant to be lambda to the power k minus two alpha over three. And we see that when alpha is bigger than half, we should see an inversion scale. Than half, we should see an inverse cascade. And when alpha is bigger than one half, we should see a direct cascade. And indeed, for example, if we examine the case of lambda equals to the golden ratio, we see for values which are smaller than half, we see an inverse cascade. So this is the case of alpha equal to zero. And for alpha bigger than half, we see an inverse cascade. And this is the case of alpha equal to one. But we checked. Checked different values of alphas. And another interesting thing is that if we define the skewness, which would be the third moment normalized by the second moment, so I denote the second moment of the ith amplitude as ni. Then we see that it's pretty much constant along the cascade and it's of order one. And then one can ask himself what One can ask himself what happens exactly at alpha equal to one half, and actually, alpha equal to one half is special. So, what happens at alpha equal to one-half is that we see two cascades, both direct and inverse cascade, no matter where we put, where is the position pumping. So, here on the left, you see the scaling of the density of the quadratic invariant. Then in the middle, you see the flux, which Then in the middle, you see the flux, which is constant and changes sign at the position of the pumping. But the skewness in this case, if we look at long enough intervals and we go far away from the dumping position, then the skewness goes to zero. And that might suggest that the probability distribution of the turbulent case in the scaling of alpha equal to one-half is close to Gaussian, which is the thermal equilibrium case. The thermal equilibrium case. And indeed, if we consider the marginal probability distributions of single amplitude and we check its even cumulants, and we rescale the even cumulants to their Gaussian values. So we see that at long intervals, they relax to their Gaussian values. So here for red corresponds to Red corresponds to a chain of 40 modes, and blue corresponds to a chain of 60 modes. And so this is the second order, fourth order, and sixth order connotes. And that might suggest that the case of alpha equal to one half might be treated analytically or perturbatively near the Gaussian state. And maybe Grisha will talk about this. And I think you will talk about this in two days, a little bit more. Bit more. Okay, now let's talk about scale invariance. And before that, let me note about scale and translation invariance in our models and in shell models, and how is that related to the scale invariance of Navier-Stokes equations. So in Navier-Stokes, Navier-Stokes equations in the inertial range, which is just the Euler equation, is invariant with respect to this scaling transformation. scaling transformation where chi is some positive number and h is some arbitrary real number and in in the case of the of a cascade h is fixed by one third due to the kolmoga of scaling or the existence of an energy cascade and in our case if we treat i as spectral parameters or shell numbers with a frequency or wave number given by lambda to the power of i so k i equals to lambda i so k i equals to lambda i then the mode number serves serves as a logarithm of the effective wave number and then multiplying scales corresponds to adding mode numbers and indeed our family of models is invariant with respect to the translation of i go to i plus some number as long as we rescale the frequency accordingly and the amplitudes accordingly with the interaction strain and And because we force the system or we have this cascade, then of course we don't expect the amplitudes to be scale invariant or to remain translation invariant exactly as it happens in hydrodynamics. And an indication for the breakdown of scale invariance can be seen in the scaling of the one-mode moments, which is anomalous. mode moments which is anomalous so if we define if we take um uh denote the scaling of the of the kth of the qth moment of the i-th amplitude with uh using lambda and some function zeta q then the fact that we have a precise law for the flux or a constant flux then that predicts the the third moment to be to scale as alpha plus one or zeta three to be alpha alpha plus one or zeta three to be alpha plus one and indeed our numerical fits give alpha plus one plus a small correction for different alphas and then if the probability distribution of one amplitude normalized to a constant to the scale of the to the value of a constant flux if this probability is scale invariant then if we redefine the anomalous scaling to be delta the function delta q with this addition then Addition, then if the probability distribution is scalar invariant, then this should be zero. And of course, we see that delta q is not zero, so you can see it on the plot on the right for different values of alpha. It is a non-linear function of q. And so personally, we don't find it surprising that the statistics of the amplitudes is not scaled. Amplitudes is not scale invariant because we have because the existence of the flux and because of the forcing. And so we believe this is quite natural as it happens in hydrodynamics. But we do think that if scale invariance emerges far away from the pumping position in terms of other random variables, then that deserves an explanation. And indeed, we see such emergence in terms of Kormogov multiplication. In terms of Kromogov multipliers, which in our case are the absolute values of adjacent modes. So, before I show you what we see, let me give you a brief background about Kolmvogorov multipliers. So, in 1962, Kolmvogorov presented a set of hypotheses on the local structure of turbulence in order to account for the intermittency phenomena. And he concluded this work. And he concluded this work with a third hypothesis regarding the ratio of velocity increments. And I think that hypothesis didn't get a lot of attention afterwards. So he hypothesized that the probability distributions of this ratio at the limit of the Reynolds number going to infinity should be universal function of the ratio of the scales and not of the absolute scales. And also, he postulated that for Kornmogov multiply. For Kornbogov multiplies, which are that correspond to widely separated scales, they should be statistically independent. And he also stated that this can be used in order to prove the logarithmic normality of the distribution of velocity differences, which was probably inspired by his previous work on the subdivision of stones. But we will see that this is not the case in our models. Is not the case in our models or nor in hydrodynamic turbulence because the correlation between multipliers cannot be neglected. So, the emergence of Kronogola multipliers was already seen in a work of Einkinshui-Mi-Wansen in 2003. And our numerics also shows that the statistics of the multipliers is translation invariant. So I denote basigmai the logarithm of a multiplier. Of a multiplier, and you can see here different colors correspond to different Kolmogorov multipliers or different locations far away from some of them are far away from the pumping. The blue one is pretty close. Then you should see that they all have the same probability distribution. And another surprising thing that we see is that it is indistinguishable from the probability distribution of. Distribution of multipliers in equilibrium, which is written here. Now, we can express the amplitudes in terms of the multipliers. So, I denote here the dimensionless amplitude. I take the absolute value of the amplitude ak and divide it by the square root of the second moment. And then I can express the logarithm. Express the logarithm of xk in terms of sums of sigma i's plus some pumping connected mode plus some constant which is related to this scaling. And then if, as Konmogorov postulated, if the correlations of the different multipliers decay fast with the distance between them, then that suggests the large deviation form at large or at large k, or in other words, I should be able to write the logarithm of. Should be able to write the logarithm of the probability distribution in terms of some rate function times minus k. And indeed, if we consider the probability of the logarithm of xk, we see that it collapses for modes far away from the pumping in this variable. So you can see this rate function for different values of alpha and different positions of convogo of multipliers. And then if If I want to, one can ask himself if we can approximate this rate function using the form of the probability distribution of a single multiplier. Then, unfortunately, this cannot be done here because of the exponential tails of the probability distribution. So, if we neglect the correlations, then we would get infinite moments for. Moments for positive infinite moments for positive powers of amplitudes. And what we see is that moments for positive powers in our case are finite. So we cannot use that. But what we see in addition is that the probability distribution of joint adjacent multipliers far away from the origin can be also well described. Be also well described by the probability distribution of adjacent multipliers in equilibrium. So, what you see here are contour lines. The black lines again correspond to the probability distribution in equilibrium, and the red lines correspond to alpha equal to zero or to inverse cascade, and blue lines for alpha equal to one, which is direct cascade. So, in simple words, we see that the probabilities of strong fluctuations of the multipliers are the same in thermal. The multipliers are the same in terms of equilibrium as in turbulence, and then we wonder whether we can use the probability distribution of n multipliers and equilibrium in order to approximate the probability distribution in the turbulent case when we're close to equilibrium. This is at alpha equal to one half, and then maybe use some perturbation theory in order to describe the turbulent state at scaling, which are close to one half, say one half. Close to one half, say one half plus some epsilon. And I will conclude with a nice observation about the mutual information between multipliers. So mutual information is some measure about how much can we learn about one multiplier by measuring another or some measure for correlation between random variables. And it can be written as the sum of the marginal probability distributions, the entropy of. probability distributions, the entropy of them minus the entropy of the joint probability distribution. And what we see is that the probability that the mutual information among two adjacent multipliers in equilibrium sits almost in the middle between the mutual information in indulged cascade and direct cascade. And there might be something to it, there might be not, but I just think it's a nice observation. a nice observation and I will finish by maybe by setting two the probably ambitious goals for the near future so it will be of course very nice to explain the emergent scale invariance of Kornmogovov multipliers at least in our model and at least around alpha equal to one half and maybe construct an example of algae flowing turbulence around alpha equal to one half. Alpha equal to one half, and at alpha equal to one half, we expect this Audi flow to have a fixed point which is exactly Gaussian. Thank you for listening. Thank you. Thank you. We have time for questions if anyone wants to ask something. Oh, Jacob? Oh, I think Jacob had a ha oh I saw the hand of uh Jacob raised, but maybe it's from previous time. Somebody have questions? Oh, Joe, yeah, Lydia, please. Yeah, so I wanted to ask and I don't know how meaningful this question is, but so if you consider the equilibrium propulsion distribution, the Gaussian distribution, and I can't hear you well. Oh, John, any idea. Maybe you're coming closer here. Can you hear me better this way? Yes. Okay. So if you consider the Gaussian distribution at equilibrium and a steady state that supports flux of this quadratic invariant that you have. That you have. Are these distributions smoothly connected in substance, or is it a discontinuous transition from no flux to having any flux at all? I think there will be discontinuous. So I'm just, the reason I'm asking this is that why do you think that perturbation theory will work in this expansion? Because what I mean by perturbation theory is that in some sense, Is that in some sense? I think that Geisha will describe it better because it will talk about correlations, other correlations that we see in the case of alpha equal to one half. But we do think that in some sense, the probability distribution of the turbulent state of alpha equal to one half, if we take the limit of an infinite chain, should be close to Gaussian. So we also in the So we also well, it's close to equilibrium in the sense that they are both Gaussian. Not in the sense that they sit closely in some space. If I understood your question correctly. Of course, the state, the turbulent state cannot. The state, the turbulent state cannot be exactly Gaussian because we have a flux. So there is a third-order cumulant and it cannot be zero. But if it is small with respect to the, for example, second-order cumulants or the two-point correlation functions, then it might be close in some sense to a Gaussian state, to a Gaussian probability distribution. Yes, I see. Just to make another way of asking the same question is that what would be a control parameter in this expansion, such that as you take it to zero, you go to Gaussian distribution, I presume, a collaborative distribution. So one control parameter is the length of the chain and that should make the skewiness, the flux with respect to the second the second order taking at the right power to go to zero. So this can be one simple control parameter that That might work. In the case of if the chain is long enough. So this would be like a size of the system, right? Yes. Oh, well, thank you very much. Awesome, very interesting. First, I think we succeeded to show recently that Galileans of Homago multiplies are related to hidden symmetry, which is both in shell models and also in linear stocks. Then perhaps you probably know there was a paper in 2002 by Gilbert Wolf Pomero Prokacas. O ML of Kacha. So they were considering this change of parameter in the shell model when you go from direct to inverse cascade. And what they saw is that whenever you go to the positive threshold, which is, I guess in your case is one half, the solution with a flux is a small perturbation of the equilibrium. It's not a common goal flux solution. A common water flag solution. It's a solution where the flux develops on top of the equilibrium solution. So probably it's good to take a look at this kind of thank you. All right. Well, thank you very much. And uh we're moving to s last talk of the morning session. Uh for some people it's evening session already. For some people it's evening session already. Uh so uh Dipanka, can you share the screen please? Yes, can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you, yes. Okay, so let me share my screen. Can you see the PDF file? Yes, we do.
