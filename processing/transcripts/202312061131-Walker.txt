Welcome back. Last talk of the day, and pleasure to have Kevin Walker talk about higher categories of symmetry species. Thanks, and thanks to the organizers for the organizing. That was a lot of work, and thanks for the invitation. So, let's see, this is. Let's see. This is work in progress. I think one of the main short-term applications will be joint work with Fiona Burnell. So anything I say about physics, her. So let's get started. So first, let G be a finite group for the next two or three slides. I'm going to talk us about G be the league group potentially. But there's this well-known sequence of categories from a group, and it has various names. algebra of G or VECG or categorical version and so on. So I'm assuming that almost everyone in the audience is familiar with at least one name each row. And these higher categories, a lot of basic constructions we do in quantum topology are expressed in terms of these. So for example, if you say here's a law of lists, So, for example, if you said here's a long list, we can do a kind of a code limit construction with Gn, and that produces n plus one-dimensional digraph-witten theories. We can let G act on an N minus one category. We can write down algebraically what it means for a higher group action, maybe G with some underlines under N minus one category, and that turns to be equivalent to the The TQFT version of the gap method. There's a lot of interest in these days with non-invertible symmetries, and one way of understanding that is if you take the completion of these things, they contain non-group-like, non-invertible elements, and those act as well. G-graded categories, cross-graded categories, and physics, also SVTs and SETs, which are versions of the above. So the goal of the talk is just to be able to give a proposal for doing all this for a leak or final group. And the ideas, they're not super deep, but based on a sample size of three, I don't think it's widely. I think it'll be novel, if not good. Okay, so G is still finite. So, G is still finite on this slide. And so, recall that we have a Merida equivalence between G, the in-category version of G, which I'm going to draw as on this side of this diagram where I have some codimation one sheets. And each time you cross a sheet, you pick up an element of the finite group. And then we can also take representation category G, which is a symmetric monoidal category, and we can tell us a symmetric monoidal and think of it as. Does a symmetric monoidal and think of as an n category for any n. So on this side, I have these ribbons off an n-dimensional space. And there's a marine equivalence between them. So the generators, by which I mean invertible bimodule category, draw this line, I'm going to f for Fourier transform, and there's no labels, so no group element hits the line. But if a representation hits the line, we label it by an element of the vector spaces, which should be that representation. This is actually a presentation. And then this is definitely a very diagram-centric talk. So the rules from the FDA use the diagrams. The main ones right here, if we move a group sheet past the representation dot and group X, and then we can just push group things into the thing and we can push a morphism of representations into the interface at x representation. Okay, so how so I let's how do we prove it's a re-equivalence by a convertible domain wall? Well, we have to prove a series of identities. Each of these, when I write isomorphic, what I mean is these, you know, these are pictures in the involved, and they are modules for kind of diagrammatic categories that we draw on the boundary. I'll put a picture on the next slide. And so I want them to be isomorphic as modules for this boundary. Be isomorphic as modules for this boundary in one category. And it turns out that most checking most of these is trivial for this choice of categories that I've given, except for this one. Here's an example of the category that's acting, and we want to show its equivalent with respect to that. And so this is the, it's not very difficult, but relative to the other cases, it's difficult. And so if we can write down a base. And so, if we can write down the basis, if we just have, say, the empty boundary can be shown on the outside, and the basis for this side is a useful representation with basis elements on either side. And the basis for the other thing is a single sheet G. And we want to show that the vector spaces of isomorphic are isomorphic and then promote that to be equivalent representations for that category. And so, this is just the Peter-Weil theorem. And so, this is just the Peter-Weil theorem. So, we have this isomorphism, and it's compatible with, we've got kind of two different multiplications. We can take tensor product of representations, and that should correspond to point-wise multiplication of functions on the group. And we can compose these representations, and that should be the function convolution product. So, the strong means that you have these explicitly statements. Okay, so here's the Okay, so here's the idea. We want to preserve this material equivalence, and so we should look for versions of the Pater-Weil theorem for Lie groups. And there are several different versions. If we consider only an automaton on the group, then that corresponds to taking finite sums of these row ribbons. So this is somehow the easiest generalization. Generalization from finite to Lie groups, and it's the one I'll focus on in the talk. But most of what I say, I'm talking about all these different options at once. And if we're more interested in physics, we might want to take capital L2 functions on G, and that's related to square summable sequences, the representation thing, and there's a few other possibilities. And so I'm going to use, throughout the rest of the talk, I'm going to use this notation f of g, which is. I'm going to use this notation f of g, which just means the appropriate class of functions on g, probably number one, but much of it should work for the others. So now we just want to push this through the constructions that we know how to do for finite groups using this. So first we have to, so what's our version of pi less, of vec g. Of vec G or its higher categorical generalization. So when we do it for G equals 2k, so this would be exactly analog of VEC G. So it's a tensor category. We just have a single zeromorphism. We've got a single generating one morphism, x. And we should think of x as being some, you know, if g were finite, it would be the direct sum of all the Elements. And then two morphisms should be algebraic functions on G. So we can draw a dot, and there's a map from x to x, so x is not a simple object, but this algebra doesn't contain eigenpotents. So one thing we have to abandon is simple objects and eigenpotents. Instead, we have these decomposable objects whose morphisms look something like algebra. So if we have a dot sitting on a tri-valent vertex, Trivalent vertex, functions on two copies of G, you know, once we know two, and so on. And then the higher, you know, so that that's a very simple idea, but the next few slides are going to make it look kind of um complicated. So I apologize for that, but I wanted at least most of this talk is this kind of general ideas, impressionistic, but I wanted to give one precise definition. I wanted to give one precise definition. So let's contain the next two slides. So when we compose these morphisms, what do we do? We basically just integrate over the superfluous sheets we have. So in this case, we would integrate over triples B212 and 3 such that they are equal to 3. So in higher dimensions, again, Dimensions again, this is sort of taking a simple idea and making it look complicated and technical. Do you have a single zeromorphism, a one-morphism generated by a single one-morphism x, but we should think of it as somehow the sum or integral of all the group elements. If we're below the top dimension, again, we don't have interesting results. That's interesting. The end vertical is a kind of, let's call it a variety associated with a boundary condition. We have the link of the vertex where we're drawing it. So I draw on a few possibilities of what we might want to put a dot. Take the link. And then we can, somehow we're modeling flat G connections on the link. So we have a copy of G for each codimension 1 cell, and we have a relation like this for each codimension 2 cell. This is for each code of mission 2 cell. And that's a variety. It'll always be isomorphic to just a product of copies of G, but it's nice. I want to give it a more symmetric description. And so and so functions on that variety are the morphisms. Variety of artomorphisms. Okay, now I have to tell you how to compose. And so you have the somehow flat connections on either side of this piece, a variety of such things, has a subset where they agree on the interface. And then we can project down to by connections here, basically forgetting about these internal faces. And so that gives us a map of function spaces where we have a restriction going from here to here. We have a restriction going from here to here, and we just integrate along the fiber. So, this is where I'm using that. I have a compact group. I could play for non-compact groups, so I'm just going to stick with that case. Okay, so one thing to note about this, I've been calling it a category or a tensor category, but it doesn't have units. It doesn't have tensor units, doesn't have. And kind of two morphism units. But nevertheless, we can work with the diagrams. You can just, you know, a lot of the main theorems about skein theory and how one does coding constructions to things for more complicated manifolds. Somehow, if you're careful, just slightly careful, you don't need skin theory. You just have to be sure that all your string diagrams fill up most of the manifold. Fill up most of the manifold. And you have to check that there's some kind of factories that there's a way to sort of refine the dot. If we're cutting a manifold up in the balls, we have to be able to refine. So I wasn't going to talk a lot about that. But we can manipulate these diagrams and do all the things we usually do. So I'm going to pause here and encourage you quick. So is the composition of two morphisms just a product of functions like in the VECG case where you just have on a single strand? Yes. Yes. Why isn't that unit? Isn't purely just a cost of function? Well, no, that does have a unit, but if we had two spams, it wouldn't have a unit. And the tensor unit would basically be like a skyscraper. Should you fit the identity, but you know, you're not. And should I think of the horizontal prior to two multiplications as a convolution? Yes. A related question. If I'm just looking at coronary dichrophy theory, I would have expected some normalization factor in this samples. Where does this go? Oh, I yeah, I I s I should have written it down. I I'm assuming the volume of G is one. Down. I'm assuming the volume of G is one. Okay. I see. Sorry, that's a good point, but I um. Other cases that I've seen of kind of non-unable scheme theories, I have an interpretation where the schemes are like the projective modules, and then there's sort of also a category of all modules. Is that available here? Is that available here? I'm not sure. I can my so there was a project with David where we definitely use that and need to, you know, in my thinking is this came first, and I don't, and you know, to me, the projectors is a more recent idea. So I haven't gone back to see whether this can be reinterpreted that way. So certainly, yeah, these ideas about the non-interval stain theory. About the non-unital stain theory apply to the case that you're talking about. Does the things with projectors apply here? Not so sure. My hunch is that, no, they're kind of going off in their throat directions. Okay, so now we want to apply just everything we know how to do for a finite group, like G-grader categories, et cetera. We just want to push it through this formalism. So let's get started. So let's get started. Okay, so can we do a TQFT? Yes, at least the n plus epsilon dimensional TQFT. And what's the Hilbert space for an n-dimensional manifold? And it turns out to be algebraic functions on the variety of the expected answer. So my original motivation for doing this was, so this can lead to applications in algebraic. This can lead to applications in algebraic geometry and language like that. That was the original motivation for doing this. But let's look at some other cases. So how about what does it mean for the tensor category version of G to act on a one category? So basically a module category. So here I'm reminding you of the standard answer for finite groups. So we have functors reach elements. Functors for each element of G, so a bunch of different functors, and then a bunch of different natural transformations relating compositions, and then those natural transformations have to satisfy an identity like this. So in contrast, when we have a Lie group, so this is again a finite group case here, we just have one object, one generating object, so we should have a single functor, which we should think of as somehow the symmetrizing functor or the spear. Symmetrizing functor or the smear everything out along G functor. And then this two-morphism goes to a natural transformation from that functor to itself. And similarly, you know, dot here would give us a natural transformation from composing the two functors there. And then there's a bunch of relations that have to be satisfied. And I, you know, cause this a short talk. I'm just giving some sample relations. I'm just giving some sample relations. So, these are relations between two morphisms, and that leads to things that these natural transformations have to satisfy. So, for example, a map from the abelian algebra of functions on G into natural transformations and similar. And so, what's an example of such a thing? Well, we could, you know, suppose G acts on the space Y, we have a map out. Y, map alpha, you can consider she's on y, and then the functor is take a she form y, pull back the g cross y, and then map forward, push forward with alpha. So it kind of seems to jump. So I think the point here is that I think the surprising thing is when we're, I guess what I'm putting out, the idea that if we've got a continuous group, you should never consider just a single functor of group bag. Single functor of group action. You want to consider them all at once. Why do you want to do that? Because we want to treat G as a topological group, not a discrete group. So somehow thinking about these things one at a time is implicitly using the discrete topology on G. It's not what we want to do. So we just have one big gigantic functor that takes them all, but it has a big algebra of natural transformations. And so this somehow is the grading. From algebraic functions on G into natural transformations. That's kind of a go to sleep now. That's the main idea of the topic. Okay, so that's G acting on one category. And so I guess some other potential applications of this are in physics, and physicists are interested in these things where they use. They make it seem more complex. What they use, you know, they make it seem more complicated. But to construct another example, we could start out with, say, some extension of g by u1. And these are, of course, classified by second co-homology with coefficients at u1. And I'm emphasizing that it's using the interesting version of cohomology. So Borel cohomology, the bigger one, where I was using just cohomology based on continuous forms, and because it's complex. Continuous forms, and because it's compactly grouped, there wouldn't be any interesting classes. And we can take the associated line bundle, we can look at sections, maybe algebraic sections of this line bundle and functions of GX on that. And that basically gives us a module category for G2, which leads to SVT, and then similarly for higher boreal cohomology. So haven't checked all the details, but if you take this and you put it on a lattice the way. The way Ramona was talking, or similar to how Ramona was talking about the last talk, that hope is you recover these models by when and any authors will they use in Burl code okay let's go up a category level suppose we have a three category version of GI came on a tensor category ingredients so this is reviewing the answer for finite groups This is reviewing the answer for finite groups. So, again, we would have a bunch of different functors, a bunch of different pseudo-natural transformations, and then for each triple of elements, a modification or a second-order natural transformation between these guys, and they would have to satisfy some identities, like the Pentagon identity. And so, in contrast, the Lie group case, again, just a single functor, symmetrizing functor, for each. For each, we could have vertices with any number of lines, but in this case, we get a natural transformation from this functor composer itself. And then if we have just a dot on a sheet, that gives us a modification, a second-order maximum transformation between these identity computers for each one. Something like this, and there's more data, and there's lots of identities, these various. Identities, these various higher order natural transformations would have to satisfy. But the point is that somehow these natural transformations, which are labeled by functions on the group or product of copies of the group, that's doing all the work. Okay, what about um Drumfeld Center or annular category. I'm not sure, but I think Drumfeld Center doesn't work very well for this. But the two category does give a very sensible answer. So what is the two category? It's diagrams drawn in an annulus. Just to concentrate on that diagram. So this category with only one object, so Gussian kind of algebra, as a vector space, the endomorphisms. As a vector space, the endomorphisms of this are functions on g cross g. I can label the sheet by one element of g and this sheet by the other, and then that determines it there. And then what's the multiplication on these? Well, it's kind of a combination of point-wise and convolution. So if I have two such functions, their product evaluated on A and D is integral in G, that expression where, you know, why am I writing down these? You know, why am I writing on these particular things? Just think of this thing. And so, what would the representation? So that gives some algebra. What are the representations of that algebra and which would be G equivalent to use for G actiments of a conjugation, which again I think is the expected answer? What I think is true is that, you know. is true is that, you know, so under in general, rather than on the board, you know, the representations of the tube category of something should be isomorphic to the Jinfeld center of the sort of one category or representation of the same thing. Representation of the same thing. So, in this case, we would consider one category representations would just be she's on G. So I guess what I expect would be true is that the Rinfeld center of she's on GA will be the same as this. Yeah, I wasn't being very, you know, always like coherent. I don't know. I'm not an algebraic geometry. If you deal with compact grouping, I don't even know what coherent sheets are. Okay, so in that case, yeah, I have to think about it more. Yeah, I will note, I think in an earlier slide, I said push forward, and that's the first time I've ever spoken those words in my life. So I mean, yeah. So I'm basically, yeah, in some sense, this talk is trying to take things that are maybe. Since this talk is trying to take things that are maybe more naturally algebraic geometry and make them look more diagrammatical and skeptical. And when you write this integral, you mean some type of variant? This integral is just like the integral of power measure. Yeah, for comp record. I think definitely I'm like to do this, but I think there's some fancier way of doing it just for it. Okay, so how does what would a G-graded category look like? So when G is finite, at least the way I think of a G-graded category is, you know, there's some bulk that has these G sheets, and we look at the sort of category that could live on the edge of the G sheets. And so, because each sheet has a label, we get a grading, you know, C sub G, C sub H. If we use them together, they land in the G times H grading. H grading. In the Libro case, again, we would just have a single grading, X. So basically, we take some of them all together. And the reason we do that is we want to not pretend that G has a discrete topology. But then there are these dots out in the bulk. When we push them to the boundary, they become natural transformations. So we have a single tensor category. And then for each function on g, we have a natural transformation from the identity of the identity functor. And satisfying some relations that these dots could be go there and be pushed out. And I think the easiest way to express it is in terms of the Hop algebra structure of functions on G. So I act, say, a pure sum dot, and that can be re-expressed at the Expressed acting down here and here where I'm using sort of Sweden notation for the co-pod function. So again, fairly, so this is the proposal for what a G created category should mean. G is something like URC2. Um for like for the category C? Yeah. For the category C? Yeah. I mean, I don't think strictly speaking they're semi-simple in the same way that, say, a polynomial algebra is not semi-simple, but it's a somehow milder form of non-semi-simplicity in, say, more coins. But the the examples will come from you know GE acting on this. But I will admit I haven't worked through a whole okay and then the last last topic and I actually this slide you know is I didn't think I would make it this far in half an hour so I kind of cheated on the slide list thinking about G cross rated categories. So one way to think about G cross rate So, one way I think about G cross-graded categories is they're a module category for the three-dimensional version of G, but we integrate along this line. Somehow, you have the codimission two defects within a bulk that's dimensional. Okay, so what is this as a two-category? It's got a single zero morphism, so we can think of it as a tensor category again, nine years ago. One morphism and And then the endomorphisms of this will be two copies of G corresponding to these two cheaps. There, the vertical composition is going to look point-wise, whereas horizontal is going to be a convolution, similar to what we saw before in the tube category. And so, we get a lot of natural transformations. A data I can compute here will somehow correspond to the G grading. Somehow correspond to the G grading, whereas data on this sheet or the G action, you know, correspond to what we usually call the G action few cross-rated categories. And then finally, the cross-rated condition where we maybe move these orange dots to the green dots that think of that as an action of this space of functions, and it has an endomorphism chorus. Corresponding to the topology of this diagram, we add G cross G to G cross G according to that. And then the natural transformations have to be compatible with that, and that's the handling of the cross-grade condition. So again, I haven't written down everything, I just wanted to give a flavor for it. Have you tried writing down the state sum for these for these GN things? Or and how far does it like what's the expectation? How far this close? I don't think it's far at all because the spaces are infinite dimensional. The variety is fortunate. Yeah, so I I don't um I mean my guess is that didn't get too far. Get too far? Like, maybe I'm missing something. You've got an idea. What? Oh, like how many handles you could define. Like, you know, it's common, like, you know, suppose you try to do revQ of G, you know, G is a quantum group for Q generic. You typically can define it upon n plus one manifolds, go ahead and zero and one handles, but when you try to do the two handle, Oh, yeah, in terms of dualizing, yeah, this is indualizable, but I don't think it comes anywhere close to being plus one to eleven. That's my expectation. Yeah, so I should have said all the categories were kind of typical from that that's built into that. It will work, but certain kinds and not the top certain source. Like the ones that don't have any handles. Yeah, no, I agree. I agree with that. Can you twist these things by that Verocho mode? The twist associator? I think, yeah, I didn't, I didn't, I was thinking about that this morning, and I think the answer is yes, but so let's give a tentative yes to that, but I haven't written any thoughts. At some point early on, you said you only had to check this, there were like a bunch of handles relations. You said like A applied to this cobordism, this A of this cobordism. You only had to check the one handles. No, you have to check all of them, but I'm saying that most of the checks are, you know, you're just seeing the two modules that are obviously approximately trivial are the same as. Approximately trivial or the same as each other. And so the so all of them have to be checked, but the most challenging check was for the one-hand rule. And again, the main point of that was that this merida equivalence that we implicitly make use of all the time between rep, g, and g boils down to the Peter-Weil theorem. And then when we state the Peter-Weil theorem for topological Theorem for topological lead groups, we have to state it carefully, and that, and then I'm trying to just take what we already know about Peter-Weil theorem and somehow reverse engineer it into the categories of the field. So your choice of which version of the Peter-Weil theorem doesn't have ramifications for checking the higher handles? Yeah, I don't think so. I think so. And it's based, and the reason is as an The reason is as an end category, you know, like rev G is only interesting and only has interesting n minus one morphisms, and g only has interesting one morphisms. So it's somehow that it's the higher connectivity of BG is what it boils down to. I think for general categories, yeah, all of those would be difficult to check.
