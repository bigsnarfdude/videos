We have Amija Joe going. I apologize for mispronouncing that. Perhaps I could tell everybody the correct pronunciation. It's Martini Dumerigan. What he said. He's a postdoc of myself and Ross Stocky at the University of Winnipeg. He's going to be talking to us today about the structure of invertible elements and certain Borgian steel sensors. I would like to thank the organizers. I would like to thank the organizers, Olkar Keith and my PhD co-supervisor Brian. I would also like to thank my PhD supervisor, Nico and Brian. This research, it was a terrible time when I was going through this particular research, but somehow I came through it. I would also like to thank my postdoc members, Ross and Matthew, and also Young Sun and Ferdinand. Okay, so today the talk. Okay, so today the talk is gonna be about how the invertible elements in segment Fourier status algebra is gonna look like. Before jumping into the sessions, on one day I was attending the class, this operator algebra's class and Banak Algebras class with Wow and Paul Saxon. Banakaljit was planned with Vowan Paulson, and Von Paulson was describing about his first experience of his PhD research where he was working on certain index groups, abstract index group of algebra. And he wanted that day itself, do not try to research on such topics. It's usually like difficult because it tends to involve a lot of cohomology theories and a lot of much more multi-variable complex analysis theory into the field to at least understand what is going. To at least understand what is going on, even for the simpler structures. But the abstract index group of a Banach algebra is defined as: if you collect all the invertible elements on unital commutative Banach algebra and give the norm topology, it has the exponential as the open subgroup. And we consider the quotient. This exact exponential of A is the connected component of the identity. If you have the elements, say, e to the If you have the element, say e to the power of b, the map that goes from p to e to the power of tb, it connects e to the power of b and 1. So every element can be connected to identity and it's exactly the connected component of the identity. And if we consider this discrete group, Cauchy got by the open subgroup, is what we call it as abstract index group of a Panach algebra and the notation is H1 of A, the notation is inspired from the cohomology theories. From the cohomology theories. Okay. Now, if you consider any Banach algebra homomorphism between two Banach algebra, this homomorphism is going to lift the invertible elements from one guys to exactly into the invertible elements of the other guy and it lifts the exponential guys into the exponential guys of the other. So, any homomorphism induces a map on the level of this abstract index group. In particular, if you look at the In particular, if you look at the map induced by the Gelfand transform, it happens to be the and H1 of say if you have a competitive Banach algebra with identity and the spectrum, the Gelfand spectrum delta of A, then H1 of delta of A is nothing but the H1 of the Banach algebra C of delta of A. And so the Gelfand transform now induces map on the level of this abstract industry between. On the level of this abstraction distro between these two Panak algebra, it is an isomorphism. So, Aaron Schrodinger theorem is a very deep theorem that has a lot of, I have never seen a full proof of the theorem for myself. It does involve a lot of composite sciences technique. But this theorem is going to be in the backdrop for most of the results that we will see around this one. So, as soon as after the class from one person, I rushed into Miko's office and asked him, do we know anything about Bimasha algebra? Do we know anything about the Masher algebra case at all? Like, do we know if there is any work done for the abstracting the scope of a Masher algebra? And he did say yes. And it was by the work of Joseph Taylor around 1965 to 1972, he introduced a series of paper to say, introducing this something called this commutative convolution measure algebra. Main examples of such algebra is the measure algebra on a semi-group or measure algebra on a group, group, group. Group, the group group, the Elven group algebra, or even the Rockman measure algebra will also be such competitive convolution measure algebras. And it has a compact semi-group associated with it, and it is the structural semi-group. And the semi-characters on this compact semi-group can be identified as the Gelfand spectrum of the corresponding measure algebras. Mesh algebras, and he did a lot of cohomological calculation on this particular semigroup to actually determine the invertible elements on measure algebra. And his work was so general that he was able to give two results. On one of the other results is the Cohen's item button theorem and this result is the characterization of the invertible editor. Characterization of the invertible elements. If you take an invertible element, there must be distinct maximal group algebras such that the invertible element can be expressed as the convolution product of the convolution product of new i's and each of this new i is coming from it's invertible in the unitized group algebra the maximum with respect to the inclusion the maximality and each of this new i is unique model with respect to Unique model with respect to the exponentials. And what exactly this says is that the abstract index group of the math frac M is nothing but the direct sum of the abstract index group of these group algebras. So group algebras are in a sense understandable as compared to in the realm of speaking of the spectrum. The spectrum of the even the measured algebra for a locally compact abelian group is so big that there are so many things happening around. And what he has done is like And what he has done is like if there is an invertible element, there is an accessible guy to which we can go and find the inverse and we can come. In particular, if you have a measure algebra of a locally compact abelian group, and all of this maximal group algebra is going to look like L1 of G with a topology, and this topology is going to be finer than that of the ambient group topology. Okay, so Once we know about this result, we did go through the entire, so there were about more than 10 papers that Joseph Eyler wrote in that particular period. After those papers, he did have the summer school where he was able to give this entire picture to the set of papers, and it was published as a book. And while reading through the calculations of the book, what happened? Of the book, what happens in data's analysis? First, so he identifies this set of all bonded semi-characters of the structure, semi-group of the spectrum of this mushroom algebra. Once he does it, he has there are like several topologies. There are strong topology and the weak topology on this. There are like advantages each of the topology. The operations become continuous with strong topology. The weak topology, the compactness is there. In some sense, he wanted to have both of these things to exist somewhere together. So, what he wanted. Exist somewhere together. So, what he wanted to do is he wanted to identify those sets where the strong topology and the weak topology agree. And he was able to find, and these were determined exactly something around this positive elements of this spectrum. And among the sets where this weak and strong topology agree, they seem to have some sort of minimal element. And this minimal element happens to be. Happens to be corresponds to an idempotent. So, for idempotent, he considers this maximal group that is formed around this item potent. Now, all he wanted to know is like if this group can be a locally compact group or not. And once he can find, and that particular characterization comes from the fact that if this guy happens to be a minimal element of some open and closed set, you get a local. Open and closed set, you get a locally compactness together. And those elements also have a characterization that they cannot be approximated from below within the spectrum, strictly lying within the positive part of the spectrum. And such points are called the critical points. And the corresponding maximal group around this critical points is a locally compact topological group. And these critical points are in correspondence with this map. Points are in correspondence with this maximal group algebra that was speaking. And the maximal group algebra is nothing but the L bone of the dual of this exact sector itself. Now that he has done, now rest is all the cohomology theory and showing that the abstract index group of this measure algebras exactly the direct sum over this critical points and the corresponding maximal group algebras form around these critical points. And this thing is what he called as the This thing is what he called as the spine of the measure algebra. Whenever you are in the measure algebra, go through a spine, find the inverse of the element, just with respect to modulo exponential, you are going to get an element within the spine that is going to represent the inverse. So after this, Nico Spronga and Monica Elli were able to generalize this concept of spine. This concept of spine to a non-commutative setup in the contemporary non-commutative commutative one arc algebra and the non-commutative setups. And as we know from Bokner's theorem is when G is a VPN, the Fourier Sergei's transform maps this M of G isometric onto B of G hat. This is a reason why we can think of the same characterization in terms of Fourier switches algebra situation. And now the And now, the topologies that were finer because of the duality, now we are going to consider the topologies that are coarser with respect to the ambient group topology. So, in 2007, Sprong and Illy developed this non-commutative dual analog of the spine of the abelian measure algebra. They conjecture that every invertible element in Fourier Series algebra is going to look like a multiplication of some Vi's with an exponential, and this Vi's. With an exponential, and these Vi's are going to be coming from some group whose topology is a coarser than that of the ambient group topology, and particularly they have this non-quotient locally pre-compact topology relations with it. So, as of so the examples that we're going to see later, the ones which the conjecture has witnessed or doesn't need to Doesn't need to go through this particular description, but nevertheless, there are like two ways we can. So, this is a topological description, then the other way is a spectral description that we saw from the elements of the Taylor analysis. So, there were certain intricacies on the spectrum of this measure algebra of a locally compact abelian group, which made Taylor to look at this entire problem in a very non-traditional way, to use the cohomology to determine. To use the cohomology to determine these things. And most of these problems were due to the fact that the one is usually called as this Wayner Pick phenomenon that within the spectrum of the mesh algebra, there is no way we can witness all the elements from just the group side and it's not symmetric. There also exists measures such that it's bounded away from zero, still not invertible on the measure algebra. On the Measure algebra and some sort of independent sets. All of these things proved me much difficult to just study the problem of this invertibility on the Masher algebra of a locally compact group. Nevertheless, for certain Fourier status algebra, none of this condition happens to be there. We have a lot of symmetric Fourier status algebra, we have for Fourier status algebra on the spectrum where the group is dense in the spectrum of the Fourier status. In the spectrum of the Fourier algebra and such. So, that was the important factor. We have been looking at how to. So, we have this elements of Payless analysis, and we have no way how to lift this cohomology calculation completely onto the spectrum of the Fourier algebra. So, we started looking at certain examples, like what is the simplest example that we can go through so that we can at least try to witness for a such smaller group. One of the initial examples that we were looking at was the special linear group. Yes, the special linear group SL2R or SLNR, whose Fourier status algebra is nothing but the radicalizer of the Fourier algebra plus the constant. So for such an algebra, what is happening is, so we have this particular situation where an algebra, so it's an in that we have a Banach sub-algebra sitting inside such that the spectrums are the same. So we can consider as an algebra and it's radicalizes. So the spectrums are the same. So if we have such The same. So, if we have such situations, and if one happens to be in the smaller algebra, so if you can unitize both algebra and C, then we can express the invertible elements on the radicalizer algebra or the bigger algebra as just exponential times the invertible elements on the smaller algebra. So, this was a very quick application of the Aaron-Strauter theorem and just chasing the commutative diagram and following filling up the details. Once we have this, we are able to at least describe the invertible. We are able to at least describe the invertible elements for certain semi-simple videos because they all have certain considerations. Certain such structure and a theorem of Canil Plot describes when the Rockman algebra, the Rockman algebra, the functions that vanish at infinity in the Fourier series algebra. And it's regular if and only if the spectrum of the Rockman algebra happens to be the group itself. To be the group itself, and in such situations. So, if in particular, if you consider the in this particular corollary, if you consider A to be the Fourier Sergei's algebra, the unitized Fourier serges algebra, and B to be the Rockman algebra for the regular Rockman algebra, it might happen. There are several groups, several rigid groups for which the Rockman algebra is exactly the Fourier Senses algebra itself, exactly the Fourier algebra itself. Exactly, the Fourier algebra itself, and also there are several rules where they're distinctly separate. And there is this particular conjecture by Figatalamanka and Picardello on this particular one when the radicalizer of the Fourier algebra is dense in the algebra. And in trying to answer that question, several groups have been interviewed. Several groups have been introduced in the literature, and all of those groups have provided particular examples to characterization of invertible elements gap times. So now moving on to a next step, the little more easier example, but still the almost periodic part is not compromised completely. It has Compromised completely. It has a part of almost periodic component. So if you consider the Euclidean motion group, the Fourier Sergei's algebra looks like B0 of G plus the Fourier algebra of the almost periodic compactification part. And here the B0 of G, so the structure is that it looks like an ideal L1 direct sum with an algebra. And the spectrum is looking like the union of locally compact groups. So, if we have an Banach algebra where it looks like an ideal plus a Banach subalgebra, then we can even describe this invertible elements in a very simple calculation. Just if you consider what because of the idealness, we will get the calculation and we will also know how the factorization of the invertible elements will be. And using that particular remark, we can describe the invertible elements for the Euclidean motion group. The invertible elements. Motion group. The invertible elements in the Fourier status algebra of the Euclidean motion group is going to look like one part coming from the neurotized Fourier algebra and the other part going to coming from the almost periodic component part. So the spectrum of V is looking just like the bunches of group. So whenever such situation occurs, the Fourier Silence algebra is going to be much symmetric. Algebra is going to be much symmetric because of just the complex conjugation, it's going to work out very well. And it always has two particular I dependents in the spectrum. The one is the identity element of the group itself, that is the identity of G, and the identity element of the almost periodic component. And the identity of the almost periodic component is going to be the smallest element in the spectrum of V of T. Element in the structure of B of G in terms if you are looking at the positive elements, and the idea of G is going to be the biggest element. So, these two elements are always going to be there. And so, we started looking at which groups have the regular Rockman algebra, then we tried to see if they have a particular structure theory for their Fourier series algebra. On the abelian case, most of the results were possible only because type. Only because Taylor was using the structure theory of the abelian groups much, but none of the structure theory is going to help exactly for our purpose. So it took a while for us to understand that without the structure theory of the Fourier stage algebra, we cannot do much with this problem. So we were able to find many groups. So from the paper of symmetry in Fourier Series Algebra where Lehman. In Fourier Series algebra, where Leikoden and Mislow show that the representations of the group were a compact analytic group acting on an L potent analytic group, such that the action has no non-trivial fixed points. So such groups, their Fourier status algebra is going to be symmetric and their Fourier status algebra is going to be union of a bunch of groups. And there is this another description by Meyer. By Meyer. So there are these groups called totally minimal groups. A group is called minimal if there is no other topology closer than that the ambient group topology with respect to which it is housed of. And it's called totally minimal if every factor is minimal group. So among the connected totally minimal group, so they have this particular characterization that they are all going to look like. Like a reductive group acting on an L potential analytic. Okay, reductive group is much somewhat very closer to a semi-simple Lie group. And the reductive group and for some quotient of a compact group, it's going to look something like this. So we add in a linear factor so that when we add in a linear factor, it's going to exactly look like the semi-direct product. And the representation theory of such groups are so nicely. So, nice for all the representations to some certain tensor product, they are all going to be quasi-equivalent to the left regular representation. That's what makes them into okay. So, we will see the structure theory of such groups in the next slide. So, these groups among these totally connected linear among these. Linear among the connected linear totally minimal groups when H acts on N with non-trivial fixed point, when we have then vector group or an amelioral group on as the nil potentially or if the reductive component is a compact group. So we are able to describe the invertible elements for that. And we have said connected semi-simple E group with finite center. So it's it's much it's it's it's It's they are reductive groups. It's it's already covered in the second one, and we have this p-adic motions which is not a connected group. And then there are also, so one of the examples for the second one is like the Lorentz group, the SLNR acting on the Rn and sort of groups. Okay, so all of these groups have this particular structure theory that the B of G is going to be looking like an L word direct sum of this. Direct sum of this radicalizer of Fourier algebras on certain locally compact topological groups. And all of these groups can be described by an idempotent in the spectrum of the Fourier Sergius algebra. And the spectrum of the Fourier Series algebra is going to be looking at this bunch of this group. And the second condition says how this algebra structure is within this, they are going to direct some of the Paranc algebras. Algebras. And the proof is we reduce it to the finite case using the density argument and apply the finite case so many times or use the induction so that we will get the proof. The proof is simple. The main point of the entire research was to show that there are more examples that are possible to which we can extend the characterization of the invertible elements. So, all of the index group of this set of Fourier segments algebra can be This set of Fourier series algebra can be represented through these, the unitized Fourier algebra of each of these bunches. So if you have u in particular element in v of g, then u can be written as v1, v2 until v n. So that this vi's are coming from the unitized g z i's. And for example, if you look at the group, the circle acting on C2 and each of the z corresponds to this one-dimensional lines. Dimensional lines on each of this determines the item potent in the spectrum. There are uncountably many item potents in the spectrum, but nevertheless, the chains are always going to be finite chains. It's going to be identity, one of the guy, it's going to be almost periodic guy, then one of the lines and the identity. That's how the all set of chains that are going to be in the spectrum are going to look like. So, piggybacking on Taylor's analysis, we can also describe the invertible elements of the Fourier series algebra of Ax plus B group because the B of Ax plus B is going to look like the B of real line plus the almost the Fourier algebra of the group itself and we know how the invertible elements of B R B of R look like using the Taylor's analysis. like using the T-analysis and P of G it was can be so one of the guy must be coming from the unitized group Fourier algebra and one guy from coming from the almost periodic part of the Fourier algebra and the Fourier algebra of real lights itself. So there will be three so one two there will be three item potents in the spectrum that corresponds these item potential correspond to the critical These item patterns will correspond to the critical points of the the so as as happened in the uh Taylor's element it's possible to so again in this what happens is like there are several possible topology that is possible to give on the spectrum of the Fourier series algebra and we can also think the topology because of the action of how the spectrum acting on the Fourier series algebra can be made and it is a part of the Multimoltus It is a part of Martin Walter's work that he also identified certain sets where this left strong topology or the right strong topology or the weak topology they all agree on a set and when they are agree they are looking at particularly the idempotent elements and then we get the topological group and we look at those elements which are not approximated from below and these are called the critical points and this is exactly a topological locally compact topological group and all the examples the critical And all the examples, the critical points, all the elements in the positive elements in the spectrum happens to be critical points in all of the other examples. And also, for all the other examples, the everlasting compactification of the group happens to be the spectrum of Fourier Suzuki's algebra. So, the critical points are all lying in the aberrant compactification of the group. So, if we the future work is that at least for a connected locally compact group, if we can show that the critical points belonging to the aberrant compactification of the group. To the abelian capactivation of the group. There's a recent result that Nico used for his operator amenability study where he does this Galvo connection between the set of topologies and set of itemponents in the aberrant compactification, where there is a correspondence between the locally compact topologies that are possible and the item potents in the aberrant compactification. At least we can extend the part of the theory to connect, to cover more examples. And ultimately, it comes to the point: given a central It comes to the point: given a central critical point, does the corresponding algebra have any element of this Fourier algebra? Even if you can do this, this must be having a lot of theory related to Tomito Takasake theory is what Martin Wolter believed at the end of his paper. So, thank you. Are there any questions from the audience for money? How about from Zoom Lab? I guess I've got one quick question. So you get this nice characterization of invertible elements. Do you have any suspicions for any more general classes that might hold for? Or do you think that this is a For or do you think that this is as far as it can be pushed? So, there are some groups that I have been looking at in Sora and Nirpi's paper. So, Sora and Nirpi has been working on this groups for which P0 of G is exactly the Fourier algebra. And there are certain groups that we believe that if we can figure out the entire representation theory, then we would be able to get the structure theory of the Fourier algebra. Theory of the Fourier algebra. So it should be easy, but I do believe that they will also lie, come and lie on the sort of characterization. We would like to see at least one example where it just fails and we don't want to look at the problem anymore. Or maybe even if it's going to extend to even further problems, it might give a new insight into looking where the cohomology theory can come into picture. So, from a cohomological point of view, there are still some of the calculations that That are much more general than the groups that are concerned. So the cohort calculations can give the characterization for much more groups, but we have to just find the groups. Yeah, yeah. All right, thank you very much. Let's thank money once more. Next talk will be in one or two minutes. Nico's work. You can see the queue me up anybody. Thanks for doing this.
