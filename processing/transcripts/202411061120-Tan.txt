So, as we know, the cancer is a global challenge, and especially in the clinics, 90% of the cancer patients die not because of primary tumor, but simply because of the cancer spreading from the primary lesion to the dissonant organs. And of course, there's a lot of studies going on that is identifying virus or chemical cues that play huge roles in the tumor metrostasis. But here, Tumor metastasis. But here, we're more interested in because tumor cells, when they are migrating from the primary lesion to the secondary organs, they actually experience different types of mechanical cues. So we are particularly interested in what kind of roles those mechanical cues are playing. Yeah. So here, in the last year, we actually summarized the mechanical alterations in the tumor mechanic environment compared to the normal tissues. Actually, there's a lot of things changing. For example, Changing. For example, the matrix stiffness. Actually, a lot of speakers mentioned that, and also the solid stress and interstitial fluid pressure, and so on, and so forth. And of course, I would mention that this is, in addition to those changes in the tumor mechanical environment, actually the mechanical property of the tumor cells actually dramatic changes along with the progression. So, this will cover this in the next minutes. And also, of course, the cells can not. Of course, the cells can, not the tumor cells or the living cells, actually can perceive the mechanical cues. And more complex is that those mechanical transduction signaling actually can cross-talk with the traditional, what we know as ancogenic signaling. So twinkle together actually further complicating this issue. So the overarching hypothesis of my study that is we assume that cells can perceive those mechanical cues, which can further Those mechanical cues, which can further change epigenetic features of the tumor cells and then impact the tumor cell malignancy. And so we mainly cover three aspects. The first one that is the primary tumor mechanics. So we, previous study actually showing that we are moderating those mechanical properties of the microenvironment. We show that these mechanical properties can actually influence different aspects of the tumor malignancy, for example, tumoring genetic potential, metastasis, and of course, tumor. And of course, today I will just basically share one of the stories that is a recent story that is they actually determine that when the cells spreading from the primary tumor to this organ, then determine which organ they will migrate. And another one that is when the tumor cells disseminate from the primary lesion, they're mainly through the blood circulation to the different organs. Actually, compared to the mechanical transaction, we are very familiar to, which is for the adherence cells. But in this case, The adherent cells. But in this case, those tumor cells are a non-adherent state. They actually perceive the shell stress in a very different way. And also, very interestingly, that these CTCs, the secondary tumor cells, actually can adopt adaptive ability to survive in this process. And the third one, that is, in addition to those mechanical changes in the microenvironment, that the tumor cell mechanics also significant changes. For example, the tumor cell stiffness decreasing. Tumor cell stiffness decreasing along with the progression. And people thought that these mechanical changes in the tumor cells are trivial. But actually, what we found that is very important for different functions like for the tumoring tumor growth and tumor metrostasis. And even recently, we found that for the drug resistance. So, we will give more information later on. So, first of all, the first story I would like to share today is when the tumor cells metastasis, they actually Metastasis. They actually not randomly metastasis to random organs. They actually have the target. Okay, so this is what people call the organotropism. So they migrate. So you can look at the left-hand side, the different type of cancer actually migrate to specific organs instead of randomly metastasis. So here we choose the breast cancer because the spread to all these four common organs, which is bone, liver, lung, and brain. So here today, give the time. Give the time, so we'll specifically explain how this mechanical microenvironment can impact these courses of different specific organs. So, of course, we know that a lot of people focus on that the stiffening of the primary tumor tissue that actually can impact different stages of tumor metastasis. And of course, indirectly or directly, people assume that when the tumor tissue gets stiffened, that just Tissue gets stiffened, that gets stiffened as a whole or homogeneously. But actually, the heterogeneity is a hallmark of cancer. Basically, tumor cells are very different from each other. So, we believe that this tumor microenvironment should be mechanically heterogeneous. So, we're asking the question that how this primary tumor mechanical heterogeneity is related to the organotrobism, that is, which organ they will choose to migrate. So, here, first of all, this study. So, here, first of all, this study basically conducted by my PhD students, Kai. So, we collaborate with Professor Yongpin Jian. So, basically, we utilize the ultrason elastography to measure the tumor tissue stiffness variations in live animals. So, basically, as you can see, the stiffness vary a lot from 0.2 kilopascals to about 50 kilopascals, which actually very closely recapitulate what people measure earlier that is in the What people measured earlier that is in the humor breast cancer biopsy that is from 0.1 to 20 kilopascal. So, to mimic this mechanical variation, so we synthesize different protein gels, utilize 0.6 kilopascal to mimic the soft niches, and then 35 kilopascal to mimic the stiff niches within the same tumor tissue. And then we control the cells on top and then analyze the gene expressions. So, very interestingly, those soft cells, soft tissue. Those soft cells, soft tissue culture cells, they actually express those brain gene signatures. So, what are we? And we're asking that because those are breast cancer cells. So, why they express those neuron and those nerve cells signature? And then we further look at the brain metastasis gene signature. So, you can see they actually have significant up-regulated. And then, of course, this is prompted us to investigate whether these tumor cells actually can specifically migrate. Cells actually can specifically migrate to the brain instead of other organs. So, here I adopt a very traditional mass model, which is an intrachardic injection, basically injected tumor cells into the heart. So, theoretically, they have the equal opportunities to migrate into different types of organs. So, if you look at this table, so you can see this is soft primary cells actually to gain significant and upgrade the ability to migrate into the brain instead of others. Instead of others. And of course, if you look at the signals which generate in the brain tissue, so you can see that the brain matosis is actually to grow bigger and bigger. And of course, when we inject the tumor cells into the heart, so we see that the rhyme metrosis actually increased. So it could be because of more tumor cells can penetrate the BBB, the blood-brain barrier, or when the tumor cells arrive at the tumor. Tumor cells arrive at the brain site, they have the high ability to colonize this brain tissue. So, to answer this question, so basically, we use this really use the confocal macros we do to imagine the tumor cells in the brain blood vesicle. So, as we can see, actually more these soft primary cells, they are either activasating, that is penetrating the blood vessel, or they already finished, complete the activasation process. The activization process and less portion of cells are still entrapped in the blood vessel within the brain tissue. So basically, they have higher ability to penetrate the brain blood vessel barrier. And another one that is if we directly inject the tumor cells into our brain tissue, and then to see whether they can grow bigger and bigger. So the answer is yes. So you can see if you look, if you directly inject the tumor cells in the brain tissue and Tumor cells in the brain tissue, and these soft primary cells can grow larger tumors compared to the different groups, other groups. And of course, we ask what is the mechanism behind. So we look at the RN sequencing results, and we found that the histone de-astylase, so histone de-astylation actually significantly enriched in the soft primary cells. And then we look at the, we measure the histone, the HDAC activity as a whole, and then indeed. As a whole, and then indeed the soft primary cells have a higher HDSA activity. And of course, whether this up-regulate HGSC activity plays a role in this process or not, so we utilize the PAN inhibitor, HGSC inhibitor, to inhibit the HGSC activity when we culture the cells on the soft matrix. So you can see when you inhibit this HGSA activity, the brain metastasis gene is significantly down-regulated, including the BBB migration and also. The BBB migration and also the brain colonization ability. And of course, we have different types of HDSC in the database. So we knocked down one by one. And I found that it turns out HGSC3 play a major role. So we specifically focus on the HJC3 phosphorylation because the phosphorylation of HDS3 is very important for HDS3 endometriic activity. And of course, the total level of HJC3 actually in Of HJC3, actually, in the soft priming case, they're significantly upregulated. And indeed, if you look at the measured HJS3 activity, it also increased as well. So in order to really explore whether this is because of the enzymatic activity, LGSC3 plays a role or not. So we actually engineer the negative mutant, point mutant, in LGSC3, specifically at the serine 424, because the phosphorylation of this. Because the phosphoration of this residue is very critical for the HDS3 activity. So, as you can see, we evaluate this negative mutant, as does decrease the activity. And then, if we culture the cells with this transfected negative mutant with the breast cancer cells and then culture on the soft matrix, indeed, the BBB migration and also the brain colonization ability decrease, indicating that this is the HACS3 enzyme. Indicating that this is HACS3 enzymatic activity is crucial for the soft matrix to induce this brain metastasis activity. And of course, we can also use the specific inhibitors. So here is HGSC3 inhibitor, RGFP966, and also you get the similar results. And this is for the individual. So we also try to explore whether this can be utilized as a new way to target the Brahmatosis. So what we did. Brain metastasis. So, what we did that is we injected the brain metastasis, the soft prime tumor cells into the heart, and then treat the mice with this specific HVAC3 inhibitor. So, you can see this significantly reduced the burden of the rare metastasis. So, this is what we did is always in vitro. That is using a virtual mechanical microenvironment to make what we see in vivo. But whether this process can Evil, but whether this process can really happen in a xenograft. So, what we did that is that the student we found basically to identify a gene which is very sensitive to the matrix softness. So, you can see we identified several. So, at the end, we choose NDRG1. You can see NDRG1 is highly upper regulated when the culture on the soft matrix. And then we utilize NDRG1 to drive the M cherry expression. So, and then transfect this reporter. Transfect this reporter plasmid into the cancer cells and then transplanted into the mice. And then within the xenograph, we do see the M cherry expression is inversely correlated with the collagen, which indicating the tissue stiffness. And then we also do an abundance of experiment to show that, especially in the high m cherry level regions, they actually have a low stiffness whereas the low The low M cherry level. So basically, it's a high stiffness. So, showing that using the M cherry level can indicate that where the cells come from, whether it's from stiff matrix or from a soft matrix. So, basically, what we are trying to see that is M cherry negative cells are from relative stiff niches versus M cherry positive cells from soft niches. So, we also these cells out, and it turns out this M cherry positive cells has a high HJC reactivity. Has a high HGS reactivity, and also the in vitro has a high ability to colonize the brain tissue and across the BBB. And of course, so the golden standard that is to test the in vivo. So we injected this M cherry positive and negative cells into the heart again. And we do see that M cherry positive cells, which from the soft niches in the xenograph, they generate a larger and more brimatastasis than the M cherry negative cells. And then you can see they are. And then you can see the other quantification as well. So, make this story short: that is, in the breast cancer as an example, that is, because in the breast tumor, primary tumor, there's the mechanical microenvironment, we have heterogeneous. We have soft niches, we have stiff niches. So, basically, here, what we see that is in the soft niches, they actually have a, through the mechanical transaction, a nuclear mechanical transaction, and then can up-regulate the HKS reactivity, which essentially to promote the gene expression. To promote the gene expression, the effection of the brain metastasis of the genes, and eventually can facilitate the tumor cells specifically migrate to the brain tissue instead of others. And the other one that is the give example that illustrates how the mechanical properties of changes of the tumor cells can influence the tumor cell malignancy. So, we know that a grand challenge in the cancer field is the drug resistance. So, you can see if you utilize the chemotherapy, and we can. The chemotherapy, and we can initially see a dramatic decrease reduction of the tumor volume, and it seems like it works. But later on, of course, depends on different situations, the latency varies, but in many cases, the tumor will regrow, which we call the cancer relapse. And of course, this cancer relapse can deteriorate the prognosis of the patients. And of course, there's a number of ongoing results, studies ongoing that is. Studies ongoing that is to show different biochemical mechanisms behind this cancer drug resistance. And of course, as I showed, as I illustrated earlier, that is, apart from the mechanical changes of given microenvironment, actually tumor cell mechanical properties also change. For example, here, the more metastatic cells show that they generate higher contractile forces. And of course, there's other studies show it all. Other studies show the opposite. So, I should be emphasized this. So, as a whole, we don't know actually what is the actual relationship or what is the role of this tumor cell mechanics in this specific cancer cell, the drug resistance. So, to my students' point of view, it's very interesting in this aspect. So, starting from analyzing those database on the left-hand side, that is MSF7. On the left-hand side, that is MCF7 drug-resistant cell lines where the control cells. And on the right-hand side, that is in the cancer patients. Either it's non-responder, basically, it's meaning that it's drug-resistant cohol, and then where's the responder, which is sensitive cohol. So you can see the in both co in both cases, so you can see the dramatic enrichment of the acting celloskeleton, which is crucial for the generation of the contractile force in the living cells. In the living cells. And so, to establish whether there's really a correlation between the contractile force a tumor cell can generate and the drug resistance, so we again utilize the breast cancer cell as an example. So we can, we he basically showed that when the tumor cells generate a higher contractive force, they actually have a high IC50. So IC50, higher IC50, basically meaning that the tumor cells are more tolerant or more Tolerant or more resistance to this drug. And of course, to really establish the drug resistance with the contractor force, so we utilize the Dr. Lubincin, which is a traditional chemotherapy drug, to isolate, to treat the different types of cancer cells to get the drug-resistant cell lines. And you can see when the drug-resistant cell lines basically generate a much higher contractor force. Generate a much higher contractor force compared to the sensitive parental control. And of course, which is further supported by the higher level of F-actin and the myosin, the phosphoration of myosin life chin kind of. So this basically gives us an idea that at least in the breast cancer cell, so it is possible that the generation or the level of contractile force the cells can generate is probably correlated with the drug resistant ability. So, but whether this is a So, but whether this is a simple correlation or there's a real internal link between these two, so we have to interrupt or modulate the contractile force. So, we know that the act of mouse and contractivity is crucial for the generation of a contractor force. So, here we start to knock down the mouse and large and kinase, which is very important for the mouse and contraction, and also the MDL1, which is crucial for the actin polymerization. So, as you can see, Polymerization. So, as you can see, when you knock down these two, so you can see, of course, we also measure the contractile force is a dramatic decrease. And you can see the cell under different concentration of the doxalubinsin. And you can see the curve shift towards the left-hand side. So, basically, meaning that the IC50 decrease and the drug resistance level decrease as well. And of course, you can also use the drugs, Carsin D or Plepstatin, to decrease the contractor force. And then, also, you can also. Contractor force. And then also, you can also see a dramatic reduction of the IC50. And of course, to see really this is because of the force plays a role here. So when we knock down this and then we utilize the effect in polymerization activator or use the rock activator to try to reverse this process, as you can see, it really can fully restore the drug resistant level. Here is IC50. And of course, you can do the reverse. So if you overexpress. So if you overexpress the utilize, transfect the constituent active mouse enlighten kinase or rock plasmids, so you basically can elevate the contractor force and then again increase SA50 by almost 100%. And then of course, this is not only in the 2D, if you do the tumor spheroid, and you do the similar things, and you see this observed similar findings in the 3D case. And of course, you can use the drugs to. Course, you can use the drugs to elevate the contractor force. You also see a huge increase in terms of IC50. And when you increase the contractor force, increase IC50, and use that statian and cytoclassin D to do the rescue experiments, and you see the full restoration of the IC50 to the control level. So, basically, what we see is that we do see the, it seems like there's an internal link between the contractility. Between the contractility the tumor cells can generate and the level of drug resistance. And I forgot to mention that in those experiments, the cell confluency, what we use is 70%, which ensure that cell can communicate with each other and but avoid over confluency. So what do we see that is what is when we change the conferency from 70%, we call the medium cell density to the low level, it's about 20%. Low level is about 20%. So, basically, simply because they're single, still single cells, the loose cell cell contact. So, in this case, very interesting. That is in the low case. That means if you even you increase the contractor force in the single cells, but they stay as a single cells, no cell-cell communication. So, you wouldn't see any change in terms of the IC50. So, only when you increase the cell density to ensure that the cell can communicate physically contact with each other. Communicate physically contact with each other, so you will see that the SA50 change when you are increasing the contractile force. So, to be able to show that whether really because of the cell-cell contact and then the force transmission between the cells, so we decided to knock down the alpha-catanin here to disrupt the force transmission between cells. As you can see here, so if you disrupt the cells, even you upregulate the contractor force that can fully restore. Contractor force that can fully restore the SA50 to the control cell lab. And under this case, if you knock down the alpha-catinine, there's no dramatic influence on the level of the contractor force generation. So this really shows that this contractile force influence drug resistance is through, probably through the force transmission from one tumor cell to the neighboring tumor cells. Now, of course, what is the underlying mechanism? So we actually show. Underlying mechanism. So, we actually show that the cell, the contractility level of the tumor cells cannot regulate the drug resistance. So, we again go back to analyze the RN sequencing, and it turns out that many, many of those kind of genes related to notch signaling actually highly upregulate. So, we focus on the influence of the contractivity on the notch. Contractivity on the notch activation. So you can see if you're elevating the contractor force, so you can see the NACD, the notch intracellular domain actually highly up-regulated, or you do the reverse and you reduce this, as well as the downstream signaling of the notch. So basically showing that the intracellular force can really activate this notch signaling. And again, to show that it's really because of the force transmission between one cell. Because of the force transmission between one cell to another. So we utilized a notch reporter. So the GD tomato. So basically showing a higher red fluorescence, meaning that a higher level of notch. So to show whether it's because of a force transmission, so we decided to transfect the cells, use this plasmid to increase the generation of the contractor force in one cell. And then transfect this. And then transfect this reporter, we represented the TDT in another cell, and then mix this two population of cells together. So, as you can see, this CA plasmid basically showing the venous, the fluorescence, and this TDT is basically is just controlled cancer cells. As you can see, we only mix with this high contractile force. So, these TDT or this notch can be activated. And indeed, And indeed, because this plasmid can only be active under the induction of doxycycline. So, even you transfect with plasmid without induction, so nothing happens. So, basically, notch cannot be activated. So, here, basically, showing that it's really because of the force transmission between cells, activate the notch signaling. And we can also do the reverse if you mix the DDD transfected cells with the low contractile cells, so the notch. Contractile cells. So the notch signaling in the control cells cannot be activated as well. And to further illustrate, is because of force plays a role. So we synthesize different gels with different stiffness from 0.15 and 50 kilopascal, and then code it with the notch ligand, which is JAC1, which can interact with the receptor, which is notch one on the cell membrane. So we culture the cells on different substrates, and clearly we show that the cells can generate. And clearly, we show that the cells can generate a higher forces, contractile force, on the higher stiffness. And here you can see the notch signaling actually activated more on the stiffer substrate, showing that this is really because of the force transmission played a role. And to illustrate whether it's really not signaling played a role in this process or not, so we not use the inhibitors to inhibit the force-induced activation of the notch. Activation of the notch. So you can see they can fully restore. So you can see inhibiting cluster-induced endocytosis, or use a gamma-screttase, or use MMP inhibitors, which can really bring down, restore the IC50 to the control cell level. So because we're running out of time, we'll just quickly wrap up this story. So, what is the mechanism that why not signaling can really promote drug resistance? It's actually not because of the upregular, the MDM. upregulate the MDR membrane proteins on the cell membrane, pump out the drugs out of the cell. Actually, it's because of, they actually promote the drugs export from the nucleus to the outside. So because of the drugs, most of the chemotherapy drugs we're targeting the nucleus to induce the DNA damage. But in this case, they actually can pump out the drugs out of the nucleus or reduce the doxylobincin. The doxylubinsin in the nucleus. Okay, so if you knock down the notch and then the nucleus, the amount of the drugs in the nucleus actually restored. And similar things you can find out when you lower down the conductivity. And so the downstream, what kind of proteins is responsible for the not induced nuclear drug exports, which we found that is a major vault protein we ensured as MVP. We ensure this MVP. So the last slide that is showing whether this really works in animals. So you can see this is when we modulate the contractility and then inject it into the mice. So before we added the chemotherapy treatment, so there was no difference between different groups in terms of the tumor size, but only after you add the chemotherapy drugs. So as you can see, the black line. The black line, so basically, indicate this the typical drug resistance. So you add the drug and then reduce the tumor volume reduce, and then you stop the drug, the treatment. So you pump up again, you add the drug, and then you see the cycles. But if you elevate in the contractile force, so you can see you wouldn't see any reduction of the tumor size. So showing that the drug resistant level is really high. Drug resistance level is really high, or if you reduce the contractility, so basically you see a very low level of drug resistance. And these processes also depend on the notch signaling. So again, we show that this signaling like actomyousin and also the notch actually are correlated with the cancer recurrence in the patients. So we said that's a briefly summary that when the tumor cells in the microenvironment, the tumor cells, the neighboring tumor cells, which The tumor cells, the neighboring tumor cells, which generate a high contractor force, so they can transmit that force to the neighboring cells and activate the notch signaling. So, notch NICD can move into the nucleus, transport the MVP, and MVP can export the drugs from the nucleus outside, and which can further potentiate the drug resistance. So, with this, I will thank the students and Kai and the Peng Yu and also the collaborator and funding support. Thank you.
