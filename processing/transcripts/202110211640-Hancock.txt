Screen okay? Great. Looks good. So great to see everybody. I'm really sad I can't be there on your hike and doing everything else up there, but you know, look forward to Gordon conferences this summer, I guess. So I am going to talk about the role of fluid-lipid bilayer in transports. Bilayer and transport. So in my lab, we study kinesins and dyneine now and a lot of the more detailed mechanochemistry, but we're also very interested in bridging up to the cellular scale where transport is bi-directional and multimotor, and it adds a lot of complexities. So the work that I'm going to talk about is almost all done by fantastic newly A fantastic newly minted PhD, Ray Jang, who is finishing her stuff up in the lab and getting ready to do a postdoc. And she worked quite diligently on all of this, as you'll see. So in cells, we often look to neurons because they're so highly polarized, but it's a problem in every cell of transport. And in neurons, the transport is long distance, and the Transport is long distance and the transport is bi-directional. And if you look closely, you see little motors moving along the microtubules. And many, most of the transported cargo are membrane-bound, vesicles and organelles. And so that means the motors are stuck to the membrane. And we actually don't know as much as we would like about all the Don't know as much as we would like about all the adapter proteins that do that, but it's still, no matter how many links to get to the membrane, they're membrane-bound, and so they're diffusing generally in the plane of the membrane. So that could have a lot of implications to motility. And the transport is carried out by dinings and kinesins, and there's many different kinesins, and there's different dining regulators, and there's many different And there's many different types of cargo, too. So there's a lot of diversity. But there's some fundamental mechanisms underlying the basic way to think about it, we're hoping, and that there are then flavors that different motors and different cargo are taking up. So if you look closely, what you see is that the cargo are actually being transported by teams of motors. So there's a rich history of So, there's a rich history of single-molecule kinesin biophysics and mechanical measurements and optical traps and things like that. So, we know a lot about the motors themselves, but then how they join together, work together, work antagonistically with dynein. There's much more open, many more open questions there. And it turns out that when you isolate vesicles from neurons and then you look Neurons, and then you look with antibodies to see what motors are on them, then that many of them, most of them, have both kinesin and dyneine, and they also even have multiple kinds of kinesin. So like a kinesin 1 and a kinesin 2 or a kinesin 1 and a kinesin 3. And so that presumably is important because it's seen all over the place, but exactly how those motors are all working together. How those motors are all working together is not really clear. We do know that motor binding kinetics determine cargo distance. So we can think about a cargo with multiple motors and there's an initial attachment rate and we can characterize the off rate, so the detachment rate from single molecule measurements, and it's about one per second for kinesin. But if there's multiple modes, But if there's multiple motors, then it's very difficult to determine how fast those other motors attach to the microtubules, and so that you get a dynamic with multiple motors such that if one comes off, the other is still there, and you can get long distance transport. And what you see is compared to a single motor that has a run length of a micron-ish, cargo go much, much farther, suggesting that the motors are indeed coordinating to get this long distance. Coordinating to get this long-distance cargo. We know, as I said, we know the off rate. The on rate has been estimated at about five per second, and that's with a couple different types of experiments, including a DNA origami study that we did. This number, you know, it's a little embarrassing to say how passionate you are about a rate constant, but this attachment rate constant is incredibly important. Is incredibly important and I think is really one of the keys, along with the load-dependent detachment rates when motors are fighting each other. But this reattachment rate is really going to determine the role of all of the different motors on the vesicle besides the one that's carrying it. And so knowing its rate is really important. And so let me just explain. A couple people have talked about this DNA orgami experiment that we did. And let me just explain it. This is how we It. This is how we got this five per second on rate. So we made a little construct here where we have, it's a poor man's DNA origami because what we have is just single-stranded pieces attached to the motors and then a long single strand piece or a long double strand piece with overhangs that then attaches them together. And so we have kinesin motors out to 560 length. There's a GFP on them. We have a GFP. Them. We have a GFP binding protein, which is a nanobody that binds the GFP, and we covalently attach an oligo, a 20-base oligo, onto that. We do the same on this other motor, and then we have a DNA complementary to those, and we can tie them together. And so then we can ask, okay, what's the run length of one motor, and then what's the run length of two motors? And if the reattachment rate is really fast, you expect that. Attachment rate is really fast, you expect that motor run length to be very high. And if it's slow, if it's you know to the limit of infinitely slow, then it would just be the single motor run length would be the same as the two motor run length. Okay, so the distance between these two motor domains is two motors is roughly 100 nanometers, this whole tether. And it's very flexible. There's a lot of brakes in it. It's nicely modeled by a freely jointed chain. Jointed chain. And so if you calculate, then, if one motor is attached and the other motor has 100 nanometers excursion either way, there's a sphere, a hemisphere, if the microtubule is on the surface, a volume that that second motor is in. And there are microtubules there. And based on the microtubule geometry, you can count how many tubulin you would get in this 100 nanometers with, let's say, the top half, top six. Let's say the top half, top six protofilaments or so. And if you do that math, then you get that the effective tubulin concentration for the second motor is 125 micromolar in that volume. We can measure biochemically using stop flow the solution on rate. So this is the standard bimolecular on rate, and it's one per micromolar per second, which is a very standard on rate for a protein-protein. On rate for a protein-protein interaction. So, since we know now the bimolecular on rate of the motor binding to the microtubule and solution, and then we know the tubulin concentration, then we can predict then this second motor here should bind to the microtubule at a rate of 125 per second. So, it should go on rapidly. As I said, the off rate's one per second. And so, you can imagine once one motor detects. And so you can imagine once one motor detaches after a second, it rebinds at 100 per second, and then they keep on going. That thing is going to have both motors attached almost all the time, and it's going to go basically forever. So is that what we see when we do the experiment? So we do a single molecule or single construct experiment. We look at the run length of these guys. And the dotted line is a single motor run length, and the solid line is the run length of this two-motor complex. Length of this two-motor complex. And it's not a very impressive increase. It's about a two-fold increase. And so, from that information and some other measurements where we're measuring binding duration and ADP, we can back out what the reattachment rate would be to get this kind of run length, and that reattachment rate is about 5 per second. So that's where that number comes from. And I will say, this number of 5 per second, the first measurement of it was in the The first measurement of it was in the early 2000s, and the Mueller-Klump-Lepowski modeling of multimotor transport used this as dogma. And I was sure it was wrong because everybody was using it. And so I was sure this experiment would give us something different, give us a much more precise number. And it totally blew me away that it was like exactly the number. It's like four points. It's like 4.6. Okay, it's not 5. Okay, so that's where we get that number. So, if that's the case with just a construct like this, now what about membranes? Because there's a different thing going on. The vesicle can be much larger. The membranes are diffusing in the 2D lipid bilayer. We have to think about the diffusion rate of the motors to the microtubule and possibly slipping in the plane of the mouth. Possibly slipping in the plane of the membrane. So there's a lot of differences that may be playing a big role. And so the way that we set out to study this first is using an infinitely large vesicle, if you will, in the form of a 2D supported lipid bilayer. Okay, and so what we want to know is the motor attachment rate, just analogous to that DNA origami experiment, the motor attachment rate. The motor attachment rate when these motors are diffusing in the plane of the lipid bilayer. For instance, if the diffusion is really slow, then it'll be diffusion limited and the binding will be really slow. And so there's sort of two parts of that. Okay, for the technical experimentalists, the way that we did this is we made these giant unilamellar vessels. Giant unilamellar vesicles, GUVs. We let them land on a clean cover slip and make a bilayer. Confirmed that there weren't any holes in it. We used biotinylated lipids spiked in 1% or less than 1%. We bound nutravidin to that. And then we made biotinnylated motors that had a GFP and then a C-terminal biotin. And we attached them to the nutravidin that way. And so we. And so we have then a bed of motors, and they're diffusing in the bilayer. And then we let a microtubule land on that, and the motors will accumulate on that microtubule, and the accumulation rate will be governed by the rate that they diffuse over through the membrane and bind to the microtubule. So we can get information about that. And so if you just do localization, here's the here's on glass, here's all of our green kind. Glass, here's all of our green kinesins, but here they're stuck to the glass surface. And so if you merge, you see no accumulation because they can't move. Here's the lipid bilayers, here's the microtubules, here's our green motors in the lipid bilayer. You can see that they're accumulating on the microtubules because they can localize there. They can concentrate there. Okay, and what we found is that the motors accumulated more quickly at higher motor densities. Motor densities. Okay, so maybe you can see that here. I'll give you a little bit more quantification. But here are two motor densities. And here's just the stop time animation showing that you're getting faster accumulation rate at the higher motor density. And so we can think about this like we think about normal ligand receptor binding kinetics, where we have an on rate and an off rate. And what we're measuring. And we can, what we're measuring is the accumulation. So we're starting at a steady state of no motors bound. We're letting it get to the microtubule lands. It establishes a new steady state of the motors binding and unbinding. And so you get a plateau there. And we measure the accumulation rate. We call this accumulation of the motors there. If we go to higher kinesins, then the accumulation rate is faster. Okay, so if we Sorry. So, if we ask, what do we predict to be the accumulation rate? And so, this is just the same math as ligands accumulating on receptors on a cell. And what we know from our biochemistry is that the accumulation rate or the rate, the exponential rise to a steady state is governed by both the on rate and the off rate. So, it's the on rate multiplied by the free concentrations. That's the flux on. Concentrations. That's the flux on plus the off plus the off rate. And so that predicts then that at higher motor densities, you do expect to see a faster accumulation rate. And so when we plotted the accumulation rate at different motor densities, you get from this not only the off rate here, 0.8, which is just what you measure when you do single molecule measurements, roughly, but we also get the on rate by. Get the on rate by fitting the slope. And so now we have a 2D on rate, and it's a little weird because it's a two-dimensional on rate: 0.003 motors per square micron per second, because that's our concentration in 2D is motors per square micron. Okay, so we now have a number to work with. So one prediction then is if this binding was irreversible, Was irreversible, then the on rate would be the same, but the off rate would be zero. And so the slope here would be the same, the thing would just move down. And so just to confirm that we're thinking about this the right way and we're modeling it the right way, we did this experiment with AMP-PNP, which is a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog. And what you see when you do that is you see accumulation on the microtubules. You can sort of see it here. See it here. And yeah, sorry. And they actually get brighter because the off rate is zero, but you get the similar types of accumulation. And if we then plot that, then this is the observed accumulation rate in AMP PNP, and here it is in ATP. And so it's the same slope, and it's a different off rate, just like we expect, supporting our idea. Okay. Okay, so now we want to know what's the rate limit limiting step in this attachment of the kinesins. It could be diffusion in the lipid bilayer to get down to the surface, or it could be the binding rate once it gets there. And the way that we think about and simplify this problem is to think about a zone, an area where the motors are close enough that they can bind. And just simplify it to say that if you're outside that area, then the attachment. If you're outside that area, then the attachment rate is zero. And if you're inside that area, then you have some first-order attachment rate. And you can get more complicated than that, but this captures a lot of what we want to look at. Okay, so we have a proof, so we can test this by changing the fluidity of the lipid bilayer to ask whether its diffusion is controlling the rate or the attachment is controlling the rate. And the way we do that is we add cholesterol to our lipid bilayer. We can do FRAP. Layer. We can do FRAP, and this tells us about the diffusion constant of the lipids. Here's the FRAP. And so we get about a four-fold slower diffusion constant for the lipid bilayer. It's about fourfold more viscous with the cholesterol. So does our accumulation rate change? If it's diffusion limited, it should change. If it's not, then it shouldn't change. And the answer is it doesn't change. The slopes are just about the same. The offsets are just about the same. Same, the offsets are just about the same. So, this tells us then that for this motor accumulation from a lipid bilater accumulating on the microtubule, it's not diffusion limited. It's limited by the binding when it gets there. And so, we can think about it as a well-mixed system. And so, we need to then continue really thinking about this binding, though. Okay, so that's what I just told you. Okay, so now, how Okay, so now, how do we think about this binding in the zone and the size of this zone? So let me try to walk you through this. If we think about the flux of motors binding on, we have a 2D on rate, it's a bimolecular on rate, multiplied by the density. So if this was in solution, this would be per micromolar per second times the free concentration, but it's 2D, so it's times the density. Concentration, but it's 2d, so it's times the density. So this flux on is going to be the same as the attachment rate when you're in the zone times the number of motors in the zone. And what's the number of motors in the zone? The number of motors in the zone is simply the size of the zone multiplied by the motor density. Density times size gives you motor number. Okay, so we have this. We can drop out the sigma. So we have this, we can drop out the sigma. So then we expect then the 2D on rate, which we measure from our accumulation measurement, is equal to k attached times the azone. And we have an estimate of k attached from our DNA origami of 5 per second. So this is the on rate that we measure. This is our 5 per second. And so then the answer is that we can explain our data by saying that the size of By saying that the size of the zone is 680 square nanometers. So, in other words, the motors on the lipid bilayer have to be in this area under the microtubule for them to bind. And interestingly, that's the size of only about 20 tubulins. So, that's a pretty small zone because if you think about just the contour length of the zone, Length of the motor, and if it can search the whole area, then it'll be considerably, it'll be 50, you know, a square would be 50 times 50, 2,500 nanometers squared, so much bigger. So it seems very confined. Okay, so a quick summary of this before I move on to the vesicle stuff is that the bimolecular on-rate is slow when they're diffusing in the membrane. Diffusing in the membrane, and the size of the zone is pretty small, and diffusion in the membrane is fast, is a fast step. So we can actually do simulations and then ask, what do we expect for run lengths with these kinds of on rates and motor densities? And so this is just a stochastic simulation of one motor binds and then the motors can, the other motors can bind with a rate constant and the Constant and the motor that started can unbind, and by varying the number of motors and the size of the vesicle, and we can predict run lengths. And so this is what you get for different vesicle sizes. The total number of motors on the vesicle you need to give a given travel distance goes like this. So this is the single motor travel distance. And as you can see, for a small one, you need, you know, a few. For 100 nanometers, which is many of them, you need. 100 nanometers, which is many of them, you need a few tens. And for big things, you need a few hundreds or even a thousand. So this slow attachment then predicts that there's high motor densities on these vesicles. The problem is when people have looked at vesicles and counted motors, there is not a high number of motors on vesicles that are ballpark 100 nanometers in size. It's more like two, three, four. It's more like two, three, four, five. So, this is from fluorescence intensities. So, we have a little bit of a discrepancy between what we predict to get these long transport distances would be high motor densities on the vesicles, but that's not what's there biologically. Okay, so we next went to our next system, which is more physiological, which is studying lipid vesicles. The lip studying lipid vesicles. So it's the same lipids and the same motors. We do a little tweaking to optimize things. But here, then we immobilize the microtubule on the cover slip and we put the motors on a liposome, 150 nanometers or so diameter, and we can then measure them. And we can measure the number of motors and we can measure the run lengths. And we do this little trick with using oligos as little tethers. All of those as little tethers to attach them there. And as I'll show you in a second, that's for we can cluster them this way. Okay, so if we look at our single, this is a single molecule TERF experiment of just single motors landing and running. And what you see when you look at if you look at a chimograph of these, and if you look at just the distribution of run lengths, you get these pretty short single molecule run lengths. Okay, and here. And here's the velocities. So now we want to know on our vesicles how many motors do we have? And we can first just look at our single motors. They have two GFPs on them. If we look at the fluorescence intensity of these, we get a bimodal. And that's actually expected because, due to folding and bleaching, not all of your GFPs are going to be bright. And so we get. Right. And so we get 1.4 GFPs per motor, or 70% that if a GFP is there, is it fluorescence? And so this is our benchmark to then estimate the number of motors on our vesicles. And the way that we do this is because we're using turf microscopy, which only looks within about 100 nanometers of the surface, if we used the vesicles and we did it in ATP, we would have motors everywhere, some of them outside the evanescent field, so we wouldn't see them. So, we wouldn't see them. So, we do this trick: we riger our motors onto the microtubule, we give it a lot of time so they'll be diffusing around. They're an AMP-PMP. If they bind, they won't leave. And then we measure the intensity of these. And so you can see the kinesins everywhere. Here's the liposomes. And we can measure then at the spots, at the liposome spots, the density of motors. Okay, so we can get from this then how many motors we have. How many motors we have. So, if we look at low motor copy numbers, like a few, and we look at the run lengths of these, then we find a slightly greater run length than the single molecule. And it looks like there might be just a little bit of clustering there, this kind of this tail, this exponent. But it's a pretty low run length for low copy numbers. If we increase the motor to vesicle ratio, then we get much longer run length. Then we get much longer run lengths like this. Okay, and one thing that we can do in looking back to this modeling we did from the bilayer stuff and just with those on rates is the key thing is the number of engaged motors. And so if you take these and you look at actually how many of those motors are engaged in these simulations bound to the microtubule, this is the average number of engaged motors. Is the average number of engaged motors, and this is the vesicle transport distance. And so this means you don't need that many engaged motors. It's just all about getting them engaged, and then that'll give you a long run length. Okay, so how can we improve this motor attachment rate? We hypothesize that clustering will solve this problem. So it turns out that if you look at vesicles, you do super resolution microscopy. Super resolution microscopy of vesicles, then you first see that dyneine and kinesin co-localize with different proteins, and you see that they're not uniformly distributed. They're punctate and there are pretty big clusters. And so there's evidence that both dynein and kinesin are clustered. Are clustered on vesicles by these scaffolding proteins. And that'll have pretty big implications for the motility because you're bringing all the motors together. So this thing about diffusing and the attachment is going to be different. And so this is a possible mechanism then that we could resolve this discrepancy where we think that you would need tens or hundreds of motors to get this long distance transport that only takes a few. Okay, so to test this hypothesis, Okay, so to test this hypothesis, we did this nifty DNA trick. So we are attaching our motors through a single-stranded oligonucleotide to the surface, and we make a complementary nucleotide that has a repeat of the complementary sequence with spacers in between it. And you could make this arbitrarily long. We just make it three copies. And so this is a way that we can cluster our motors really quickly. We can cluster our motors really closely, ideally analogous to what's going on here. Okay, and so we can visualize our liposome because we have a dye in the lipid. And then our oligo, our clustering oligo, has a different dye. So we can see that the oligo is bound there. And I'm not showing it here, but you can also see the GFPs on the vesicles. GFPs on the vesicles. So, this confirms that the oligo, when we put it in there, can bind and can get there. So, then the question is: how does this affect the transport? Does this enhance the transport? Okay, so here's the motor copy numbers are the same plus and minus the oligo as you'd expect. But what you see is you do see a pretty good enhancement of the run length when you have the same number of motors, but you've collected them with this. You've collected them with this clustering oligo. And if you go to the high motors, so basically that you can get up to this high motor equivalent with this clustering. And if you want whipped cream and a cherry on top, and so you cluster the high motors, then you can go even higher. Eventually, you get to limited by microtubule lengths and things like that. You can see actually these, you know, 20, it gets hard to make microtubules longer than 20. To make microtubles longer than 20. And so, you know, so this may be an underestimate. Okay, so first of all, I'd like to say how proud of myself I am to be under time, to be right on time. And second of all, I'd like to give you the conclusions. So, in our membrane-bound situation, in the 2D, we think that the binding is inherently slow because the binding is Is inherently slow because the binding zone, how close they have to be, is very small. So the diffusion is not the rate-limiting step. It's that they need to be really close. And we have this discrepancy between our prediction of high motor copy numbers required for long distance transport and the cellular data from others that says there's actually not that many motors on there. On there. So we propose that motor clustering through membrane microdomains, so it could just be lipid rafts getting there or multivalent scattering, scaffolding proteins or other mechanisms, can bridge this discrepancy. And so this really drives in thinking about regulation of bi-directional transport where you're having fights between a number of motors. Again, you care about the number of motors that are engaged. And so this. That are engaged. And so this would have effects both on the run length and on the directionality if it's a tug of war between kinesin and dynein. And so the clustering matters. The on rates matter. We know that different motors have different on rates due to electrostatics and things like that. And the off-rates matter. And we know that different motors have different unloaded run lengths and different off-rates. They also load. Off-rates. They also load different effects on different motors. So there's a lot of knobs to tweak in this bidirectional motility. But I think that this is one that we need to be considering when trying to bridge up to the cellular scale. So I will just finish. Again, this is Ray, who did much of this work, basically almost all of it. And this is Ching Zhou, who did the DNA origami work. This is part of my. DNA origami work. This is part of my group. These are the collaborators on this LIPID project. These characters, who most of you know, are collaborators on other bidirectional transport modeling work. This was funded by a grant from the NIH. And I would like to just give, in closing, a little plug to the biophysical journal. There's a lot of references I know in this meeting, and Christine gave a nice And Christine gave a nice story about a great reviewer of a paper. I think a lot of the type of work here that maybe hasn't gone historically into the biophysical journal would be really a great place, I think, in marrying the math and the biology. So I just want to make a plug for the biophysical journal and try to maximize the number of good papers, like all the good work that's at this meeting. So thanks very much, and I'm happy to answer any questions. Happy to answer any questions. Thank you so much. Already have two hands up. Maybe we'll start with Pete, who's on Zoom. Well, I really enjoyed the throughline narrative to various papers I've been trying to study. One question I have in the linkages: so you pointed out with the DNA origami experiment that there's some. That there's some non-transferability between solution on rates and scaffolded on rate. And then when you were making the arguments and inferences on the lipid membrane experiment, you were transferring, if I understood correctly, the on-rate from the scaffold experiment. So do you have any concern about the transferring the on-rate from the scaffold experiment to the limpid membrane experiment? Experiment to the limited membrane experiment? Right. Good question. Because part of what we're exploring is the effect of the lipid bilayer. So the motors are basically identical constructs. So they have the same motor part up to the through the coiled coil, and then there's a GFP, and then they're attached slightly differently. But in terms of Differently. But in terms of length from the surface, they're similar. There is a geometrical thing of the entire microtubule and the difficulty of constraining a microtubule really close to the surface. And Stefan Dietz did some beautiful work in just a regular assay showing that even with long motors, Even with long motors that are 80 nanometers or so long, the microtubule is 17 nanometers above the surface. And so, you know, the entropic spring aspects of the motors. So I guess the thing that I might be the most concerned about is that change in geometry versus when the microtubule is flat and the tether can go anywhere, that's much more free. Yeah, so that's. Yeah, so that's my concern. So I will say that Leduc and others measured this 15 or more years ago with a GUV thing where the motors were pulling out these long tubules. And that's actually where that original 5 per second came from. And so that's another membrane system where this 5% Where this five per second, which I didn't believe was going to be so right, came out of. So that's support. But I think it's worth still having these worries, still keeping under that under consideration. Thanks. Other questions from Zoom? I guess I was wondering, Will, if this Yes, I was wondering, Will, if this idea of motor clustering still fits into that theory of codependence of two teams of motors that you had before. I'm a little bit behind on your more recent work, so I was curious if this still fits that idea. Yeah, so this phenomenon is called the paradox of codependence. And Scott McKinley and Pete Craig. Scott McKinley and Pete Kramer and John Fricks and I had a Vulcan mind meld trying to figure out how to think about these problems. And, you know, a long time ago, before we got a grant on this, and it sort of came. So if you look in the literature, what you find is if you knock down one motor, everything doesn't go the other way. It's motility is inhibited in both directions. And that's a puzzle. So I would say this. This does not, those are, they're both going on. I guess I would say, this doesn't make me think of that question in a fundamentally different way. I haven't thought too deeply whether it may resolve part of it. I guess you can say, you know, if these clusters, if this clustering happens so that the scaffolds are binding both of them, and then one of those motors not being there somehow affects the binding. Somehow affects the binding of the other, then that's a scaffolding mechanism, which would be one way to account for this phenomenon. But if they're independent scaffolds, I think that you can't explain it just by the scaffolding. That makes sense. Thank you. I think one more from Zoom from AJ. Hi, great talk. So I was just curious, since you're talking about the effects of the lipid membrane, whether membrane uh whether you know what would you would you consider like things like um the fluidity of the membrane reducing kind of interference between motors like strain between maybe oppositely oriented motors or between similarly walking motors or something like that was that something you could measure or is that something that's reasonable to think about right um right Right. So that's a really good point because in optical trapping, you're using a hard bead. And so then you can have motor-motor, they can fight against each other. It's rigid. Here, you have a shock absorber. They can diffuse. And so the motor-motor forces will be reduced. And if the motor-motor forces, let's say a team of kinesians, some want to go a little faster, some want to go a little slower. Faster, someone got a little slower, that actually slows things down. Then you would predict that this would alleviate that. This would alleviate this. We don't, so you know, yes, yes, we've thought of that. And the velocities of these things are slightly different, but not much that we can really, we think is really a big thing happening to. A big thing happening to say just single molecules. We haven't looked rigorously at comparing a hard bead and a vesicle. I think that's still a good experiment that other people might have done, but we haven't done. So I think that that's a good, it's a very good consideration. I mean, I think there's positives and negatives. They also slip in the 2D bilayer. And so that's going to reduce their ability to transport things. To transport things. In terms of the bi-directional, you know, I kind of think they'll just go to their corners. But, you know, there may be effects of that are pretty important. And like as you guys were saying, you know, it's going to be more mortal is pulling it down onto the microtubule and that may have an effect. And so I think that that's a good open question, is my opinion, basically. You think there could be deformations and stuff if you're pulling in opposite directions or probably. In opposite directions, or probably the forces are not high enough to do that. Not so much for these tiny things, but for the bigger ones, for bigger vesicles, yes. Okay. Yeah. Cool. Thank you. Yeah. Maybe we'll take Jay's question. He's had his hand raised. I was just trying to think about sort of synthesizing what Pete was talking about. What Pete was talking about, and what you're talking about. When you have like a motor and some bigger complex, and so there's some freedom of motion for the motor to diffusively bind to its binding site. I thought it was interesting that you showed that it's reaction-limited. So, is there any effect in lining? In lining these motors up in a certain alignment so that reaction-limited rate is lower. I don't know, that they're lined up better. I know maybe that's not a factor in the lipid case, but I guess I was thinking more in terms of the DNA origin. Yeah, if you, I mean, the motor binds of the microtubule. I mean, the motor binds to the microtubule in an oriented way, in one way. And so you could imagine if you could orient it, that would really help the binding. I mean, you're reducing a degree of freedom. And if you oriented it the wrong way, then you could really hinder the binding. The thing is, there's brakes, so there's coiled coils in the motor, but there's brakes. Motor, but there's brakes. And people have done like optical trap experiments. Well, you can have one motor on a surface and a microtubule bound to it, and the microtubule spins around from Brownian motion, telling you that there are flexible regions that are rotationally flexible. We have even more of those in our origami complex, including places where there's just a single-stranded piece of DNA. And so my And so my opinion is that we have complete freedom of rotating around. But in terms of the scaffolding, so you could imagine that to be a really important factor. But there is this dilemma of like, it's not ridge. You're binding 60, 70 nanometers away with coiled coils and brakes. And so it's not an ideal way to do it. So you're giving it enough. So you're not giving it enough range of motion that you're not hindering it from aligning, but possibly not pre-aligning it so that it's faster. Thanks. Yeah. I mean, it'd be interesting to think about like if there's bi-directional transport, the motors are partitioned and the deformation of the vesicle could be doing some of that in a geometrical way. It wouldn't be, it's not alignment per se, but it's kind of aligning. Alignment per se, but it's kind of aligning the vesicle along the microtubule. Okay. You okay taking a couple more questions? Yeah, sure. All right, we have Gian and then Leah. Bill, it's a great talk. I have a question about the clustering of the motors. As you mentioned, that for the large that the uh for the large for the govs that um the cluster of the motor could generate some kind of shape deformation on the membrane and um that moving to the the way that the motor cluster do you think that the the the um the membrane shape change could be a factor um that participating into Participating into the motor cluster. In other ways, and if you can modulate the rigidity of the membrane, would you be able to modulate the way that the motor protein cluster? Right, right. So you could So you could just do the geometry to say that if it's non-deformable, so stiffer and stiffer, the spherical, then you're going, anytime you go away, you're going in Z. And the more deformable, the better. In terms of curvature, that's one factor. If the motors can, if the vesicle can deform and the binding and you have fluctuations, then that's going to really work in your favor. Going to really work in your favor, and a quite spherical, stiffer vesicle is going to work against you. That's about as far as I can think about it. I think in terms of curvature and clustering, you could imagine the curvature is driving scaffolding accumulation, and then that drives motor accumulation. Drives motor accumulation, but it'd have to be through sort of a secondary thing and not just the motors. Thank you. Clea? Yeah, really enjoyed your talk. Beautiful. In vivo, where there's a lot of other stuff around, do these vesicles ever get trapped due to obstacles or do they get trapped between two anti-parallel microtubules and Parallel microtubules and that kind of thing. So in axon, all the microtubules are oriented the same way. And so that probably works in favor because the vesicle can interact with multiple microtubules. The in dendrites, that's different. At least if the uh not C ele C. elegans and Drosophila, as Melissa said, have uniform minus end out, but but Uniform minus end out, but mammalian, you get bipolar, both directions. There's a lot of ideas about the different post-translational modifications on the different microtubules and that being a regulator so that a vesicle in a mixed orientation bundle would preferentially interact with one class. That assumes you can set up. That assumes you can set up different PTMs on different oriented microtubules, which is a challenge. In terms of the roadblock, yeah, so that's a big problem, and there's a ton of stuff on the microtubule. And in Alzheimer's, tau tangles are probably having big effects on motility. Different motors can do different things. Kinesin 3, this is all Kynesin 1 work. Kinesin 3 has electro. Kinesin 3 has a stronger electrostatic interaction. It can diffuse around and seems to be able to avoid diffuse around roadblocks a little bit. One, you know, you could say that having both kinesin and dyneine on the vesicles that are moving is an inefficient way to move them because it would be better to just put one motor and have it move ballistically rather than move stochastically back and forth with a net drift. But there's the proofreader. But there's the proofreading model that says one of the big bangs for the buck you get out of that is you never get into a dead end. Because if you ever hit a roadblock or a cul-de-sac or whatever, you're going to get out of that and give it another try. And so you have this sort of proofreading mechanism. So it's definitely a consideration. And I think those things work help. Help. You know, it has to be said: if you look in a neuron, in an axon, or a dendrite, and you look at the vesicles and you count, you know, what fraction are moving plus n, what fraction are moving minus n, and what fraction are static. There's always a lot of static vesicles. And so the degree to which that is, you know, because of detachment, because of the motors fighting each other, and they're at a standstill. At a standstill, or one of these cul-de-sac or roadblock kinds of mechanism is not really well known. So I think that's a very good and open question. Thank you. Paul? Well, we should probably call it an evening there. We're already about 10 minutes over. Glad to have the last talk of the day. Okay, more discussion. More discussion. Thank you for both speakers in this session. They've been lovely talks. Thank you. And see you all tomorrow morning.
