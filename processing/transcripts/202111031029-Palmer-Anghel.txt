And we will start with Christina Panard-Angel, who will tell us about colored Jones and colored Alexander polynomials unified by a graded Lagrangian intersection. Christina, please go ahead. So thank you very much. First of all, I would like to thank the organizers very much for the opportunity to speak here. Yeah, and my talk will be about a way to see Color Johnson and Color Alexander Polnomius. Color Johnson and colour dynasty polynomials as gradient intersections of certain Lagrangian Lagrangian sub-manifolds in configuration spaces or symmetric powers. So, the outline for my talk is our service motivation. And then in the first part, I will say what is the homological setup that we use. And now there are two main parts. The first part is about topological models as state sum of some interstate. A state sum of some intersections in cooperation spaces. And the next part is a model which comes directly from an intersection of two Lagrangians in a symmetric power. So that's where I would like to arrive. And I'll see with the motivation. So I would like to see topological models for UQSL2 quantum invariant. And by topological model, I mean a gradient intersection pairing. Pairing of certain homology classes in coverings of configuration spaces, at least for the first part that the database setup. And now my motivation is, or one of the motivations concerns categorifications. So now if you think about the Alexander polynomial and about the Jones polynomial, they have categorifications which are provided by not phlegmology on one side. On one side, and then covanovhomology on the other side. And then it was conjectured that between this categorification, it should be a spectral sequence that was conjectured by Rosmusson. And it was constructed, such a spectral sequence by Dublin in 2018. But however, there are still questions about the geometric meaning of the spectral sequence. Okay, and now, so what Um, okay, and now so what I would like to talk about is about um Corrupt-Johnson and Corrupt-Alexander polynomials, which are quantum generalizations of these two main invariants, Johnson-Alexander. And I'd like to bring them together in the same picture. Okay, and then this will provide the topological framework from where we could try to go towards categorifications. Right, so now historically, Now, historically, quantum invariance came from representation theory by the construction due to Rashstickian and Porayev. And Kohler-Johnson and Kohler-Daikondra polynomial come from the representation theory of the quantum group UKSL2. And now what I would like to talk about is a view from intersections in covering spaces, in covering soft configuration spaces. And now And now the first such model was provided by Bigerow and Lorenz for the original draws polynomial. And now what I would like to talk today is about a way to see the color N, colour Jones and colored Alexander from the same picture. And then in the first part, we will see. So the picture will be provided by a state sum of intersection. Sum of intersections, and then we will have an intersection of immersed agronomians, and then we have another model which will be an intersection of embedded agrarian. And sometimes it will be interesting to go between the two. And in the last part, I want to go towards a way to see this state sum in a single place, which will be provided by a gridded detection of two Lagrangian symmetric power. Okay, so this is roughly the plan. And I just wanted to say which is a flavor of this state sum model. And then I will define step by step the ingredients. So for this state sum model, we fix n to be the color of the quantum invariant that we want to study. And then we start with an anorentic link. Start with an aurantic link and present it as a closure of a braid with little M strands. And the idea is that for each indexing set I, where its components can vary between zero and the color minus one, we will associate two Lagrangians. And the way of constructing these two Lagrangians will use the configuration space. Namely, Namely, we will start with a 2n puncture disk, and we will look at the confusion space of these many particles in that functor disk. And now we will consider a particular Z plus Z covering of this confliction space. And we will use the homology of this covering. And in this homology of the covering, we will construct two homology classes, F, which depends on F, which depends on that indexing set I, and then Li. And now just to say which is the picture that we have in mind. So here we have the puncture disk with 10 punctures. And then in order to construct the first class, F, what we do is to draw, so we start from the boundary and we draw a set of curves. Some set of curves towards the punctures. So, for example, we start on the boundary here and then we look at the first puncture labeled by one. And then we draw I1 curves which end in that puncture. Okay. Then we go to the second functor and so on after the n minus one functor. And then we draw their n minus one segment. And then what we do is to imagine that we cut is to imagine that we cut the disk into two halves. And then for the right hand side, we will draw the number of segments which are prescribed by the complementary numbers with respect to the color. So we'll have n minus 1 minus this index, n minus 1, and so on and so forth, up to n minus 1 minus i1. Okay, so the condition is that the number of segments which ends into symmetric punctures will add to the color minus one. Will add to the color minus one. And we have a collection of curves, and we will take their product and quotient it into the Confucian space. And we'll get a sub-manifold of half-dimension. And we will take a particular lift of that sub-manifold. And that will give us an homology class. That's the first one. And then the second one, the class LI, will be provided by the same procedure, but we will consider But we will consider configuration spaces on circles which go around the punctures. Okay, and then another important thing will be that we'll have a breakgroup action on this homology group, on the homology of the covering. And that action comes from the mapping cross-group property of the so the breakgroup is a mapping cross group of the buncture disk. Right, and now so we'll define a particular state sum of these kind of intersections. So more precisely, we denote by lambda n the following stamp. So here we have a framing correction, which we count by the variable u. And then what we do is to take the homology classes, the sum over all states i. States I and we look at the class Fi, we act with a braid on it, and the idea is that we will have an intersection pairing on that homology, we can make the pairing, and then we'll get a polynomial, okay? And basically, that intersection pairing is a type of Poincar√© duality. So, in this way, we'll get. So, in this way, we'll get a polynomial in three variables. And the theorem that we will reach is that this polynomial in three variables recovers the n s color jones and n s collar d alexander through a specialization of coefficients. Okay, so if we want to obtain the color jones jn, we start from this state sum and then we specialize it in a certain way. And dually, if we want to obtain the colour jump, And dually, if we want to obtain the colored Alexander, then we start from the same state sum and then we specialize it in a different way. I will say which are these specializations later. Okay, so this was the statement. And now I want to define the homological representations that we work with. So we will fix three natural numbers, n, m, and k, and we will look at the n-puncture. And we will look at the n's puncture disk, the n. And now we use the configuration space in this functor disk with n particles. And when I say configuration space, I mean unordered configuration space. Okay, and now on this configuration space, we will define a local system. So basically, we start from pi 1. We will take the abelianization, which abionization which provides us with n plus one generators and then basically we can see these generators as being the classes of certain loops in the configuration space so if we imagine that we have the base point on the boundary the generators look like look looks look there are two types of generators basically so the first type moves just one Moves just one particle. So you keep all the points from D2 to Dm fixed, and then you move the first particle on a loop around the ice puncture. Okay? So in this way, you will get n generators because you have n punctures. And now you will get an extra generator, delta, where basically you keep all the points from the third point onwards fixed. But then you swap the But then you swap the first two points one with the other by a loop which looks like this: this delta. Okay, and that will give you another generator of the homology group H1. So in total, we have m plus one generators. And then what we do is to go to go towards Z plus Z by basically just taking the augmentation on this Zn. Where we send sigma i for the first n minus k punctures to the variable x, and then for the last punctures, we go towards minus x. So it's just a difference of a sign there. Okay, so and we consider the covering space corresponding to this local system. So basically, we have a covering space. So basically, we have a covering space with deck transformations given by z plus z. And then one of the variables is x, and then the other one is d. Okay, and then if you look in the punctured disk, we can see which is a monogram of this local system. So basically, if you take a loop in the confusion space, when you go around the puncture, in that with this orientation or the other one, you count x with x. x with x or x minus 1. And then if you swap two particles, then you get the variable d. So this is what happens. And further on, we will fix also a point W on the boundary and then a base point on the punctured disk, on a lift of the base point in the covering that's detailed. Okay, and now the two sites. And now, the tools that I will use concern the homology of this covering. So, things are a bit technical here, but the idea is that we'll take the covering, we'll look at the Borel morhomology, so the homology with respect to locally finite chains, and then we will consider the Borel morphology with respect to two different parts of the boundary. Okay, and so I want. And so I won't go in more details than that, but because we have very precise pictures, but what I want to say is that one should be careful to define these homology groups such that the pictures that I will see afterwards really make sense and give you homology classes in these homology groups. So what we will use basically is that we have on homology group H and M on which we have a break compaction and then we have also a dual homology group. Have also a dual homology group which we denote by H and M delta. And the main point is that, so that's in a joint work with Martin Palmer, that we have an intersection pairing which goes between these two homologies. So you take H and M, you take its dual, and then the pairing will give you a polynomial into variables. And these variables are the variables of the deck transformations. Okay, and then the idea is that. The idea is that we'll start, we will basically draw everything in a punctured disk, but then secretly we will mean that we construct homogeneous systems in the cowboard in the following way. So for example, if we start with a partition of m into n natural numbers, first what we can do is to draw m curves in the punctured disk, like in this picture. Like in this picture. So you see, you start from the boundary and then you draw these red curves which are prescribed by the partition. The number of curves which enters into each puncture is prescribed by the limit of the partition. And then what you do is to take their product and then convert it into the analysis configuration space. That will give you a submanifold, F. But then, in order to obtain some manifold in the covering, we will have to lift it. And now, in order to lift it, we have to know where to lift it. And this will be done by constructing some loops to the boundary. So the first piece of data is this manifold, which is given by basically this collection of curves in the puncture disk. And secondly, we want to pass in the Secondly, we want to pass in the configuration space. And for example, in this particular picture, I chose the path which is given by the collection of these pink segments which go vertically. Okay, so that will construct a path from your manifold Fe towards the boundary point. And then what you can do is to take the lift of this pass in the covering from the base point and then Base point and then lift your seminar at the end of that path, okay. And in that way, you obtain an homologic class in the covering. And so the idea is that the geometric support given by this collection of curves and then the path to the base point, this couple give us an homology class. Okay. And as I mentioned before, we have an intersection pairing in the homology of the covering. The homology of the covering, but actually, that intersection pairing can be computed in the base configuration space. Namely, that intersection pairing is basically somehow indexed by intersection points between the two sub-manifolds. And then it should be graded. And this grading, it's more subtle. And it uses the local system. And then our choices of paths to. And then our choices of path to the boundary. Okay, um, so this is the dictionary, and then from now on, we'll basically work just in the configression space. Okay, so this was part of the homological setup that we use. And now I start to present the models which are given as state sums. State sums. So here the context is again: L is an oriented link presented as a closure of a braid, and the braid has n strands. And we also fix the color of the invariant that we want to obtain. And so for this model, we'll use some building blocks, which will be again indexed by this choice of indexing sets. This choice of indexing sets. So, for each eye where the components are between zero and the color minus one, we construct two homology classes. And the homology classes are given by the following couples. So for the first family, what we do is to this is similar to what you said in the beginning. So we start from the boundary. From the boundary, we cut our disk into half, and then in the first half of the disk, so towards the punctures labeled by one and so on, up to n minus one, we draw some curves which are prescribed by this partition. So it's i1, up to i n minus one. Now in the other half of the disk, we complete symmetrically with respect to the color. In total, we have n minus one times n minus one red card. times n minus one red curves and this will give us the the geometric support so it will be a manifold of half dimension in the basic configuration space and now in order to lift it we need a path to the to the boundary and in this model uh we choose we choose this this path which as you can see is quite curvy okay um but anyway so the couple collection of curves and then Collection of curves and then path to the boundary encodes basically an homology class in the homology of the covering. So that's for the first homology class. And now for the dual, what we do is to draw the following figure eights around symmetric functions. And we consider the configuration space of n minus one particles on each figure eight. Take their product and then look at their product in the another. And then look at their product in the another configuration space. That will give us another submanifold of half-dimension. And now, if we couple this with the pieces of data given by this path to the boundary, as I said, this couple encodes another homology class in the covering. And that's a class G. Okay, and now what we do is to consider a linear combination of these classes U-tild. Tilt with some coefficients. And then we keep the second homology class fixed. And we will also use the following specialization of coefficients. So for the following model, we go from During two variables, X and D, towards normal polymers in one variable. Okay, and so the idea is. So, the idea is that if our link is a closure of a braid beta n, what we do is to consider this pairing I n, which is obtained by the first homology class En on which we act with a braid and then we make the pairing with G. If we do the pairing, we'll obtain a polynomial in two variables. Okay, and then this I n records. And then this recovers the n-scalar Jones and then n-squared Alexander polynomials, up to some framing corrections in each case. Okay, so this is a model with similar scales because we used those figure eight. And now for the next part, I want to go towards the embedded case. But now, before that, I want to mention a relation to Bigelow's model for the John's polynomial. So, now if in this statement we put big n equal to, we recover something which is very close to big loss classes. Okay, so the class, the red class will be very close to the forks, and then the blue one will be pretty much the models. Okay, and this is. Okay, and this is because if n equals 2, it means that our indices can vary between 0 and 1. And then basically, our homology class is a linear combination of homology classes, which have the support, as in the picture. Which basically mean that if you look at symmetric points, you will draw either a segment or a curve. Either a segment or a curve towards the puncture, the K, or a segment towards a puncture which is symmetric to K, but not both in the same time. Which means that basically up to isotopy, you can just move this point to the boundary towards the middle and smoothen them and get this support. And then for the dual manifold, you have configuration of n minus 1 particles on this figure A. Particles on this figure eights. But now, if n is equal to two, it means that you just have the figure eights themselves. And these are the noodles in Bigelow's picture. Right. And another corollary is that from this, we can see the ADI invariants from Z plus Z to N covering spaces of configuration spaces. Okay. Okay, and now I want to go towards the embedded model. So, the questions that I would like to answer here is: can we find a model which uses embedded Lagrangians rather than immersed ones? And also which is suitable for computations? Because the point is that these paths to the boundary are really essential in making computations. And somehow they're used in grading the intersection points. Grading the intersection points. So, in order to do that, so the idea is to just replace the figure eights with circles. And then for this purpose, we will also replace the monodromy of the local system because in this picture, the monodromy was counted in the same way, and then now we'll change and count the monodromy of symmetric points with different orientations. Points with different orientations. And we'll add an extra functor. So, in this, this is a model that I started with. So, the homology classes will be given by the following support. So, if we fix the indexings at I, we draw this red support here. So, this collection of these mini cards. Of these many curves, n minus one times n minus one plus one. And now we choose the path to the boundary to be vertical. Okay, so to be this collection of vertical paths. Okay, and the couple, this collection of curves plus the path to the boundary give you a homology class. That's the first of homology class. And then dually for the dual manifold, we take configuration spaces on Spaces on circles which go symmetric functions around symmetric functions and the path to the boundary is again this time is straight straight to boundary okay so as we as we saw in the beginning if we consider lambda n to be given by this state sum so for each So for each i, we look at the homologic class fi, we act with a braid on it, and then we make the pairing with the dual class li. The pairing will give us two variables, x and d, which were the variables of the transformations, and then we have the extra variable u, which is part of the framing correction. So, overall, we get the polynomial in three variables, and then if you want to obtain the answer. And then, if you want to obtain the n-score Jones, then that's obtained from this lambda n specialized with these parameters. And then the n-score Dexander is obtained from the same state sum of intersections, but specialized in a different way. Okay, and now, so the main picture that we have so far is that we have the too many variables. That we have the two main invariants. So, n scholar Johnson N scholar Alexander. And then, what we can do is to start with the immersed state sum, which was pretty much the one that I presented in Core M1, which is constructed using this figure eight. And then from this immersive sum, we can recover both of them. So, we just have to look at all intersection points which occur there. All intersection points which occur there, break them in a certain way, and then you get cordron or cordaxander, depending on the specialization. But also, what you can do is to look at the embedded one where you have the circles, and then you recover both of them by different specializations. Okay, and now I just want to show an example. So, for n equals two, it means that you basically get the means that you basically get the original Jones polynomial and Alexander polynomial from the same geometrical picture and for example let's let's look at the triffle node which is a closure of sigma to the power 3 and this means that big n is equal to 2 little n is equal to 2 and if you if you remember the indexing sets were up to n minus 1. were up to n minus one. So little n minus one, which means that we have just one indexing set. So it's just y1, which can vary between zero and one. Okay, and on the picture, we have, we imagine that this is a punctured disk. We have our boundary point, W here. The first class starts on the boundary point and goes to the first puncture. Puncture that's F1, and then we have also another class where we do not go towards the first puncture, but on the other hand, we go towards the second function. That's F0. Okay, and then what we have to do is to act with the braid, which in practice means that we can take a little disk around these two functions 0 and 1 and rotate them three times. them three times okay and now if you look at the at the picture that we get the the the effect will be that the red curve will wind three times around the punctures okay so get this uh this this curve here and then on the other hand the the orange curve stays fixed okay and the idea is that we have to look at the intersection point and um And in this picture, we see five intersection points. So now we intersect with a circle. And as I said, the important thing is how we grade these intersection points. And the grading basically uses the path to the boundary. So for example, at this intersection point, the way to grade it is you start from the boundary, you go towards the green. The green circle, go to the intersection point, then follow the red support, and then come back to the boundary. And then what you have to do is to see what is its monotromy around the punctures, and then if it has a relative winding number. But in this case, it doesn't. But what you will see is that this winds around two times around the punctures. So this is where I get the power two. The power two. Okay, so you have five intersection points, you have the gradings, and you obtain this lambda two. And this lambda two, you put the framing correction. So if you specialize it in this way, you get the transponal of the trephole. And now if you take the other specialization, you get indeed the Alexander. you get indeed the Alexander Poninas Trevor. Okay, but then both of them really can read from the same from the same from the same drawing. Okay, so that's on the embedded side. And as I said, we have an embedded model and also an immersed one. So the same computation can be performed using the intersection between the red support and then the figure rate. So if you consider this model, This model, you have a similar way of computing the gradings, you get the polynomial omega2, and then if you take the two specializations, you get the transform of triple and again the Alexander polynomial of the trifle. Okay. And now the idea is that, as I said, my motivation is towards, it's going towards categorifications. So, looking at this picture, it, I mean, the embedded model, it's it looks like it might be close to fluoromology and then we'll get actually closer soon. And on the other hand, it seems like the immersed model might be more suitable for the transpondial case. So, the motivation is to go to go towards Covanov from the Immers model. Okay, and now, so what I'd like to do next is to answer the following question: Is it possible to find a geometric support, which is given by just two sum manifolds, fixed sum manifolds, which basically encode these families which occur in the state sum? So in other words, can we globalize all these homology classes? We globalize all these homology classes which were indexed by the choices of i in a single sub-manifold. And this is what we'll do next. And in order to do this, we'll allow points with multiplicities. And in order to do that, we will work in asymmetric power. Okay, so that's the second main mode that I'd like to talk about. Talk about. So in this context, again, n is the number of the strength of the braid, and big n is a color. And we will work with a puncture disk, but we will add some extra punctures, blue punctures. And those extra blue punctures will carry some new monodromies. In other words, we will add one extra variable. One extra variable which will help us with the grading. And we will work in the symmetric power. So we take the punctured disk with three n minus one punctures. And we will consider the symmetric power of order n minus one times n minus one. Okay, and we denote this by sigma. And in this symmetric power, we will define two logarithms and manifolds. So here is our 3n minus 1 puncture disk. So we have these black punctures and we have n blue punctures. Okay. And now we consider these red curves. Okay. In total, we have little n minus one red curves. Minus little n minus one red curves. And further on, we consider the on each red curve the symmetric power with big n minus one particles. Okay, and now we take the product of this all these symmetric powers and quotient it into the symmetric power of the function list. So that will give us a submanifold in. In the symmetry power sigma. Okay, and dually what we do is to take these circles, these little n minus one circles, and consider the symmetric powers of order big n minus one on each circle. Okay, and that will give us a second submanifold, TNL. Okay, so we fixed. Um, we fix this too, and uh, further on, we'll have a breakup action. So, what we can do is to imagine that we draw a little disc around the first punctures, and then the bread group action will be can be supported into this area, into this disc. And then in the exterior, we'll act by the identity so. So, the idea is to look at this red support and then act on it with a braid and see what happens. Okay, and further on we will also fix a base point which will denote the bar, which should have n minus 1 times n minus 1 components. So, on the picture, basically the base point this time will be on the red curves. The red curves. So, for example, here we have n minus 1 components and so on and so forth. Up to here, we have big n minus 1 components. Okay, so that is our base point. And this will be very important for the grading point of view. All right, and now we want to define a certain We want to define a certain gradient intersection between this summary fold, so the action on the braid on the red curve, so on the red Lagrangian, and then the dual one. And then basically, so this graded intersection will be parametrized by the intersection points. So you just look at these two sub-manifolds in the symmetric power, they have complementary dimensions. Have complementary dimension, you have a set of intersection points, and then we will grade them. And the way of grading, uh, so we'll grade them by polynomials this way and not by monomials. Okay, and I'll describe exactly how what I mean by this. But the idea is that you take intersection points, to each intersection point, you'll associate a polynomial, and then basically the unified model. The unified model will be the sum of those polynomials. And that will recover the inscription and Alexander. So now I want to describe how to construct this polynomial. So the idea is again to look at some loops and then read those loops using their monogamy around punctures and around the diagonal. So as I said, So, as I said, the main object is a set of intersection points, which we'll denote by iŒ≤ n. Okay, and the idea is that for each intersection point, we will consider an extra data. And that extra data will be which we call a coloring of that intersection point. So, I will describe only an example what that means. But here, so if we denote the intersection point by x-bar, which will have n minus one times n minus one component, the idea is that basically these components might have multiplicities. And then we want to prescribe a way to color this point using these multiplicities. So we do not. So we denote by call of x the set of colorings. And now a coloring means that we have a collection of n minus one functions where fk goes from the set one up to n minus one towards itself. Okay, and basically the idea is that if you look at each point, at each image, if you take the pre-image, If you take the pre-image of that point, the idea is you want that pre-image has the cardinality which is given by the multiplicity of the point. But I will be, I'll be, so I'll give the construction now. So the idea is that if you are interested about FK and what is the definition of that FK, we look at the case red. Red red curve. Okay, which means that it will end in a point 2n minus 1 minus k. And now on this curve, we will see a collection of, we will see some components of x. Okay? Say x1 up to xl. We might not see n minus 1. In total, we see n minus 1 if we add the. Total, we see n minus one if we add their multiplicities. Okay, and the idea is that each intersection point, we think that it carries a coloring. So, for example, this has the circle, this has a square, and this has a triangle. Okay. And what we do is that we want to color these base points by the colors given by this intersection points. Uh, this intersection points such that we use the each color used as many times as its multiplicities. Okay, so for example, we want to use the circle M1 times, the square M2 times, and then the triangle ML times. Okay, so basically, a coloring means a way to relate an intersectional point with the An intercession point with the base point. Okay. And now the idea is that once we fix an intersection point and a coloring of it, so x by its intersection point, f it's a coloring of it. We will construct a loop in the symmetric power which is associated to this couple. And that will be a loop based in the base point. Okay, so the way to do this is, so we have the base point here, which we draw in gray. And so I'll describe what happens on the base point, which is denoted by D. So dt1 up to dt1. denoted by t so dt1 up to dtn minus one but we'll do the same procedure for all vertical levels so we start from the base point and now we look in the right hand side in the right hand side we we might see an intersection point and just one and if so we send the last um the last components of this Of this towards that intersection point. Okay. And then we so we send by following this green path, which we have drawn. Then we'll follow the circle and then we'll come back. Okay, this will be part of the loop. And now with the other components, so the idea is that if Is that if we fix the intersection point and the coloring, it means that the coloring will induce a coloring of the base point. Okay, so in this example, if you have this point with some multiplicities, so the square is multiplicity two, here we have multiplicity one, and so on. The coloring this means that if you look at the base points, we have to. We have to put the square just once. This square we have to put two times, and then this square we have to put one time. Okay? And then on the so on the right-hand side, we have multiplicity one, so we'll go just like this. And then I have to describe what happens on the left-hand side. So on the left-hand side, we start from all these three components. We follow the dotted line. Dotted line as we did for the previous one. We arrive at the intersection point. We follow this path to the green sub-manifold. Then we follow the green sub-manifold up to the intersection point. And then from the intersection point, we have to come back. But the idea is. But the idea is that we have to come back by preserving the color. So, this is why the coloring is important. And then the point is that if we change two colorings, then you might have a collision between two points. So, we might get an intersection in the symmetric power. Okay, so the idea is that we have this set of loops, and we want to define a grading on this set of loops. So, this is a bit technical, but the idea is to take L, the set of loops which are supposed to be transverse to the diagonal on the negative part of the circle. And then they are allowed to intersect the diagonal in one point in the other half. Okay, and then we want to grade them. And the idea is that we want to grade them by using the idea is that we want to grid them by using the diagonals of the symmetric power so we want to define a morphism from this set of loops towards z plus z plus z and the idea is that we want to have three variables and roughly what we want to do is to take a look and then see how many times it winds around the black punctures and the variable x will count this now the variable y will Now, the variable y will count how many times this loop winds around the blue punctures. And the variable d will count basically its intersection with the diagonal, intersection with the diagonal, and also how many times it winds around the diagonal. And the way to do this is to basically take a disk which bounds that loop and intersect that disk with certain diagonals of the symmetric power, given by the punctures and then given by the collision. Functions and then given by the collision of two particles. But the main idea is that you just have a loop and then you count this winding around these three types of diagonals. And in this way, you get three variables. And we consider the following graded intersection. So remember that our two Lagrangians were the action on the braid on the red support. On the braid on the red support, and then paired with a green submanifold. Yeah. And we define the grid intersection in the following way. So it's parametrized by the intersection point. And once we have an intersection point, we count, so this is given by the orientation, epsilon. And now we look at the set of all color rings of that intersection point. And then we And then we evaluate the local system all these colorings. So for each coloring, we'll obtain a monomial in x, y, and d. But now, if we add up over all colorings, we'll obtain a polynomial. Okay, which I denote p of x. So basically, this graded intersection is the sum over all intersection points where you count orientation, and then this polynomial which creates that intersection. This polynomial, which creates that detection point. And so now the theorem is that if you consider this graded intersection, gamma n, which is given by, this is a framing correction, this is another part of the correction which is needed, and then basically this intersection in the symmetric power that gives you a polynomial in four variables. Variables and then this polynomial recovers the n-scalar Jones and then the n-square direct-sander polynomials through two different specializations. Okay, so Jn is the specialization in this way and then the core Doris under it's obtained just by changing the specialization. So basically we have this picture and what we have to do is to act with a braid on the red support. On the red support, this will wind around, look at the intersection points in the symmetry power, and then specialize. And that will give us both score joints and core dynamics. And just in order to end, what I want to say is that we have, so n equals 2 is interesting already. Because for n equals 2, we have Johnson-Alexander. And in this case, the picture is much simpler. So you have. Simpler. So you have just the symmetric product of the punctured disk. You do not have any symmetric power on the red support, so you just take the product of these segments and then the product of the circles. This will give you two Lagrangians. You look at the intersection points, and now the grading of these intersection points will be given by monomials. So basically, here you do not have colorings. Colorings. Colorings appear just at higher colors, at higher ends. So basically, you just have intersection points, you grid the intersection points, and if you grade them correctly, then that gives you Johnson on one hand and Alexander on the other hand. Okay, and then my motivation is to go from here towards categorifications. And what I want to say is that for Alexander's case, this picture, if you look at this very This picture, if you look at this red curves and these green circles, it's very close to the picture that occurs in node pharmology. And yes. And just to end, for the trifle knot, for example, the picture looks like this. And now if you act and you see how the curve winds around, you get this picture. So the red curve. So, the red curve and then the circle. And then, if you grade it, you see that you get the Johnston-Alexander of the Trafford. Okay, and I think I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Let's thank Christina for the nice talk. Thank you very much. Please ask questions. So, is there? Yes, thank you so much for a very nice talk. I was actually going to ask about replacing intersection points by fluorohomology. So you already commented on connection to not fluorohomology. So I have actually two questions. Not fluorhomology, one of the gradings is skin differ. So how do you see it in your formalism? So that's question number one. And question number two is what happens if we take pure homology for the slipangence in the The fungi in the colored Alexander case, do you get the verification of colored Alexander polynomial, or that's what you hope to expect? Or that would be question number two. You're muted. Yeah, I'm sorry. So go ahead. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yes, so here you have the gradings will be given by the intersection and the winding number around this point. That's one of the gradings. And then is it clear why is that spin C structure? Why should it be interpreted? Alexander grading and not for epsomology is a spin C structure conceptual. Yeah, so I mean I don't have a very good answer for this at the moment. Have a very good answer for this at the moment, but what I want to say is that the picture itself looks very close to not pharmology. Yeah, but there are still some details to be sorted out about that. I think it's all the links are all in S3, so there are certain structure. That's right, that's why it may be not so easy to see. Not so easy to see that it's well, I mean, the Alexander grading, the variable that we usually call X of Alexander polynomial is counting spin C structures. But anyway, what about the second question? Yeah, I mean, I very much hope so to go in the direction. Yes. The point is that, so this sequent result is very, very recent. It's just a pure D. Very, very recent. It's just it appeared yesterday on archive. And I think it was useful to go from the state sum, which was basically a huge state sum, and the geometric support was not easy to deal with, towards this picture where everything is contained in just two Lagrangians. So I think this is a better place from which you can start to seek about colour colour dailyxandra. I mean, that was one of the motivations for trying to globalize everything in. To globalize everything in the same picture. Thank you. Does anybody else have a question? Okay, then let's thank Christina again for her very nice talk. Thank you very much. And then we'll then have a five-minute break and resume at half past.
