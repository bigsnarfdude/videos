Um let's go to the last talk of today. Let's say the originalization of non-mini randomly corporated media under minimum signal. Thank you very much. So it's a very long talk. Actually, this should be the title of the game. It should find something I mean shorter. And thanks a lot to Flaviana, Sigiff, and Jean-Fran√ßois for the invitation. Okay. Okay, so here I'm going to present some results which are really recent. Actually, they're not out yet, so we are finishing them. Some updates, which I obtained in collaboration with Mushias Kardia from Heriot Watt and Costas Zemas, who is a talk from my group. And they are about the homogenization of integral functionals in perforated domains, which would be randomly perforated under minimum assumption of the The minimum assumption of the geometry of the domain. Okay, so let me first introduce the problem I would like to discuss here, which is actually work more. Okay, thank you very much, Philip. That's enough one. Okay, so the problem I would like to discuss here is a very classical one. So we consider here. So, we consider here a sequence of Dirichelet problems for an elliptic, non-linear in general PDE. So, this A will be an elliptic operator, which is possibly non-linear. Actually, in our case, this kind of problems will come from a function, because this A of will be equal to zero will be the range of mission associated with some function. And these problems are set in a domain which demands. Are set in a domain which depends on a small parameter epsilon, which is the parameter which sets the scale of the problem. And this domain, d epsilon, is what we are calling here a perforated domain. And indeed, this domain, d epsilon, is obtained, sorry, is obtained by removing from a Lipschitz-bounded domain a collection of holes, which will be spherical. And so now in this picture, you can see that these holes are quite regularly distributed. Are quite regularly distributed in the domain. And here I will call this slide epsilon the typical distance between the centers of two holes. I mean, the meaning of typical will be clear later on, and it really depends on the geometry that we are choosing, while A epsilon, which is infinity similar as epsilon tends to zero, will be the typical radius of these holes. Okay, and actually this torque I will consider. Okay, and actually this torque I will consider always radii of type epsilon to the power alpha, where alpha will be larger or equal to one. Okay, so as you can imagine, we would like to study the esoteric behavior of this sequence of problems. So we want to let epsilon go to zero, which means considering the limit of many small holes. And we would like to understand whether our original problem converges. First of all, if it converges. First of all, if it converges, I mean, maybe it converges only for certain choices of the radii in epsilon, and then clearly what is this differential operator here, maybe not, if we can find it explicitly, and how this operator depends on the geometry of the domain. Okay, so now at the moment the problem is stated in a very general way, and let us see what happens in the well-known case. See what happens in the well-known case of uh periodical distributed holes, which is a very classical problem which we solved at the beginning of the eighties. So let us consider now the situation. The situation where we have a reality distribution of balls. So my set H epsilon will be here. The union of balls will be which are centered on periodic vectors. So the center sign of type epsilon i will write is an integer nine. where i is an integer number and with the radius epsilon with alpha as I said before times rho where rho is a fixed positive constant of the model and alpha is larger equal than one. So in this case I can really say that epsilon is the distance between the centers of the homes really the distance and epsilon to the alpha is the scale of the so it's the radius of the volts up to this fixed constant problem. So it's really the And um I would like to to recall what happens in the case um of the Woisson equation. So now we are in a linear setting clearly and we would like to study the Linux B of this equation. Where here this right hand sum is such that this equation makes sense. So the element of h minus 1. So first of all let me notice something which is very trivial. So if I take Very trivial, so if I take a solution to this problem, I can simply use it as a test function in the equation to find immediately, and then I'm extending it trivially to zero inside the holes because they have to satisfy the additional condition of the boundary of the holes. And then I'm mixing media to reduce that the L2 norm of the gradient V, and this is the bigger extension of mu to the zero is smaller or equal to. 0 is more equal to a constant, which only depends on me, times C, the right hand side in H minus 1 of V. Then, simply applying the Booker inequality, we immediately know in this case that up to subsequence we will epsilon converges weakly in H1 to some Europe. I mean something which is very very which is triggered in this case. So we know for sure that the solution to this problem converges to a certain function and now we want to understand whether this function satisfies a limit equation and what is the form of this limit equation. Okay so I mean here calling this quite quickly I'm not going to prove these results in detail I will just say something Indeed, I mean I will just say something about this classical result that what is known and is classical is that in the limit problem, so the limit operator that we are going to find as epsilon Kelton zero depends on the harmonic capacity of the set of volts, of spherical volts, density, if one wants to be precise in line. And here I'm just recording what is the definition of harmonic capacity. This is called harmonic because I mean it's obvious we mean like Harmonic because I mean it's obtained by minimizing the Dirichlet functional. So I'm minimizing just the Drich functional. So this is the capacity of a set AE, which is contained in A by 2 millimeter. So it's the integral of the nabla u squared. And then I'm minimizing over all functions which are C infinity with 14 B and which are equal to one or not one in A. Okay. So let me then uh give you a bit more an original idea It's more a neuristic idea at least of this result. So it's very one can compute very easily the capacity, the harmonic capacity of a Bohr brothers R in Rn, and this will scale down R to the L minus 2, where N is the dimension of the space. Then in this setting, where we are considering a periodic distribution of balls, of holes, if you want, so the number of holes in a unit square is in a unit cubeson. And the mention is epsilon. And dimension is epsilon to the n to the minus n. And then if we compute the capacity of the set of volts in Q, so with respect to Ln, so we can write it as the sum of the capacities of the single volts which compose the set H epsilon. Actually, the capacity superaditive is not really additive, but if you take poles which are well separated. Poles which are well separated from one another, which is exactly this case. It is basically additive, so you can do this computation very easily. And what you get in the end is that the capacity of h epsilon in Q with respect to Rn, so scales like in epsilon as epsilon to the minus n, which is this number, and then the radius, as I told you, to the n minus 2, and the radius. Due to the n minus 2, and the radius was epsilon plus, and then it's not a vector n minus 2. And then n is constant, so this is just constant. And so, for this guy here to be positive and finite, so we can see immediately that alpha has to be equal to m over n minus 2. And indeed, I mean, capsule from here immediately, and then we can call them and just discover. And then we can call them in this this capacity. We're not, and this will be done faulty and fine with it. Okay. And actually, what was proven in the periodic case by Etoris Conural at the beginning of the 80s is if we are exactly this regime, so for this choice of the exponent alpha, and here n is larger or equal to 3, I'm avoiding towards the critical case, and we choose radii. And we choose radii which scale exactly like epsilon to the alpha, where alpha is exactly this guy here, and we take a sequence of solutions to the epsilon problem. Then, clearly, I mean, you naught exists is positive, and the limit of the sequence, which is with the target of the blackboard, converges to a problem which is of this type, so it's still a linear equation. This step, so it's still a linear equation where we have here the Laplacian and then plus an additional step, which depends exactly on the geometry of the domain exactly through the capacity of the volts. Okay, and so this is the main result of Shurenes Comura, and you can compute the capacity, you're not in this case, I mean explicitly, this is nothing actually, than the capacity of the ball of radius rho in Rn, which. A role in correct, which is discussing. But if my memory serves me right, it was not only for probiotic, right? You had conditions you couldn't get away from the periodic. Yes, you can. You are completely right. At the moment, yes. No, no, no, I don't. No, I don't. No, he was asked. But you are talking about this paper? Yes. I don't think it's totally periodic. I think it's periodic. Not only bolts. No, but you could. Wasn't there a condition on the radii that, you know. Yeah, the condition on the radii is this one. So the radius is. No, no, no, no, no. I'm saying on the fact that, you know, the whole. You know, the the holes are away with a certain distance. Ah, okay, so I have to confess that. Yeah, not too close, yeah. Okay, and so they were between, you know, the volts had between some epsilon and epsilon. Okay, I don't know. So maybe, okay, maybe I'm not mentioning this because after the right way. So it's so it was a bit more general. Okay, so then. So but I can say I mean for sure that whatever was available till now in the literature the micro theory of small gambling. Well she was just mentioning the the first time. She knows and then going yes to my short. I don't know much, but yes, okay. Okay, let me say that. I wanted to here to discuss the easiest case. First, for sure it's contained by yes, but yes, I thought that it was exact. was exactly the result and it is just okay good then let me just do a few remarks on this result so the the proof of this result is based on the construction of the so-called oscillating test functions basically on the construction of correctors which was inspired by the the tartar energy method so here basically the idea so it will be brilliant and slow so it's the idea so if this So, it's the idea. So, in this case, as I told you, so the compactness is completely trivial. What is difficult is to identify the limit problem. And what you would like to do is if you take a test function phi, so which is infinity compact support in D, which is a test function which works well for the limit on I don't know if I would in the previous slide. In the previous slide. Then, I mean, typically you would like to use this test function also for the P epsilon problem, but you can't because this is not permissible as a test for the P epsilon problem, because this doesn't vanish in the holes. So you want to correct this test function and to construct test functions, phi epsilon, which are of type phi times W epsilon, where W epsilon is the so-called correct. And this W epsilon, you want it to vanish on the boundary of the body. To vanish on the boundary of the poles. So, w epsilon will be equal to zero on the boundary of the union of these balls. Because there are simple algebra. But you also want, I mean, not to change too much somehow your test function, because you want in the end this to converge to fit in some way. And uh so this will be in a weak way as you can imagine. So you want this w So you want this W epsilon to converge to 1 in H1. And then you also want to construct it in a proper way so that you can maybe, I mean, you will get, when you test your equation with this particular test function here, you will get some extra term, which is the one giving rise to the extra term depending on the capacity. And hence you want to to be sure that you will construct this in a way that you Construct this in a way that you get convergence of this extra there. And as you maybe already, maybe you can see a bit two conditions, or maybe not. So this W epsilon reminds you a bit of capacitor function now, because it has to be boundaries, but then it has to converge to one in each one. And this is actually how you construct the discorectors, but this is the main part of the result of a Toranisco. Okay, so this is the typical way you prove it in the context of PDs. Okay, then let me remark something else. If we consider the case of radii, radius actually, I should say, because in this case the same, which is smaller than the one of uh choral risk for a mirror, you actually I mean the the holes are so tiny that you don't see any limit of uh function. limit function solves exactly the same equation as in the beginning, so there was an equation. On the other hand, if the holes are too large, so they are larger than the critical scaling, then actually you can prove that u epsilon converges strongly to zero in one. And this is a consequence of a concerned that you can write down in the domain the epsilon, where you can. The domain at the epsilon, where you can do the complication quite carefully and find that this is the constant in front, and the constant, the scaling of the Boca constant in this case. And this observation is due to a ler. And you see that if you are in this regime, this constant is going to zero. And since you can bound this ghana, it is written on a blackboard um by uh the H minus one norm of sign you are adjusted strongly to its. Strongly to its view. So, also in this case, the the limit problem is not interesting. And then, let me see whether there is here another. Mark, yes, this is the one I mentioned before. So, clearly, this result of Germany's conural was extended, was generalized over the years in many different directions by many others. I just mentioned a few, but there are many more, and also to the case. And also to the case of more general geometries, and for instance also to the case of volts, which are randomly distributed inside the domain, but are always well separated. Because basically you want to avoid the construction of correctors to break down roughly speaking. And in this talk I would like to to focus uh more on two um extensions. This result which well I mean uh These results, which were the most meaningful for us, for what we wanted to do. And one is a recent work of Julie, Heufer, and Velascas, and then an older result on Sinibra, which is to do with the result of Juliet Weufer and Belaskis, which is again for the Poisson equation, but in the means, which are very interesting. Very, very general. Per each other. Okay, and so this is the situation. So we are in a random setting, and so we introduce here a probability space and we will consider, so in this case, so the centers will not anymore be distributed Zm. So this V, this set of centers here, V was Zm before, but they are distributed according to a Poisson point process. So here, I mean, this is a I mean, this is countably many sectors which follow which are determined by a Poisson process with intensity lambda, which means, so this lambda is a positive number, which means basically that the average number of points which fall into a unit cube of order is that lambda sorry is the average number of points which fall into a unit cubic. And then we also assume that the risk And then we also assume that the radii of these balls are random variables. And for simplicity, at the moment, we are going to assume that these random variables are IRT, so independent and identically distributed. And at the moment, I'm also going to add this condition, which we'll explain in a second, but for the moment, notice that I'm requiring this integrability condition in the probability space for the array. So this just means. So this just means that and just requiring that the integral over the probability space of rho n minus 2 in dp is finite. Okay, so this is a stochastic infiltrability denomination. And I'm not saying we can meet anything else on the radiance, in particular the gamma power. So, in particular, they can be unbounded. So, the situation in this case can be the following one. So, the one depicted in this picture. So, actually, I mean, in this setting, if I'm going to remove balls, I mean, whose centers are governed by a Poisson process and whose radii just satisfy this integrability condition, this very low actual integrability condition, in this case, I can have actually. Case: I can have actually with probability one, both which overlap. So, as you can imagine, maybe already, so this can create a problem when you want to construct correctors because you don't know very well how to treat these clusters of points. In this case, this specific case of the Poisson point process, you can see, I mean if you don't know the processes, that actually the average distance between the centers of the poles is Of the poles is proportional to epsilon, this line and epsilon, and that their average radius scales like epsilon to the r. And so you can still consider these parameters as typical, let's say, this configuration, or almost surely you have these skills. Okay, then again, what I want to notice now with you is that if I choose art exactly as before, as in the periodic. As before, as in the periodic sampling. Actually, almost surely the limit capacity is well defined, it's a constant. And this comes from a computation which is very similar to the one that I thought above. You just fix the realization in the probability space, so it's only appear, and you compute this capacity since again the holes in general, I mean, almost surely are well separated from one another, so probably. From one another, so probability one, you can write down this capacity as the sum of the capacities of the bolts, of the single bolts. And then, since the radius scales like epsilon to the alpha, and you have chosen alpha, and this will be so this will be. And now you can pass to the limit here, but now appeal to the strong law of large numbers. So, and you get that almost surely this limit of this capacity density exists. Capacity density exists, it's well defined, and is given by Lambda in this case, which comes from Post-Opym process, and then the average expected value of rho to the n minus 2. So, before I make the periodical case, you have rho to the n minus 2 appearing. In this case, you have to take the average from this. So, the capacity in this case is well defined, and as you can see now, I mean this condition is basically the minimal one that you need. The minimal one that you need in order to have a well-defined capacity. So, this means that the limit problem is meaningful. So, it's very natural to ask, to understand whether the limit problem that we have seen basically in the periodic case, but now, where the capacity is given by this guy, is the limit problem in this for this configuration. And yes, sure. But somehow also But somehow also that almost the qualities has to be proved. I mean, not that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, but I mean, this is just into algorithm because I mean, this is the tapsrun and the balls are not much here actually. However, the fact that the capacity is well defined in this case and under this assumption doesn't mean at all that you can construct correctors in this case because you have to construct correctors basically here. So, however, this problem was solved, as I told you, by John Kiehufran Velaskets recently, a few a couple of years ago. And uh yes, sorry, last remark. Yes, last remark, but actually this is something that I said already were that I mean under this assumption, as you can see, well you are not requiring the radii to be bounded. So they can be unbounded. Clearly, I mean the radii times epsilon the radii can be unbounded by this guy here, which is the radius so n to the n minus 2 times the radius of this of the n. Two times the radius of this, and then actually you can prove that with probability one, this guy here is infinitely simple. So, this is how I'm not giving, but you can see this with the bored capabilities from large numbers. Okay, good. But we can have classes anyhow. Okay, and this is the theorem which was proven by John De Hufer and Villaskus, which is really, I mean, some it's I mean, it's very similar to the problem that we have seen in the periodic case, but this is an almost sure that convergence result, as you can imagine. So we work always for this choice alpha. And we have then the solution to this problem. So almost surely converge to a limit problem of this kind where the capacity here, density, Here, density, the average capacity density, is given by this function. Okay, so this is really, I mean, similar to the capacity to the term that we have seen before, only here you have an average. And this lambda is the average of the number of points falling in a very easy remark is that in the periodic case you take phi centers like Zn and Like Zn and random radii equal to wrong for every and for every realization, and you get that this kind is exactly the answer of Schwartz formula. Then, clearly, here, as I said already, so the proof I mean is based is again uh based on the existence of uh the correctors, of uh stochastic correctors. Of stochastic conductors, and you can prove that they exist almost surely in this kind of configuration of walls. And the key step here in this case is to prove that almost surely the regions where the perforation overlap have negligible capacity. Main result of July and Velasquez. So this is actually. Some percolation theory. And okay, so actually, the results are true for more general processes. You don't have to choose a post-somewhere process at identically independent and identically distributed reg, but you can take what is called a Markwell process, which is a double sequence of random variables. So, where this tree is the set of centers in R random variables of the radio, which are attached to every center. Are attached to every sector. I think these are called marks in this case. Important to know what is the definition of Mark and processes. However, you can do it processes. And in particular, what you need to assume here, what is very important, is that the centers are stationary and that they satisfy mixing conditions, strong mixing conditions, which is also quantitative. So basically, there So basically they have not the correlated disceptors as before as in the case of Poisson-Perl process, but they have a short-range correlation. Over large distances this is a distribution of parts decorated, but they will be the set of centers doesn't need to be accountable in general. Yes, it's countable. Yes, sorry, yeah. I think I said in the yes, sorry, in a point in a market point process, yes, phi is a countable set of centers. Yes, Ph. Of centers. Yes. Thank you for the question. And actually, also the radii, so they don't have to be independent, identically distributed, they can be correlated, but they have to be correlated to the large distances. Okay. And also in this case, I'm clear. This is something that we have observed already: that this condition, this stochastic integrability condition is the normal one. The Q that you there is this is I wrote a Q. I'm not a musician. Ah, sorry. It's uh two. So this is yes, it's a title for the next uh the next uh yes sorry, it's two yes, it's two. Okay, so okay, good. So let me go then to the problem I would like to to G Line cost us. And as you can imagine, this is a very And as you can imagine, this is a familiar uh let's say version of the joint year and Pelaska problem. So in our case we work directly with functionals because we want to use a method which is alternative to the one of constructing correctors for nonlinear let's say PDEs for certain near PDs at least. So we are going to consider an exponent q. This would be the growth An exponent q. This would be the growth condition of my energy. So before it was 2, and now it's q. And so my alpha has to be changed accordingly. So your n could be 2? Yes. Yes. Because before it was 3 or more. N was 3 or more. No, no, sorry, let me. Because your off was 2. Yes, because it is 2. Something like n minus 2. Yeah, because I mean, because that, I mean, because you have. Yeah, because I mean because that I mean because I mean you need your exponent to be smaller than n. So since the exponent before was uh two, then I had to get three. And then we are going to assume that I mean this these couples or the centers and radii are a marked point process. I mean I didn't give you an exact definition, but I mean we are in the assumption that we've seen introduced axis. So we can have a correlation. And again we are assuming this integrability of Assuming this integrability condition, where now we have n minus q instead of variables, and this is the domain that we are considering, so exactly the same of the risk and counters. Okay, and these are the functions that we are considering. So, we have an empty integral of some f of gradient of u over my randomly perfected domain, and so with the condition that u, the variable here, has to vanish in the set of this randomly distributed row. Of this element, the distributed holes. And on F, we are going to make very minimal assumptions, it just needs to be for any sort of and then you can assume without loss of generality that it vanishes at zero. And the growth conditions are of order q. And now, before giving you the statement of the gamma convergence result we can improve, I would like to somehow to explain. to somehow to explain to you what is the gamma limit of these functions in an intuitive way. First I will not write down something which might appear very confusing. And so let me consider now what I'm going to call here a typical annulus. And then I will explain in a couple of slides why this is typical. But the moment just a day. So I'm considering a perforation in my domain. My domain, and so this is a ball where the radius is the one. So this is epsilon to the alpha rho. Rho is a random variable. Here, my epsilon to the alpha is epsilon to the n over n minus q. And I'm going to consider a larger hole, a picture around this hole. And so this will have a radius which is proportional to epsilon. Okay so now also I mean I will I will tell you I mean later on why this is a typical situation in my case. And I'm going to consider a function which is equal to zero on the ball, so here. So my function B is equal to zero here and is equal to a constant here. So why a constant? We are going to see a dot one to be a constant and I didn't say this. Concept and I didn't say this, but this problem is also electronic because it's starting only in the stars. Okay, good. Okay. So now I'm defining a new function starting from this one just by a change of variables. I just want to go to the board of radius crop basically. And remember that this is a function of variable. So just making this a change of variables basically. And this is what happens to the energy. Happens to the energy inside that vacuum stare. So I'm just wrote here the energy, I'm changing variables, so I'm doing very trivial computations. Then I'm estimating this from below with the quasi-convex alphabet of F, because F is not quasi-convex, so I can estimate this in this way. And then I'm going to minimize this guy over all functions, so this, I mean, strange guy, so ep 0 to the q alpha times the positive of the. The Q alpha, and it's the positive number of this garden. So, this will have a fear in the garden. And now it's more clear why. I'm going to minimize this guy over all functions, which now are exactly equal to zero on a ball, which doesn't depend on epsilon anymore, but it depends on this random variable rho, so I'm set at zero, and then it will be equal to this constant z on a larger ball. Because I mean, this k here obtained by this change of variable equals to a single. Change of a requirement to pacify. So, something which really resembles the velocity of the hole in a rectangle. Okay, so just remember this very strange guy which appears here. So, and then in the next slide, I'm going to define function g epsilon, which is exactly the integral of that integral that we have seen before. So, it's the quasi-convex envelope of f scaled in this way. F scaling this way with epsilon to the alpha, alpha is that critical scaling and that's here to be compacted in this way, times f. Okay. Now, since f satisfies a close condition of order q and qf is quite half x clear by definition, then you can prove that this is logalidims, where this is standard, and then up to subsequences this converges point-wise. And so I can define. And so I can define a limit of this guy up to sub-sequences, and I will call this limit G. Clearly, if this function was Q homogeneous, I would not have any problems, any epsilon here, and I will not need to take this in this image only up to some signals. Okay, and now the guy, I mean, the fee that we have seen. The the guy, I mean the phi that we have seen in the previous slide, which depends on rho and on z. Uh so morally you pass to the limit in epsilon, and what you get is you get this limit problem, where I mean inside you replace your integral with the limit of this. The large amount of ball in the limit of this. And as you can see, I mean, this can be considered as a nonlinear capacity of the ball of radius rho P in R N. Of radius rho, p in Rn, and then with this Z means at infinity this decimal. Now where this G is exactly the integral here. If you take G equal to modulus of n squared, so this would be biominic capacity. Okay, good. Now this is still a random variable because rho is a random variable. So I'm going to take later on also the expected value of this random variable. But before I work, Random variable. But before, I would like you to notice that this guy here, I mean, the growth in rho, you can prove this very easy using the growth conditions, that this, I mean, is bounded from below and above by rho to the n minus q. So if I'm going to assume that the expected value of this uh random variable is finite, then also the expected variable the expected value of this random variable here will be finite, so it's quantified. 25. And then, actually, this will be a random value, so I'm going one bit quick, sorry, because you can prove that this guy is overly deep sheets in rows. So if you can compose if you want with a random parameter, this will be a random variable. Actually, so this guy here is well defined. And when I'm going, and this is what I'm going to call the V, because I'm averaging out dependence on rho, because I think average exactly, then Exactly. Then this guy, so when you is an LQ function, I can try to take all these two I explain as this form and the main sense is where defined under our assumptions. So our result is the following. So up to sub-sequences which come from the definition of G, so to deterministic sub-sequences, for P almost every realization, so almost surely you have a gamma convergence. So almost surely you have a gamma convergence of the functions that I was introduced before to this guy here, where you get a relaxation part, and the part which comes from the presence of the random perforation in the domain gives you exactly this guy here. Where I mean this is just the average number of or the average of the number of points falling in a unit cube, and this guy here is nodding to this time which I'm integrating. This way in which I'm integrating this building, but the expected value of the non-linear G capacity of the ball will be robbed in currently. So actually, this is a form of the gamma limit, which is somehow expensive. Is the number of centers falling in the unit cube, which are the same if you if even. Which are the same if you if even if organizationality Okay, so uh okay so clearly I mean you never see this in the deterministic uh periodic case because this is one okay good. So this is the gamma okay so the general I mean a few results in this a few sorry remarks on these results so the gamma convergence is the good So the gamma convergence is holds true only up to subsequences as I told you before, only because this G is defined up to subsequences. So it is not a problem of the method of proofless functions. Okay, good. Clearly, if you take F, which is equal to X to the Q, then you get G, which is equal to X to the US as well. And so in this case, you have convergence, for instance. I mean, for you. Just an example. For you. Just an example, and you can compute explicitly this feature that is this guy here. Okay, then what else? Yes, and clearly, I mean, since I started with a problem for proof that in certain cases, for instance, for f-convex and differential, just to make an example, you can deduce from the gamma-convergence the almost sure convergence of the solution. Solution of this other equation. So, this is a stochastic equation and this is a deterministic equation. And that's all we can. Okay, good. And clearly, if you take phi again equal to Zn and rho i equal to 1, for instance, then you will recover the result of a single process. So this is a generalization of that. I will give you some ideas of how to prove this result, or at least what isn't really new in this kind of result, but I would try not to be too technical. So what we would like to do, I mean, before implementing the construction that we had in mind, which really much resembles the one of Andrea and Nadia, is the following. Is the following. So, we would like to decompose our domain in this way. Basically, we would like to have three kinds of sets: the good balls, which are the red ones, with a bounded radius. I told you that the radii in general are not bounded. We want to consider the small balls. And these, I mean, good means that they are well separated from one another. And we decide for a threshold M and we want to take all the boards without whichever radius we. Without whichever radius, which is small enough. Then we have other good bolts, which are these blue ones, which means again that they are well separated, so they do not overlap with the red bolts, but the radius is too large for us. So at first, I mean, for the moment, we don't want to consider them. And then we have the clusters, yes, sure. Well separated means they are disjoint or that they are really distant? They are also distant. They are not only disjoint. There is, I mean, some space. In some space. So the blue have a large radius, and this means also that the distance from any other is comparable to the radius or something like that? No, I think, no, should I mean no, I think that they are they just I mean we just I mean fix uh some threshold and the problem that this uh blue ball set is just that they are the uh like the radius. So the distance is fixed. Yes, it's it's good. Yes, it's it's good. It's still I I will be more precise in a separate but yes yeah yeah but well separated means really that we have enough distance. Then we have some clusters which are nuclear here this cluster, this orange one. And we would like to have also a safety layer around this cluster. Actually here the safety layer seems to be a a curve surface if you want, but it's a n-dimensional feature. Is a n-dimensional picture for the picture in this way, also to max C. And we want actually these clusters to be also well separated from the good poles. I mean, this is an ideal situation that we have in mind. We would like our geometry to be this one for epsilon small and almost sure. And this is what the cluster looks connected, right? They could be disconnected. Yes, yes, it was yesterday. Yes, it was yes, my fantasy, yes, I draw the picture just yes. Okay. And this is, I mean, uh something which is a bit more precise, but not that much, otherwise the statement would be airy. So asymptotically, it's very, okay. So asymptotically, whatsoever, meaning for epsilon small, what you can prove almost surely is that you can really have this kind of situation. I mean, basically. I mean, basically, the statement that is written here, which is not very precise, means that with probability one, you have that kind of situation. And in particular, so you have that the capacity, the G capacity, so this non-linear capacity of the bed bolts of these clusters inside this safety layer goes to zero. So basically, this doesn't contribute in any way to the limit coverage of the gap. So it's not so. It covers the gram, so it's not so important what you do there in your constructions, you can get your details. Okay, so how? Why can I say something else? Okay, so this is one of the fundamental building block of our proof. And then, sorry, I mean here the slide is not so nice, but I mean, this is just to tell you that the second part, I mean, the second fundamental ah, sorry, answer. So the the the thing well separated means exactly that you can construct around your typical ball a ball with radius proportional to epsilon so that this annulus which I considered before is really typical. What happens? So once we have these kind of situations and this kind of wood bolts, in these good bolts we are going to perform a construction, which was the one suggested by sort of proposed by Andrea Proposed by Andrea and Nadia and Cini in their case, which basically has to do with the modification of every sequence. I mean, what you're going to use in the port, which converges quickly, you are going to modify it in a way that it really is equal to a constant on a certain sphere surrounding your hole. I want to make this heuristic. Heuristic computation that I've done in the beginning in the typical annulus really rigorous. And this is what this lemma, what this lemma is about. And this will be performed only in the good pods, actually. Okay, then I'm almost done. Sorry. So the last, the very last building block, if you want, is a discrete approximation of the capacitor. That's how we're recognizing. Capacitary, how we reconstruct the capacitor. And so, the statement is the following one: is again a stochastic statement, something that we can reconstruct almost surely. And again, these sums are taken only on the good balls. And to prove this approximation, this discrete approximation of the capacitor data, and so we use heavily the composition of the domain, the joining lemma of none. Glamma of Nadia and Andrea in the set of good balls and the strong law of large numbers for market point processes which can be correlated. So it's not the standard strong law of large numbers because typically that one is stated for random variables which are independent and actively distributed. In this case they will be correlated, but I'm they are short. Short range correlation. So, this is something all I wanted to say. And yes, and also for space-debanded marks. So, it's a bit difficult to put this result, but these are all the ingredients. Then I'm going to skip this and then we just finish with some future plans. So, things that we plan to do next with costs and illusion. Clearly, we would like to prove some quantitative result. So, we would like to see whether we can say something on the rate of conversion. Whether we can say something on the rate of convergence of the solutions. And this might be possible in some cases for someone in the integral spec convex with some other assumptions, because actually there is also a quantitative version of the result of Juli Heufer and Gilaskets. Then we would like to do this in the free descriptive functional in the spirit of the work of Mateo Fogarty and Aristi Langi. And then we would like to. And then we would like to do the elasticity case where I mean random perforated domains means that you have no minimum boundary conditions, so yet the situation is different because it's the compactness is the issue. You have to extend your function in a suitable way inside this domain when you have also overlapping regions. And then in the case of the stop presentation. Okay, so thank you very much, Lucy. Seems to me that your result is pretty local. I would say that you need it. No, we need it. We use it in. Now I'm thinking actually about our proof and that we use stationary in several places. Now, I mean, if one could prove to the I mean, if one could prove the result. I mean, could you not just, if you have like a, it's non-local, let's say different, it looks different in different parts of the domain, your process. So let's say you distribute, so you choose lots of holes onto the left side but not the right. I mean, it looks like your result is pretty local. If you just make everything on X. But you know what, I mean, I understand your point. It might be about it. But I mean. About it. But I mean, there are some stochastic results that we have to prove. I mean, purely stochastic stuff, like this law of large numbers in our setting for correlated stuff. And there we use it quite heavily. So that has nothing to do with the construction of the holes, but I mean, we take some random variables satisfying certain assumptions, and among these assumptions, stationarity, and we are able to prove certain things. So this is really with the fact that you really characterize the limit with. Characterize the limit with a precise number, which is the limit. So the proof maybe is completely different, Frank and I don't know. Is this related with what Guy was saying, that there are these general results in compactness? For example, take whatever set of measures that Galma's mod converge to some other measure. This Galma small means that the problem related associated to the Related associated to the Laplace, but the Laplace converge. And then you get that all other nonlinear problems, there are several results of Casado Dio, myself, Dan Paso, and Mira, all other problems converge to the corresponding. Yeah, but then some other ideas that you tested with some out the lablage. with uh some outer laplation with laplash and then uh you recover uh the non-linear general setting starting from that uh okay it can be so maybe this is possible so this i have a suggestion because uh similar phenomena uh where is a capacity enter in the moment uh when you have a fiber uh reinforced structure with fiber so it is pretty So it is pretty modeled, but if you cut, it's like a cut, you have like a self-defense, and you have diffusion with these fibers, and you have this capacity coefficient which makes a connection between if you speak o about it equations, you have to to differentiate some. Different temperature is a fiber, and I would say that the fiber. And the coupling is better to make you temperature stretching. Just a suggestion. You have also in electromagnetism, you instead of allopathic pressure, you have always Laplace equation, you put Albert's equation. So you have a frequency, and it's important phenomena because the strange terra. So this cummer gives birth to effective optic in nano-photonic is important because you have a effective matter with a negative uh diffraction or a negative uh permanent. Yeah, yeah, this I can image, yes, there are there are a lot of things to do. Yes, but I will think about this. Since now I'm just thinking about my proof, I don't see. So, because in that general uh framework or in the the general uh sequence of measures, so in particular a general uh distribution of of uh uh bones uh whatever. Balls, or whatever. Uh, there is an extension of this uh corrector uh uh strategy which is uh somehow solving a uh a PDE associated to that distribution of problems, which is not like the one you were mentioning, which is completely local construction, but that is a global construction which is associated to the given sequence of measures. So maybe the
