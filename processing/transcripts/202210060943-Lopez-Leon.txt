Inviting me to participate in this workshop. I would have loved to be there with you, but I couldn't make it this time. Anyway, I'm very happy to see many friendly faces on the screen. So today I'm going to tell you about the problem of filling a sphere with a layered liquid crystal. But right before that, I will adjust to okay. That's a little bit. Okay, I have to click. Yeah. So what Yeah, so I just wanted to introduce myself for those who don't know me, myself and my lab. So I work at ESPCI in Paris in a lab that is called Goodiver. Goodiver is a lab that gathers many PIs and we are some of us experimentalists, others are theoreticians, and we work on topics that are very diverse. Some people work on robotics, other ones work on protein evolutions. Evolutions, and so there is a quite a variety of research topics in the lab. And so, in my group, we work in what we have called topological soft matter. And the idea is to use geometry and topology to control the structure of matter. We are interested in systems that are able to self-organize, and we study how this intrinsic order of the material is influenced by the geometry and topology of the space in which. Geometry and topology of the space in which the system is embedded. So, we work with different types of building blocks. In all cases, they are elongated objects that can spontaneously align parallel to each other and form liquid crystalline phases under certain conditions of temperature and concentration. And so, in the past, we have worked mostly with passive liquid crystals, which are made of these synthetic molecules. And more recently, we have started. And more recently, we have started to study building blocks that are active, actually, that are able to transform chemical energy into motion. And we have worked with two type of active building blocks, so biofilaments and bacteria. And so the biofilaments that we use are microtule bundles. And these microtule bundles, when you confine them to an oil-water interface, they form a interface they form a nematic phase and so in contact with molecular model this active nematic this this nematic becomes active so they disturb they move they have a spontaneous motion and the the dynamics and structure of these materials is controlled by the motion of topological we also study bacteria so liquid crystalline suspensions of bacteria and here we study And here we study how the swimming mechanism of the bacteria is affected by the elastic anisotropy of the liquid crystal. And we study also the collective effects that emerge when these bacteria interact with a network of topological defects. So to confine our systems, we use mostly two methods, either microfluidics or 3D printing. And in this way, we can create droplets that can be spherical or that can have more exotic shapes. Can have more exotic shapes, they can be ellipsoidal, they can have handles, and we can also make films that are flat or that can be also spherical in the case of a shell. And this actually, these liquid crystalline shells is the system that we have studied the most because, as I mentioned already, they're very nice platforms to experimentally study fundamental questions regarding topological defects and geometrical frustration. So we have worked with many different phases. So Lisa presented the cholesterol phase at moderate anchoring condition and how we can observe all these nice spread patterns. At a stronger anchoring condition, we can observe topological solitons, which are cholesterol structures that are embedded in a radial director field and that behave like solid particles. We've seen different types of cholesterol. We've seen different types of cholesterol fingers, spherical torons, and we have been studying how we can induce interconversions between these different kinds of solids and also how they interact with each other and crystallize on the surface of the shell. We have also studied nematic shells, smectic shells, and today I'm going to tell you about the nematic smectic phase transition and how it happens in the curve space of a shell. Of a shell. So the shell is going to impose global topological constraints because it is spherical and local geometrical frustration because of its Gaussian curvature. And the topological constraints are going to lead to topological defects in the director film, mostly. And the geometrical frustration is going to be especially relevant in the case of the layering of the semantic layer. We have already said. We have already said many times how these smectic faces are really much more constrained than nematic faces because they cannot twist, they cannot bend. So, in the spherical space of a well, the spherical, this curved space of a shell, so if we want to respect this constraint, we need to induce additional topological defects in the director film. And so, the question is: what features of the nematic phase are perceived? Features of the nematic phase are preserved during the phase transition, and what type of new defects do we expect to see? So, to answer this question, so we used HCV that has an asthmetic phase transition at 33.5 degrees. We created the shells using double emulsions as we have already seen. So, for the in this shell we use PVA, which imposes planar anchoring. Which imposes planar anchoring to the shell. So we always worked in a situation where we had strong planar anchoring. And to control the thickness of the shell, we used osmotic swelling after the production of these double emotions. And so in the nematic phase, we observed three different types of diffused structure with tetrahedron, triangular, and dipolar symmetries. And these differ structures result from the Structures result from these global topological constraints that I mentioned. They are given by the Poincare theorem that basically said that any spherical nematic field necessarily has defect and a number of defects such that if you add up their charges, you get plus two. So here you can see the simplest configuration where you have two plus one defects at the bules and the director field is aligned along Mary. director field is aligned along meridians. This configuration is maybe the simplest one, but not the one that is minimal in energy. The one that is minimal in energy is this one that is reminiscent of a baseball. And here you have four defects of charge plus one half that are organized in a tetrahedral way. So if we come back to the experiment, what we observe is the ground state of the system, but also two metastable states. This one is the one that I just mentioned with bipolar. One is the one that I just mentioned with bipolar symmetry. And we also observe a hybrid configuration that combines plus one half defect and plus one defects. So are those configurations compatible with smectic texture? Well, we said that in the smectic phase, we don't want to have band. So that means that the director field needs to be aligned along geodesics. This is the case here, but not here. Then actually, so. Actually, so theory predicts this configuration for a bidimensional smectic shell. This configuration is very similar to the bipolar pneumatic bipolar one, with the difference that here the molecules are also organized into layers. And it happens that this configuration is energetically equivalent to a series of other configurations that result from the following operation. So you take the shell and you split it into two. And you split it into two by using a plane that contains these two defense. And then you rotate one half of the sphere with respect to the other by an angle that can take any value. And what you get is this. You get a configuration in which you have four one-half defects that are lying on a great circle of the sphere. So far, so good, but the frustration in the semantic layering The smectic layering really arises when you expand this texture to the third dimension. So, as the smectic layers grow from the inner surface to the outer one, so they become wider, so they have layer dilation. And we have seen that this costs a lot of energy. There is a possibility of, so we can kind of compensate the difference in surface between the inner and outer sphere by adding this location. This is another option, but this also has an energy penalty. But this also has an energy penalty, and we can also make a geometrical construction where we don't have layer dilation or dislocation, but we have anchored violation, which again has an energy penalty. So what is the minimum energy? What is the solution? Let's say the solution that costs less energy, the minimum energy configuration for a smectic shell that has certain thickness. Certain thickness. Well, to study this, we did the experiments. So we started with shells that were quite thick, actually. And so in these thick shells, you can see the same three structures that I just mentioned with four, three, and two defects. But here you can see that all the defects appear confined at the top of the shell. This is just because the shells, when they are thick, they are also very heterogeneous in thickness. We have already mentioned that this is because of buoyant. Already mentioned that this is because of buoyancy, but also because of the elasticity of the pneumatic, and so the defect will confine to the thin part of the shell to minimize energy. So that's the reason why you see all the defects confined at the top of the shell. So this is our starting point. So we considered a shell with four defects, one half, and we decreased temperature toward the asthmatic phase transition. And so, something important to say is that you have to do this cooling down of the sample very carefully. You need to have a precision of at least 0.01 degrees, otherwise the system doesn't go through equilibrium state. You get trapped into metastable state and you don't see what I'm going to show you now. So, we did it carefully. And then, what you observe is that the defects associate themselves by pairs three and four and one and two. So, if you look And one and two. So, if you look at three different three and four, you will see that they stay more or less where they are at the beginning of the process. While defect one and two, they start moving apart. You see, they are moving apart until at some point they reach the equator. When they reach the equator, then if three and four start moving away from each other as well, and eventually they also reach the equatorial plane. So, at the end of the process, Plane. So at the end of the process, when we get the semectic phase, we have the four defects on a great circle, as expected and predicted by the theory. So why these two pairs of defects behave so differently? I mean, we have this asymmetry in their behavior. Well, there were a few propositions to explain that. And in the end, we demonstrated in collaboration with the group of Slava and Zumer in Jublana. And Zumer in Jubliana, they did the simulations. We demonstrated that it is due to the elastic anisotropy that emerges when you get close to the semectic phase. And so you know that the K3 diverges while K1 doesn't. And this makes that band distortion becomes very, very energy costly. So the fact of keeping two defects at the top of the shell makes that you can confine all Makes that you can confine all the band distortion in this thin area of the shell, and this is energetically favorable. Okay, now let's see the symptom picture that you get in the shell. So, what you can see here is a top view of the shell, and here is a view of the shell from the bottom. The top part of the shell is thinner, and the bottom is thicker. And you see the four defects that are inherited from the nematic phase, but you also From the nematic phase, but you also can see lines, lines that connect the defects by pairs and that divide the shell yes into crescent-like domains. So three and four are connected by line that run on the thinner hemisphere of the shell, while defects one and two are connected by lines that run on the thicker hemisphere. And so this generate two sets of lines that are orthogonal with respect to each other. With respect to each other. And if you come back to this operation that I mentioned here, it means that you have rotated one half of the shell with respect to the other one by an angle of 90 degrees. So we investigated the origin of these lines by putting the sample between cross-polarizer and rotating it. And in the end, what we observed is that the directory is tilted with respect to this line by a constant angle of 13 degrees. Angle of 13 degrees and the director tilts in opposite directions into adjacent domains, which means that these lines are curvature ones. And so they are curvature ones that produce this undulation of these meticul layers. So it's actually kind of a healthy choral and stability. And what we see also is that Also, is that inside these domains we have a stripe pattern? And this stripe pattern produces due to the fact that we have secondary curvature walls that provoke this modulation of the layers. So these curvature walls are actually a way to concentrate all the dilation in a small area, right? And this is something that you can see in this schematic. This is a geometrical model. In this schematic, this is a geometrical model that we proposed in which you have layers that undulate, and the amplitude of the undulation increases as we move from the inner to the outer sphere of the shell. And so in this constitution, the shell, so the spontaneous layer thickness D, is preserved everywhere except at the curvature ones. And you have also an effective layer thickness, D prime. Layer thickness, D prime, that depends on this tilt angle. And the tilt angle will vary from zero on the inner surface to phi at the outer surface. And you can actually calculate the angle, the tilt angle that you need to compensate the difference in surface between the inner and outer spheres. And if you take into account the geometry of the shelves that we used in the experiment, the value is 15 degrees, which is actually close to the 13 degrees. Close to the 13 degrees that we measured experimentally. So, in this geometrical model, you have dilation, but the dilation is not everywhere, it's concentrated at the curvature bones. You have also some anchoring violation. So what you can see here, this dot line represents a smet layer on the inner surface of the shell. And this solid line represents the same asthmatic layer on the outer. Layer on the outer sphere of the shell. And if you look at three points, reference point P1, P2, and P3, which are at the middle of the layer on the inner sphere, you will see that as the layer grows, these points need to shift. They shift in this direction here and in this direction here, which means that the layer is tilted. As you can see here, these are a cross-section of the layers at these three planes. So the layers are tilted, and since they are tilted, they are. Are tilted, and since they are tilted, the anchoring here is also violated. So, with this model, geometrical model, you have some layer dilation, some anchoring violation as well. But the anchoring violation that you have here is much less important than the one that you have in the model. I mean, this construction that I showed to you before, where you didn't have any curvature ones. And we also could have this location, although we are not able to see them optically, but they could be there because it has. Optically, but they could be there because it has been demonstrated that this dislocation relaxes the energy of the walls, especially when you have walls that create a lot of distortion. So, it seems that these curvature walls are a way to resolve the problem. So, the solution of the problem is a combination of these three limit cases. You have a bit of layer dilation, a bit of anchoring dilation, and maybe some dislocation. Dilation and maybe some dislocation as well. And it seems that this combination seems to be this, you know, the solution that ignites energy. But the problem is not solved, of course. So in a recent paper, Christophe Blanc has proposed a model, so another geometrical model in which he allows these layers to be curved so they can have an S shape. And in that case, you don't have anchoring violation, you only have dilation in the curvature once. And if you calculate, In the curvature once, and if you calculate the energy, you get a value that is lower than the one that you have in this model. So it's an improvement from this simple geometrical construction. But again, the problem is not solved and we need simulations. So yesterday I arrived too late, so I couldn't see the talk by Apana. So I just saw the very end of the discussion, and I could see very nice simulations. And I could see very nice simulations of this smectic shell. So I think we need to discuss to see if there are things that we can understand from this simulation. I'm sure we can. But anyway, so okay, so this structure here, of course, is very sensitive to the thickness of the shell. If you increase the thickness of the shell, you increase the separation between curvature walls. You also increase the distortion induced by these curvature walls. By these curvature walls. And even further, we see that if the shell is thin, you only have primary curvature walls. But if the shell become thicker, you can have secondary curvature walls, as I mentioned before, and you can even have tertiary curvature walls. So it seems that the dilation in this metric is expelled from the volume to the surface, and from the surface to the curvature walls, and from the primary curvature walls to the secondary ones, and from the secondary to the tertiary. And from the secondary to the tertiary, in a kind of a cascade of energy dissipation. So, this result that I have shown to you now are actually results that we obtained a few years ago. And so, I would like to show you some of the new things that we are doing that are actually related with this neck issuance, just to give you a savor of the things that we are doing. So, I said before that you have to be very Before that, you have to be very careful when you control temperature in this nematic smectic phase transition, otherwise, you get weird things. And this is one of the things that you can see if you change temperature very fast. So, here you have the shell. You will see that at some point in the shells, the shell becomes unstable. So, and yes, it breaks. It breaks and it forms a droplet that is not spherical, that is ellipsoidal. This is something, so this movie, we got it with a So, this movie, we got it with a fast camera. So, this happens very fast, of course. But this allows us to see how the double motion breaks, and you can see also how is the shape of this rocket that is ellipsoidal. This ellipsoidal shape is metastable state, but it lasts very long time, like a few days. And we believe that, so when we saw the first time we saw that, we were very surprised because when you make droplets of SCV, they are spherical. You can make them with microfree disc. You can make them with microfletties, you can make them by shaking, and in all cases, they are spherical. And what we think is that you know this ellipsoidal shape is a way to preserve the layer structure that the smectic had in the shell geometry. And so we have used these smectic droplets to control the dynamics of active nematic. And so I'm going to show you this. So when you confine the active nematic, When you confine the active pneumatic to an oil-water interface that is flat, and so the active nematic is in contact with two fluids that are isotropic, you don't have lateral confinement in the system. What you get is this one, is this thing. What you get is many defects that move in a random way that induce this chaotic dynamic in the system. Now, if you take this active nematic and you confine it to the surface of this ellipsoidal smetic droplet, this is where you. Droplet, this is what you see. First thing, you observe only four defects, only those defects that are topologically required. And secondly, you observe a dynamic that is very regular. You observe oscillations with a very well-defined frequency between a rotational regime and a translational regime. And so, and this very, this periodic dynamic results from an interplay between the viscous anisotropy of the smectic phase and also the Gaussian curvature. And also the Gaussian curvature of the ellipsoidal problems. So, I don't have the time to tell you more about this, but if you're interested in these things that we are studying, please let me know and I can tell you more about this or send you Son of Powerworks. And with this, I reach the end of the presentation. Just let me okay. To thank the students that had been working on those questions, mostly Guillain Dure, who was working. Mostly Guillaume Duret, who was working on cholesterol faces and a bit on dysmectic phases as well, and all my collaborators, and of course, you for your attention. Thank you. Much we have time for questions. In the last thing you showed with the activity math on the ellipsoid. On the ellipsoid, do the defects seem to self-propel like the TV picture to cause that defect to move in the comic direction? I'm very sorry, but I hear extremely bad. I don't know why I have echo. So can somebody that is closer to the microphone repeat the question? Dan's question is on the ellipsoids in the active system, do the positive defects still move in their polar direction as they do in two. Their polar direction as they do in 2D films. So, what we observe is that the positive defects go to the poles, they are attracted by the poles, and you can see the probability of finding the defect at the poles is larger than in the rest of the ellipsoid. But what we observe is also that at the ellipsoid, when they are at the ellipsoid, they rotate. And this rotation aligns the director, and this aligned state is unstable and generate bending instability that makes that the defects move from one pole to another one. Move from one pole to another one. So we observe attraction toward the poles, but this situation is not stable, and the defects are continuously exchanging poles. I don't know if I answered your question. You did even better. Den said, you did even better. Any other question? I can repeat it from here to there. Well, I have a question. When you have the shells, which are not all of uniform thickness, so do you, if the shells are thin enough, can you see dislocations around the, let's say, as this as the shell increases the thickness in the asthmatic phase, or are they too thick? In the spymactic phase, or are they too sick anyway to see that? Yeah, these locations we didn't really see them when they're very thin. I can show you actually when they're very thin. I think I have a slide here. Let me check. Yes, this one. You see, this is a shell that is extremely thin. This is how they look like. Here, yeah, it's difficult to say. You see the curvature was sometimes there. So I think it. Sometimes they are so. I think it is sometimes difficult to say when the shells are very thick. You can see sometimes focal conic domains, that for sure. And yeah, sometimes you can see imperfection defects in the curvature walls. So in the stripe pattern that they produce, like here, you can have some dislocation here in this case, but it's not very. Uh, in the in this case, but it's not very clear. Yes, um, when you have these um ellipsoidal semantic problems, do you kind of have some variety which kind of includes a spherical tools, right allocations? And on what does this depend? So, can you elaborate a bit? Yes, yes, we this is something interesting. Yes, we this is something interesting. We observe different kinds of asper ratios. Okay, there it's here. So, um, the asper ratio can change quite a lot, and it depends on the shell thickness, actually. Thinnest shells give ellipsoid and droplets that are more elongated than thicker ones. And also, the way in which let's put the movie again, because this is something actually, Odyssey is not published, something that we, I know. Something that we, I know, it's not, sorry, it's not here. It's here. Okay. If you look at it, if you look at it, it seems that you have a hole in the thin part of the shell, and then you have, you know, the shell like bent inwards to produce kind of a roll. I don't know if you see what I mean. That in that case, you have this kind of bending like this, and this gives this. And this gives this elongated ellipsoid and droplet. But you can also have another situation where you break again in the thin part of the shell, and then you get something that is like, you know, like a ball. And in that case, the ball will shrink and become something that is again ellipsoidal, but with a smaller aspiration. So it depends on how thin the shell is and how it breaks. And usually, thin shells break. And usually, thin shells break in the way that I say that they kind of bend inwards. While thicker ones, they do this thing that I said, that you have this bulb that shrinks and gives you the lip so it don't droplets. Any other questions? So, if not, let us thank Therese again. Thank you.
