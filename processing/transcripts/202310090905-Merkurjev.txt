Nines visit this beautiful place. So, about Massey Provok, I'm supposed to give some introduction for the second talk. Massey, some time ago, 1958, introduced the notion of massive product. After this, it was generalized and applied. And replied by topologists, gives a declaration on the comology of topological space, allows to distinguish between different topological spaces. And in algebra, it was adapted by Buyer in 1955, and that's exactly. Special case of massive product I'm going to talk about. So the setting is the following. You have a prime number fixed and integer n at least two. We introduced the following groups, mu and plus one. This is the group of all upper triangular matrices of the zm or pz. Of PZ 1 and diagonal 0 of blow is a subgroup of G L N plus 1 of all the Z multiplies. So this group has a center, very small one, sequential to further P. Our face is. Of maintenance of the phone that you have in the top right corner, anything and zero everywhere else. And using the factor group A n plus one measure of the center, we call it u n plus one bar. So we can view an element of u n plus one bar as a matrix with the top As a matrix with the top right corner removed. So we have the following sequence of subjective polymorphisms. The first one from u n plus 1, from n plus 1 r, first economical one, and the other one from z1 pz to the n. We forget all elements, but the ones But the ones over the deck. So u, let me close them, q, 1, 2, q, 3, u, n, n plus 1. So this is the almost. Now comes the provincial loop gamma. Eventually built the absolute Gauler group for fields. And we look at H1 of gamma with coefficients in Z mod PZ for the trivial action. Because this is just a group of all continuous homomorphisms from gamma to G morphism. And suppose we are given n characters or n per cycles. One per cycles. Chi one, chi two, chi n Well, those defining homomorphism from gamma to write loop here given by these tuple of characters. And then we look for the need to resolve. This chi tone homorphism from gamma tool you and From gamma tone, you n plus one byte, control by. But such liftings may not exist, or you can get several liftings. And now I would like to understand when such a lifting, if any, extends to an homomorphism row from m to gun plus one. Okay, any robot can be also built as a matrix one row one two bar, row one to three bar row one n bar and then dismissing one out. Dismissing corner row 2n plus 1 and so on row n plus 1 bar 1 where the entries row ig bar are just maps from From 1 multi Z mod to Z just one per chains. Very few of them are on one characters. Exactly those with an equality character. And with one over, they're equal to any characters by I because then it's going to be So this is a general form of gifting, it should be a homomorphic gift. And then we would like to see when it extends to row. So to the extent So, to extend to the robot arrow, you need to fill this square. And let us put function eta to this square and see what condition should hold for this square. So, rho, when you plug in eta, should be an honor. So, the only condition you need to satisfy is that the first rho uh times the last poem should be equal to. Energy here for the product of two elements. So you pick two elements, x and y, in gamma, and you multiply a rho of x, rho, without what means, when you put a times well, rho of xy row of x times rho of y. And we write this condition for the right one. So eta of xy should be equal to, so the first, on the first row and on the right home, it is theta of x, height of light, plus, and then we have a sum of. We have the sum of probabilities. So here we have the sum over all i from t to n rho 1 i bar of x rho i n plus 1 bar of y n plus the last term when you did catalog x times 1. So a row bar leads to a row if and only if there exists data such that it's called for every x and y. Well, let's denote the sum by delta overall y. Of xy. So it's a function on two variables. And one can check that in a function on two variables, it is a two-pacy. G2, gamma, za, g. It follows from the fact that rho bar is a common. So when we write this as follows. So let me write this as follows. The cycle delta is equal to eta of xy minus eta of x minus eta of y. Well, this is in fact the boundary of eta. Well, strictly speaking with negative sign, but I With negative sign, but I want to ignore the sign. Boundary of design is just the decoration of x, y. So the equivalent condition, finally, okay, robar lives to come if and only if pass. Pass of delta of rho line zero in the second management H2, nana, and two models. So this delta of robot can be used as an abstraction of lifting robot. Okay. Okay, now we are ready to introduce mass products. So we have P fixed, we have N fixed, we have loop gamma fixed, and we have characters. I want you to put that. I recall that those are Very cool that those are elements of page one, which are simply our monophysics from without loop gamma to simulate. So the mass product of these parameters is not an element of anything, it's just a subset of the second homology. It consists of all Homology consists of all abstractions, classes of delta of rho 1 for rho rho 1 over pi. So this is a subset of H2 gamma z. Take all the abstractions for all possible liftings probar of I and see whether those can be lifted. The set could be empty or contain many elements. So we say that the master product, so it's called the master product. The mass product is defined if the set is non-elective. And non-lifting means that at least one robot exists. So high means at least one lifting. It means at least one lifting towards from gamma to the middle group lifting robot over and we say that massive robot is the vanishes. If zero Zero and is contained in this concept. In other words, one of the abstractions in this set is zero. So there exists a bar over time that extends to some row. The two of some row. But since every row restricts to some robotic, it's the same to say that if and only if there exists row over chi. So you can lift high just to row. So chi can be lifted to rowbar and you can lift so that rowbar lifts row. That robot used robot. It was not a robot. Of course, uh when uh master product if is f arrangement is defined. Okay. Well, let's do the simplest example where n is the smallest possible number, it's two. So we have two characters, R1 and character two, and row one is what we formulate one by one row two and some well we call it Some, well, we call it row. Row bar is just this one. And eta, which you plug in here to get wrong, satisfies the condition that the boundary of eta is i1 approved at this item. So you see that the So you see that the massive product is always defined in that case simply because in this case the book USD bar and this one are the same. 50 US trivial and benches Vanishes different from me, the cut product is zero. Okay, now let us assume that m is a two-state. And I would like to consider the following three properties for the two-point parameters. The first property that this might Yeah, that this must product the remote support is product the A M. Our PM that mass product is defined. And my connection, Cm, is that the cup products chi i times chi i plus 1, all 0 in H2, all i from long dependent. Well, as I told you, that A n implies B n, and in fact, B n implies C n. Where is this? If you take If you take a matrix in Pn plus 1 bar without this connect or bar, you look at some i and take the place where you have character ii, ii plus 1 somewhere, and the corresponding 3 by 3 matrix. So this corner doesn't hit this one because Polar doesn't hit this one because n is 3. And you see that one as an robot from 1 to u n plus 1 bar, then can be composed with the restriction to 3 by 3 square. Restriction to the 3 by 3 squared is a home market, which gives you a m to u 3, which means that the Two plus the product chi i, comma chi i plus one is two eventions. But then the cap product is zero. And that's exactly the statement. So that's why cup products are close consecutive characters two. So these are the three properties. So these are the three properties, which makes sense for M of equals to P. Now we have uh removed the case when gamma is the gamma for P. So every And it's assuming that P is different from P is number one is different from the characteristic of F and also we assume that F contains primitive road of unity of unique value. In this case we can identify this in this road Z multipli Z infinity MP. And in this case, H1 F Z mod P is x time of squares of these cores. So that any character is given by an element A in the field, so we call it x chi A. Any character of the score. Any character of this form. So instead of writing IA1, I A2 and so on, for the master product, we will write simply A1, A2, AN for N tuple of elements of the multi-PTP group. And the mass product used in H2. This in H2, in this case in the p-part of the problem. So the mass product is a subset of the P. And uh chi I chi A times. A times cap product with square B is just the class of the cyclic algebra. It's going to be denoted by AB. Cyclic class of cyclic algebra of the DP. Okay, and now I would like to rewrite those conditions. Those conditions. Erase the irrigate 1 A2AN A1 A2AN and then use simple algebra's AI, AI plus 1 algebra. But if you take a present in perpetuity group gamma, then it is not true that Pn implies A. Cn implies Pn. By the way, the only case when something closes of P3 is the same as A C3, which we will see soon. CZ, which you want to see soon. But there are implications for it. But I will keep younger. But it was noticed by Hopkinson different A3 is a very good thing. K3 is equivalent to P3 if P is 2 and F is a number field. I'll shortly after minimising pen prove that it is true for anything. Prove that it is true for any field. Cool p equals to and Minister proposed the following conjecture which we call the Maisie-Wenishing conjecture. Uh Maisie-Wenishen conjecture, say M. conjecture, say M that A M is equivalent to Bf for every N, these three, and for every P and for every fee. So this is yes, and then again shortly after that, this conjecture was proven in the case. Prove in case the chemical state. So, Efrad and Manzi. And also, Minaj and Tan approved this for any processing and when I would be RTF. And in the next talk, Frederica will tell you about the next case due to Federica and me, some recent report that MBC holds for N equals 4N P equals anything. What's the meaning of this concern? Suddenly I give some restrictions on the homology of absolute dollar group. Well, I didn't see it, so gamma is gamma F is the dollar group of the separate order of F over F. So we have a constraint on the homology input of the absolute Gala field, and some of them we know. For example, we know that epsilon Gala group cannot be finite except Trivial 1 and 6 to 1. Minner uh a lot of better conjecture proved by Wywotsky and Ross tells us that the homology is very special, generated by is very special, generated by the first component with relations in the second degree. So it's a quadratic alternative. So that conjecture, if true, gives us additional constraints on the homology of the assumption about uh Ross affinity is not necessarily the results you you can Research we can extension so we can make a block up. I mean it requires either uh roots of unity or just if you want zero pz roots of unity. Okay. Now Well, I would like to prepare for this week's lecture and to give a proof of this result for any cost signal. And this is essentially due to what Maxwellian image. So, are you going to prove that AB is true into BCD and in fact true and to CC? The only thing we need to prove is this integration. So we have three elements in the field, let's call them ABC. And we assume that AB is 0 and B C is 0. And we need to show that A3 holds. In other words, the IC product, ABC vanishes. Okay. Well, those conditions tell us that the cup product chi i times chi B is a boundary, co boundary as well as ID times There is a beat type space for some core chains to the number. So let's look at the following matrix for all 1, well, pi A, 1 pi B, 1, Ti C, 1, 0, then Adam and M. Well, if you restrict this matrix to this 3 by 3 pointer, it is a homomorphism. Because it's a big homomorphism, just you willn't satisfy this condition. Similarly, distinction to the other three by 3 corner is homomorphic. By blue and these things, we see that it's homomorphism if you ignore the homogeneous. So, by the way, we proved B3. So, we proved that C3, so those conditions give us at least one robot is called. But then we need to meet one of the robots, not just this one, it's another one, two robots. And we remember that the abstraction delta of Of the code I is given by the following to pass i, I times mu by A times mu plus atom times I c in the barrel loop. Well, I A is a character, so it's a quanca cycle, as well as Chi C. One caseycle as well as phase. Mu may not be a character, this is just one for chain. So it's not, just the first term is not a kupacycle, as well as the second term. But together they're this is a cascade. Actually, it's easy to see it. You apply delta to boundary to delta of rho one and then you get delta applied to this one, this cycle. So it will be another inverse of the negative sign appears. Negative sign appears, maybe for the next term. I times delta of mu plus of h minus because delta of atom times chi h c. That is B times I D times Chi C and that is chi A times chi D is zero. So again, the total thing is a took aside. Total thing is a two-pacer, but it's not. Well, that's well, you see that if you take the multi-symmetric extension, I call it FAC, which is just FA1 over T, C1 over P. And both one cascades chi A and Chi C are split by this bicyclic extension. Piscitic extension. And therefore, delta of rho r the brower class is big by the high speed extension. Well, let us assume that this class of the corresponding central symbol algebra is decomposable. What it means? That it can be written in the form of the sum of two cyclic classes. The first one is A times, J, E. The last one is F times C. We keep the same for C, but E and F, some other elements will become the cold solution was decomposable. So they basically extension. Or, equivalently, you can write this. Or equivalently you can write this as chi A times chi E plus chi F times H plus in this case both summons are cycles, equals. So you have this same case written in two forms and you take the difference. Different with zero. Zero means tiny times times mu minus chi E plus theta minus chi F times Chi C okay and now we modify the matrix. Rho bar. So this rho bar has abstraction which may not be zero, but let's modify it. I will write rho double bar, maybe for me it's easy to Maybe this modification by erasing at the end. No, I write that a minus and in this place I write mu times. Oh, this still illegible magic. Well, it's still illegible matrix in the sense that uh it's a homomorphism. Because uh the condition that delta of this thing is a cow product still falls because uh the boundary of theta is the same as the boundary of theta minus theta f. Theta f is precisely the same. So rho double bar is a homomorphism and it can Homomorphism and it has trivial obstruction. So delta of rho double bar is zero and therefore rho double bar extends to and therefore ath equals. So we proved m b c, the massive region conjecture, for n equals t. For n equals 3. So you are given a row bar, or you modify it, and get abstraction 0 in this step. Of course, we made a friendly assumption. There's a case when the assumption holds. Okay, I need I still want to keep. Is the least two. So t is two. In other algebra of exponent two, split over by quadratic extension, this is not possible. So this assumption holds and we are done. That is the end of the proof in this case. In this case, when P is odd, it is not true. In general, that every algebra even called exponent P by C extension is composable. But we can introduce abstraction for decomposable. Computing the factor group or the relative power group of F A C over F, those classes that speak of bicyclic extension, modulo and decomposable electrons. So in general, it is non-zero, but it is always isomorphic to h minus 1d of the Of and now of that by signal extension, these coefficients do not put them in the group. So it is by definition the factor group of group of norm one elements norm for AC for this biceclic extension of zero one by three By trivial elements with this property, they are elements of the form sigma of u divided by u, where sigma and d double are u and u divided into. So in order to see whether algebra is decomposable, we construct the corresponding element of norm one and see whether it's true. And if there's And it turns out that for our abstraction, by direct calculation, you can compute the abstraction in h minus 1 to be composed of. And the answer is the following. Remember that AB is 0. So there exists an element alpha in field F A, just a signal extension. Signal extension such that the norm of alpha is B. And similarly, well, for Bc, you have element gamma and F C as we know for C of gamma is positive. And then calculation shows us that if you take take an abstraction rho delta of rho bar here and the corresponding element Z is will be represented by the plus gamma divided by alpha. This element has norm one because gamma and alpha have the same norm at the corresponding extension. Now we have look at the following diagram. Look at the following diagrams mean it. You have F, F A, F B the bicyclical step A C, so C of A C alpha lives here, and gamma lives here, well, C, which is gamma over alpha lives here, and here's normal. And it has norm one downstairs. But now look at the norm to any intermediate extension between, for example, FAC. Then we see that the norm of Z, even for this extension, is one, not just for the whole extension. Norm from FAC, you have the C of gamma divided by the gamma. Of gamma divided by alpha is one. And this is a significant extension of the DP that we can apply to that magnet. We get, of course, C, which is gamma over alpha, is of the form sigma of sine u, derivative by d. Therefore, construction fails, and this implies that algebra delta alpha rho bar is decomposed. And therefore, the assumption holds for the special algebra, and you can finish it. This is how it works when n equals 3. So the proof follows from the Hilbert 9. Extension of the DP. Okay, uh now make it. Maybe in general, if MVC holds and follows from till the time, I would like to finalize this for arbitrary profinite loop. So first the question, what does Hilbert 90 mean for any profinite loop? The answer is not so simple because well, The price for here that man here is just common with H1 of field with the efficiency F. And what is this gadget for number? It's not clear. Even the roots of unity, sorry, mu is mu p infinity, meaning all roots of unity. meaning all also finity of deg to the power of t inside f set time requires some additional information to be defined for laboratory group done but for the mu it's not that bad we know that for any field f of course of pertinent any field F, of course of characteristics different. We have a canonical amorphism from gamma F, gamma loop F from Z P, p i integers and the elements. That's determined by the way gamma loop x in the roots of finity. So if you take say g from gamma f and the root of finity affinity in mu, then g acts on the root of infinity by raising this root of unity to the power theta of g. That's the definition of this map canonical. So for any colour group of a field, we have a canonical map to say this type. It is trivial if and only if all the primary rules of unity are unbeknownst. So people decided to consider not just arbitrary profinite groups but profinite groups with a fist homorphism to the and they call it p orientation. So now let's gamma be an arbitrary profinite group and that I homomorphism from gamma to Let's have a homomorphism from gamma to ZP star. P is fixed on us. And we call this orientation, P orientation of gamma. Now we can for a group with orientation. If you have a pair gamma, there are oriented. I hinted our final group. We can define the analog of roots of unity. As an extra roots of unity is divisible T group, maybe we can write it as QP modulus ET. And action is twisted exactly by this. So let me write QP modules of one twisted by one. That the TP modules give is the following gamma action. A G element of the colour group acts on anything here that by multiplying this theta of G. That is the action in this multiplication. It is the action and its multiplication. So, this is the analog of m okay, but still, we need to make this well somehow resolve the difference between mu and f z star. Mu is a union of finite groups of roots of unit. So H1F mu is the direct limit coordinate of H1 FN to the N. Each of these groups is computed as F star modula to be d to the n and the transition maps just raising to the power therefore. Therefore, every element is a pth power of something in the conditions. So this group is p-divisible. Yeah. In fact, it's divisible because clearly divisible by any other parameter. So it's divisible ability loop. And this calculation was always from Pilot 9. So the fact that H1F nu is divisible is just direct comes. It's indivisible, it's just the concept of human nitrogen. Well, now we can make the following definition. And I think it is due to Florence and declare appears in their paper. We say that the identity group grants. Say that the anti-group gamma theta satisfies formal huge language if H one if H one H H, well, maybe. Gamma prime at QP mod GP of prime is divisible. But for every open subgroup, or closed, we say open subgroup gamma prime and gamma. Because this falls obviously not only overwhelm, but over any piece of sign. So now we have the formal Hilbert 90, which is which the case when gamma is dialogue. Is dialogue of a field, but in the case of a field, it's probably weaker than the usual Hilbert 90. But then you can ask whether this formal Hilbert 90 is enough to prove things. For example, there is a question. Suppose that you have an identity group. Suppose that you have an ideal group, P areiant group, which satisfies formality. Uh the C and O are for gamma. But we don't know this in general, even in the case when gamma is a group of a field. But at least in those cases we can prove formal Hilbert nine proof MBC. Is it true that just follows from the formal Hilbert 9? From the formal hypertension. Well, in the cases below MDC, we can say the following: if M is D of the is purificer is okay, yes. If n is equal to t. Not only for fields do we know that it follows from Hilbert 9, but just it follows formally for any profinite group satisfying Gilbert Knight. And then, uh you know on the case n equals four and uh p equals two or four quotes fifty. For focal mice product. And if we take the degenerate miceproduct, the answer is still this. So in our first paper, we handled this degenerate case when the first and the last injuries are the same. And it turns out that this can be also formulated derived from European. From humid mind. But in general, the answer is not known. And well, it would be a bit disappointing to learn that it also follows from Hilbert 90. Maybe LBC whenever it also follows from Hilbert 19. That's a bit unfortunate. What would be much better if this doesn't follow from This doesn't follow from inverted. But it it means that there is a group gamma, or a relative group gamma, such that satisfies formula queper. But for that particular root gamma, NBC, say four equals two, does not fall. If such a gamma exists, it could mean that massive engineering conjecture does not follow from Tilbert 90 only. But it is not known with such candidates. We prove this theorem by introducing items of f-spy. We were able to explain the rules of unity, but it turns out that there is a module analog of f sub star. So if you take n x sub star, Uh M as H star. Oh, this is written multiplicatively, but I would like to rewrite M e divisible. No, for what reason, but this group is, first of all, P divisible, right? In fact, it's divisible. But I will write the following properties. Pm is equal, M is equal to P M property. Second property that detortion of That the torsion of elements of this group is the group of rules of unity, which can be written as M of Q primary component is just Q T mod Z P of 1, the gadget we introduced. And finally, of course, H1 gamma F is risk efficiency minus zero. So, these are the properties of this book. And prove that the following codes, so gamma lambda satisfies and format. If the tangent, in fact, if and then if there exists M well, damn my module M and such step all these three conditions for one. On few I just need a few of this. And in all proofs, pleasure M replaces a gamma sepstar. In other words, In other words, when you work with the field and using Hilbert Knight, you can prove certain things. You can prove it formally for any group gamma satisfying formal Hilbert night. For example condition three for every o open subgroup or is it condition three is it for every Oh, yes. Right, it should be too frequent where we open something. For example, we know that for a field there is an exact sequence for a six-tiff extension of the key. Extension of the VP. Say, Fellow Found group of F, and I'm going to be the ground group of L. The purest term is F star, and that is multiplication by the character, obvious extension, then L star, and then number. This is the exact. And if you look at the proofs, this is Hilbert 9. And of course, the topology is well used in the multiplicity group of the field. But then you just simply plug in for the multi-protective group of field that module, which is called Velo module, and prove that for any group gamma, any group gamma with a limitation satisfying QB 90 and for any subgroup gamma prime of index P have the following bed sequence H1 L Normally H2 H1 F is Z naught H2F and Z naught and multiplication by the curve and then H2 and not the curve of course. So in place we have loop. Here's gamma prime. Here's gamma gamma and gamma prime again. And I tried to prove this exactness just directly avoiding this theory, avoiding this M, just deduce it from divisibility of conditions for the Hilbert line, and they failed. Fails. So there should be direct proof by passing this stuff. Maybe it's too complicated. But to use such an M, which we call Kubernetes 90 module, is very useful. Any questions?
