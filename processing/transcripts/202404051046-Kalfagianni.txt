Okay, so I'm going to talk about the crossing number of satellite modes. And actually, again, also, this talk does not quite fit into the random models. As you will discover soon, if I'm going to compute pro actual procy numbers, I have to make my notes nice and special rather than random. Rather than random. Okay, so the crossing number, we all know what it is. You throw your note on the projection plane, and then you're looking at the smallest number of crossings that you need to the smallest number of processes that you need a projection for the given nota. We all know it is easy to define, but very hard to compute for a But very hard to compute for arbitrary ones. And in particular, my talk will be discussing satellites. So the behavior of crossing number and the basic satellite operations is not known. And this will be the connected sum and more general satellite operations. Well, it was said we are. Well, it was said probably there is an algorithm to compute the crossing number, and that would involve, if you wanted to decide which nodes have crossing number seven, to enumerate all the diagrams and then tell all the node types. And we already know, of course, we heard it many times how many 90 crossing notes. I've heard this before on my we have, and so this gets the Have, and so this gets to be an impossible task if you don't conclude that the crossing number is 100, for instance. Okay, so the next let me define the topological operations, so they connect some that we know. So if I start with minimal probability. If I start with minimal crossing diagrams and I connect those, then I get an upper bound automatically. And if you ask, is this a minimum crossing number diagram? Well, here it is, but in general, it's open. It is in fact one of the open problems in at least some edition of Kirby's Lisa problems. So and I promised I'll define those things to Andrea Simoto. To Andrews, not a bear, so bear with me. So, the general satellite is to start with an unnoded torus, put in a node, the blue curve, and then re-embed it following another node you chose. And so the blue node I get here is the satellite with pattern the figure eight, sorry, pattern the blue curve and companion the figure eight. Okay, and there is a little Okay, and there is a little, so it's well defined if you determine this map, what happens of homology, the framing. And so you will hear me talking about untwisted satellite, which means it will take the generator of pi one of the sonic tones that is standard that is homologically trivial in the complement to the unique one in the image that is homologically trivial in the complement. And again, you are making a more complicated node. Well, it makes intuitively a lot of sense to expect that the crossing number goes up, but even the basic question, if the crossing number of the satellite is at least as the crossing number as the companion is still open. Um, any questions? Any questions? Now, there are some general results that are nice and point in the correct direction. Leichemb in 2015 showed that you have it, well, this cycle of inequality is fine, but you actually have a lower bound and you're going in the right direction up to a bounded constant. Okay, um, so in particular, it's nice because it tells you: well, as the crossing numbers of the uh summons increase, surely enough, your connect sum gets more complicated. And there is a similar result for satellites. So again, it points in the correct direction up to a bounded constant. The bounded constant, as you can see, um is not one that you can use to compute, okay? Compute. Okay? So for um, so it's very nice. Um, but um, for instance, if I apply to the simplest to the to figure it, right, and I do this satellite, this guy here has eight oxen, and all I get is the the cross magnet's positive. Anyway, um these results are great, but um not helping you if you want to actually find the cross magnets. Finally, possibly. The next, right? For random ones, that tells you a lot. Okay, the next good thing to do, the next best thing to do, is actually to look at specific classes and for these cases, the cases where we can compute the crossing number. Can compute the crossing number by special diagrams, and then what I want to do is slowly deviate from these classes and see how I can push a little bit. Okay, so specific classes are alternating nodes, under over, under. And what we know is that if you give me an alternating diagram that has no redundant process, you can Crossings that you can obviously undo with your hand by flighting, then that is your crossing number. So the note I have there is alternating the crossing number is 11. I think. Okay, the number of crossings you count there. So this was actually a well-known conjecture that was projectured by amateur node theorists. By amateur node theorists in the 1800s, and it was proved in the 80s this was one of the early successes of the Jones polynomial. So this is called the Taunt conjecture. And in particular, the additivity conjecture is true, okay, for alt and magic not. And for torus notes, curves that I can project exactly at what you see. And the Parson number again is given. Is given in terms of the special diagram you use to define your point. Okay. And while during the proof of the tight conjectures, naturally this Yuguesia tensor and Monsuki were led to expand the class of alternating notes because their techniques go through it. And so And so I will be talking about a broader class of nodes that is called adult nodes. It's not important to know what they are, but they're great way. And again, the theme is they have a special diagram, and this is the way you define them. And that diagram gives you the cross number. So in particular, one thing here is that the right number of an attitude of such a special diagram is actually an invariant of the node. So you would see in what the So you would see for the WK. And also, talking of special numbers, crossing numbers of Montesinos nodes are also known, and those are again realized by reduced Montesinos diagram, which is what you use. And so when we started working on this, and we were. So, okay, so I'll tell you. Okay, so I'll tell you a result. So with Christian Lim, we were able to prove this. If you start with an adequate diagram that has right number zero, then the crossing number is going to be exactly what you expect. As a matter of fact, you get it by doing your operation on the adequate type. And when we started And when we started talking, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, asking people, we found out that this is actually the first infinite family of prime satellite nodes that we can pinball in the cross plan. So again, as I said, the nice thing is that you start with the slide diagram, the nice diagram, you do the satellite operation of the diagram. Satellite operation of the diagram, and you have your personal. And then with Rome McConkey, who is a graduate student, he's defending his thesis next Tuesday, and he's going to be going to the Colorado State University work off then with that. So we looked at the next case, which is you start with an adequate map, take it again to have right number zero. You don't need it here, but it makes it easier for me. And you perform what is called the 2-1 cable, right? You can tell what your pattern is. And so once you do this, again, you get your crossing number. So if my original note had crossing number, if I start with a If I start with an adequate diagram like here, and I perform the satellite operation, what I have is a minimum crossing number. So we're talking 4 CK plus 1 here. Okay. So these are exact families. Any questions? All right. So now let me tell you a little bit how these things have worked. Um how these things are grown and um how does one come to naturally expand the class. Sorry, this is boring, but uh everybody knows it's topic. Okay, so when you start we saw orientable resolutions of crossings. Here I want my diagrams to be non-orientable and then I'm gonna have two ways to splice it and don't let the fact that I don't have orientation fool you. I don't have orientation full. You make a convention from the beginning. One type of splice is A, the other is B. Keep it throughout your life. Everything I say is good. All right, so if I choose one of these A or B slices for every crossing from my link diagram, I'm going to end up with a collection of Of simple closed curves that are disjoint. And then, what I want to do is I want to report where my crossing was with one of these red sticks. Okay? And I want to think of this as a graph. I have fat edges in literally. This is a fat graph, a trippy graph, if you like to play with those, but that's not important for me. Okay? So I want to pray. So I want right away to attract your attention to the fact that this graph, if I look at all the stick edges, the red sticks end up on different pairs of circles, while this graph has edges that lie on the same, with two endpoints of the same and such a difference, okay. So this is the way that you define your diagrams. Um that you define your diagram. So A di A B I studied with a lot. I resolved all my crossings in one um way or A and then at my graph I have no one edge loops be adequate to the other resolution and otherwise this one must not be adequate. And so now I'm looking at diagrams, I want to look at notes, at diagrams that have the property That have the property that are both A and B adequate to the A and B resolutions. Graphs have no edges, no one loop edges. And this is what I would refer to as adequate. And a node that has such a kind of map is going to be quite adequate. Alright. And let's see. So these nodes are actually, you can define Are actually, you can define them or links in a simple way to say, well, these are the kinds of nodes that behave nicely with respect to a geometrical number. So, I will say in a second, when you compute it, there's no cancellations, not compactness. All right. And so the time conjecture that I mentioned earlier was proved using the Jones polynomial, and in fact, the And in fact, the statement that a 12-pan would associate test weight is weight independent. And the truth is that if you look at the degree span, so you take a note the Jones polynomial can be computed from any diagram. And then if you use a diagram to compute, the degree span of the Jones polynomial is. Of the Jones polynomial is at most the number of processes of any atom with equality if and only if your diagram was reduced alternating. And if you take a moment today, you will find that this implies that a reduced alternating diagram has minimum crossing number overall diagrams of your node type. Okay, so and this was the um similarly all the results I mentioned. All the results of measure will be using degree spans of polynomials, different kinds of polynomials. Not exactly Jones, but cousin. Okay, so let me go back to what I said, how you compute the Jones polynomial. Okay, so the key is you have this function that is the bracket so-called, unoriented V diagrams. And if you speak out of the polynomial, Speed of the polynomial, Laurent polynomial, you've got these rules, right? These are N, yeah? And so the brackets of three links that are different at the crossing satisfy this linear dimension. Adding a flat component amount, you can remove it at the expense of the factor. And the empty here is the link that you formalize the factor before. So for example, you start. You start with the first note of the table and you proceed, so into cross-eats one by one, you end up with 2 to the third, 8 seconds, and each of them now has, yeah, simple closed curves, and you can remove them to get the Kauffman bracket, and then after that, you normalize a little bit, you get the curves. But normally you can think the Kaufman bracket if you want here, and you find it to be this. Be this. And notice that 4 minus 1 is 3, which is the positive number. Alright, so that's very much good. Questions? Okay, so next? So for adequate notes, what happens is that when you do this pan, it's not exactly the crossing number, but there is an abstraction. There is an abstraction that is actually in itself an interesting environment called line change. I won't need it, so I don't define it. But it is harder than the crossing number to compute. So this here does not give you what you want. But nevertheless, what people realize when this is packaged realities, this is an easy push to move, is that if you look at the parallelisms, Parallels also, and compute the Jose polynomials of the parallels, all of them, then you will prove that the adequate diagrams realize the crossing number of nodes that they represent. And I didn't say, I don't remember how I said they reduced the number of native implies adequate in that sense. Okay. And the Jones polynomial also. Um the Jones polynomial also behaves well with the paradigms. Why? Because because actually because if this is adequate, so is the paradox. Okay and now, okay, so before I switch to how do we go to satellites, any questions, Max, comments, operations? Okay, so other words that I want to say remain something that people don't realize, the safe remains closed under during these parallels, which alternatives do have. Okay, so for the non-adequate nodes, because the satellites are immediately non-adequate, we move to the color tones polynomials, which is very close to very closely related to the palette. Related to the parallax, to the Jones polynomials of the parallax, but they are put together in a nice magic way that's inspired by representation there. And if you look at all of them together, they have very nice structure. First of all, I tell you that there is, okay, this is a collection of polynomials, one for each indigent, actually, to be negative. But even though you get a family, they satisfy requirements. They satisfy recursive relations, and so this amounts to saying for any node, I can find a number so that I only need the really finite remaining of those polynomials to determine the whole set. Now, okay, I don't mean to imply that this is not that you can really compute from this. Okay, so. Okay, so um for the figure eight for the three-fold by the way you have a pre-denial function, but we're not going to use this. I'm only using it as motivation to say that this imposes a nice structure on the degrees. And so the degrees, so these are as okay, I have polynomials, they depend on n. They are actually polynomials also. Onions also the variable t and t inverse, which is not coming in the degree. So the highest degree alpha t plus, the lowest degree alpha t minus, and I'll be looking as we've done with the Jones polynomial at the degree sp. And, okay, so you can think of this as, if you want, as a polynomial, a quadratic polynomial in n, but the reality is that this. But the reality is that it's not. It's a quasi-polynomial. And what this means in practice is that at the limit, if n becomes large, each of these terms stabilize to finite values. They're periodic, right? So you have functions from n to q that are periodic, they take finite functions within it. And so when you look at this leading text, and for my doctor's And for my talk, please go ahead and think of this as a number, if you want. If you look at the maximum of this, this is what people call the Jones diameter. And it's diameter because of slopes. But that's what I want. So this is the quantity that we want to use to determine some crossing numbers of satellite rods and to actually get lower values. Lower values. And it follows again from the work, from the old work, that this quantity is bounded, the Jones diameter is bounded above by the crossing number. So automatically this presents a lower bound for the crossing number. But the w the reason it was used for this is because we didn't know the structure and because we didn't know the Structure, and because we didn't know the conjectures around the Jones, Carlo-Jones polynomial that helps prompted people to start computing mystiveness in more detail. Okay, so what we proved with Christianist is this, that if you compute it, if you match it exactly the other bound, then you are accurate. Okay? And this is. Okay? And this is a little bit more um more eff effective, actually. Okay, so this is the theorem obviously this. Um again, the Carlott Jones polynomial can be computed from any diagram. So if you started with a diagram and computed from that diagram and you found that the quadratic term is twice the Crossing number of that diagram. Twice the closing number of that diagram, then this diagram must be adjusted. So that's the punchline that actually makes it something you can use. And so, yeah. So, okay, if you start with the knot and um the Jones diameter, you realize the closing number that is at the quick closing number. That quickness. Is it like how intensive is it to but people have been using also programming, quadratic programming, so not to get uh to confuse programming. Just n later you've done something which will start, you know? Like something to be stylish, you know? I would choose the error for you. But others was a kind of all right. So, yes, okay. I'll tell you, they've been computed for Montesimo's links, for alternate links, for adequate links, I'd be saying, because, and there is quite a bit of programming going. They call it quadratic programming, but they actually get the formulas, not okay. Okay. And our results are obtained from studying the question: okay, how does this degree behave under satellite collisions? This is the question. So we don't know anything. Okay. So then, so I told you that if you computed and you got exactly this, right, then you are adequate. You are adequate. And our proof actually consists to show that you start with a diagram that has a stick that goes on the same circle, and you do, and then you never get this, you get something here that is positive. But so then the results of process, the stronger results, come from this corollary, which is, okay, I will look at things that deviate a little bit from Deviate a little bit from the upper bound, so the minimum you can get. So I will look at links where I found a diagram and I computed this diameter and I found it to be twice, well, the maximum minus two. And so then we say, if you already know that this is non-adequate, Know that this is non-adequate, then that is your unit curves. So this is the method we use to find the exact units. Compute the diameter, other people give it to us. And I'll tell you how. Notice that it has this. Sure that it's not adequate. And again, how do you show it's not adequate? There is ways. Okay, so in particular, So, in particular, let's look at this example, the figure eight node that I have here. This actually has right number zero. It's alternating. And so, Baker, Ken Baker, Moteki, and Takata computed this diameter and find it thirty four, which as you see is two times eighteen minus one. And so this diagram is the minimum number across the diagram. Minimum number has been adequate. Alright? Okay. And this is not adequate. Maybe the white data is not adequate. Okay. So how did this vehicle compute that? I'll tell you. So any questions? Before I switch to bounce more? So, oh, I did want to say something since it's good to draw examples. Crossing right number zero, there are notes that have, there are infinitely many nodes already that have write number zero and are adequate. You can do this with argumenting. But the simplest way to create notes where the result provides. Where the result of white head doubles applies, is take any other, take each metal image, and do this. And so we looked, me, not computing, but what I could do is look in not info. And so these are the up to 12 processes. These are the amphicaria mat. The anti-cry normal nodes, there is not many. But if you note, out of 2977 crime nodes, up to 12 crossings, 1852 are adequate, so you get many samples. Now, I know what you're thinking. Yes, as you move on, the crossing number is not small, more and more scales, right? But okay, there you go. Yes. So let's know. Let's now switch to Those reach to upper bounds. In fact, when you look at, in fact, we have a lower bound that doesn't apply to, applies in general. So if you start with any node that is adequate and you take the white head double, you get this number at this lower bound. So Is the slower bound. So it's actually here, the maximum hitting it. And in particular, if this is zero, you get. Okay. And then you do get nice bounds with the colour Jones polynomial with Jones distance, even if they're not adequate. For instance, if you put the white head doubles of torus knots, you still get this. You still get this, but that bypasses a little bit, the lowest standard conjecture that I mentioned here. Yes, it makes sense to make more strong conjectures. Okay. And then we looked at cable nodes. So cable node is you take the PQ tolerus node and you put it in the solid torus to make it better. And so for Rob and I, for this node, For these notes, we proved again that you have the maximum. So suppose that K is a magnitude note, the crossing number is a K. If you do the K on, you get exactly what you would like to get neural, Q times CK plus 1. And notice, right. And there is another pound, I will can bacon. Can baker Moteki and the cutter move to the next pattern, which is this meso pattern. Alright? So notice this one goes three times around the sonic torus. And again, they've got that in this case, if you start with a 90-bit knot, what you have here is again 9cc plus 2. Plus 2. And for the fun of it, notice that here if you make this 0, this is 2, this is 3, so you pinpoint the crossing number by 1, by 2 actually. It's either this or this. But not exactly. Okay. Alright, so this is the news. And so I already told you, okay. You okay? If you start doing this satellite business, this is the original pony to start with. You put the pattern in, right? How many times the pieces here? This is what we call a rapid number, I think. And so the examples we got, but also I think the conjecture has been stated for all nuts. It's not considered placable. It should not be that's what Mark Leigenby told me. Can be talking. So, what seems to be the thing here is that what we expect at least for adequate nodes is that if we compute the degrees of the colour draws for the mass, we should get this low amount. So the rapid number. And there is a question I want to ask you. Actually, for what satellites or whatnots can I get the number, the crossing number on the nodes, I speak? People I talk to had a lot of ideas and they think it should work in many other cases. Humor to say it repairs, I'm sure it would work. But then I can't work. Okay, questions? What time do I stop? Your ten minutes. Okay. So, okay, so now let me say a little bit more. Somebody asked how hard it is to compute the calorie jones, okay? Well, the colour jones degrees were computed for all these families that I'm computing. The white had also not only adequate, but many more complicated, more complicated nodes. The white had the Meso pattern and the cables, and actually, them can be and Takata, and they've been red from this business starting. Okay, so what do we do? Let me show you, let me open this, and tell you how you compute. Now, I already said that the Gallery-Jones polynomial is a formula. Is a formula, a cleverly put together formula that involves the Jones polynomials of cables. So you can start with the bracket of this thing and start computing the bracket. But if you think, if I take the three cable, each crossing I had gives me nine crossings. If I take the n cable, this is very, very expensive. Well, impossible. Okay, that's what it's like. Okay, those words I don't know. Okay, but there is a little bit, there is something that is more effective, and it comes actually from the quantum nature. As I said, it's called fusion, and the roots of this invariance come from the presentation here of the algebras. The exact form is coming from there. But what you do basically is this. You view this complicated expression of brackets, of cables, as colored knots with boxes and labels. And then you start fusing and you put in complicated things and graphs here. Colored graphs. And then there's additional. Coloured graphs, and then there's additional rules that bring you down to simplify your graphs and bring it together here into things that also look intimidated. I mean, it's very easy and easy to compute. However, these are fixed quantities. You can sit down and compute it once and for all. That's what they've done. And this is what um Ken and others did. So, um Yes, it's not a pleasure completely. It's not a pleasure computing this thing. But why do we compute it? Why compute it? Well, we didn't compute it, you know, we have crossing numbers. After people computed it for other reasons, we noticed, oops, it does this too. Okay. So, well, there is, as I said, the degrees of these polynomials are supposed to come incompressible surfaces in the node component. In the node component, boundary slopes. And then the middle term of this polynomial is telling you exactly the topology. That's the prediction. And so, what Ken and Baker, these people who make the cat, was verifying that the conjecture is closed under these satellite operations. They described how the degree changes, and they found that it changes exactly the way that the incomparable. That the incompressible surfaces change. And so this is why what I'm trying to say is that there's a number of open conjectures that prompt us, tell us, encourage us to compute the Calvert-Jones polynomials. And it can be computed, okay? And so, in particular, there's this conjecture that says that Conjecture that says that if you found it to be in this form, you added many things. So, in particular, it tells you that the jobs, the colour drone, so to detect the unknown, and much more. So, we certainly have a lot of reasons to study the computer. And yes, it also gives us crossing microstaties one more. I think I'll stop here. Other questions, Greg? I have a question. That's about slide 19. Slide 19. I don't think I did this one. How many did I have? No, that's good. This is this one. So in the last sentence there, so the ride is zero. That implies that the point of double was not out of. Why is the point was not adequate? Was that no? Was that part of the hypothesis? If it's not adequate, in particular, if this is zero, then it's not adequate. But it doesn't imply it. You have to check it. And how you check it? Well, again, you don't need to do extra work because when they compute the slopes and everything, you have the whole degree of last. And the degree of the adequate has very particular properties. And let's have one last point of applause to all the speakers and against Brooklyn Order.
