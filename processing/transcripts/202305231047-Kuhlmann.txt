I don't know if this is going to be my students that say that. Okay, so we have the pleasure to Ian Samat Kulman who's going to talk about moment problems for algebra generated by the nuclear space. Yeah, thank you very much and I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me here. It's a privilege to be here. Thank you very much. So I will start. I will talk about the moment problem for algebras generated by a nuclear space. And I would like to stress the fact here that in my talk I will be talking about the full instance of the moment problem. That is, we do not bound the moments in this thought. The moments in this talk. I will show you by way of introduction several contexts where we studied the modern problem. We meeting my co-authors, three of them are here in the audience, and over the last few years. And I would like to say that my I would like to say that Maria Infusino will talk later on today on the translated version of the items that I will be talking about. And the paper that I would like to partially present here is in joint work with Maria Infusino. Maria and Fusino Skugner and Patrick Mikhalski who was Maria's PhD student when she was here, was talking consultants before she left us. And it is submitted to the archive. And there is an archive version and it is submitted currently to a journal so it is under review. So I would like to start by an introduction. I would like to start by an introduction. And it is a mixed audience here, and I would like to tell you the way that I was first myself, very quickly, introduced to the multi-dimensional Moment problem This is the way I was introduced to it and it was also the way that most real algebraic geometers in the community were introduced to it because that was where the very clear bridge to real algebraic geometry was set in a paper, in a seminal paper of Seminal paper of Konrad Schmuttgen in 1991, where he made an essential use of the positive tensor of real algebraic geometry to bring us to this world of functional analysis. And this is the moment problem in this case is formulated for the algebra of polynomials. It's always real here over the reals. Real here over the reals, all my talk will be real in finitely many variables. And you consider L from R x1 xn to r normalized linear functional linear functional. And normalized will mean throughout the talk that we will assume that L of 1 is 1. And the question of the multi-dimensional moment problem is when does there exist So the radon measure is a positive measure defined on the sigma algebra of Borel subsets of Rn that is locally finite and in a regular. So the question is when does there exist a radon measure on Rn such that Such that the linear functional is exactly integration along, so a radon measure u, let's say, on Rn such that the linear functional is exactly interpretation with respect to this measure for every polynomial. Now, I will not talk about this, I'm telling you the concept. Telling you the chronological procedure where we came to talk today about a very specific context of those algebra generated by nuclear spaces. So it has been a learning experience through the years, and after we understood, it's very well understood in the community with, as I already mentioned, there is also. Mentioned. There is also a variant of this that is called. So let me say that this is IAMIB. There is a variant of this that is the so-called. So this multi-dimensional moment problem has been acronymized as MP. And there is a version of this where you also specify a Also, specify a support. So let K now be a closed subset, closed in the Euclid topology, of course, closed subset of R to the N and the K-moment problem, which is acronymized as K and P, is the same question. V is the same question, so but this time you want the measure mu to be on defined on k and such that L of F is integration of F d mu over K distar. Okay, now we understood pretty well this context and we kind of got excited about Excited about understanding a much more general context. In general, what is so sacred about the polynomial ring and what is so sacred about the polynomial ring in finitely many variables. And Mehdi Gassemi and the late Mary Marshall worked intensively with us to understand the general context. Understand the general context that I'm going to introduce now. So now let us go more general. So let A be a commutative unital real algebra. And we want to mimic the situation here. Now I'm not saying it's a polynomial algebra, nothing. And to mimic the situation. And to mimic the situation, we need some topological space in the background, and the topological space will be the space of characters. So, let chi of A be the space of characters, A, real characters on A, so it is the space of all alpha such that alpha is from A to R is an R algebra homomorphism. Homomorphism and so that will provide us with the topological space, but I need the topology and to introduce the topology I will remind you of something that most probably people know here for every A in A, the Gelfand transform of A. form of A is mimicking the evaluation that we do when we view polynomials as formal objects and as functions. So the Galfan transform is defined to be alpha evaluated at A and now we endow indeed the character space with the weakest topology. With the weakest topology, weakest such that all those a hats are continuous. And so for all A in A. And with this we can formulate now the common problem. Well, once you have the topology, Once you have the topology, you have a Borel sigma algebra. So let's say that A is the Borel Sigma algebra. And then as soon as you have the Borel sigma algebra, you have a notion of radical measures. And you can ask the same question for a linear functional normalized. You're functional, normalized, and you ask when is there a radon measure. Again, on this time, on the character space such that L of A is equal integration rather than measure mu of a hat. of A hat du over kind of A, and we studied this quite closely, this very general context. Now this is much more general because it allows the algebra not only not necessarily an algebra of polynomials, but more importantly for us, it allows the algebra to be anything. Anything not finitely generated, in particular not finitely generated, and this in particular not finitely generated is the key link to infinite dimensional analysis. Namely, typically the character spaces that will appear will be infinite-dimensional real vector spaces. And I would like to specify some convention. So, convention. From now on, unless Adora stated, we will assume, and it is a non-trivial assumption, that there are real characters. It could very well happen that the character space is empty. Now, I want to see as a special case, indeed, the case of a so this problem is. So this this problem is solved or not solved or are there cases where it is solved and? So the mal well it depends what solves means. Yeah I mean that's a very long story what solves means. Let's say that about the multi-dimensional moment problem we know a lot. A lot from the algebraic viewpoint and from the function analytic viewpoint. And in the general context that I'm talking about here it depends on the algebraic About here, it depends on the algebra, but we also know a lot. But I'm not talking about these things, and I want to bring you now to what I'm talking about. A lot is known. Can I please ask one motivational question about the classical business? You said something about the positive Stellenzots, but can you say one more sentence about the motivation from real algebraic geometry for the original model problem? Yes, so there is, okay, I am now giving you a complete answer. Giving you a complete answer because there is another person asking. So there is a complete answer here, and the complete answer is Javilon's theorem. And Javilon's theorem is a version of the Ries theorem, representation theorem, but with a grain of positivity. And the answer, the complete answer here is that there exists a rather That there exists a Radon measure representing, by the way, we say that the Radon measure represents the linear functional, that there exists a Radon measure representing the linear functional if and only if the linear functional is positive on positive polynomials on k, on this element k. Now, a positivity of polynomials on a close On a closed subset of Rn is quite a complicated matter, and it is a matter that real algebraic geometers love to study. Right? So, this is... Can you just write the name of the person whose theorem it is? Have you landed? So it was completely solved by Havilland in the 1930s, but the real algebraic geometers didn't like at all the Havilland. didn't like at all the Haveland solution. So Haveland was not a hero for the real algebraic geometry. Only in 1991 there became a hero for the real algebraic geometries and that's Konrad Schwitten who is an operator theorist and who is still very active and enjoying a lot his fate of being a hero. Being a hero. I would like to say that the main important thing that the real engendered geometers did not like about Hafeland is checking this positivity because there is a very complicated story with Gilbert. Gilbert had a 17th problem, and Gilbert had an 1888 paper where he told you that homogeneous polynomials that Polynomials that are non-negative are sums of squares in only very rare cases and so on. So, this Havilland checking was very not algebraically satisfactory. And the breakthrough of Schwigen is that he basically we liked him because he said the following, so just try in two minutes to follow the zest of the matter. Of the matter, he told us that if K, this closed subset of Rn, happens to be a compact semi-algebraic set. So semi-algebraic set is the common domain of non-negativity of finitely many polynomials. So you give those finitely many polynomials G1 to Gs that define that semi-algebraic set. Then you can replace the Havilland. Can replace the Haviland nasty condition of checking positivity on a huge cone by the checking positivity on the so-called quadratic pre-ordering that is finitely generated by the finitely many polynomials. And the quadratic pre-ordering is something that algebraic geometers love and real algebraic geometers love. Algebraic geometers prefer varieties and to realize the varieties of the variety Varieties and real algebraic geometers prefer quadratic pre-orders. I say quadratic pre-ordering, you mean like sums of squares? So the weights, it's linear combination using weights. The weights are sums of squares of polynomials and the elements that you are combining are uh products of the finitely many generators of that that describe your sign algebraic cycle. Your semi-algebraic set. So that was the big breakthrough that came. But then we kind of got bored with the finitely many variable case and we wanted to do infinite dimension analysis and then we went to this much more general context with Netty Cassemi and Moiri Marshall and later on Maria Infusino joined the team. But I would like now to tell you a bit more because I am now after I told you, okay. I am now after I told you, okay, we started with polynomial algebra in finitely many variables, then we went to an arbitrary algebra, commutative unit rule. And now I want to also depart from finitely generated algebra. So let me just, because an algebra could be finitely generated, of course, without being a polynomial algebra. So let us have a very quick look at this. So let A now, special case B A. special case be a finitely generated be a finitely generated commutative unital algebra and so A is just let's say that the number of generators is n. The number of generators is n, so then A is just not quite the polynomial ring, but the polynomial ring divided by an ideal in the polynomial ring. Right? And so in this finitely generated case, just as a nice exercise, it turns out that the kind of A, so what is the formulation? Of A. So, what is the formulation, the specific formulation in that specific context of the moment problem? We have to say what is chi of A. Well, chi of A turns out to be the real variety that is defined by the ideal. So, this is the real variety. So, it is, well, the ideal, of course, by Hilbert-Besis' theorem is finitely generated, and the real variety is the set of all. Variety is the set of all points that make those finitely many generators vanish. And you can, I did the exercise this morning at 5 with Victor. You can quickly compute that chi of A can be identified with the real variety and then you can, and the Gelfand transforms, okay, so they are actually maps on cosets, but at the end of the story, when you cancel everything. Of the story, when you cancel everything, the moment problem will be just again the same. So you are given a linear functional on A that is defined on A. And is there a measure mu on defined on this real variety such that for every polynomial you can kind of go forget the coset of the polynomial and just start. set of the polynomial and just talk about the polynomial itself L of Q equals the integration with respect to this measure mu of Q T mu on V of I. So you see that for the finitely generated case, this is just again a K-moment problem. There is not really anything new. Okay, so it turns out there is not really much new for finitely Much new for finitely generated algebra if you understand very well the k-moment problem over the polynomial algebra. Therefore, we had the idea, and this idea was the PhD thesis of Patrick Mikhalski, to leverage, to create a machine to leverage the knowledge, the sound knowledge that we have for modern problem on. That we have for moment problem on Vernati-generated algebras to go to infinitely generated algebras or the so-called infinite-dimensional moment problem. So this is the second part of this introduction and motivation that I will also need in the presentation of the results of this paper, so I may as well tell you. Tell you very briefly because I have spent already a lot of time talking. So, let me tell you what is the way to leverage your knowledge from finitely generated sub-algebras of a given infinitely generated algebra to know something about the algebra itself. That's one thing. That's one thing. What about the character space of A? If you know the family of character spaces of all finitely generated sub-algebras, what about the measures? So can you just lift the knowledge of finitely generated subalgebra S, its character space, the Borel sigma algebra on this character space of the finitely generated subalgebra, the radon. The random measures that live on those finitely generated algebras. Can you lift the whole situation to know something about algebra? Okay, so Ron, you said that you were giving your talk for graduate students. So what is the machine? I'm asking you. What is a well-used and a machine that has proven throughout the decades to be quite effective? The decades to be quite effective. I'm asking you. I can't hear. Ask the students. I am asking the students, is there a brilliant student here? Those that know have seen the assignment, you keep quiet. I'm going to go on the floor and say I hope it's not schemes. It's not schemes. I hope it is schemes. I hope it's not schemes because I don't quite know how to work with them. Sorry, what is the elements and algorithms? I'm telling you about positivity. So it is projective limit techniques. Okay, so the fourth approach that we had is leverage the knowledge. The knowledge from the collection S. So I'm going to give this collection a name I. So it is the collection S. Also, I should have first, I gave you now let A be an arbitrary, hopefully infinitely generated, not finitely generated. Let A be an arbitrary Arbitrary, unital, commutative, R algebra not necessarily finitely generated, not necessarily finitely generated. And now you want to leverage the knowledge from a whole bunch of things from I, so this is a finitely generated sub-algebra, so finitely. Algebra, so finitely generated subalgebra of A, and then you have the characters, the collection of character spaces of S, S and I and then you have hopefully radon measures, and in the background there is, of course, your linear functional L on A, which of course. Which, of course, for the purpose of the projective limit, will restrict to a linear function on the finitely generated subalgebra. So you also have this collection of L of S in I, and you have a collection of representing radon measures for all these. And how do you put all this together? You put all this together via projective limit techniques, and I want to tell you because this is going to be the instrument that we use all the time. By the way, I forgot to mention when I gave you the example of the finitely generated algebra, and I computed for you the character space to be the real variety. I forgot to mention that at I forgot to mention that at this point you see that this real variety might be empty. There might be no real points. And therefore I will assume so out this non-trivial assumption. Okay, so I want to give now with the normal A. So you say L is an African linear form. Not necessarily bounded. Nothing is to be. For now, nothing. I'm just doing a complete. I'm doing a Bourbaki. I'm doing a Bourbaki construction. There is nothing deep. It's a projective limit construction. It will become a bit more flashy when I talk about Brokhorov conditions, so I'm about to do that. So of course, when you want to do projective limit techniques, you also need arrows. You need arrows between the objects. And the arrows are given by projections. So this is going to go from a character space of. Go from a character space of T to the character space of S. So you take a character and you just canonically restrict it. So canonical restriction. Restriction, and that is for the case when S is less than or equal to T, but the less than or equal here, the order that you use for the projective limit construction. Projective limit construction is simply inclusion, set-theoretic inclusion. So we have the maps, and okay, the canonical projections when they go from S to A, we will just abbreviate them to pi S. When they go to the largest point of this projective limit, the technique will just call them. And now I want to give you, so this is a So, this is one of the main results. It is a very, very long paper, and it's only one of its main results that I happen to be wanting to use today. So, it is a paper that appeared in integral equations and operator theory in 2022, and it is number 94, volume 2, article 12. Article 12, and it is 44 pages with the same co-authors as the ones I cited today. And I want to tell you one of the solutions of the moment problem on a not finitely generated algebra using this projective Linux technique. It's just one instance. So the statement is: so we are given, it's a bit chaotic here because I don't have time to write the answer. Because I don't have time to write the ansats properly, but we're giving a linear functional on that not finitely generated our algebra. And we want to know what can we get from the projective limit. And the statement, it is actually serum 3.9 part two. And it is on in that paper, it is exactly s serum 3.9 part two in that paper. Point nine part two in that paper, and it says the following: there is so n is given, so let n be the normalized linear functional linear functional then L admits a representing measure, then there exists There exists a representing Radon measure representing Radon measure. Chi E means it's defined on the Borel sigma algebra of the character space for L if and only if and only if And only if for every S in I, so my index set is all finitely generated sub-algebras, there exists a measure, a radon measure, a radon measure mu sub s. Mu sub S on the Borel sigma algebra. So I should say rather than there exists ah there exists I should be consistent there exists a chi sub S representing rather than Rather than measure for the restricted functional, but that's not the end of the story, otherwise it will be just wubaki, right? Such that the family of all those Finally, of all those that you get satisfies Prokhorov condition. And it is condition 3.4 in our paper, and I'm going to write it down for you. So, proper rough. For you, so proporov condition 3.4. This is the main theorem we'll appeal to. Proporov condition 3.4 is the following for the it is a condition on a family of measures, right? So it says the following. So for every For every real epsilon positive, there exists a compact subset of chi of A such that for over S in I mu s of pi s of C epsilon is greater or equal than one minus epsilon. Now I am not an analyst. I don't know why analysts like epsilons. I get nervous will never see one, but this is the technical condition that is needed for this theorem. So Needed for this serum. So try to remember this serum. We will appeal to it in the next five, seven minutes. So that a bit. This is not about just approximating your projection sets by compacts. Something that's pretty it works. It's pretty nice. Okay, so now this was the situation. This was the situation with projective limit techniques. And then to conclude this introduction that is long, but it is kind of on purpose now because it's a mixed audience here. So that was number four. And finally, number five, I will leave this projective limit on for you to absorb while I am erasing here the blackboard. But finally, for number five, Finally, for number five, we got to work with Matti Gasseni and Marie Marshall on a very special brand of the moment problem, and that is the moment problem for a commutative unit, but endowed with a topology, a topological algebra, and where our preferred topologies are locally convex topologies or locally convex. Locally convex topologies or locally multiplicatively convex topologies, locally convex or locally multiplicatively convex. And we studied the moment problem here. So what role does the topology play? So I mean the topology on the character space is another story. Now we have the topology on the algebra. It was the original topology on the characters on the Gelton. Was that originally considered to be locally convex, or was it the original one that you put on the Geltar? This weak topology? Early getting weak starfish. No, this is just House Dorf. Just Hausdorff. Yeah, not necessarily. We're not interested. It is actually the restriction of the product topology. So the point is that this topology appearing here gave us a handle on the more. us a handle on the moment problem for continuous linear functions for result for continuous so moment problem for tau continuous linear functionals but after we did all this work we met maria infusino and she was working with with tobiascuna on some items and then we were very And then we were very frustrated by the fact that, with all the knowledge that we have acquired, we still didn't get that one bit. And that one bit is actually not exactly what Maria and Togetz were doing, but there was in the background the work of Berezansky and Kondratiev. So there was the work that we still could not get a hold of with all our topological. Of with all our topological methods and everything, we could not get a hold of retrieving the results of Berezansky and Kondratiev. So that's a challenge, Berezansky, maybe Z and Kondratiev and many others. I mean, there are works. I mean there are works of the Rezansky and Ziffin and Jim Vasson and Albeverio and many many people that we were mainly interested on the moment problem for the symmetric algebra the symmetric Algebra, the symmetric tensor algebra, the symmetrized tensor algebra. S of V, this is also a commutative unital algebra, S of V, where V was a vector space, a topological vector space. Logical vector space endowed with a new so-called nuclear topology. So, this guy sneaked in. It sneaked in because it's not quite Not quite that it is a topological algebra. No, I mean it is an algebra that is generated by a topological vector space. So it sneaked in and we decided we're going to look at this now. So this is the main motivation for what I'm going to tell you now. So what is first of all, so I have to give you a few I have to give you a few definitions, and I want at least to state the main results. I see that Maria is looking very disappointedly at the clock. I have five minutes. I think we started five minutes left. Okay, so basically, you know, this serum that I'm not going to erase. That I'm not going to erase. So let me tell you what is where do we start? So maybe just to make the story a little bit easier, let me just start telling you what do we mean by an algebra. So definition. So this is no longer introduction. This is now actually the paper itself, part of the paper itself. Part of the paper itself. So, definition: Let A be a commutative unital algebra and G a set of generators algebra generators, algebraic generators. Generators, algebraic generators and consider V to be the linear span, the linear span, the R linear span of G. Okay? So we will say in that case, just to abbreviate this here, so we will say we will say in this situation We will say in this situation that A is generated by V. Now we are interested, so this is the definition of an algebra being generated by a linear subspace of itself, but what we are interested in, we are interested in this paper. In this paper, in the case when V, the V that we are considering, is endowed with the Hilbertian seminon. Seminon. So since I have no time to write a version. I have no time to write. A Russian semi-norm is a semi-norm that is induced by a positive semi-definite bilinear form. And we want to study the moment problem accordingly. And this Hilbertian semi-norm is the first step towards considering. Towards considering being those with a nuclear topology. So the nuclear topology on a real vector space is induced by a family of Hilbertian seminon that is regulated by trace conditions. Okay, so I want to put now on the board our main result. Well, it's the main result of one section, and the main result Section and the main result of that one section, I still want to leave this okay. Okay, so the main result of this section is the following of and from this main serum, which is serum Which is serum 25 in this archive version, we derive basically everything else, including in section 3, we retrieve all the results of Berizansky and Kondrativ on algebra generated by nuclear space. We got them. So here is the serum. So the ansat is algebra A is generated by a linear space which is endowed with is endowed with so let A be generated by a linear space V together with Q where Q is a Hilversion semi-norm right and we will assume that the characters which Which are continuous, of which restriction is continuous with respect to the seminar is non-empty, and this is the intended support of our measure. And look, it is the counterpart of what is written on the right-hand side, the projective limit technique, except that now instead of looking at arbitrary At arbitrary finitely generated subalgebras, we will consider. So, this is a finitely generated subalgebra, but we are interested in those that are finitely generated by a finite dimensional subspace of V. Right, so that's why the index set is called G instead. In here, it was just. Instead, in here it was just all. And then the result is there exists a represent radon representing measure. Oh, there was a linear function somewhere. Okay. And let L be a normalized linear function defined on A, and we want to solve the moment problem. There is a random measure. There is a radon measure that we support, and we can even say something about the support, and the support is contained in this topological jewel of this Hilbertian semi-norm. If and only if there is a Hilbertian seminar Seven on P such on V on the same space such that the trace of P against Q is finite and for each S in. For each SNG, there is same story here representing measure mu sub S for the restricted linear functional. And now you're telling me where is Prokhorov control. Tell me where is Prokhorov's condition, such that instead of Prokhorov condition, there is a concept that is much more adapted to these nuclear spaces that we discover, has a direct translation, well, after a lot of technical effort to Krokhorov condition, and such that the family of all those measures, mu S in G is Is P concentrated. It's called P concentrated. So this is a notion that comes from this nuclear spaces ANZATS. I can give the definition if someone asks me later. And this is the transition of the Prokhorov condition. And I have used my extra five minutes. Thank you. Any questions? This is probably a very naive question, but so what is the relation between this result and the contracted Berizansky result? So y y you have you have a general unit of algebra, they have the symmetric algebra generated by G. Is that is that a quotient or is it something much more general? So in the case of the symmetric algebra, the case of the symmetric algebra generated by a nuclear space is just one example of what we call a unital algebra generated by a space with a nuclear topology. But in that case, Topology, but in that case of the symmetric algebra, we know it's a really nice situation. So, let me tell you what they do. So, what they do, so they take the symmetric tensor algebra, which is a very natural choice. You can actually describe this symmetric tensor algebra as a ring of polynomials with variables which are the coordinate vectors with respect to a basis of v. The character space. The character space of the symmetric algebra can be identified with the algebraic jewel of V. So the algebra is S of V and its character space can be identified with the algebraic jewel of V. And where the nuclearity assumption hits in their work, plays and the important role in their work of Berezansky and Kondratiev is that to get that Is that to get that the measure, the representing measure, has support contained in the topological joule of V. So this is the special situation. So we retrieve it because we also said that the support of the measure is in this topological jewel. So their result becomes a special case. So if you want, we have a generalization of the result. But now you can say. The result. But now you can say algebrists like a lot, they have some kind of obsession of generalizing the results just for the sake of it. But we actually were generalizing these results for another context that was considered by Maria Insuzzino and Tobias Cuna for space of infinitely differentiable functions. Functions, and we are right now applying those results to a very interesting context of a work that we're doing with Tidiolio. So there are many contexts that go beyond this simple generalization for the sake of generalization of Kondriativ and Erezansky, where you meet the context of a unital algebra that is actually the core of the That is actually the core of the algebra is given by some topology on some linear subspace of the yeah yes I mean kind of a comment in this same context and so I the point is that even even in this Even in this setting of a symmetric algebra of nuclear space, you have here a much more precise result, right? Because you can identify the support in terms of the semi-norms that approximate your nuclear topology. So, if you have a scale of spaces like the Sobolev scale, you can kind of Can kind of pinpoint exactly where the support lies. Yeah, so the reason why Victor is explaining this is that he joined into this follow-up work with Didier Enviant and where we indeed apply all this to Sovolov spaces. And that's the viewpoint from this very recent work that we are about to put on the archive. Did John Rion is a guy who is an Didien Rion is a guy who is an engineer who does semi-definite optimization using La Serre hierarchy methods, Jean-Bernard La Serre. They work in a lab in Toulouse.
