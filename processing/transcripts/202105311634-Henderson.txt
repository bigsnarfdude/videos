Okay, and then the other thing I want to say is: you know, if you've got questions as I'm going through it, you know, feel free to ask. I always prefer to present with a bit more of a discussion. But also, thank you all for coming and thank you to the organizers. I'm going to be presenting some work I did back in 2020 on entanglement harvesting with a temporal superposition. The temporal superposition. It was a fairly large collaboration, and I believe some of you are in the audience today. And if you want to see, the paper is here. So just to start off with some background, indefinite causal order, why do we think there is one or why are we looking into it? So the idea is that quantum gravity, just in this case being some unification of general relativity and quantum mechanics, may lead to some sort of indefiniteness in causal structure. Definiteness in causal structure. So, if we take this seriously, we can have situations where it can't be determined if operation A comes before operation B or operation B comes before operation A, or we can have situations where they're both in a, could occur in a superposition A before B and B before A. We've done, there have been tabletop experiments done to sort of show this indefiniteness using beam splitters and lasers, and it's been shown that this. And that this indefinite causal order provides advantages in quantum computation and communication efficiency. So, then the question, sort of broad big picture question, we were hoping to sort of chip away at is how does this indefinite causal order affect the entanglement structure of quantum fields, even if they remain space-like separated throughout the entire interaction? And this entanglement is distillable. Over the years, there's been many, many investigations, entanglement harvesting. On entanglement harvesting by a pair of localized two-level particle detectors. So these are our UDW detectors, and that's what I'll be working at. This is not a complete list, there's pages and pages of references. Now, what's nice about looking at the extracted entanglement, so the resultant entanglement by these detectors, is it's sensitive to many different things in particular, specifically but not limited to space-time curvature, the topology of space-time, the boundary conditions of space-time. Topology of space-time, the boundary conditions of space-time, and many other things. So, more precisely, a UDW detector, as I said, it's a two-level quantum system, so a qubit, ground and excited state where they're separated by some energy gap omega. And they're detect particle detectors because we say it detects a particle when it transitions from the ground to excited state. We're going to couple them linearly to the quantum. Coupled them linearly to the quantum vacuum, quantum scalar vacuum for some amount of time at some specific place. And it's been shown that this is not just a simplified model. It actually is a good approximation for the light-matter interaction, provided you don't exchange angular momentum. And then now to sort of put that, put some math to it, the UDW, or sorry, the entanglement. Okay. So, the entanglement harvesting protocol usually has sort of three big steps. We're going to initialize everything in sort of the ground state, so both detectors in the ground state, the field in a vacuum. Linearly couple the detectors to the field through this interaction Hamiltonian, which is time dependent. Lambda is our coupling strength, which is usually small. And you've got your internal degrees of freedom of your detector. Internal degrees of freedom of your detector and your field at some point in space, some trajectory. Now, the final state of the detectors. So you evolve it under your standard time evolution operator, the time ordering of your interaction Hamiltonian, and you trace out your field. And to lowest ordering the interaction strength, here is your density matrix describing the state of the two detectors. Detectors. Now, so just a couple of things to note about this. Your PA and PB are, in fact, your transition probabilities of detectors A and B. And this curly M is important. It's a coherence term that encodes the non-local correlations of the detectors. And now we need to quantify the entanglement. Okay, quantify the entanglement in our system. So sort of big picture, we've got a notion of entanglement of formulas. We've got a notion of entanglement of formation. So that's a measure of some density, the entanglement of two qubit density matrix has the interpretation of the number of bell pairs required to prepare rho AB using local operations in classical communication. Now we're going to use the concurrence, which is an entanglement monotone, and it feeds into the calculation of the entanglement formation to lowest order in the interaction strength. It looks like this. That looks like this, and it has a nice interpretation in this form. If your non-local correlations are greater than your local noise or your transition probabilities, then you can say that the detectors are entangled and the larger this difference, the more entangled they are. So now that was the standard UDW, sorry, the standard entanglement protocol. Let's add in a temporal superposition. If you've noticed, I've been sort of bolding and read that we have. Sort of bolding in red that we have that you know it's they couple for some time, so we have the freedom to choose when they actually couple. So let's condition it. The idea is to condition when they couple to the field on some control qubit labeled by C. So you see the two switching functions are centered at TA and TB conditioned on your control qubit. So if we initialize this control in the plus state, then the switchings will be in some state. State, then the switchings will be in some superposition. And now to show the math changes, you've got ground, ground the fields in the vacuum, and then your control and plus. And here's your interaction Hamiltonian. It's the same, but you've got this control qubit here, which you condition the switching time on. So once you again evolve it in time, trace out the field, you're actually left with the detector. out the field you're actually left with the detector control system to lowest order and the coupling strength or interaction strength looks like this so it's a bit more complicated but you still have sort of a familiar structure next so the next step is to make some kind of measurement to your control qubit and you've got sort of three options you can measure well you know three sensible options i'd say you could measure in the computational basis and recover your standard entanglement harvesting protocol throw away your Throw away your control qubit, and you'll actually end up with a probabilistic mixture as one would expect. Now, what's interesting about this is if the energy gaps of the two detectors are equal, these two situations are going to be the same. And then sort of the third and most interesting is if you measure in the plus-minus basis, that you'll wind up with the detectors having interacted with the field in a coherent superposition of A before B. Superposition of A before B and B before A. And just sort of to review how these density matrices change, again, measuring the computational basis to recover the standard entanglement harvesting protocol. You just wind up with this. You've got your transition probabilities of your detectors and your non-local correlations. If you trace out the control qubit, now you have averages. Again, just a probabilistic mixture of, say, A before B and B before A. Of, say, A before B and B before A for all of your terms. Now, if you measure in the plus-minus basis, with result plus, that's really all you're going to get if you expand to lowest order in the interaction strength. This is your, again, your resulting density matrix describing the AB subsystem. So you have, so now what's interesting is this non-local correlation is still the average of A before B and B before A. A before B and B before A, where your transition probabilities are now more complicated and have these cross terms. And this represents the coherent superposition. So we've sort of considered two scenarios of a coherent superposition. I've been saying A before B and B before A, and that's what we call the cause and effect. So you can see in sort of the black branch, A before B, and in the red branch, B. Red branch B before A. So that's what we call cause and effect. And we can also consider a past-future where both interact, what we say early and both interact late. Now, you know, if those detectors are space-like separated, then you would think that you could just transform one into the other. You could transform the cause and effect into the past-future. So if we try to do that just through a boost, let's That just through a boost. Let's try to line up the black branch here so that the A before B ends up occurring at this slice of simultaneity. You see that the red branch doesn't actually match up. So these really are two distinct scenarios. You can make one branch of the superpositions look like each other, but the other branch will never look the same. So now. So now, sort of, let's just sort of show some of the numeric results we got. So, what we're considering, just to remind you, some point-like UDW detectors, they interact at a single point in space. They're going to be identical. So that means that even if you trace out the control qubit, you're going to recover the standard UDW, sorry, the standard entanglement harvesting protocol. We're going to Protocol. We're going to say that detectors are separated by a distance s, and the time delay either between the early late or a before b or b before a, we're going to call that t. And they're going to couple through a cosine switching, which is nice because it's compact. And we can, it's straightforward to determine the regions in the parameter space where the detectors are space-like separated. So now the first result is comparing on the left a probabilistic mixture. Left a probabilistic mixture, and on the right, a coherent superposition of A before B and B before A. The black dots here are regions where we find zero concurrence, and so no entanglement harvested from the field. And if you're to the right of these green lines here, then the detectors are space look separated. So you can see that there is a significant enhancement in the regions of the parameter space where entanglement harvesting is possible when you have a coherent superposition. You have a coherent superposition, and what I mean by that statement is: you know, you can get entanglements in all of these regions. The detectors will become entangled after the interaction, but not if they're in a coherent superposition, but not if they're just in the standard entanglement harvesting protocol. And most notably, you actually get these little areas here where you can harvest entanglement in space-like separated regions with cosine switching in the parameter spaces we've considered. Switching in the parameter spaces we've considered. So, you know, this can be traced back to the sort of to the change in the transition probabilities. If you recall, the concurrence, which is an entanglement monotone, takes this form. And if you remember, it turns out in the perturbative case that the non-local correlations for the For the cause and effect, are actually equal to the probabilistic mixture, but the transition probability for the coherent superposition is actually less than in the case of the probabilistic mixture. It's a lot of words to just say these simple equations. And that's true in the perturbative case, regardless of the spatial profile or switching function. And so it looks like indefinite temporal ordering lowers. Indefinite temporal ordering lowers the transition probability of the detectors. That's due to those cross terms you saw. So then the next thing is to let's compare this cause and effect superposition to the past future and see, you know, how do those two, are those two situations actually distinct? And yes, they are. So on the left, we've got cause and effect, and on the right, we have past-future. And the entanglement harvesting protocol can distinguish. Entanglement harvesting protocol can distinguish between these two. And what's even more interesting is that, even in regions where the detectors are space-like separated, they can distinguish there are regions in that parameter space where they can be distinguished. So, for example, in this region of time delay separation. And that really does emphasize that those two situations are distinct, even though you can make one branch look like one branch in the superposition through a boost. It seems to It seems to be in terms of the parameters we looked at that only the cause and effects of position allows space-like entanglement harvesting at space-like separated distances. But it can distinguish between the two. So one might ask if this entanglement enhancement we're seeing overall is a result of the detector switching in some sense twice, even though they only switch once in each branch of the superposition. Branch of the superposition. So, you know, for some easy comparison, easy comparisons, we're going to take a look at this, what I call the double switch. And that's just the average of sort of the switching, A before B and B before A switching, or the early light. Those two are going to both be captured by this double switch. And if you want, here's a look at the density matrix. So we can already see that the entanglement harvesting protocol is going to be able to distinguish them because. To distinguish them because now the coherence term now has all four cross terms, whereas in the coherent superposition, it only had the 0, 0, and 1, 1 term. And interestingly, it actually is the average of the, what would be the transition, what would be the non-local correlations for the cause and effect plus with the non-local correlations for the past-future. So that's a sort of interesting mathematical result. And then, what does this look like? So, just for an easy comparison, or the comparison I chose to make is the cause and effect superposition. So the coherent superposition A before B and B before A to this double switch. And what we can see is that there are lots of regions in the parameter space where the entanglement harvesting protocol can distinguish between these. And the double switching case, at least again, And the double switching case, at least again, in the parameter space we've considered using cosine switching, we can't get space-like entanglement harvesting. So that seems to be fairly unique to this cause and effect superposition. So the final thing we looked at is going up beyond perturbative results. So everything I've shown it to before is you go through and you expand your time of And you expand your time evolution operator in a Dyson series, go expand to lowest order. But we can, if we use, if we couple the detectors with delta switching, we can actually get the final state of the detectors. What you've traced out the field can be known exactly without approximations. That's again, assuming we coupled the detectors with a Dirac delta swishing function. Now, one thing that you do. Now, one thing that we do need to do is to give them, we need to give the detectors a spatial smearing profile so that they're not just interacting with the field at one point in space-time. They're interacting at one time specifically, but that's averaged out over some spatial profile. And in order to keep our results analytic, we chose a Gaussian spatial profile given here. Now, by choosing a Gaussian spatial profile, we now no longer have the easy criteria to determine space lakes. Easy criteria to determine space-like separation. But that's not something that we really felt necessary to do in this case. It could be done in the future, but as of now, we're just looking at the Gaussian spatial profile. So again, smearing out the detectors in a Gaussian. So it's in 2017, it was shown that actually. It was shown that actually a pair of UDW detectors can't harvest entanglement profiles. This was by Peter and Eduardo. And that's so they cannot, a pair of UDW detectors that interact with a coherent state of a scalar field. And the vacuum is one such, is a coherent state. They can never become, they cannot harvest entanglement. They cannot become entangled. That's regardless of your spatial profile or your coupling strength or your energy gap. Coupling strength or your energy gap. So, you know, you'd think that this idea is already dead in the water, but it actually turns out that, well, as I said, we can cheat, but it's not really a cheat. We can get entanglement if we couple the detections to the field in a coherent superposition, both in the cause and effect, so A before B and B before A, in the past, future where they interact early and late. Future where they interact early and late in a superposition. So, this is quite interesting because, in each branch of the superposition, the detectors are on only once, but we can still get entanglement harvesting. Now, it turns out mathematically, this is because the interaction is complex enough to actually get around the no-go theorem. But still, in each branch of the superposition, the detectives are only once, and I at least think that raises some. And I at least think that raises some interesting philosophical questions about what a superposition really means. And then, to sort of comment on space-like separation, the Gaussians I've chosen here are quite wide in units of your interaction strength. It's nine, and the scale goes up to 20. So, I'd say that in both these graphs, the detectors are in causal contact. But it doesn't But it doesn't, and if you did go out much further, you would see that they couldn't, past a certain separation, they couldn't harvest entanglement anymore. So since there were no sort of interruptions, I guess I'm going to end fairly early, but and just sort of conclude. So this indefinite temporal ordering, what does it do? It enhances the entanglement harvesting, particularly in space-like separation. Particularly in space-like separate regions, at least in the perturbative case, and when you have the A before B and B before A, the cause and effect superposition. And if you have the early late superposition, you still see more regions in the parameter space where you can harvest entanglement. It does this by reducing the detector's transition probability, so reducing the local noise, and it doesn't seem to affect in the perturbative case the non-local correlation. Interpretive case, the non-local correlations. This is distinct from double switching, so it's not simply that the detectors are switching twice. It allows us to get around the no-thereum and harvest entanglement with adult switching because our interaction is now complex enough to allow that. And then some future work. If there's experimentalists, can something like this be realized in a laboratory setting? And then I think some other future work or some discussions. Future work or some discussions I'd like to have, or have you know, other people have is what is this actually saying about the field itself? Because although we know that entanglement harvesting says something about the field, about the entanglement structure of the field, I think that that's something that entanglement harvesting in general doesn't ever really get to. I answer what is it saying exactly. And so, thank you. So let's thank Laura and we have time for questions. So yes, Tim. That was very nice, Laura. Thanks. I'm just wondering if the reason you can get around this Nergo theorem, I mean, in some sense, I mean, in some sense, when you use this switch, the detectors are actually entangled themselves in that switch degree of freedom. Oh, yeah. Is it maybe that that is then getting translated into an enhancement of the harvesting? That's something I had forgotten to mention, so thank you for reminding me. Thank you for reminding me. One of the sort of the first things we saw when we saw the first things we checked when we saw the enhancement in the perturbative case was: can detectors become entangled through the switch itself if you remove the field altogether? And it can't. So it's not simply the switch. You do need the field in place and the interaction with the field to see this entanglement. Detector, detector, switch is not enough to allow this to happen. To allow this to happen. Okay. I don't know if that, yeah. Thanks. No, no, well, that was what I was wondering. So, so in the absence, so right. So in the absence. So So, in the absence of, I'm not sure which, okay. If you set this to the identity and grind through the calculations, the detectors don't become entangled. That's what I mean when I say you remove the field. I see. Okay. All right, thanks for that. No problem. And we have another question from Ahmed. Hi, Laura. Great talk. I just have a couple of questions. I guess the first one would be a follow-up. So if I remember correctly, one of the sort of the punchlines of the delta switching no-go theorem paper that you mentioned was the fact that the unitary that describes. The unitary that describes the time evolution of the system is the exponential of a Schmidt rank one operator. So, is that why, like, does that no longer hold? Yeah, that's what I mean when I say that the interaction is complex enough. It's no longer a rank-wenchman operator or the exponential of a rank-wenchman operator as soon as you add in this control. Okay, that makes sense. Okay, that makes sense. And then if you could go back to slide, I think 25 or 26. Yeah. So 25, so. Yeah, is there a way to think about the different, like the structure or the patterns that arise where you think about these two different situations of why you have regions or islands where you can have entanglement in one case and why you don't in the other case? And why you don't in the other case? So I haven't thought as much about this as I would like. I mean, you can clearly, you can see it, particularly in this past future, that you get sort of the biggest bands at multiples when your time delay is sort of multiples of your interaction strength. And I'm thinking that's some sort of, I think that's some sort of resonant effect with the With the cosine swishing itself. In terms precisely what's different about this, I'm not sure. It must be, perhaps it's catching up to its own signal. Because if you remember in this graph, it's the past-future. So they interact, you know, once here in one branch and then later on, if time goes up. And perhaps that's what's going on, is that it's catching up to its own superposition. Up to its own superposition. It's a bit funny to think about these superpositions. Yeah, I agree, but I think that's a good point. Yeah. I don't know if that probably doesn't answer your question because it's sort of difficult to see exactly what's going on physically. I mean, not entirely, but if it's still sort of an open problem, that's fine. Also, sorry, one last thing. Now that you mentioned it, was there a particular mentioned it. Was there a particular reason that you chose the cosine switching as opposed to some Gaussian switching? Yeah, so we chose cosine switching because it's compact. So it doesn't have tails that go to infinity. It's compact, so you can tell exactly when the detector is off outside of this range. So we can easily draw in these lines without needing to worry about when does the interaction get small enough that the tails don't really matter. Small enough that the tails don't really matter. But if we've actually done this, the perturbative stuff with cosine switching, or sorry, with Gaussian switching, and you see similar patterns. You see the enhancement of entanglement in the parameter space if you're in a coherent superposition versus a probabilistic mixture. Okay, that makes sense. Thank you so much.
