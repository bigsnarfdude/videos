Thanks for showing up. Yeah, so I want to talk about relative group trisections. So we saw some trisection stuff earlier with Shandeva's talk and Karen's talk. So just happy for that to get everyone primed on group trice or relative trisections. And basically the first part of my talk, we're just going to be going in a little bit more detail about the stuff that Shinto talked about. Namely, like what is a relative trisection, the diagrams. We're going to be dealing with diagrams. The diagrams. We're going to be dealing with diagrams mainly and how to construct Four Manifold and the Hope and Book on the Boundary. So let me write down some goals that I want to say. So one, I would like to just understand relative trisections of smooth forms. Try sections of a smooth form manifold with boundary. Try the sections. And the new stuff in the book. Okay, so it's just preliminaries. Then I'm going to talk about how to transfer that data into a group theory setting, so we've got relative group trisections. And then I also want to talk about want to talk about some questions about stabilizations and destabilizations of open books. So I should say induced open books. Destabilizing really the relative trisection itself. Okay, and then I realized after I was doing that that these are both work in progress. This one is with Jason Joseph from One is with Jason Joseph, who is one of our lovely organizers, and Patrick McFadden. And this one is joint with Thomas Kindred. And they're both works in progress. And I realized that I'm going to be talking about why I'm frustrated with these two. Why I'm frustrated with these two questions. So I'm just basically gonna be as a complaint for you guys. So, just a heads up. Okay, great. Okay, so let's just understand relative trisections. Let's start over here. Okay, so here's a relative trisect. It's easier in the relative setting to start off with the diagram, I think. Okay. And I love drawing this picture because it's just so ridiculous. Okay, so a relative trisection diagram. We have a surface and we have triples of curves. Okay, and pairwise, they all look like this. At least, up to handle slides and diffeomorphisms of your surface. This is the standard diagram, their standard position. Standard pair for a relative trisection diagram. Relative trisection diagram G K P B relative trisect D and these integers give us number of parallel curves is I'm just going to write these down. I don't really I'm just going to write these down. I don't really care about the indexing too much. That's the number of parallel curves, and then up here, the number of transverse curves, g minus k plus p plus p minus 1, and then this is p, and this is. Okay. So this is the standard pair. So, this is the standard pair, and there is a third collection of curves. And those are just, if we're not looking at that, those gamma curves, which are the third collection, they're just sort of like going all over. But if we chose those together with the red and the blue curves, we can make them look like this. Okay, so there's a theorem. So, this is. So, this is myself, Dave Gay, and I mean nothing else to say though. So, every compact, smooth, four manifold in what's a relative trisection. Okay, so I'll do an inferior. I'll do a proper example in a bit, but I also want to just say how we construct the four manifold from this because it's going to tell us about the open book on the boundary. Okay. So we take this, this is a pretty standard construction from the closed case, if you've seen it. Closed case, if you've seen it. So we take our surface across a disk and we attach a three-manifold, which is a cobordism from this high genus surface. And then we sort of compress along the alpha curves to get this cobordism from sigma to a lower genus surface that I call sigma alpha. So in particular, this is a genus P surface. A genus P surface, because they're G minus P currently. Yeah, and so it's a cobordism where we're really just compressing all the way down, and we do that with the beta curves as well, and with the gamma curves. Okay. And so, this is what everyone's been calling a spine of a trisection. This uniquely determines a trisection. Uniquely determined the trisection, so there's a standard way to create the rest of the four manifold from this. And with the boundary setting, there's sort of a little bit more work to do. Here we have to, this is now a GNSP surface, this is a genus P surface. So we can glue in a sort of standard or an abstract GNSP surface cross-interval along here. Along here. And it turns out that this is unique, this gluing. So there's only one way to do this. So there's no ambiguity there. And then we do that over here as well. And over here as well. Okay, so already we can sort of see this open book decomposition where we have this surface fibrin over S1. And then And then we sort of have to worry about filling in this part on the boundary, which amounts to basically filling in a neighborhood of the fiber knot, which is the boundary of your surface. So we do that on the boundary. Now we have a closed stream manifold on the boundary, and now we can just glue in In some number of S1 cross B3 because each of these pockets has sort of like a hole in it, and the boundary of those pockets connects on S1 cross S2. So it's a similar construction where we do this uniquely by Laudebach and Cornerooo, but we just have to take a little bit more care in doing this on the okay, and sometimes it's nice to have a picture similar to my I have a picture similar to what Chiboto wrote. I like to think of this as an aerial view of my four manifold and something like this. Okay, and the boundary stuff is really just like this. Boundary stuff is really just like this piece. So like that's that's the boundary data and then once we glue those pieces in then we can fill in with the coordination pieces. Okay. Cool, yeah. So every four years, we're going to have to do So every four-manifold boundary has one. It doesn't matter how many boundary components we have. We can do this. And on each boundary component, we're going to get an open look decomposition. So this is another theorem that. So this is. Originally, this was David Robbs. Kirby, and then myself and multiple boundary components. So a relative trash section, and we'll say diagram in parentheses. So this will always induce an open book, decomposition boundary. Moreover, what's really nice is that you can pick any open book upon the boundary, and it will induce that given open book. So you can sort of choose what you want to have in other operations. You can choose all the bus on the battery maps so that's really nice. So that's really nice. Okay, so I now want to just give an example because the example of how to find the open book is going to really play a part in sort of the group trisection and this destabilization thing I mentioned. So here's an example. So here's a one, one One zero to relative cross section of B4 Okay, so on the surface and You see that green? Okay. Okay, so here's how we get, here's the algorithm for determining any open book, induced to open book by any relative transeption that I get. So we start off with We start off with our surface and one collection of curves. Okay, and what we're doing, what we're going to do is find a collection of properly embedded arcs in the boundary surface, which is Boundary surface, which is the page, so I'm calling that sigma alpha, which cut it up into a disk, and we want to see sort of what happens to those collections of arcs as you go around this S1 direction. Okay, so we choose a collection of arcs. Since it's a collection of arcs down here, we can push those to the central fiber. Okay, and now I want to see if I can realize. And now I want to see if I can realize this arc on the next surface in the boundary. So this is sigma beta. And beta is right here. So when we compress along the beta curve to get to that page, sigma beta, we actually do still get an arc in the vector. So, nothing terribly exciting here because this arc also lives on that page. Okay, cool. And now we want to go to the next surface in the boundary. So our R sigma of gamma. Hate that. We have to compress along this curve, but now this arc does not live in the surface sigma gamma. So we have to find an arc which does, and we do that by sliding our beta arc, our blue arc, over a beta curve. So we take this one. A beta curve. So we take this one and we slide it over here. And now this new arc also lives in sigma beta, but now it also lives in sigma gamma. So now we have a green arc that sort of lives in the right surface. Okay, and now finally, I want to come back around to understand the monodromy because you know sigma alpha glued back up. There's a gamma arc of alpha, sort of the same thing that was happening in this step, so we have to do another slide over a gamma arc, a gamma curve. To realize this arc on the sigma alpha surface. So after we do a slide, it looks like this. Okay, so now we have if we compress along the alpha curve surface and Surface, and we started with an arc, which goes straight down, and we ended with an arc, which sort of picks up a dane twist. Okay, so the induced open book is the Android open book with a dane twist along the central. Okay, and there were choices, like we made choices in slides, and those turns out those don't matter. So it will always give you a Give you an open book up to conjugation. Okay, and yeah, so this is a nice hands-on algorithm. And I guess I'll say it right now, but I want to see if the group theory can pick up this algorithm. Third, my big goal. Okay. Okay, so um that's the way tracks. What's that? A church. What's that? The one that looks like it's a ledge. Oh, that's just a lid. Yeah. This looks a little more challenging. Alright, yeah. Got really attached to it. Okay, cool. So now I want to just introduce the idea of a relative group trisection. Root trisection and this is again modeled after the closed case that was handled by Aaron Hebron's and then And then Dave and Rob. Okay, and again the goal is to introduce this boundary stuff. Okay, so basically we take this picture and we have all these pieces. Here's essential fiber, x1, x. x1, x2, x3, we have intersections, and let's call this sigma alpha sigma beta, sigma gamma, and we just hit everything with pi1. Okay, so pi1 sigma, and then we get homomorphisms which are given by inclusion. So then we get pi1 into sigma alpha. Sigma alpha sigma beta sigma of gamma. Okay. And since the spine of the trisect determines everything, these maps should determine sort of everything. And it turns out that they do. I'm not working the handle. Is it Sigmap with a page? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Thank you. So we want the compression volumes right here, the covariance ones. So let's say CL5 C bit C gamma. Thank you. One two. 2 plus 3, and so we get this nice community cube of the shots. And all these maps are subjective, and this gives us a nice sort of group theoretic way of seeing the trisection data. Of seeing the trisection data and what we want to do is just now define this in the absence of the topology. We just want to define the groups with surjections so that we can recover the four manifold, the tricep formana fold in particular. Oh, yeah. Uh oh yeah. Thank you. Head of the game. What's that? Yes, sorry, I have a big game. Sorry. Yeah. Okay, so we can find a relative group trisection. Okay, so we basically just have groups with three active homeomorphisms and CN these are going into K's K's and A to G, some group G. Okay, so this, these are all, right, we're taking, these are supposed to be like the same thing as pi one of the compression bodies, but this is a cobordism where we're just sort of compressing all the curves. So these are all free groups. Free. N n is rank n with n is g plus p plus p minus 1. And these are also free because all of these cases are just four-dimensional neighborhoods of a bunch of circles. And this is actually also free, but we really want to remember some. But we really want to remember something about the fact that this is coming from the like this should be pi one of the sort of switchback group. So here S G B this is really x i's y i's and then j's such that the commutation that the commutators of the XIYI's are equal to the product of the commutators, or sorry, equal to the products of the Zjs. Okay. And what we need is these to be surjective homomorphisms. So maybe F1, F2, F3. F2 F3 FIs are surjective homomorphisms, subjections such that and we need to make sure that f i of the z's are non-zero in And really, this can get pretty like all the notation because when you're remembering boundary information, there's just a lot more things to keep track of. And so I'm lightly fudging this a bit, but yeah, we just want to make sure that we're able to get. We're able to get push-ups for each of the faces of this indicator. Well, we need to have to be subjective. There is sort of one more where One more where we want to write CN as want to write CN there's I sort of don't want to write the other technological condition because it's but it involves remembering that CN is really a compression body not company sort of remembering the splitting of the boundary somehow yeah kind of it's like remember Somehow? Yeah, kind of. It's like remembering what data comes from the boundary and what data is sort of remaining from the interior performance. Is that kind of picked up by knowing that the maps from CN to ZK are subjective? No, everything's sort of just determined by these three. The sparse maps, yeah. Yeah. Just to make sure, so Just to make sure, so when you have a format over the boundary, then you have a realized trisection, but is this a trisection of a group G, or is it a trisection of the group G with some group or something? Oh yeah, no, yeah, so okay, so this is a trisection of the group G. So and that's sort of exactly the point of this. So um this is a Is a relative group trisection of the group G, finally, presented group G. And it makes sense when you're talking about like the or manifold with boundary to say, okay, it's trisected relative to its boundary, right? Because you're given the manifold, it has a boundary. Here, you're just given the group G. Here you're just given the group G and sort of this data. And I guess the question is like relative to what? And sort of that's the problem. That's the issue. We know from the trisect theory that this induces the open book. So in particular, it induces a group which is probably one of the founding. And the question is, is like, how do we recreate the monodromy, which is not enough, in this setting? Okay, so I want to say. Alright, I want to say, but not really get into is um so this actually constructs well first off every finally presented group emits a E emits a E permits A G K P B relative group transection relative group trisection percent GKKB and so we have this sort of we're sort of just finishing out this bijection that was in the original group trisection paper between Between relative transactions. So we can hit this with pi 1, so it's sort of like a map G to group trisections. And the thing is that we can construct the four manifold from this data. Like given a group trisection, construct a manifold, which induces a A manifold which induces a relative, or which has a relative trice section. Okay, and we're really like modeling the group in the closed setting. So we do have to use like the Poincaré conjecture and the sphere theorem to really get, construct all the pieces of your manifold. Okay. But I don't want to sort of go into into the proof of that because I The proof of that, because, like I said at the beginning, I really just want to complain about why the boundary is sort of difficult. Yeah, good. Okay. Can you say a little bit more about the there's some condition that you missed out on blocks? Yeah, some condition on block? Okay. So when you're constructing this compression body in the Body in the manifolds. Okay, so constructing this compression body, we're saying, okay, compress along this curve, so we get a cobordism from there to surface. Surface. And we sort of want to remember that there were generators of pylon of the surface that sort of still remain in the game. It does emit a trisect close toward that hole. Now you're saying that the not arbitrary, I mean for some GKP. I mean you can take a normal one, puncture it, introduce, like make p equals zero and b equals one. There's something in the theorem that's There's something in the theorem that some data is missing. Like you can take, as Rob was saying, just take the closed manifold and B and B will be zero, right? That will be a relative group trisection. And you just remove the ball. Is that actually missing? I'm missing what makes this special and different from a closed group trisection. No, it's not a closed surface. You want to say P and B are non-zero? Oh yeah, B is definitely not. Sorry, yeah. I know I'm being pretty sloppy. So B is definitely positive. P can be zero. I think what Jason said is important about the service. First, if there's a free group. Yeah, this is a free group, not a service group. Are PMB given? Like an Ethereum or are they? Like in the theorem or I think it's really two theorems. And you also want to say every relative trisect can be group trisected and vice versa. The fact that every group admits one is like a separate tab. Yeah, that's, you know, doesn't want to move forward to that. I guess these are some separate sequence. So yeah, so every, I mean, we could just trivially make one like Rob was saying, like. Make one like Rob was saying, like, why is this different? Well, we could puncture a closed trisection and get a relative group trisect. But for every, you give me any relative trisection, we can create the group trisect. But if you give me GKP and B, P and B, and a commutative cube like this, then we can construct the format of pole. The format of pole. So if you do mean different values for P and V that aren't just zero, like we can't construct a format pole at this point. This is maybe off-the-wall question, but like, so in general, it's like really, like, algebra, at least for me, algebraically, it's really hard to construct group conceptions. You know, like if I pick a group of, like, just from your experience working with examples, like, do you think it's any easier in this form? Not for me. Yeah, I get it. Yeah, I get when I talk to like geometric group theorists about this, they ask me like, okay, so what did you prove about groups? It's like, nothing. You're supposed to prove something about quantum solving. So that's how I feel. It's a lot of fun. What will the quantifiers on the playing paper? It was beautiful as well as you might say it's fine. So given A GK PB relative group transition of G. So that means a means a commutative cube which satisfies rejections and that every face of this cubes are push-out. We can construct a four-manifold which we're denoting manifold associated to this group trisection. With GKP relative transition and its construction is unique. Very first time I was on Ethereum. What is that? Yeah, I mean the same I mean this I guess Jason was right and Rob were right in saying that like it's not this I guess this statement saying that every finally presented group admits a relative group trisection isn't probably GK and you don't have to worry about the quantifier Yeah, because it's like for some for some GK. Because the existence statements for trisections is and relative trisections is that every four manifold admits a trisection for some but the point is you're saying b just for b greater than zero you can't just yeah for b greater than zero okay Okay. So sort of to Sarah's point, I want my example. That's the group trace section. Yeah, yeah. That's fair. It seems like people aren't too happy with this one anyway. No, it's okay. Oh, also, sorry, it's not to tell you that it's just who you're talking about, but are you going to go? You are starting to answer. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I've forgotten what you have. I wanted to know. The bullet point just says CN, and I wanted to know what that means. Right. Without Russia didn't want to get into the details, so just to do that. So, if we compress here, then down in this, and this is also related to the boundary building, on this surface, the dual curve has disappeared. It just disappears in the surface. We need to look at like pi 1 of this surface. So it just doesn't exist, right? But in the compression body, this is still a perfectly good element of pi 1. And we want to remember that this, we basically want to say that this dual curve goes to a generator of C. So if So if, say, we compress along xi, then these are going to be like the duals. So we want to say that this is yi together with sort of the page page, staff, and exit trace. The condition that those things are free. Yeah, there's a condition that the image of the appropriate things are sort of generators of this frequency. Okay, cool. So so I think the alpha beta selections submit this to it. That's the CK is free, right? That's the push-outs are free. Yeah, so with that. Yeah, it's worth it. So what it is is like we have to remember: so this is free. So, this is free. This is what correspond to the elements on the page. So the other end of the compression body. And we know that we can sort of, like you said, we have this wedge, alpha beta. We know how to glue that in uniquely like page cross eye. HROSI What a delta and epsilon? What a delta and epsilon again? I want to put it in the middle of the data. Yeah, so in the in the so for example in this picture, if these are part of your trisection diagram, this would be part of the page, which sort of doesn't get compressed at all. And so these will not be in the kernel of So these will not be in the kernel of, these generators over here will not be in the kernel of those sort of homomorphisms. And so these, like in the image of the surface including into this compression body, these are going to be the delta epsilon. We sort of want to remember, again, like which ones came from page, sort of like the generators for those. Sort of like the generators for the page. If you're given a group, you don't have this information about the page. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's why we have to remember the presentation. That's like the algebraic version of containing the variation of the models. You start at the surface of Genus G of the set. Have a whole bunch of helicopters, a whole bunch of stuff, and then you have a surface of one. Of stuff, you have a surface that will use. You can kill a whole bunch of different things. And now you have to have an automatic diffimorphism between the two. Yeah, that's actually like that's giving you that somehow varied in this position and that vary. So, yeah, I guess I like I said I didn't want to go too much into the details of like the maps. I sort of wanted to talk about the boundary and the open book and to see if we can get or like why it's difficult to introduce or to preserve boundary information. Okay, so before I but before I do that, let's Okay, so before I do that, let's just do an example. This is sort of like Sarah was saying, like, is it easier to think about group trisections? I mean, it's easier to for me to describe to you the trisection than it is to do the group trisection. Trisection than it is to do the group trisection. So here is trisection diagram And these dots are supposed to be identified giving its genus. Giving its genus okay. So from this we get the so this is now a group track. So this is now a group trisection S2 I'll just say P, this is a 2 1 colour 0 2 relative trisection. Okay, so now this is x 1, y or x 2, y 2. X2 are two C1 C2 such that that relation holds. Okay, and f of F one of X one is zero F two of X Y two is zero and zero and f three of x i y i x one sorry these are x i's y i's x i y z one is um and and This is telling us what's in the kernel, and we have to remember. So, for example, on this map, we want to remember that y1 and y2 will go to generators in the C sequence. Okay, so that's my That's my example for now. And now I want to start talking about the boundary since I'm out of time. Okay, so if you do the monodromy algorithm on this trisect diagram, you'll get You'll get two ding twists along this curve. So you twist along this curve, so that means that you have that arc and that arc for if you run the monitoring out of the question. Okay. And so the idea is that you can use the same thing. And so the idea of taking the sort of trisected manifold and going to get like this commutative diagram, that was done before on three manifolds with Hagar splittings. And you get so given a Hagar splitting and two. Here we can get what's called a two-split home. What's called a two-split homomorphism, basically, where we again just take a pipeline of everything. But we can also do the construction the other way. Okay, so the idea is like we want to Idea is like we want to be able to induce this splitting on the boundary so that we get sort of it makes sense relative to what? Or relative to pi 1 of the boundary. And so this is all hidden in the trisect data because pi 1, because we know that we get an open book on the boundary, and we can actually get this. Actually, get this to give us a inner splitting of the lens space, L21. And so the question is: where in And then the group trisection is the sort of induced AI splitting on the boundary coming from the open book decomposition. Where is that hidden? And the difficulty is the fact that we do the monodromy algorithm based on arcs, properly embedded arcs in the boundary. And sorry, did you mean H1 and accept H2? Oh, yeah, definitely. Thank you. Yeah, so um yeah, so it's recovering the monogramming algorithm is again difficult because the arcs, they just don't live in in pi one of any. In pi one of any. So we're playing around with sort of the fundamental group void to sort of encode these arcs and these handle slides on these arcs so that we can recover this induced Hagar splitting function from the open book. And yeah, and Yeah, and so there's this other half to my talk about stabilizations and relative stabilizations. And I sort of wanted to use these group trisections to understand like when can you take a four-manifold that's been trisected, relatively trisected, and Trisect it and destabilize it in the sense that Shintaro kind of mentioned if you know that the boundary of the trisection coming from an open book that is a hop fleming. So I was hoping to pick up some hop fleming data in this relative group trisection setting. But I guess I'll stop there because I don't want to keep going for references. I don't want to keep going forever. Questions? Does the recovering the boundary become easier if there's just one binding component? Because then you don't have maybe formally don't think about it. You get 2p plus b minus 1rx. So, if you put the base point on that binding component, I mean, I was thinking the problem is like, where's the base point for fire one? And you've got disconnect and bind them, and that's got if the binding connecting is based on the binding, and those arcs go from binding to finding, but they can't come back by or teaching or something on the binding. They're sort of pyramid, everyone's pywant. Yeah, they they are, but still. They are, but still, somehow the fact that you're tracing through monodromy algorithm doing the handle size, it still gets tricky. It's not just the fact that there are multiple values. Other questions? All right, thanks again. Can we do a five-minute break? I'm so sorry. I was meeting with Connie and we were talking enough, and then I lost track of time, and then I was like, oh no. I assume that these are yours. I was just reading. Sorry, I love you. Sorry, I lost the fact that you gotta go find somewhere. Somehow, you're all. Okay, should I just log in? Yes. That's true. I just discreet email. I'm gonna log into the channel lighter. It's no searching back to myself. I don't want to remember. I don't have to go to my phone. I'm just saying you send some notification to your phone, and my phone doesn't do anything. So, okay. We needed like a CFA about it. It was like, that's right. That was worrying about it. I see that.  So it's just my white wardens on working on it. I know like 12. Yeah, yeah. I would walk like five kilometers. Yeah, so like you're right, that like these are very close. Anyway, I don't know if you can't subscribe, but I won't have a little bit of a data. I mean, that makes sense. On the other hand, now you have to send down the little problem, maybe not. I'm used to just like the standard. I would say that like the only circle.
