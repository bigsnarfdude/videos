That's in November after the election, which is a political issue, unfortunately. So that's all, it's an exciting time to be at Pfizer. I'm working on some of our COVID-19 things. But I thought I would start off with, I think, perhaps for people that are junior in their careers wondering about where to go, it might be interesting to touch on my story a little bit. I'm an applied mathematician. I did a PhD at UCL. PhD at UCL in London, and then I did a postdoc at UNC Chapel Hill. I've been at Pfizer since 2012. And I've worked in a variety of diseases, mostly metabolic diseases, until the beginning of this year, where I switched to leading our efforts in inflammation and immunology. That was in January. And I thought, well, I'm going to have to learn about immunology. It turns out we all have to learn about immunology this year. So that's been an interesting experience. As part of that, we're building a COVID-19 in-host model for. An in-host model for the immune response to COVID-19, which, for anyone who's been following the disease and what happens to people who have it, maybe people who experience this themselves, unfortunately, the most deleterious consequences appear to be, although we're still learning about the science around this, appear to be an improper immune response to the infection. So you definitely want an immune response, but sometimes that can get out of hand. Out of hand, and so we're working on a model that we're trying to do as openly as possible. If anyone wants to open up our model and see what it looks like and see what these types of QSP models, as Helen mentioned, look like, you can go to that GitHub address and find it there. When I'm not having my life consumed in multiple ways by COVID-19, I'm working on building models of diseases, autoimmune diseases, mainly of irritable bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis. And then aside from And then, aside from actually building and applying these models, which can be great fun. It's Pfizer, that's not something you just go away and do in a silo. It's like anyone building these models, actually, in academia or otherwise, the most important and enjoyable part to me about it is communicating with experts, whether they be clinicians, patients, or biologists, about what should be in your model. But when I'm not, when I'm thinking about some of the bigger problems that maybe Helen sort of Some of the bigger problems that maybe Helen sort of touched on, and that this is related to that. I'm really interested in how we make what we call virtual populations. That's basically a set of parameter sets that looks like a real population. That can be a computationally intensive time task, rather. So, doing that efficiently is kind of crucial. And then, just related to that, actually, is how do we quantify how much information is in the data sets that we inform our models with? That can be really important when I'm suggesting to. To biologists to do an experiment, I want to suggest an experiment where I get the most information out of. And so measuring 100 points at steady state is a lot less information than measuring three or four points where you have the beginning, middle, and end of a dynamic time course. But how do we go ahead and quantify the difference between those two things? And probably like a lot of people in the world at the moment, my current hobby is signing my kids into all their online learning tools in a day, which is driving me mad. A day, which is driving me mad, so I'm venting. Um, so I'm going to do a little case study of some work that we did that was uh published for the most part, and then I'm going to circle back around to some sort of more career-focused things. So, this will give you a sense, hopefully, of the kind of questions we take on and the impact that we have. So, this is a story about fructose. A lot of you will have perhaps heard about fructose as something bad. You want to look at the back of the things you're buying in the supermarket, and if it says high fructose corn syrup, you want to put it back according to. Corn syrup, you want to pull it back according to commonly perceived wisdom. And that's actually nutritional advice that, unlike some nutritional advice, that has a strong, not only epidemiological association, but also it appears that there might be some causative evidence for that. That is to say that fructose consumption does have, is linked to deleterious metabolic effects and can drive things like type 2 diabetes and non-alcohol. And non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. That's what the NAFL acronym stands there for there. And it seems like it's causative because there have been studies where they took people off fructose and then they started giving them back fructose in their diet and that drove up metabolites in the bloodstream that we know are strong risk factors for those sorts of diseases. Fructose is metabolized by an enzyme called ketohexokinase. That's mainly in the liver. And it's an interesting one. And it's an interesting one in that there are subjects, there are people walking around in the world who have deficient copies of KHK and completely unable to metabolize fructose. And they might not even know about it because it seems like they are perfectly healthy. They actually only ever really used to get diagnosed by turning up at a clinic saying, I noticed that my urine smells kind of sweet. I looked it up and it's, I think I'm diabetic. And the doctor does a glucose tolerance. And the doctor does a glucose tolerance test and finds out, oh, you're not diabetic. And then the differential diagnosis was missing KHK. Now you might get these days, you might get genotype for it, but it appears to be perfectly safe. So immediately someone like Pfizer says, or other people say, well, hey, this fructose is bad. The enzyme that metabolizes it is safe to not have. So perhaps we should develop an inhibitor for it. And that's what we did. And that's what we did. So then we to support the program here for our KHK inhibitor, we built this model you see on the right. It's a kind of simple model where we basically follow fructose when you eat it or drink it, where it goes in your body. Some of it goes just into the plasma floating around in your bloodstream. A lot of it goes to your liver. And so we built this model. And the question was, the question was, when we develop our drugs, The question was: When we develop our drug and take it to the clinic, what do we expect to see? So, there's some acronyms here which I'll talk you through. This at the bottom here, this was our first clinical development plan where we had this first in human study. That's what FIH stands for, single ascending dose. So, in our first in-human studies, you like to give a small dose and then you want to increase it up to the point where you think it might be actually worthwhile for a patient. And the reason for you do that is purely safety, you don't want to start off with. Want to start off with a high dose. So you start off with a very small dose and you expect nothing to happen, and hopefully, nothing happens. Then you keep going up and going up, and this way, you hopefully accumulate some confidence in the safety. And then a multiple ascending dose where you actually just don't give a single dose, you give most bulk to them. And then we were going to do this imaging study, magnetic resonance spectroscopy study, to look at what was happening in the liver of these people treated with our drug. And then we were going to declare proof of mechanism. That's what POM stands for. Mechanism. That's what POM stands for. And the idea behind that was you want to know that your drug is getting to the target and actually having an effect. Because you might see effects, but it might be for some completely other reason. You know, we design a little drug and you think it's specific to the thing you meant it to bind for, but when you get into real patients, you can find out suddenly that you're inhibiting something you never even dreamed of or having some other effects that were not what you intended. So we were going to do this imaging study. So, we were going to do this imaging study and then we were going to move on with our plan. That imaging study was going to be really expensive and difficult. And so, what we ended up doing was using this systems model and the data from these earlier studies to say we must be inhibiting KHK in the liver. And so, this is an example of the workflow that we use. I actually built this fructose model and this virtual population, that's what VPOP stands for, purely based on data I found in the literature. And then And then, what we ended up doing was I took novel data. No one had had a KHK inhibitor before, so we didn't know what was going to happen when we gave this to humans. We took that, and from that, I selected a subset of the virtual patients in this population that were actually consistent with this novel perturbation. So, you have a set of simulations, and I can immediately discount some as not being realistic in the light of this new data. And then we use these new parameter sets or virtual patients. New parameter sets or virtual patients to infer what was going on in the model in those cases. And so here's just kind of a picture on the right of it: is that we have this, I think this model has 15 parameters or maybe a few more, excuse me. We would have all of these initially, and then we get some new data. I throw out a lot. I keep some. So actually, this new data was, this is just a cartoon, but this was kind of, I think I threw out all but 10% or something. And then I run simulations with these new parameter sets. With these new parameter sets. And so these are what those simulations look like. You can ignore the colours for a second and just look at the blue line here. And we said, so, well, in the model, I can run out, I can inhibit KHK in the liver, hepatic inhibition, that's what that means, by certain amounts. So in the model, if I inhibit it by 85%, then in my virtual population, all my simulations say, well, in those cases, you get about a two-fold increase in the fructatase you see in the bloodstream. Increase in the fructose you see in the bloodstream, or maybe even up to a six-fold. Okay. And so then, if in the clinic, in our top doses, we saw about a 10-fold increase. So the moment you saw a 10-fold increase here, in the case of the blue box, you scroll across, you go across here, and you find, wow, I can't find any simulations where I can get a 10-fold increase in the plasma without inhibition in the liver of above 90%. And so that gave us confidence that we were hitting the target in the liver. Confidence that we were hitting the target in the liver. There was no way that we could imagine in our model that you could replicate the observations without inhibiting the target by lots and lots in the liver. The different colours here correspond to what we call the KPEU. That basically is just when you have a drug in the bloodstream, it's not necessarily going to be in the same concentration in different organs or tissues. And so, this factor here, if it's one, it's the same. If it's 10, it's tenfold higher in the liver than in the bloodstream. And that was an uncertainty. Delivered them in the bloodstream. And that was an uncertainty for the program. But it turns out that uncertainty is not really impactful for this question because no matter whether you look at the green or the blue, for the fold changes that we were seeing in our clinical data, we were confident we had a lot of inhibition in the liver. Okay, so that was the boiled down version. It wasn't quite as simple as that. What did we really do? You can check this out in our paper, which I can send people the link to if they're interested in. We did a lot of fitting on the In we did a lot of fitting on the left. This is just some of the fitting that we did. The blue is data that I have scoured the literature for. I had to translate a lot of papers from different languages actually, because a lot of these studies were from when, from older papers, not that's the reason they're in different languages, but from older papers where people were really interested in this question. And this question went out of vogue in the sort of 80s or something. And so I had papers from the 50s and they had like case. Papers from the 50s and had like cases. You know, some of these are individual people that they identified that had this genetic condition of missing KHK. And then once we've got, once we've fit our model, we actually then validated it by finding some other data sets, which I'm not going to go through, but just to show here visually, you can see the model in gray is kind of agreeing with the data in blue. Okay, so moving on to the more career, so that's the To more career, so that's a top-level fancy for you. But what do I actually do in a day? And I'm caveating this by saying this is pre-COVID-19 because hopefully, by the time you're all interested in a position to really join Pfizer, you'll be able to, that'll be post-COVID-19 and more back to this baseline. So, okay. 8.45 to 9 a.m. I get into work. I open up my overnight simulation results and I kind of marvel how did I manage to spend so many CPU hours generating garbage results. Oftentimes at Oftentimes at FISA, we'll have invited speakers, which is great. They could be academics, they could be from other companies, they could be biologists, they could be other mathematicians, other modelers. 10 to 12, I'm going to have to try and fix up my simulation results, what went wrong. So I'm going to try and scour the literature. I'm probably going to confuse myself about the biology or the physiology. Lunchtime, I'm going to spend the entire time complaining to my modeling colleagues about MATLAB. After lunch, I'll get back to my After lunch, I get back to my computer and find actually my MATLAB complaints were ill-founded. It was my error, but I'll still complain it's a little bit slow. We do spend a portion of our time interviewing people. And I'm going to come on to, I've put this in here because I'm going to come on to the do's and don'ts of interviews just very quickly. We'll have lots of project team meetings. That's a good opportunity to ask about my biology confusion from earlier in the day. Maybe it's actually a question that's on the whole project team's mind, or maybe the biology. Whole project team's mind, maybe the bias will tell me, Oh, you really should look at this paper. Maybe they'll maybe it'll prompt a longer conversation. Um, working at Pfizer, you will have some bureaucracy to deal with, just like anywhere else. Um, uh, it's probably a slightly more company, I would guess, but it's not too bad. Um, and then if I am working post-five o'clock, I will try and fix my model and restart the optimization routine. And so, all of this is. And so, all of this is I put up here because I think for those people that are those PhD students or postdocs on the line, at least for me, this was kind of familiar to my day working in academia. Day to day, it's probably not as different as I thought it was going to be working at Pfizer. Okay, so wrapping up quickly, I'm probably out of time a little bit, but what do we look for when hiring? This will change a little bit depending on what level. Of course, technical ability is important. Probably if you are interested. You are interested, and you're probably you can judge that for yourself based on the job description if you meet that. It does not necessarily, we're not necessarily worried about a whole long list of publications, but several are definitely for postdocs and full-time positions, several are definitely useful to assess where you are. Communication and presentation skills, really important. Disease area knowledge: if we're hiring for a particular area, and I think we have a postdoc. Area, and I think we have a post-doc opening in oncology. That's a plus, but it's not required. It's really hard to find modelers in general, and it's even harder to find modelers that have been working in a specific disease area at the right time, that you know, that they're reaching the end of their PhD just as we're hiring, for example. Again, presentation and communication skills, experience and enthusiasm for interdisciplinary collaborations. Did I mention communication skills? It's really important because. It's really important because that's the way that you are going to get judged ultimately in your interview process. That's not to say that people that, if you're sat here on this call thinking, wow, that's not a skill of mine, I think you should take that as a positive because you know what you need to work on. And certainly it's a learned skill. And so I'm happy to talk to people more about that if they feel like that could hold them back because it shouldn't. It's something that everyone can work on. Okay, when do we? That everyone can work on. Okay, when do we hire? So I wanted to mention that we do hire undergraduates for summer internships. We have had at least two, maybe three for the last six or seven years in our group of a variety of backgrounds. You probably want to think about that for January and March. This year they were remote, and I'm guessing that'll be the case next year, although I don't know. And that was harder, but I think the students still had a good I think the students still had a good experience. And they'll do sort of small modeling projects and get a taste of what we do. PhD students, we hire for postdocs, of course. We do have industry postdocs, or we sometimes hire for full-time positions. That'll depend a little bit on your background, where you are, where the job market is to some extent. Sometimes we just have a hard time finding postdocs. If postdocs and PhD students apply, even if we don't. Even if we don't tell people which are which, usually postdocs do shine through a little bit. That extra experience does count for something. And so, for people planning their careers, don't discount. What I'm saying is if you're already set on coming to industry, don't discount an academic postdoc if that's what you want to do. You don't have to have defended. You can apply before then if we're familiar that that process takes time. That process takes time, and we want to support people doing that. So, anything a little bit further than six months out gets a little bit challenging. But if you're getting towards the end, then our process takes some time too. So, usually those things can be made to line up. And then postdocs, we will consider for full-time positions, of course, or another postdoc, particularly if you're changing fields slightly, then we have certainly done that before too. Okay, very quickly, what to do when interviewing, particularly for PhD students. Particularly for PhD students and postdocs, do you know why your current project is impactful? You're going to get asked that. And if you don't know why, ask your supervisor what the first line in their grant is, and then remember that. Hopefully, you do know why, but just, you know, it's really important that we can see that you can take a bigger picture. Being confident and engaged in the process kind of goes without saying. Might obviously give full answers to questions, but don't give too full answers to questions. Don't go on too long. That's a skill. That's a skill. And then, my pet peeve is: don't apologize for your slides or work. Oftentimes, I'll hear this: people put a slide up for their interview talk and say, I'm sorry, this slide is busy. Well, that's kind of annoying because if I know it's busy and you know it's busy, why didn't you make it not busy? So that really speaks to be confident. So, with then, I've probably gone a little bit over. I'll pause and take any questions. I'm also going to hang around if there's any questions on the Slack channel or at the end. Slack channel or at the end. Thanks a lot, Richard. So I just heard that Dean has to go to a business meeting very soon. There might actually not be enough time for a full talk, Dean, but maybe at least you can introduce yourself and introduce Kita and then I can let you go. Okay. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Let me.
