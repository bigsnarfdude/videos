How the cytoskeleton, the acting cytoskeleton, can reorganize into networks that are protrusive and undergo retrograde flow. They can also bundle, making phylopodia and as well as contractile bundles. And we in the field of acne-based motility would like to understand how these networks assemble, how they bundle, contract, disassemble, and how the flows are powered in the cell, because this mediate the mechanical interactions. The mechanical interactions between the cell and its environment. So there's a classic structural study in this field from keratocytes. It goes back to 97 in this famous Zvitkina micrographs. One can see how the litting edge of this keratocytes is a brushwork of filaments. Of filaments, short acting filaments that make a network. That has been explained by the dendritic nucleation model, where branching of pre-existing filaments by the R23 complex, followed by capping, and then severing by cofilling and recycling, can maintain this brush work. However, from the time these image were obtained, a big puzzle in this field was In this field, was how does this network rearrange into these long filaments at the back, which precede the region where the myosin contracts the actin side skeleton? And actually, I found, I went back to my notes and found the program from my 2004 workshop when I was a postdoc there. And, you know, one of the questions in the field at that time was how to explain these long filaments across the lamellopodium. These long filaments across the lamellipodium and the brass work at the front is annealing of filaments that mean the end-to-end joining of filaments. How do capped filaments anneal tropomycin other processes? Where does remodeling take place? I remember Leah and Alex and maybe others were at this meeting. And at that time, the organizers even gave us a reading list. Okay, so I will propose an explanation for this. And to answer the question of where. And to answer the question of where does remodeling take place, so we know more about this. This is the images from the Watanabe group who do single molecule imaging of the actin. So this that appear as speckles in these images when they are polymerized, when they're part of the acting filament. When they're otherwise, they're diffusing and they leave a blur, very similar to the images that Ed Monroe presented a few days ago. Row presented a few days ago. So, what's interesting about these speckles is that they do not appear only at the leading edge of the cell, but also throughout the Lamellipodium, as you can see with this appearance distribution. Plus, they have relatively short-lived lifetimes. So in fact, most of them disassemble, right, they disappear before they undergo retrograde flow from the leading edge of the cell to the end of the lamellipoly. So, the turnover is indeed distributed. And this is also, at least in some cases, it seems to be local as well. In these photoactivation experiments by Vitriol and others, as well as related photo-bleating experiments, one sees that the actin that's activated, a big fraction of it, reassembles nearby the region of photoactivation. And we've modeled this with a particle-based model. This is with a particle-based model that shows when we assume that there's local rebinding of the depolymerized actin, we can explain this data. But what about this short filaments versus long filaments? So one hypothesis that has been proposed that we've tested is the frequent shavering in a new hypothesis. Frequent severing in annealing hypothesis. So, proposed by Miyosi and Vedanabi. The idea here is that the ends of these branched networks can sever easily, releasing oligomers that can diffuse and anneal nearby the network, thus changing the length distribution of the network. I mean, indeed, we know cofilling can do this kind of severing. Many experiments have shown that anil. Many experiments have shown that annealing of filaments occurs and it can be very fast, especially under confinement. And more recent data show that filaments in the lamellipotin can be uncapped without really repolymerizing because of the effects of proteins such as cofilin and twinfilin. Okay, and then another argument of why anilin may be important is shown in this. May be important is shown in this movie where I take a branch network and then I just cut filaments at random and then splash them together. Over time, such process will lead to longer filaments because eventually short filaments will disassemble and the surviving filaments will grow and acquire the length. Okay, but can this occur under Lamellipodel conditions? So with Danielle Holtz and R. Holtz. So, with Danielle Holtz and R. Hol made a dendritic model that has implements this process. So, we have a polymerization of filaments that is faster at the leading edge. We know that this much faster near the membrane here. The pointed end can disassemble at a certain small rate. That's not so important as long as it's small enough. There is capping and uncapping, so that process. So that process we have has to uncapping has to occur fast enough to have enough free ends for annealing. And then we can have branching, a deep branching of along active filaments that are modeled here as straight lines. And we have two severing mechanisms. One is a end severing mechanism that's a rate constant K-sever. K-sever end and a uniform severing that happens uniformly along the filament. If a severing happens near the end, then this oligomer can diffuse and bind to an available free-barbed end. And we calculate this by using the diffusion propagator in this stochastic simulation without explicitly modeling the diffusion. So we So, we have a good idea of what many of these parameters should be, and also the fact that they oligomers can have different lengths, but they should be diffusing quite slowly compared to the monomers. So we then try to explain whether we can build a simulation that matches the filamentous acting network concentrations that have been measured experimentally. That have been measured experimentally in electron microscopy experiments, for example, to match the distribution of speckle lifetimes measured by the Watanabe group, and three, to see if there's an increase in the filament length. And we varied the three main unknown parameters here, which is the severing rate near the end of the filaments, the uniform severing rate, and how close this end severing occurs to the end. Occurs to the end. This is the maximum molygomer length. If we don't have enhanced end severing, then there's no, we can match the concentration of the speckles. We have a blue and green bar here in this box, but we cannot satisfy all three requirements, as I stated. However, by including enhanced end servering, then indeed we can match all three. And this is a simulation of this. And this is a simulation of this case. So we can see how we can reproduce a lamellipodium that is branched near the end. So red dots are the branches with longer filaments at the back. And these are the color coding of this simulation. This is SOAS agreement with speckled data from keratocytes, this classic cell motility system, where they got an update. Filter system where the Guatanabi group, Yamasero, and others measured the lifetime of speckles that can be matched by the black and red boxes parameters here, the location of appearances, and disappearances. But only the model with enhanced end severing can also give you the longer lengths. So, this is a proposal for this long-standing puzzle. I mean, you may ask, you know, why would the cell implement such a complicated process? And here I can only speculate that perhaps this branched network is good at, you know, it's needed for pushing at the front, but at the back of the lamellipodium, you need longer filaments to pull and make bundles out of them. So, this would be an efficient mechanism to establish this. Another reason is that. Another reason is that by doing severing an anilum, it would not require repolymerization of active monomers that are needed at the leading edge. And you don't inhibit their diffusion to the leading edge by this way. Okay, so this shows that the mechanics of this process is something that we have to consider, as of course, you all know. So to make a step in that direction. We built a mechanical model. And to use a, you know, we have to use some kind of reference case. And again, we use the data from our collaborators in Japan, where they imaged single actin monomers undergoing retrograde flow at the leading edge of cells that have nascent adhesions here. And you can see that. And you can say that when the adhesions are weak, the flow of the network is very uniform. In cases where a big mature adhesion gets into the Lamellipodium, then the flow of the acting network and the speckles and their lifetimes is much more complicated. There's pushing and pulling and breaking. So, you know, how do we get to understand these things at a filament level? So, we've, with David Dutkovsky, who's a postdoc in our group, we develop a reference situation where we simulate a patch of the label podium at the filament level and without trying to capture all the details at the moment, the ideas that can be added later. Be added later, you know, the small-scale things, and we don't have the suffering and annealing in this model yet. So, what we but we try to have a steady-state mechanical model. So, so we, in this simulation box, we add filaments as one micrometer segments at the front, typical filament length, and then they get cross-linked by dynamic or permanent cross-linkers representing. Cross-linkers representing the AP23 complex as well as other cross-linkers that exist in the lamellipodium, such as alpha-ectrin. Nascent adhesion is introduced here in the middle of the lamellopodium, and this is shown here as a sticky patch. That's the level of description here, where actin monomers, actin of the filament can bind and unbind and experience higher friction, kappa, compared to the Compared to the fluid friction inside of us. So, this, as you can see here, the acting filaments are represented by bead spring models similar to Garrick's talk earlier this week that experience excluded volume interactions that are needed because it's so dense. Okay, so this is another cause of retrograde flow in the cells is induced by motors that are not necessarily. That are not necessarily mice in two models, so we don't know what they are, but we know these motor forces must exist because when acting polymerization is inhibited by cytocalcin D, for example, there is still some remaining retrograde flow that is independent of myosin II. So these motor forces are introduced here as a uniform pulling of the network, as external forces for now, that are either applied at the back of the lamellopodium or uniformly throughout. Of the lamellopodium or uniformly throughout. Okay, so can this model reproduce this reference situation here? So we did that. And you can see here the retrograde velocity as a function of distance. It's uniform and changes depending on the focal adhesion strength. This is implementing. This is implementing the class hypothesis. Here, the front here is the region where we white filaments. That's why there's a change, there's some compaction that causes this change of retrograde flow. We have a mechanical balance in the system where with increasing adhesion strength, the drag force from the adhesion increase and the saturation. And the cytoplasmic drag goes down a little bit. There's increasing pushing force from the polymerization as we increase the adhesion. And we get in these simulations where we have a constant polymerization rate artificially, we have a get a force velocity curve in the system. Interestingly, we say that this is the stress distribution in the lambda podium. It generally It's generally compressed near the adhesion, and at high adhesion strengths, the filaments can become almost bent and likely may break in these regions. While at the back, generally, that's something that's not been discussed before as far as I know. You can have tensile stresses. This is blue here, tensile, which would match our Which would match our idea about longer filaments at the back of the lamellipodium being better suited for tensile stresses. And we also start to see interesting phenomena that have to do with changing of the active morphology by changing a few parameters of the simulation. So, this is a simulation with where the permanent cross-linkers are all Are all have a long lifetime. If we have a shorter lifetime of the permanent cross-linkers and allow a reduction of retrograde flow by an adhesion, the packing of filaments can lead to a bundle, similar to actin arcs that people have modeled with continuum models. You can also get micro spike-like. Structures as this bundle, the phallopodial structures that extend into the cell are called microspikes. By having a small percentage of the active filaments oriented parallel to previous filaments, you can get these bundles forming inside the lamellipodin. So, this is something we work to develop. To develop. So let me move to the next part on the polarization. So thankfully, Metra already described how CDC42 in Pompey accumulates at the tips of those cells, as you can see here. And in fission yeast, CDC42 is also exists on the sides as GT in the inactive form. The inactive form. So, unlike button yeast, where it's thought to be primarily in the cytoplasm, in fission yeast, CDC42 GDP diffuses laterally on the membrane and arrives at the tip where it gets activated. The gap in these cells is on the sides, and I guess RgA4 and RgA6, the two of the main gaps, accumulate on the cell sides. From the cell sides, while RgA3 at the cell tips, we don't know what drives these patterns in these cells. So we've been working on this topic with the group of Sophie Martin, who made a serentipidus discovery when working with an optogenetic system, where they were attaching CIBN. Attaching CIBN to the plasma membrane with a membrane anchored called RID-C. It's a small amphipathic-like region. So CIBN binds to Cry2 upon a blue light activation. So you can see here how in the dark, the CIBN is on the membrane, Cry2 is on the satellite. Membrane cryo 2 is on the cytoplasm, signing light to these cells get a cryo 2 on the membrane quickly. What they noticed is that after longer times though, as you can see, 90 to 300 seconds, this cryo 2 gets depleted from the tip. So it gets removed. So they asked us if, and this. asked us if and this you know depends on things like exocytos and endocytosis so they asked us if you know it's is it possible that uh the membrane delivery is somehow displacing the uh these proteins from the cell tip so to uh examine this uh hypothesis we created this uh generic model where we simplify one the one tip of the efficient yeast as a sphere and Here and we can assume that there's membrane-associated proteins that can diffuse on the membrane and they can bind and unbind, like this Ritzy-attached complexes. And at the tip, there is a region of X cytosis and endocytosis. We know that X cytosis, and we measure this also later, is a bit narrower than X cytosis. So, under what conditions So, under what conditions would this process lead to depletion? So, we know that, and in this case, we just saw that, you know, there's no evidence that these proteins are carried or removed from the membrane. One observation in these cells is that the plasma membrane of the yeast of these cells is pretty flat. When a vesicle gets delivered, you know, except the sites of excytosis and the cytosis, it must displace nearby lipids to make space for that extra membrane because of some underlying tension gradient. That delivery of patch should push away the proteins around it. So, because some fraction of the membrane will flow, we don't know how much. Membrane will flow. We don't know how much field, but it's for the one, we assume. And a lot of the peripherally associated membrane proteins, probably their diffusion is influenced by the membrane primarily. So they would flow with the lipids. So we then have this area conservation model where we simulate in a Monte Carlo way, the delivery. Montecolor way, the delivery of membrane paths and removal as well from the membrane. As you can see here, for slowly exchanging proteins and slowly diffusing, a hole can develop. This is a snapshot of the simulation where you can see these patches, transient patches that display the diffusing molecules of the simulation. And so the bigger the more stationary the protons are, the bigger the hole, and the bigger the Are the bigger the hole, and the bigger the accumulation, the lateral accumulation is. So, we measured that indeed, they measured that the endoxocytosis is narrower than endocytosis and also measured the absolute numbers. And this is what we used, you know, the rates in the previous simulation. To check the diffusion coefficients and exchange rates, they performed a trap experiment. Experiments on the side of the cell, where we can try to extract the exchange rate and diffusion coefficient by looking at the recovery profile. So, diffusion would cause broadening exchange uniform recovery. Because there's two parameters, we cannot accurately get both. But the exchange rate, association rate, and diffusion coefficients would lie on these lines that represent the That represents the complete diffusion limit or exchange limit. The depletion region is shown here by the gray regions. So dark gray is 50% of the tip occupation goes down, while a light gray would be only the concentration goes down by 20%. And you can see here that the cells that after light. Cells that after light exposure, the CIBN goes into the depletion region. So that's consistent with this idea. So before and after light and activation. So this system here likely oligomerizes as well, which enhances this phenomenon. So for a better check of this, Veneta Gerganova, who did these experiments, linked Linked TFP associated with the membrane with one, two, or three copies of read C. And as you can see in this graph, while the one copy of GFP does not deplete the membrane, two depletes a little bit and three even more. We also did a check with three GFP, one copy of READC. One copy of read C. By FRAP experiments, we can see how one read C is outside of the depletion region, two is marginally inside, and three is deep in the depletion region. So another observation is that such a model would predict an accumulation of proteins on the cell, on the side of the hole, while a mechanism that relies on removal of this protein. Mechanism that relies on removal of these proteins would not do that. Indeed, in the experiments, we see over time after light exposure, they see the accumulation of cry2 on the sides of the hole. And in some cases, in time graphs, you can see the expansion of the hole and increase of concentration on the sides. I mean, what was really fascinating is that they were able to show that. They were able to show that this is likely a mechanism used by the cells to establish their shape by distributing likely the side binding RgAs. For example, as I showed here, RgA4s on the cell sides. So in the triple gap depletion, so these are all the gaps, I'm sure. Caption. As Maitreya mentioned, these cells are round. So they introduced to these cells this opto-cap construct that can bind to the membrane with read C, that's a uniformly, but also has a cry2 domain. So upon light, it can only go merize and become slowly diffused with CIBN. So the and as you can see here, And as you can see here, in the dark, these cells remain round, but when they grow on light, they have this normal tubular shape. And in fact, exposing these cells, the round cells to light causes the creation of a hole and the growth of a tip from that hole. So, okay, one question we've been asked is: you know, what about CDC for? Is, you know, what about CDC42 itself and its gaps that accumulate at the cell tip? I mean, R and A displayed from the site by these membrane flows. So to show that, you know, why this CDC42 would be stable under these flows that are very slow is that we implemented the model that Timelson just presented in the previous talk, but adapted this to fission geek parameters by having the By having the GDP form of CDC42 diffusion of the cell membrane rather than the cytoplasm. Also, the numbers of the, you know, what we know about how much of the GAF are in the system. So they are analogous to BEM1 CDC24 in POMBI is likely to be SAD1, SCD2 complex. So this is the positive feedback that's been proposed. But what we are also But what we also added to this model is exocytosis and endocytosis that is more likely to occur in regions where there is already CTC42 in a way that exocytosis is a bit wider than, sorry, narrower than endocytosis. So indeed we can simulate this patch formation. You can see how this is the patch that I can. See how this is the patch that assembles at the one tip of this simplified one-tip spherical ombiso with distributions of active CDC42 and inactive CDC42 that match previous data. And the reason that this is, and this is pretty much uninfluenced by whether we include endo or exocytosis. And the reason for that is that for this model, And the reason for that is that for this model, the measured dissociation rates and diffusion coefficients of CTC42 GDP and GTP are outside of the depletion region. So maybe the GTP is marginally close to that. And while the GAF exchange rates, the GAFs are in these models seem to diffuse very slowly, but they exchange fast with the cytoplasm. So they're also. Demetrius, you're at the 30-minute mark. Okay, great. So this is. Okay, great. So, this is, I think, the last thing, yeah. Um, so this is, yeah, this is the uh uh end of my talk. I'd like to thank uh Danielle, Aaron, and David, who did the modeling, and of course, our collaborators. The first part was done with Naiku Tanabi and Saga Yamasir. Second part with Sofa Martina, Veneta, Yukanov and Ike Lamas. Thank the funding sources. Funding sources. Thank you. Okay, great. Thanks for a really excellent talk. Labelonis, we have lots of time for questions. And it looks like we've got a question up already from Maitri. Hey, Demetrius, thanks for the very nice talk. I'm sorry, I'm driving, so I'm not going to turn on my camera. But I yeah, so. Yeah, so I really like this model of the gaps being excluded from the tips through this exocytosis, removal through exocytosis. But in a very simplistic way, I always thought that the reason the gaps do not localize to the tips is because of its activity. Once it binds active CDC42, it inactivates CDC42 and then It inactivates CDC42 and then falls off, maybe, you know, in a very simplistic manner. That's how I thought about it till I saw this paper. And so I wondered if, I don't know, maybe this is a better question for Sophie, but if you guys ever looked at the removal of these gaps in the gap-dead mutant, because this seems to be a gap-independent removal, right? So, if you use a gap-dead mutant, you should still see exclusion of the gaps from the tips. Do you know if? Of the gaps from the tips. Do you know if they ever looked at that? I don't remember now about gap-dead mutants. I mean, it's likely, I mean, there's multiple mechanisms, right? So, so, so, this RTA4 is a multi-domain protein. It has parts that link to the membrane, parts that oligomerize. There's also big disordered regions. Yeah, that's something that I think I don't think I know the definite answer myself. Yeah, but okay. Yeah. But this data suggests that you can reconstitute the tip through a membrane by slowing down this artificial gap suggests that this is likely to be biologically relevant. Sure, yeah, okay. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. We have a question from Tim. I agree. From Tim. Hey, very nice talk. I have a question. I just want to make sure I understand correctly the way you're modeling the effects of exocytosis. That essentially when a vesicle fuses, you just move everything that was there by some distance away. Is that that's right. So the closer it is. So this is the location is determined by probability distribution. You know, we've measured the specific. We've measured the special distribution of endocytosis and exocytosis on the confocal slides, so we can extrapolate the 3D. And then that's right. So, whenever a protein is nearby, that site is moved by distance, that corresponds to conservation of membrane area. And then when you do this with your particle-based simulations, and look at CC42, you don't really see that big an effect on the polarity side. Do I have to have that right? That's right. That's right. That's very because we've started to do this and it just kind of reassures what we were doing because we were kind of trying to do it the same way you guys did it and we didn't see much of an effect. But when we had done it in the past using reaction diffusion approach and then had vesicle delivery, it really, in fact, it moved around the patch quite a bit. And I'm just, I'm wondering what the difference is. Yeah, what the difference is. Yeah, that's right. So, if we, I mean, in this example here, I saw, I mean, the path that forms, I mean, we adjust parameters to make a patch that matches the experimental dimensions. But if we use other parameters where the path is really narrow, then because this, you know, the vessel delivery of this small patch can cause like big caps and can cause it to move around more. So you're okay. So you did see that. That's it because we have not gotten it. Because we have not gotten if it's really concentrated, yeah. Okay, cool. Thanks. Okay, do we have other questions from the remote participants? I guess we can get questions from the room as well at this point, right? I have a question about the first part, actually. So a key parameter, I think, in your model for getting this transition from short. For getting this transition from short-branched actin filaments to longer unbranched actin filaments, was the capping protein unbinding rate. Has that actually been measured in those cells? We've measured that in C. algans and it's very slow actually, but in vivo and in vitro. So the capping protein, so the Guatanabi group has also done a single module experiments of capping protein. And what they see, those experiments. Those experiments is the speckles are really transient. So they last only a couple of seconds. So we don't know why they is it uncapping or maybe the severing we just proposed is what's causing them to not stay at the same spot for a long time. Right. Yeah, because they would be displaced by the severing as well. Yeah, that's right. Plus, a big fraction of this. Plus, a big fraction of these speckles are slowly diffusing. So that may be these oligomers. And you can see that, you know, while you don't see the slow diffusing action, just because there's much, you know, it has to do with the ratio of ends to monomers in filaments. So there will be only a few of the So, there will be only a few of the activities that will be slowly diffusing, but maybe if the oligomers are, some of them are capped by capping protein, a bigger fraction of the capping protein might be on those oligomers. Yes, yeah, yeah. Any other questions? I assume that Maitrey doesn't have another question, but she just forgot to lower her hand. I think this is Dave, Odi, have a question. This is Dave Odi, I have a question. Sure. Okay, great. Yeah, thanks, Demetrius. I was just wondering in that first part there on this slide in particular, experimentally, it seems like the formation of new filaments, the polymerization, may not be so strictly confined to the very edge. It could actually be kind of distributed over the first couple hundred nanometers because the edge of that cell is kind of bending around like this, has a certain thickness. This has a certain thickness and curvature. Do you think that could be part of the story? Or is that something that you've seen already? Or yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't. Yeah, here, that's really, it's that's right. I mean, it will be not as sharp as shown here. I mean, we don't know exactly where the polymerization and branching takes place right at the leading edge. But I mean, we know the polymerization is really fast there or in. Fast there, or in the region close to that, you know, maybe because there's all these inner-fast proteins and that catalyze additional prophylinactin. What's important for this mechanism is that an end that is removed from that region, you know, maybe by 10 nanometers or so, maybe it can polymerize, but at a slower rate. So too slow to really change the length distribution. Slow to really change the length distribution. Okay. Here we assume that they don't, but yeah, a small amount of polymerization or even depolymerization would not change these conclusions. And then just a comment on the focal adhesion part, which is really cool. It'd be neat if you were able to add like some compliance to that patch to mimic a compliant substrate. Yep. And I think you have a friction coefficient in there. I think you have a friction coefficient in there now, if I understood correctly, but it'd be cool if you explicitly model the individual bonds forming and breaking and then look at the dynamics as a function of stiffness in the environment. Yeah, I mean, definitely, this is something actually David has been looking at. Yeah, so that's the idea of this model. We can maybe add, having some kind of reference simulation, we can add more details. Yeah, it'd be cool to see how that affects the architecture of the active. That affects the architecture of the act in because when we're modeling it, we just treat it as a solid mass bundle without structure. But this has way more interesting detail in it. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Let's thank Demetrius again. And I think it's time to move on to the last talk of this session, which will be given by Grace McLaughlin, if I've pronounced that correctly. Grace, the floor is yours. Grace, the floor is yours. Can you guys hear me okay? Yeah. And you can see my screen, I assume. So my name is Grace, and I'm a graduate student in the Gladfilter Lab at the University of North Carolina. And this project is also in close collaboration with Tim, who just gave a talk a few minutes ago. And I'm going to be talking about asynchronous nuclear division in fungal cells. So fungal cells are need to adjust all the Zoom faces. One second. So fungal cells are fascinating. They are found nearly everywhere on the planet, from within our world's forests to the depths of the ocean to some really extreme environments, including within the Greenland ice sheet. I mean, they are absolutely critical components to functioning and healthy ecosystems. To functioning and healthy ecosystems. So they're very worthwhile to study, you know, just from that ecological angle. And I think for most of us, especially this time of year, the most obvious part of fungi are mushrooms. And they're obviously, you know, as these pictures show, they're beautiful, they're diverse, they're colorful. They've captured a lot of people's, you know, interest and imagination because of this. But there is so much more to the fungus organism than just the mushroom. Organism than just the mushroom. So, mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of the fungus, much like an apple. But just like an apple is connected to a much larger tree, the mushroom.
