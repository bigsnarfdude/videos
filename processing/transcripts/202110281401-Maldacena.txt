And this is based on work with Yimin Chen and Edwin that already appeared. So, the outline is that we'll consider black holes in weakly coupled string theory. When the black hole size is close to the string scale, they are supposed to turn into highly excited strings. And we'll discuss some aspects of this transition. Surprisingly, the situation is different in the heterotic and type 2 string cases. And we'll also discuss some of the implications for charged black holes. Black holes. So we'll be making some assumptions throughout this discussion. So we are going to be considering a weakly coupled string theory. So G string will be very, very small. And we can set L S to one. So there is a length scale, which is the string length. And as you know, the Planck scale is very small. And we'll consider the type 2 or the heterotic superstring. And we'll mainly work in d equal to 4 in this talk. In the paper, we discuss some other dimensions. In the paper, we discuss some other dimensions. So, we imagine that we have four non-compact directions and six compact directions, which are some internal CFT that will always be the same in the whole discussion. So, a highly excited string state is some very highly excited string, as the name says, and they have an entropy which is linear in the mass with a coefficient that is called the Hagerdon temperature. For the type 2 string, it has this form in terms of string length. form in terms of the string length and they have a size which grows like the square root of the mass it's sort of like a random walk of a string of some tension and the thermal ensemble is well defined only for beta bigger than beta h because otherwise when we integrate over all sum over all possible m's we have factor phi to the minus beta m from the energy and beta h from the entropy and only when beta is bigger than beta h this sum converges. There are some powers here that depends on the There are some powers here that depend on dimension, but that's the basic story. Now, black holes are well defined if the Schraschel radius is much bigger than one. In that case, we can just trust the usual Schrassel solution. We are considering black holes in a synthetically flat space. And the leading order alpha prime corrections were computed for various cases. And we can ask what happens when they approach the string size. String size. So, what we are talking about is: we are in the weakly coupled regime. So, we're talking about the stringy generalization of the Schwarzschild solution. In principle, that should be the simplest spherically symmetric solution of classical string field theory. And we don't really know what it is, so we'll be making some statements about this solution that unfortunately we don't know completely. So, the Schroshad solution was found soon after general relativity was invented, but apparently. Was invented, but apparently the string theory solution, we still don't know it. So now, one observation that was made many years ago is the following, that you can think about the entropy. It's instructive to think about the entropy as a function of the mass of the black hole. And this is a quadratic function. And you can compare to the entropy of the free string. And these two lines cross. And these two lines cross. And of course, the fact that the two lines cross is not too surprising. What's interesting is that they cross also when the black hole has the size of the string scale. And that's also when the Hawking temperature is of order, the hybrid temperature. So you might expect that perhaps at this point, the black hole somehow turns into some highly excited strain. So at this point, I think. And this point I think was made first in this paper, and then various people sort of emphasized this point in the past. Now, something important is that this crossing of these two lines is based on some extrapolation of calculations we can do only far away from the crossing point. And so we need to understand the corrections or even to discuss this in detail. Maybe, and we like to understand the nature. And we like to understand the nature of the possible nature of this transition. So, the question is whether there is a smooth transition between. So, this picture might suggest that perhaps there is a smooth transition between the black holes and a highly excited string state. And one question to one reason for thinking about this question is the following. So, in the string picture, the microstates are fairly explicit, but of course, there is nothing like the interior of a black hole. On the other hand, from Black hole. On the other hand, from the black hole point of view, there is an interior, but there are no obvious microstates. And if this was continuously connected, maybe we could see how one turns into the other. So that's the background of the question. It's really the motivation. We will not answer these questions at all during this talk. And well, of course, there is another more general motivation, which is just to understand how string theory changes black hole thermodynamics. And this is a And this is a question which you can also ask about the Ruta Kanage prescription and in general of all the quantum information discussion that we've been having. And the black hole case is sort of the simplest case where you can ask this question. So you can actually compute, so returning to the previous picture, you can compute the first corrections both to the free string picture and the black hole picture. So the corrections to the black hole picture are just the first alpha prime corrections and the modifications. Corrections and the modifications from the string side we are going to discuss in detail in a moment. But only the first modifications, you can still not get to the point that you are really interested in. So first, let me make some comments about strings at finite temperatures that will introduce some of the technical tools that we will use. So this is the so-called winding mode formalism. So the idea is that we compactify the theory on a circle. On a circle, and then there is a string binding mode that winds the time direction. And when there is some action for this mode, and when we are close to the hygiene temperature, so when beta is close to beta h, this mode becomes very light and becomes lighter than all other massive string states. And so we can include it in the supergravity approximation. So it's the regime where it's easy to treat. And in particular, if beta is bigger than beta h. particular if beta is bigger than beta h then the mass is positive so it's a perfectly standard Lowener shift field theory that we could consider now this mode has some self-interactions but they are not very important the more important interactions are the interactions with gravity so because these are massless modes that interaction is attractive and if we integrate that out we'll get something like a negative guide to the fourth term something that was pointed out in that paper of Attic and Whitney. Pointed out in that paper of Attic and Whitney. So, this is included in an action like this, where we have the binding mode and gravity. So, here I've been schematic, there is also a dilaton coupling that I haven't written. Now, it turns out that there's actually an interesting solution in this regime, which is the so-called self-gravitating string that was found by Horowitz and Polchinski more than 20 years ago. So it's a solution localized in three spatial dimensions. Localized in three spatial dimensions. So, this is in the case of the equal to four. And it contains a localized profile for this winding mode that roughly has this shape where the blue hue indicates how big it is. And it describes a self-gravitating string in thermodynamic equilibrium, a sort of string star. Now, the properties is that the size actually decreases when the mass increases. Increases when the mass increases. So we have an equation roughly like this, which says that the size goes like g square m. And so this is good when g square m is less than one. So it's much less than one, so that the size is very big. But since g string is very small, m could be very large. So this is all within the classical limit of string theory. And this solution is good when the size. And this solution is good when the size is big. And the size becomes bigger as the mass becomes smaller and smaller. Okay, now notice that the correspondence point is when g square m is of order one, and that then the size is of order one, and this is of order string scale. And in that case, we cannot use this approximation, okay? Because there the gradients are proportional to their string scale and would have. To their string scale and would have to include more string modes. So, this approximate this solution is valid only for masses much below the correspondence point. One interesting aspect of this solution is that it is a classical solution of the equations and that it has an entropy of order one over g squared. And we can compute the entropy using the usual formula and using the action we had below before. And the reason we get an entropy, even though the time We get an entropy, even though the time circle is not contractible, is that there is some explicit dependence in the mass squared on the size of the circle. And for that reason, we get an entropy. So we use the usual argument that would normally tell you that there cannot be a classical entropy, but because there is an explicit beta dependence, then there is actually a classical entropy. And this is not too surprising because this mode is characterizing the Is characterizing the thermodynamics of strings, and we get the classical entropy just the entropy of these strings. And at least in order, this just gives an entropy which is s equal to beta times m. Actually, beta is of order beta h. So this gives an entropy which has the same form as the entropy for a free string. So the effect of the interactions and so on is to make the free string, which normally would be very large, to have a smaller size, but the entropy is roughly the same. The entropy is roughly the same. You can compute also the next correction to the entropy using these formulas, but the formulas in the paper are not necessary for what we are discussing. Now, I'll make a side comment. This is not necessary for what we are going to continue discussing, but a side comment is that this solution gives you a model of a localized icon condensate. So, this winding mode is massive far away, but near the center, the mass square is negative because the size of the mass. The mass square is negative because the size of the extra of the Euclidean time circle becomes smaller. I perhaps should have said that the only fields that are excited in this self-gravitating solution are the size of the circle, which is basically the Newtonian potential, and also the dilaton, and they're proportional to each other. So it's basically a non-relativistic solution, at least as far as gravity is concerned. Least as far as gravity is concerned. But anyway, so returning to this discussion, so here the size of the circle shrunk a little bit below the size of beta H, and therefore this is tachyonic at the center. And so we can view this as a kind of bubble decay solution where we will decay to a solution where the tachyon is condensing. And that's related to that negative chi to the fourth term that was discussed in the paper of. That was discussed in the paper of Attic and Witten, and it's the bubbling solution to that phase. And it's conceptually related to Witten's bubble of nothing, decay of flat space that is related to black holes. I mean, the solution is, we are saying, is similar to black holes, so that's the same story. Okay, so that's the end of this side comment. If it wasn't clear, don't worry, it doesn't matter for what I'm going to talk about later. So let me say a few things about the size of the solution. A few things about the size of the solution. So, as you know, if you take the black hole and you decrease the mass, the size decreases up to when it gets to be of order string size where we don't know what happens. So that's this blobbing indicates that we don't know the solution in this region. The Horwich-Polstrinsky solution is such that as the mass increases, the size decreases, and we cannot trust it again when we get to these string size objects. So here is the string size. So here is the string size. Now we discussed that the entropy of a free sorry the size of the free string grows with the mass and it actually intersects the Horwois-Polschinki solution at this point where this is a relatively large size for small G-string. And here what happens is that the Horowitz-Polzzinski solution becomes so big that the fluctuations around the solution become of order one. So the quantum fluctuations. Uh, become of order one. So the quantum fluctuations around the solution become of order one. Notice that this size explicitly depends on g string. So if we take g string to infinity, then we could continue this to very tiny sizes. But if we want to give a solution for very small but finite g string, we have this full behavior. So this is the behavior we expect for the problem in four dimensions, four space-time dimensions. And a few words about Euclidean black holes. I guess I don't need to tell you in this audience that the Euclidean time circle shrinks to zero. And this implies that black holes also have a binding condenser. And this, I guess, is known to those who know it, but let me just repeat it in case you don't know it. So if you had a field here that carries winding, then that field could have a one-point function. And one way to estimate the one-point function. And one way to estimate the one-point function is to consider a string that wraps the cigar, and that will give you something of the order of the tension of the string times the area of the cigar. And that goes like beta times, well, this is the value in Schrashal coordinates. Now, what's important about this is not the precise form, but the fact that it is non-zero. And this signifies that this winding symmetry is broken. There is a phase. There is a phase. The zero mode is the phase of chi, and that's related to the integral of the B field over the cigar. And of course, the integral of the B field in the full quantum theory is not, I mean, it should be integrated over. And so integrating it over, of course, restores the symmetry. And because we don't expect that for finite for a finite mass and size object, the symmetry would be simultaneously broken. It's only broken in the classical limit when G-string. In the classical limit, when G string goes to zero. Okay, so we can view this expectation value of chi of winding also as a thermal atmosphere of strings. So strings coming out of the horizon and back in. And it's just part of the contribution of the, I mean, it's like Hawking radiation, but now strings, strings that end on the horizon. And this is a picture emphasized by Saskin and Uglum. Now the Now, it's also true that if you naively estimate the order of magnitude of the contribution to the entropy of these open strings, it's formally of order one over G string squared. But unfortunately, not with the calculable coefficient, since it's concentrated near the horizon. So we don't know how to translate this observation into some statement that the black hole entropy is due to this thermal strength, though this was speculated in this paper. Was speculated in this paper. And some papers claim to prove this and so on: that it is all the entropy, but I don't think the arguments are convincing. I would find an argument convincing if it can compute the entropy and then its corrections. Now, let me discuss just a comment on the broken symmetries. Notice that since the winding symmetry is spontaneously broken both in the black hole phase and the highly excited string phase, because we had this for a whisper-strinky solution with the winding content. For a whispienki solution with the winding condenset. So, in both cases, there is a winding condensate, and this is consistent with the suggestion that they could be continuously connected. So, that's why I'm emphasizing this point. Now, the black hole solution is good when the so if the horizontal direction here is the size or the temperature, beta, the black hole solution is good for large beta. The Horowitz-Polchinsk is good for some very tiny beta very close to beta H. Time beta very close to beta h, and we would like to know whether there is an interpolating solution or not. So, this interpolating solution should be described by a world-shaped CFT, so for CFT in four target in four dimensions, or with the central charge corresponding to four spacetime dimensions. We have some internal CFT, which is the same throughout this line that we are not touching at all. So, the question is whether such a four-dimensional CFT, so it's a CFT defining two dimensions with roughly Defining two dimensions, roughly speaking, a four-dimensional target space. And it should have one parameter, one continuous parameter that interpolates between the black hole and the HP. So that's a question that we're asking. Is this true or not? And the answer is that there is no smooth interpolation for the type 2 string case. And to show this, we consider we find some conformal field theory quantity that is invariant under small deformations. invariant under small deformations or continuous deformations. And this quantity will be the Witten index of the one, one supersymmetric Walsh CFT. So since we're in type 2, we have a 1,1 Welsh supersymmetric theory. And the Witten index, I remind you, is defined to be trace of minus 1 to the F e to minus beta tilde H, where beta tilde would be the Welsh temperature. So we are imagining a Welsh configuration, which is Toros. Configuration, which is a torus or a cylinder, let's say. But let's say it's a torus. So the states that run here are the states of the Welsh theorem and cylinder. This beta tilde has nothing to do with the target space temperature, which is some parameter appearing in the action for this theory. So this is something that receives contribution only from the ground states, more specifically from the Ramon-Ramon ground states. And this physically represents like normalizable modes. Normalizable Raman-Raman states, which are related to fluxes that can exist in the theory. So, the last point I mentioned is just some connection to the physical string theory, but not necessary for this discussion. So, in order to calculate this with an index, we can make deformations, so it's invariant under small deformations, and we find, yeah. Yeah. The target space is non-compact, but the asymptotics of the space is the same in both cases. So we could imagine either adding a small potential that removes the asymptotic region. And then we expect the index to still be continuous if indeed the conformal future is connected. Now, in order to calculate the index, we can go to some extreme values, so either very small or very large beta. So either very small or very large beta. And then the index is given by the Euler characteristic of the space. So for the case of the Horwich-Polzzinski, the target space is S1 times R3 and its Euler characteristic is zero. On the black hole side, the Euler characteristic is such that the index is two. So that's the answer in these cases. And since they are different, there cannot be a They are different, there cannot be a continuous connection between the two regimes. Okay, so what this means is that we have the CFT, and then at some point, at least at some point, there should be something that happens. Maybe the target space of the CFT becomes non-compact or something happens. We cannot have a continuous connection. Exactly the nature of what happens, we don't really know. Some hypotheses that Some hypothesis that sounds simple to me would be to say that maybe at one specific point, maybe the target space becomes non-compact in the direction of maybe there's a linear dilettante direction or something like that. I don't really know what it is, but some way in which the conformal free theory can become singular and the hierogeneous corrections become important. Can you just clarify that in this calculation, space-time supersymmetry is broken by this? Supersymmetry is broken by the solution, right? Yes, yes. This calculation does not use spacetime supersymmetry. This calculation uses well-shaped supersymmetry. So it's important that we have well-shaped supersymmetry, and that's something that was used here. That's where the fact that we're in type 2 is important. In the heterotic theory, now the difference is that we have a 0,1 world CFT, so it's a different amount of supersymmetry. The index cannot. The index can also be computed in this case, and now it is equal to zero on both sides. So the index is related to the Ramon. So it's instead of Ramon-Ramon states, now we have Ramon states, only one Ramon name. And those are sort of space-time spinners. And what we are counting is the number of spinners with the different parity, the positive and negative Kirality spinners. And because the backgrounds are parity invariant, we have the zero and both. Are parity invariant, we have the zero on both sides. We have zero, yeah. Now, other known invariants are also the same, and in fact, there is a linear sigma model analysis which suggests that they are continuously connected. And in fact, for the purposes of this invariance, proves that all possible invariants that can be defined also in the massive theory, you'll get the same answer. So So, this linear sigma model is an approach for defining the CFDs that was used a lot by Witten and others in the 90s. And it consists of the following. So you start from a simple problem in the UV of just three fields, and then you add a potential in such a way that in the infrared you flow to the desired conformal field theory. So, for example, we start with an action of three fields. We start with an action of three fields where we have three superfields, so 0, 1 superfields, which are we have five superfields. And then we add a kind of superpotential. This is an analogous type of coupling for superpotential where we have a fermionic superfield and then some function w. So the fermionic superfields have only left-moving fermions, so left is the non-supersymmetric side. Supersymmetric side. And then also some auxiliary field here. When you integrate it out in components, this leads to a potential which is w squared. So supersymmetric configurations are configurations where w is equal to zero and you choose w appropriately. So for example, a choice is this one. So we choose this particular w, it's a polynomial of up to degree four in the fields and invariant under various symmetries. Now this has the following. Now this has the following nice property. So if you set w equal to zero and you solve for x squared, you find that x squared is equal to this quantity. So for very large y, x squared is equal to b, so it's constant. So we have a circle of constant radius for very large y, and y looks like R3. And then when we go near y equal to zero, what happens depends on the What happens depends on the relative signs and values of well, sorry, B, C, and A are all positive, but it depends on the sign of this particular combination. So if when we set y equal to zero here, the right-hand side is positive, that's in this case, then x squared at that value is non-zero. And so we have something with the Horowitz-Poshninsky topology where the circle never shrinks. On the other hand, if that's hand if that sign is negative then we cannot go to such low values of y so we have to we have some larger value of y where the circle shrinks and we have something of the black hole topology so depending on the values of these parameters we'll have either the hp topology or the black hole topology notice that the initial topology is just trivial she's just that r5 so we start from the model with the topology which is r5 and then the surfaces where w is equal to zero are the ones Where W is equal to zero are the ones that change the polygon. Okay. Okay. So the philosophy is that we start with this theory which contains three fields plus a potential, and then we go to this classical vacuum manifold, which is given by W equal to zero. That's what we discussed so far. And then on that manifold, we get a space that has some metric. The metric is not richly flat and it will flow. That and it will flow. So the RG flow will generate a flow in that metric. And presumably, the metric will be adjusted so that it obeys the correct string corrected equations and flow to some CFT. We did not analyze this step in detail. It's a step hard to analyze in detail. Now we can do some parameter counting. So there are three parameters in the UV theory, A, B and C. And we expect only one marginal parameter. Expect only one marginal parameter in the infrared theory, but also we expect one relevant parameter. So that, and that's because both the black hole and the HP solution have one negative mode. And that should translate into having one relevant parameter in the theory. So one combination of A, B, and C should be fine-tuned in order to get to the solution we want. And given that we have. Want. And given that we have one parameter left over, the simplest assumption is to think that the third parameter will turn out to be irrelevant. But we did not check this explicitly. So what's important is that as we vary the parameters, nothing special happens when B minus C over A is equal to zero. In other words, there is no new branch appearing there. So we expect that when we flow to the infrared CFT, we will not. To the infrared CFT, we will not have any surprise. So, at this intermediate stage, the two theories are completely connected. Now, after we flow all the way to the UV, it could be that because we are flowing by an infinite amount, it could be that the flow divides into two portions and still we get two disconnected things. So, this discussion is an indication, but not the proof that they are continuously connected. Just an indication. Okay, so how much time do I have? You have like three or four minutes left. Okay, so I will skip the type 2 linear sigma model, blah, blah, blah. There are some D-brains that exist on the Horowitz-Polchinski side, but not on the black hole side, and vice versa. So, for example, the D-zero brain, localized at the origin and wrapping the time circle, exists only on the Horowitz-Polchinski side, but there is no such But there is no such brain on the black hole side. And the fact that the brain spectrum is discontinuous is related to the fact that in type 2, this cannot be continuously connected. Okay. Now, in the next couple of minutes, I'm going to mention a couple of things. So, one is curiosity, which is that the orange election of classical string theory solutions is pure. Strength resolutions is purely given as a boundary term. So this is something that is very simple to derive from the classical gravity actions and is related to the overall e to the minus 2 phi dependence of the action on the delaton. I didn't put in here the reference. It was noted by Saitlin and Kazokov as far as I know. Maybe someone else noted it before. And so in the context of these black holes, it implies that the action can Holes, it implies that the action can be purely written in terms of quantities at infinity, so the mass of the black hole and the charge of the, let's say, the something we can call the charge of the dilaton, which is the coefficient of the one over r term in the dilaton far away. Now, this is something that is true in classical string theory. It's not true to higher orders in the string coupling, and it's also not true for an arbitrary Einstein gravity plus higher derivative correction. Of course, it's also true in Einstein gravity. Is also true in Einstein gravity itself. But if you consider a higher derivative correction, such as in M-theory, then it's also not true. Now, it's interesting that this solution that we've been discussing also has some implication for charged black holes, for some special charged black holes. So imagine that the internal theory, so that's theory with the internal six dimensions, has a circle. So there is an extra circle. For example, we have a total. Is an extra circle. For example, we have a toroidal compactification. So, in that case, we can have a black hole with momentum and fundamental winding charge on the extra circle. And these solutions are obtained from, can be obtained from a solution generating transformation, which is a symmetry of the Welsh CFD. And given the uncharged seed solution, we can obtain the charged solution. And the thermodynamics of the uncharged solution depends purely on, determines completely the thermodynamics of the charged solution. And because of the remark in the And because of the remark in the previous transparency, we only need to know the asymptotic form of the uncharged solution to know the actual charged solution. And all these statements are true to all orders in alpha prime, and the transformations are slightly different in the type 2 and heterotic string, and we work them out in detail in our paper. This was done to leading order in alpha prime or at the gravity, the gravity regime in these papers up here. But we generalized this to a lower alpha prime, and there are some corrections. And we can apply, we can consider the seed solution to be, for example, the Horowis-Volczynski solution. And in this way, we generate the charged version, and we can calculate various quantities for that. An interesting question is what happens when you have these black holes and you approach extremity. So these are black holes where if you take the classical black hole solution and you approach extremality naively using the classical black hole solution, you get the Classical Brackhole solution, you get a singular geometry with zero entropy. However, the fact that the seed solution undergoes some transition when the size is very small implies that these solutions also should undergo some transition when you approach extremality. So, as you approach externality, we would go from the black hole to a charged version of the Horowitz-Poschinski solution and then Solution and then to this so-called free stream version of the solution. So, this charge version of the Horowis Polchinski solution is similar to the fastballs configurations that were discussed in this context. It's like a non-extremal fastball, where near-extremal fastball, and where, of course, the microstates are explicit and so on. But notice that the fastball description exists in a regime which is different than. Exist in a regime which is different than the black hole description. Of course, we would have liked to find the continuous connection, but in principle, the places where we understand it in detail are in two sort of incompatible regimes, two different regimes in parameter space. So in conclusions, we discuss a possible connection between the black hole and the self-gravitating strings of Horwitz and Ponchitsky. For the case of the type II, the two could not be continuously connected. For the heterotic case, they could be. Heterotic case, they could be continuously connected. And we also discussed how this connection or this connection is related to the charge solutions. And this transition is relevant when we approach extremality. There are many questions, of course. We would like to say more about the CFT at intermediate values of beta. And we would like to track the picture of microstates through this intermediate region. And one question is: why is the heterotic and type 2? Why is the heterotic and type 2 picture different? And that's all. Thank you. Thanks for the very nice talk, Maul. Any questions? Yeah, I have a question. So what can you, yeah, you've skipped over the type 2 case. What can you say about this phase transition point in the type 2 case? Well, you can yeah, well, there is a nice story that if you're interested, well, it would take me a few minutes to go over it, but you cannot give a definite picture of what really happens. So there are other situations where a similar transition was discussed. An example is the conifold transition, which is a rather similar story, but Which is a rather similar story, but with 2-2 world supersymmetry, and in that case, what happens is that there is a branch analogous to this. Okay, maybe, maybe I should go and discuss it. Is that okay with people if I discuss that? Maybe. Sorry about this. So we have this uh So we have this linear sigma model. It's similar to the one we had before, except there is a new field. There is a new field called P. And the new aspect is that when we are exactly at the boundary between these two regimes, so when this is zero, there is a new classical branch, which is this P branch. In cases with 2,2 supersymmetry, the existence of this P branch led you to give a nice description of the You to give a nice description of what's happening here at that point. It's related to the cigar theory and so on. In this case, the story is different because on this classical p-branch, there is a superpotential generated by quantum corrections. And so the actually, and that gives rise to some, well, it gives rise to superpotential. And not only that, but there are some isolated massive vacua in. In the theory. Okay, so besides this vacuum where you have a conformal field theory where W was zero, there are some extra isolated massive vacuum. And so in this case, actually, what happens is that the index has the same value on both sides in this theory. And so what happens is that we start with the free fields plus the potential. The classical vacuum manifold is given by this. It flows in the infrared. It flows in the infrared to a CFT plus this massive vacuum. And the massive vacuum only exists for one sign of B minus C over A. And so the index of the full theory is equal for both sides, but the index of just this CFT part is different on the two sides. And so the type of transition is something where there are this pair of massive vacua that emerge somehow from the conformal manifold. And we don't know how to describe it or how to describe the How to describe it, or how to describe the theory close to the place where that is happening. That was a long answer to your question. Yeah, so what is the interpretation of this P space-time interpretation? There is no space-time interpretation that we can give. And you also don't know what the space-time interpretation of this massive vacuum is? No, no, we don't have any. Yeah, the space-time is given by the massless, the CFD part. I see Toby has a question in the chat. Go ahead, Toby. Hi, I was just wondering. I mean, the black hole, as you said, has a Euclidean negative mode, and that sort of wants to either increase the size of the black hole or collapse it down. And you said the HP solution also has a negative moment. Yes, yes, yes. Is it obvious it takes you to the same solution? Obvious, it takes you to the same sort of place? Well, it's not obvious, but you can find this negative mode explicitly. We discussed it in our paper, and it's the same thing. It collapses the time circle. Yeah, that's right. And it has the same property as the black hole in the sense that if you were to consider the microcanonical ensemble where you fix the mass, then this negative mode disappears. And that's true in both cases. For the HP solution, it's true only for this D equal to. Only for this D equal to for example, but not in other dimensions. Any more questions? Yeah, I have a question. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the way that microstates are realized in this HP solution. And I realize you listed that as an open question at the end. I guess maybe one place to ask it is in the charge black hole case where you Black hole case where you said that you can see the analog to this large family of fuzzball solutions. Yeah, yeah. So I think if you, yeah, that the situation here and for HP is basically the same conceptually, or even technically, you can go from one to the other simply. So you have, yeah, so you so the HP gives you this solution with this winding condensate. Yes. And then you interpret the winding condensate as describing a gas. Condensate as describing a gas of highly excited strings that are self-gravitating. Yes. And those are the microstates, this highly excited string. Yeah, I guess the question would be to sort of help lead you to the black hole phase. Somehow you'd like to start with the HP solution and not pull it apart and say the right description is the HP conformal field theory plus all the corrections around it. And that should be the exact answer. Should be the exact answer somehow. Is that do you think that that has to agree with pulling it apart? It seems like it should. I mean, I'm not sure what you mean by pulling it apart. Well, reinterpreting it as a bunch of highly excited streams. Right. That if you think about having some CFT, you know, the HP CFT, how do you, you know, and that was handed to you, how do you see that that's really made up of these? made up of these discrete states. Right, right. Yeah, so yeah, if you only know the CFT, you don't know. So you... But suppose you did all the stringy corrections around it. Yeah, I mean, you don't need the stringy correction. So it's the description we had in the beginning of the HP solution here. When the mass, when Gm is small, it's Mass when Gm is small, it's a good solution, it has non-zero entropy, and so on. Oh, I meant the higher loop corrections or something. I mean, I mean, that presumably, assuming you worry, don't worry about the divergence. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, that was the reason we started looking at this. I mean, what you are saying. So, you would, I mean, you start from the HP solution here, and you would, I think what you are talking about is including alpha prime corrections so as to get. Prime corrections so as to get to this point and get into the black hole side, right? Or even sticking at a place where the Horowitz-Volczynski solution is more or less valid. But suppose you wanted to compute, let's say, the actual level spacing. Ah, okay, the level spacing. Okay, well, that yeah, you could do loop corrections in principle of the HP solution. You would have to go to do it in Lorentzian signature because of this negative. Lorentzian signature because of this negative mode that we just discussed? Yeah, I guess you have to do it in ADS or well, do it in. Let's say you stabilize the microphonotic layers. Yeah, suppose you stabilize it in some way. So then, yeah, you could do that. That by itself, personally, will not give you the level spacing. Yeah, so what do you have to add? I guess that's the question. What do you have to add to the HP solution? Yeah, yeah, okay. That's free. Okay, okay, I see. Yeah, yeah. Well. Well, yeah, you could wonder whether you have something similar to this double cone geometry. I mean, naively. Right, right, right. I don't know if there is something similar to that. But then you'd have to sort of look for the half morbles or whatever else you had to add to it to get the discrete structure. Right, right, right, right. So, so, but I mean, this seems like a nice laboratory to try to. Much laboratory to try to, you know, pull that apart because the level spacing isn't as complicated as the black hole. Right, right. Yeah, that's true. I mean, I would expect it that at the level you're asking the question, the level spacing will be as complicated, I think. Right? Well, presume, but you have this non-patron where you push it very close to the free string or something. Yeah. Um yeah, yeah, but I mean if if if the interactions are big enough to you know modify their size or some property of the solution are probably big enough to s to spread there will be something to the level spacing, but I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. But I think, yeah, it's a good question. So you had this double cone geometry, which is very natural given the geometry of the black hole. Right. But I don't see a natural I don't see a natural thing in this case. So maybe I don't know the answer. Maybe there is a simple answer, but I don't know. Yeah, but you could try to just compute one partition function and ask how a smooth density gets converted into delta functions or something. Would you have to add? Ah, okay. You want to say something even more. Steve, aren't these like string field theory wormholes or something that you're asking about? Something that you're asking about? Well, or the thing you have to add onto it. Oh, well, even worse. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. Doesn't string theory usually not help us with e to the minus one over g squared? I mean, I don't know. Well, I don't know. You know, just conceptually, what is the, I mean, what is the nature of what you're adding? I mean, yeah, this is the point. The only thing that might make this easier is that in This is easier is that in this, there's a knob to turn where it looks like three strings where we do know the answer in string theory, and so you might sort of inch up on the problem somehow. That's the question, you know, and maybe you don't have to compute the actual fine level spacing, but the level spacing in free strings is not e to the minus s, it's much bigger. So, you know, maybe there's some piece of it that you can find. Piece of it that you can find. And any of that, this seems like a nice laboratory. Yeah, that's a good question. Yeah, we haven't thought about that, but that's okay. I thought about it, but without any success. So, okay. All right, good. That's all I wanted to ask about. Thanks. But once you reach that regime, still, once you reach that regime, say with a liberal interaction, should the level speeching also the data spacing also now depends on the entropy still be controlled by um well well but as you know from the old days i mean there'll be some big level spacings and some small ones i mean it won't be you know it won't be a completely uh chaotic system and it'll be like a weakly interacting system yeah i think in this in this type of diagram you would expect that non-chaotic system roughly around here right right and Around here, right? Right. And I would expect that around here will be chaotic, but yeah, maybe if you understand this transition, I mean, maybe you would understand this transition well enough to. Yeah, that's right. It probably would involve probably poking around that orange transition to sort of see the first hint of what's going on. In any event, this problem is, well, it's impossible. It seems very difficult on the Black Hole side and maybe only very organized. Maybe only very hard to this side. Let me suggest that we continue this discussion during the Remo coffee break in the interest of time so that Daniel can get to his talk. Sorry to interrupt. Sorry. No, I mean, it's great. It's great. This is what Remo is for. So in that case, let's thank Juan again. Okay, thank you. All right, should I just start?
