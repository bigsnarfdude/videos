Okay, so last but not least, we have Michael Alvanese, who's going to speak about Spinach and Farther Exit, so to speak. Thank you very much for the introduction, and thank you very much for the opportunity to speak. Given that this is the last talk, I think we should take a moment to thank the organizers for organising such a wonderful workshop. So, I kind of considered that the end of the real workshop, so I can talk about something not so related. So, this is more a topological discussion of spin age and further generalizations of spin that Diego mentioned on Monday in his lightning talk. So, apologies. Also, Gavin mentioned a few things in his talk this morning, which I may or may not talk about. If I don't talk about it, If I don't talk about it and you want to know about it, feel free to ask. Okay. I will also not talk about G2, but I will have G2 on the slides twice. Once is here, and once will be later on. Okay, so I want to start with a question. So we can consider this problem session four. Does every orientable smooth manifold embed in a spin manifold? Embed in a spin manifold? The answer to this question is yes. Every n manifold embeds in R2n by the Whitney embedding theorem. End of the problem section. Not quite. So I'm going to ask a refined version of this question. Can we do better? What I mean by better, can we control the codimension? So for this particular choice of embedding, the codimension is equal to the dimension of my manifold. It's growing as the dimension of my manifold grows. I want to know: can I fix the codimension? I want to know: can I fix the codimension as the dimension grows? So, this is the question I really want to ask: Is there an integer k such that every orientable smooth manifold embeds in some smooth manifold with co-dimension k? There's some universal integer k, and I can always find a co-dimension k embedding or smaller into some spin manifold. So, just for some audience participation, let's have a vote. Who thinks the answer to this question is no? Who thinks the answer to this question is no? You cannot find a K? Okay, who thinks the answer is yes? So this is a problem to think about. So I want to talk about spin H, but before I do that, I want to do some background. In particular, I want to talk about some of the words in this question. But if you're bored during the background, try and think about how you could answer this question. Okay. Okay, so I'm going to start with orientable manifolds. So I'm being a bit slight fair, but a smooth manifold orientable. We can reduce the structure group of its tangent bundle, or more precisely the frame bundle of its tangent bundle, from O n to S O N. So these are compact groups, O N and S O N. So it sounds like I've chosen a metric, which you can do. I could also phrase this from G L N, non-compact group, to GL plus its equivalence, given that I'm talking about time. Given that I'm talking about topological aspects, the metric won't play any role, but you can always pass it a compact subgroup. Okay, so we have this index to subgroup, the special orthogonal group in the orthogonal group. In a short exact sequence like this. And you can analyze this question from an algebraic topological point of view using the following diagram, which, if you haven't seen before, don't worry. It'll come up a couple of times, but it's not the main focus of the talk. This is using This is using kind of this abstraction. So you can think of this as a continuation of this short exact sequence where I've applied B to every term in the same order. So the Z2 at the end maps to BSON, to BON, to BZ2. So this B functor, this is called the classifying space functor. It classifies bundles whose structure group is what is after the B. Okay, so BON classifies. Okay, so BON classifies ON bundles or equivalently rank n vector bundles. BSON classifies orientable rank n vector bundles. So what do I mean by a classify? What I mean is if I have a map from a space into one of them, that is equivalent to a bundle on the space n. So this map here classifies, say, the tangent bundle of n as an orientable bundle, sorry, as a not necessarily orientable bundle. Not necessarily orientable bundle and asking is it orientable is asking can I lift this map. This is what the language of these classifying spaces gives you. This is an algebraic topology question. And I've drawn them in this way because here this is a Z2 covering, principal Z2 bundle. These spaces are well defined up to homotopy. One model for BSON is the dwell smarting of oriented end planes. Of oriented n planes and BON is the Grass Manion of N planes inside of R infinity. So then the two-to-one map is just forget orientation. Okay, so this is a Z2 covering. Then it maps to BZ2, which I've written as KZ21. So this is some fancy notation for a special type of space, again well-defined up to homotopy, where it has one non-zero homotopy group. The number is telling you where that homotopy group occurs, so pi one, and the group is telling you that. So pi 1, and the group is telling you what the group is. So this is a space with pi1 equal to z2 and all other homotopic groups 0. So a model for this space is the real, the infinite real trajective space. Okay, so why is it called k if it's an Eilenberger plane space? That's the name of this thing. K is for cohomology. So just like maps into a classifying space classify bundles, hence B for bundle, maps into an Eilenberg claim space classify cohomology class. This has my co-homology classes. And this one has a name, it's called W1. And it turns out I can lift this map if and only if this co-homology class vanishes. That's the way this diagram works. So we recover from this fancy language a familiar statement that a manifold is orientable if and only if its first single-Written class vanishes. Note here, this cohomology class is in degree one with Z2 coefficients corresponding to these two. To these two. Okay, so every manifold of dimension less than or equal to one is orientable. And in dimension two, there's a non-orientable example, RP2. Okay, spin manifolds can be seen as a generalization of this. So we say an oriented smooth manifold is called a spin if we can lift the structured group from the tangent bundle from SON to spin n. So it's a lift rather than a subgroup. Subgroup. So now we have a two-to-one covering rather than an index to subgroup. That does change things a little bit, but we still have one of these fancy pictures. We've got the space of spin bundles, the space of orientable bundles, and the map between them induced by this map. And again, we're asking, can we lift from one to the other? So we fill in the rest to see, well, what would the collomology class be that I need? So now know. That I need. So now note before we had SON inside of ON and Z2 was on the right. Now Z2 is on the left. So that's why I get BZ2 first mapping to this. So it turns out because Z2 is abelian. This sequence continues one more step, and you can take B again of this space. So that's B squared. Okay, and this is a space with one non-zero homotopy group in degree 2. Group in degree 2, and that group is z mod 2. I have no idea what this space is. Don't know what it looks like. Okay, so in general, when you apply this B operation, you take the homotopy groups of your space and you shift them up by one. So Z2 has pi 0, Z2. Applied B twice, now Z2 is in a degree 2. So again, I'm mapping to one of these special spaces. It corresponds to a cohomology class, and that is called W2. Second steeple-whenny class, so we recover. Wini class. So we recover again a familiar statement. Oriented manifold spin if and only if this class batches, again, the degree and the group, telling us where the cohomology class lives. And just like the previous statement, we have this property automatically for oriented manifolds in low dimensions up to and including dimension three. And then CP2 is an example in dimension four, which is not spin. Here's a one way you can see this is that the spin condition implies some restriction. Condition implies some restriction on the intersection form of a four-manifold, namely it has to be even, and CP2 doesn't have an even intersection form. Okay, so can we keep going in this procedure? So if you think about passing from non-orientable to orientable, that was moving from ON, a disconnected group, to SON, which is a connected group. Then from SON to spin N, well, if N is at least 3, that's the universal cover of SON. So I'm passing from a Of SON, so I'm passing from a group with non-zero pi1 to a simply connected group. So at each stage, I've killed pi zero and pi one. Well, maybe I can just keep this process going, get a sense of higher structures by killing pi two, three, four, and five. Well, pi two of spin is already zero because pi two of any lead group is zero. So the next thing to kill would be pi three, which you can do, but then you run into an inconvenient problem, which is that there is only one connected. There is only one connected, simply connected Lie group with pi two and pi three equal to zero if it's finite dimensional, and that's a point. Right, so if you kill pi three, you can get a topological group, but it's infinite dimensional. And this is a thing that people do, particularly in physics. So we started with a map from n to bon, that was our initial manifold. We chose an orientation. So I said here, being orientable means you can lift, choosing a lift. Can lift, choosing a lift is equivalent to choosing an orientation. Likewise, choosing a lift here is a choice of spin structure. So the next one is called string, it's a string structure, and then there's infinitely many more. So in physics, they consider them. The next one's five-brain and nine-brain and so on. And just like in these cases, there's a single cohomology class which needs to vanish in order to be up to lift and obtain this structure. Structure. So if I'm doing this, if I'm looking at this sequence of structures, I'm starting with all manifolds, then I'm looking at the orientable ones, then I'm looking at the spin ones, then the string ones, and so on. Each time I do this, I'm restricting my attention to a smaller class of manifolds. I want to work the other way. Is the next one W3 or it's not? No, it's one half of the first Pondry class. So the next two, I think, are fractions. So the next two, I think, are fractional classes. So yeah, instead of getting more restrictive, I want to work in the opposite direction and get a larger class of manifolds. So instead, what I'm going to do is instead of continuing in this tower called the whitehead tower, I'm going to start with spin and work outwards. So this is where the notion of spin C comes from. So this was introduced by Atiya, Bott, and Shapiro to understand better the relationship between. Understand better the relationship between spinners and complex structures. So C stands for complex. So the group spin C is some sort of twisted version of spin where you take the product of spin with U1, U1 being the complex unitary group, take their product and one out by the diagonal Z2 subgroup, which is central. So now we still have a map to SOA, and you just project onto the quotient of the first factor. Project onto the quotient of the first factor, but now it's not a covering map anymore, it's a U1 fiber. So, an oriented smooth manifold is called spin C if we can lift the structure group of its tangent bundle from SOM to spin C of that. Okay, so I want to analyze this in the following picture. I've got the product of SON with U1. I can embed that. With U1, I can embed that inside of SON plus 2, just as a block diagonal. SON plus 2 has a double covering, which is the spin group. What I want to do now is take this double covering and pull it back by this map. And what I get precisely is spin C of N. Okay, so I'm not saying only that this diagram commutes. That is certainly true. But that could be true for a lot of choices of what I put in the top left-hand corner. For example, if I put a single point. For example, if I put a single point, then it would commute. But it's more than that, saying if I take this 2-1 covering and I pull it back, this is exactly what I get. You could have also embedded this inside of the indefinite special apartment group SON2, taken the spin double cover spin n, 2, and then this would tell you you'd get this exactly and shows the maximal compact subgroup of the indefinite screen. It's another way to view it. Okay, so the reason I wanted to introduce this is that it gives us a characterization of what it means for a manifold to be spin C. So you think of this SON factor as being the transition functions of your manifold or the tangent bundle. And then you have this auxiliary U1 part. What it tells you is that if you have an oriented manifold, it's spin C if and only if there is a complex line bundle L such that the sum is spin. Right, so this map here is really just So, this map here is really just take my two individual vector bundles, take their direct sum. Being spin means I can lift to here. This being a pullback diagram means that lift actually comes from a section. It's actually going to map to spin C. Should also point out if you're spin, then you're necessarily spin C. One way to see that is that spin embeds in this. You just embed it as the first factor, descends to the quotient. Alternatively, this characterization also shows that it'll. Characterization also shows that your spin because you could just take L to be the trivial bundle, that has the same W2 as a manifold W2. Okay, so I say here if and only if. The reason it's an if and only if is because if I have a spin C structure, then I can project it instead onto the second factor, which gives me a map to U1, and that is determining my complex line bundle. Okay, so in particular, if I have a spin manifold and I look at the induced spin C structure, that projection will be trivial. Structure that projection will be trivial. So I'll just get a trivial bundle. Okay, so I want to work with this condition to understand it a bit more because we're going to move on to spin H and try and replicate things. So an oriented manifold is spin C, if only if there's some complex line bundle whose W2 is the same as the W2 of your manifold. This is a hard condition to check because on any manifold you could have infinitely many complex line bundles. How do you draw that? Complex line bundles, how do you go about checking this in an easy way? So it turns out we can analyze this problem from a different point of view because L is a complex line bundle. So not only does it have steeple-written classes like real line bundles do, but it has its own set of characteristic classes as a complex vector bundle. Namely, it has a first churn class. And the first churn class is related to the second Stephen-Whitney class. First Chern class is an integral degree two class. The second Stephen-Whitney class is a Z2. The second Steve for Witty class is a Z2 value degree two class, and the relationship is if you take the mod two reduction of the integral class, you get the Z2 class. That by assumption is W2 of L is the same as W2 of M. So what this tells you is that W2 of M, this non-zero class, if I'm not on a spin manifold, if I'm on a spin C manifold, it has to be the mod2 reduction of some integral co-homology class. This is a non-trivial condition that does. This is a non-trivial condition that doesn't always hold. Okay, so this is a restriction I can see is imposed by the spin C condition. But still, I kind of haven't really changed the difficulty of the problem. Now I'm asking, is my W2 the mod2 reduction of an integral class? That could be an infinite set of things. How do I check that in an effective way? You can do it using the following observation. There's a long exact sequence in cohomology induced by the short exact sequence. By the short exact sequence z goes to z by multiplication by two, followed by a mod two reduction. That induces a map on cohomology which takes a degree or an integer class, multiplies it by two, takes the mod two reduction, and then beta, or the box theme, is the connecting homomorphism of this Muggett sequence. So if I think of W2 of my manifold living in here, it has an integral lift. It's an has an integral lift is if it's in the image of this map. So, this being an exact sequence means it's in the image of this map if and only if it's in the kernel of this one. So, m is spin c if and only if the image of w2 under this map is zero. So, this has a special name. It's called capital W3 or the integral Stefan-Whitney class because it lives in integral cardiology. Okay, so this is a single class which vanishes if and only if I have. Which vanishes if and only if I have this special structure, just like I had in the orientable case and in the spin case. So, just like in those two cases, this condition is automatic in low dimensions. So, it's oriented manifolds of dimensions less than or equal to four, a spin C. This is familiar in the compact case. This is also true in the non-compact case. It's a paper by Teitner and Vogt, which is non-trivial to show that even in the non-compact case, this structure exists. Structure you possess. This is particularly interesting because for cyber-Gwitten theory to start, you need spin-C structures. So all four manifolds have spin C structures, so you can start that. Just like in those other cases, we have an explicit example of something which doesn't have this property. So everything of dimension less than or equal to four is spin C. So the first place that you could possibly not be spin C is dimension five. And the Wu manifold that Gavin mentioned this morning is not spin C. Notice five dimensions. Notice five-dimensional, SU3 is eight-dimensional, SO3 is three-dimensional. Is there a term balance representative of W3? Well, no, because so if you look at the induced map, so you can map this to real cohomology and think about as a drama class, this class will vanish because it's too torsion, so it dies under that map. So there's no turn bay into that torsion. Also, note that every almost complex Also, know that every almost complex manifold is spin C. You can take this integral lift to be the first trans class. No, just oriented. How easy is it to show that something is not spin C rather than just keeping W C? It's not easy. So in the Wu manifold case, so just like in the spin case, W two equals zero implies the intersection of a four manifold is even. Of a four-manifold is even. There's a similar statement for five-manifolds. There's some kind of linker version called the torsion linking form on the torsion in H2. And the spin-seat condition implies that that has to have an even number of copies of Z mod2 in its torsion, and the blue manifold has one copy. So it's not easy to check directly, but there are implications which you can use for almost complex manifolds. A lame bundle is easy to get. Canonical bundle, yeah. Canonical bundle, yeah. So, for example, CP2 wasn't spin, but it is spin C, both because it's four-dimensional and because it's complex, you can take O of three as a line bundle with the same W2. Okay, so in the previous cases, I had one of these fancy diagrams. There's also one here. So, you've got U1, which is abelian. I can take B squared of U1. b squared of u1 u1 is diffeomorphic to a circle which has pi1 equal to z and all other homotopy groups zero so if I apply this operation twice shift that pi one to a pi three so I get a kz3 so the cohomology class is a degree three integral class is this capital W3 okay so now we move on to spin H manifolds which is just analogous thing you just replace the complexes by quaternions Complexes by quaternions. So instead of U1, you have SQ1. H just for quaternions. So if you had done spin R, it would be just spin M. If I'd done spin R, it would be spin cross O1, which is Z mod2. Then a quotient value Z2, I'd get spin N. Exactly. So again, we have a short exact sequence, which is that we have a map from spin H to SON. So we define spin H manifolds as those whose structure group left to spin H. So may I just write it so it's clear? So Spirit was saying if you do the real analog instead, you do spin n cross all the one. Not Z2, but this is Z2, so you just got spin. Okay. Okay. So I learnt about spin age when I was a grad student at Stony Brook from a thesis defense of Xuan Chen, who is a PhD student of Blaine Lawson. His thesis was about irreducible bundles of clipped modules. And the spin expedition comes up there. He was not the first to discover this. It was useful to him. It was the first I heard about it. And, you know, having learnt about spin and spin C, because, you know, About spin and spin C because you know, Bay Lawson is around. Uh, I asked my you know, the natural question is: are there like analogous statements? Everything we just said kind of like, oh, low dimensions is automatic, there's a non-example, there's a single obstruction, what is it? So, we wanted to know, you know, does the same hold true for spin H? So, Sean didn't go into academia, so we had this one conversation and then never spoke about it again. I talked to Lawson for a bit, but as you should do whenever you start a new project, you As you should do whenever you start a new project, you do diligence and you do some research. So I did that. It's my first port of call to Google Spinach. Unfortunately, it wasn't a very helpful thing to do because Google asked me, did you mean spinach? Which I didn't. Also note: if you Google spin C in the exact same way, it doesn't say spinach, even though spin C is closer to spinach than spinach is. But you can take this as an But you can take this as an indication of what little was known about spin H manifolds in these structures. Okay, so basically, we didn't have any analogues of the statements that we've seen in the previous cases. So our goal was to see, well, how much can we say, what's different? I will say that, you know, if you put spin age manifold, this doesn't happen, but it's not as funny. And these groups have existed and appeared in multiple contexts, I think, going back to 19. Context, I think going back to 1978, there's a paper of Hawking and Pope, which considers spin H of 4. So in physics, these groups come up a lot. Sometimes they're called spin SU2 or spin Q for quaternions. In particular, there's a recent paper of Wayne, Wen, and Witten in 2019 called A New SU2 Anomaly Cancellation, which is essentially this. So both Xuan Chen and Ed Witten asked me, because we've been talking about these things. We've been talking about these things. Is every five-manifold spin H? Manifold is spin, every four manifold is spin C. Natural question is every five manifold spin H? So that was something that I was interested in. So let's start thinking about these things. Again, we have this pullback diagram in the same way we did for spin C, but note now when you take sp1 mod plus minus one, you get SO3. Plus minus one, you get SO3. Okay, so you get SON plus SO3, happy to SON plus 3, pull back the double cover. So you get an analogous segment, but now instead of a complex line bundle, you have an orientable real rank 3 bundle. And again, the condition is the same. You need their W2s to match. So, what we did in the spin C case was we said, well, we have a complex line bundle, we took its first churn file. Line bundle, it took its first churn class, related it to its w2, and got an expression out of that. But this is not a complex vector bundle, it doesn't have its first churn class. But it does have other characteristic classes, namely the first Pontiac class. Okay, so it has a degree for integral class associated to it. So I can ask, is this class related to W2 just in the same way the first term class was related to W2? And hopefully extract some information out of that. out of that. So it turns out that there is a relationship between the two. It's going to be more complicated because this is a degree two class. P1 is a degree four class. One relation is this one. If you take the mod two reductions, you get a Z2 class. It's the square of W2. But actually you can do better than this. There's an improvement. There's a stronger statement, which is a mod four statement. So if I take the mod So, if I take the mod 4 class, the Z mod 4 class, it breaks up into two pieces. The first piece is called the Pontryagin square, which is just a particular lift of the squaring operation. So if I reduce this mod2, it becomes the square. And then I've got the fourth C4Witty class of pure embedded inside of Z4 cohomology induced by this map. So this is a particular lift from mod two to mod four. From mod two to mod four. This is always the case. E is orientable. This is just if you have an orientable vector bundle, this is true. So I'm not using the rank or anything yet. To this orientable vector bundle, you have this relationship. But I also can apply this to the tangent bundle of my manifold. Of my manifold. That's another orientable vector bundle, and I get the same relationship between its Pontiac classes and its W2 and W4. So now you see I've got two mod 4 relationships, one involving W2 of M and one involving W2 of E, which by assumption are the same. So these ring terms are the same. Also, E has rank 3. The C for winning classes of a rank 3 bundle. Of a rank 3 bundle are W1, W2, and W3, all the higher ones vanish. So W4 of a rank 3 bundle is 0, so this red term doesn't play any role. So if you take the difference between these two equations, what you see is that P1 of the manifold minus P1 of your rank 3 bundle reduces 14 to W4 located in this way. So this map is essentially the map 1. So, this map is essentially the map one goes to two. So, in my cohomology class level, what's happening is that the image of this map, everything is divisible by two. It's always twice some class. So, what I'd like to do is divide by two and get a mod two statement. So, I'm going to write this, which without dossipation is hand-wavy, let's put it polite way. It's not a great way to say it, but you can make this process. Great way to say it, but you can make this precise. So, in particular, P1 of m minus P1 of E is just some element of an abelian group. So, even if I know it's two times something, it's not necessarily two times a unique thing. I think about Z mod 4, 2 is 2 times 1 and 2 times 3. So, when I write down a half, I have to talk about which half am I talking about. There is a way to make this precise, and this is one of the advantages of working with these classifying spaces. B, you can do this universally. Can do this universally, there's a unique choice, you pull back. So, if we can make sense of this statement, okay? So, what is this statement? W4 of m, which is a z2 class, is the mod2 reduction of an integral class. This is like in a spin c case, w2 was the mod2 reduction of an integral class, and now it's 4 instead of 2. So, what I should have mentioned this is joint work with Alexander Milavojevich. So, what we showed is that the primary obstruction. Showed is that the primary obstruction to an oriented manifold m being spin h is that this z2 class omits an integral lift, which again can be encoded as the vanishing of this box the so there's a degree five integral class which needs to vanish it just vanish. So I use the words primary obstruction there, I mean that precise in the sense of obstruction theory. So what does that mean? So obstruction theory tells you by kind of looking at this classifying space picture that Classifying space picture that there will be certain cohom-level obstructions to being spin H, or in general, any G structure. There'll be one in each dimension, a certain dimension is determined by the problem. So primary just means this is the first one. So there are no lower dimensional obstructions. Degree one, two, three, and four, nothing shows up. There's nothing preventing you. But degree five is the first place that shows up. And this is the only thing that shows up in degree five. But then there could be other obstructions in degree six. Could be other obstructions in degrees 6, 7, 8, and so on. One corollary of this is that every oriented manifold of dimension at most five is spin H. Because I told you the obstructions in degree 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, they don't happen, because this is the first one. So this is the first one. And in dimension 5, it's the only one, because all the other obstructions lie in cohomology groups, which are zero. So you just need to know that this vanishes. Need to know that this vanishes. Well, either M is not closed, so compact with boundary or non-compact, in which case this group is zero, or m is closed, in which case this is Z. But as I mentioned before, this is a two-torsion class. So the only torsion element is zero. So in either case, we see that as spin-h. So this is partly generalizing the spin and spin-C story. Note, I'm not claiming, unlike the spin-and-C. I mean, unlike the spin and spin C cases, that I have an if and only if, that if this class vanishes then spin H, there could be higher obstructions. And the reason for this is if you go to the previous slide and try to work backwards, is that if I just have the knowledge that w4 lives to an integral class, I can't necessarily realize that as the first quantity class. Whereas in the spin C case, every integral class is the first shown class of a line bundle. And the And do you have any examples without your scrap shift? Yeah, so yes. There are examples. I can talk about this a bit more later, but I'll do an example in a set which is not spin H. And there we just use this obstruction to show it's not spin H. But we have other examples in dimension 8 where this vanishes but it's not spin H. So I can talk about that more later at the end. So, I can talk about that more later at the end. Okay. So, let me give another example. So, obviously, every five manifold, let me look at a closed orientable seven manifold. I don't know if anybody in this room has thought about such manifolds before. So, it's a theorem of Thomas that if you have such a manifold, you always admit two linearly independent vector fields. And you always admit one by the Poincaré. And you always admit one by the Pancre-Poch theorem because it Euler characteristic is zero, but actually you get a second three. You could admit more, for example, S7 is parallelizable, but if you have at least two. Now suppose your manifold admits a reduction of structure group to G2. Then you can produce a third using the cross product. So I can split my bundle as some rank four bundle E0 and a trivial rank three bundle spanned by these three linear independent vector fields. Three linear independent vector fields. From this rank four bundle, I can produce two rank three bundles given by lambda plus or minus, just in the same way you take lambda plus or minus of a four manifold. So no, I really need the metric to do this because I've already looked into the metric. And you can check that when I do this procedure of passing from the rank four bundle to the rank three bundle, the w2 doesn't change. So w2 of e0 is the same as w2 of m. E0 is the same as W2 of M because they're stably equivalent. And then W2 of these new rank 3 bundles are the same. So this is great. I have a rank 3 bundle with the same W2 as my manifold. This tells me it's spin H, but you should object because in order to reduce to G2, the only obstruction is that you're a spin. So you're better than spin H. So who cares? You're obviously spin H if you're spin. But suppose now. But suppose now my manifold admits a metric with holonomy G2, so holonomy equal to G2. One of the conditions, if I'm not wrong, is that the first Pontryagin class is not zero in real cohomology. So if I take the first Pontryagin classes of these bundles, there's a formula for how it relates to the initial E0. And again, I can relate this to the first Pontryagin class of my manifold. What these expressions tell you is that at least one of these bundles, possibly both, These bundles, possibly both, have a non-zero P1 and hence a non-trivial. Actually, a rank three bundle that's not trivial. So it's a rank three bundle with the same W2, but it's not the trivial one. So that's what you would get if you just looked at the spin structure inducing a spin H structure. The rank three bundle you'd get is a trivial one. Here you have, in some sense, a non-trivial spin H structure of a G2 manifold. Okay, so you could have lots of different spin H structures, and just like in certain contexts, different. You know, just like in certain contexts, different spin structures give you different information. In cyber-witten theory, certain spin C structures tell you certain things that others don't. If you had some way of using spin H structures to solve some geometric problems, maybe this spin H structure would be more interesting than the trivial one. That's the second time I mentioned it. Okay, now the promised non-example. So, in all these cases, orientable spin spin C, we had every manifold of less than or Every manifold of less than or equal to a certain dimension is automatically has this structure, then in the next dimension, I had a non-example. This is not quite that. So I'm going to start with my Wu manifold, M equals S3 mod SO3, and consider the product with itself. So this is a 10-dimensional manifold. Note that 10 is bigger than 5, so it's not automatically spin H. And I can compute W4 of this manifold. W4 of this manifold, which just breaks down into W2 of the original Wu manifold pull back. So this is not spin, so W2 is non-zero, this product is non-zero. It's a non-zero class. If I use the Kuna formula to compute this group, you get zero precisely. Now you have to be careful, Z is not a field, so you have to do X to keep track of torsion. But it turns out none of it appears. So what you conclude is that this class being non-zero, This class, being non-zero, cannot have an integral left because the only possible integral lift would be zero, then the mod 2 reduction would be zero. It's not. So this manifold, m cross m is not spin h. On the other hand, m itself is the Wu manifold. It's five-dimensional. So by this corollary I mentioned, it's automatically spin H. And in fact, there you can say explicitly what this rank 3 bundle is. You can take it to be the bundle associated to this. It to be the bundle associated to this SO3 principal bundle, they have the same W2, so it's spin H. So spin H has the strange property that it's not closed under products. This is not the case for spin and spin C. If you take the product of two spin, none of their spin, product of two spin C, non-folds their spin C. So in the spin C case, one of the reasons you can do this is because if I have a complex line bundle coming from one factor and another from another factor, I can produce a new Factor, I can produce a new complex line bundle by taking their tensor product. If I have two rank three bundles that are orientable, I can take their tensor product. You can check their W2 will just be the sum of the W2s, but it's rank nine. So there's no natural way to produce a new one. So note there's a gap here between five and ten. So we have some more information, but if there's more time, I can. Some crazy way to take a cross product of two more people in the future in our future. Well, if there is, I mean, maybe Gavin, like, is there a map from SO3 cross SO3 to SO3 with the right properties? If there is, it's W2s don't do what we need them to do because otherwise we do. So excuse me? Would that mean that any spin C times a spin H gets a spin H? Oh, good question. I don't. I don't. So, how do you combine the U1 bundle with the SO3 bundle to produce the new SO3 bundle? One-dimensional bundle, and 3D and final only has a problem with the solution one times three. So, you have like a like U1 or XO2, right? So, you have a I think it fits into one of the more general structures or I think it fits into one of the more general structures I'll talk about, but I don't see if it's necessarily spin H. I'm not sure. It would be that's the question. Yeah, reasoning that you had, which obviously numerically kills it. Yeah. It's just a sluggish that doesn't work. Yeah. Alright. So this is the last one of these pictures, I promise. But the reason I introduced these pictures is because something that's true for all those other pictures doesn't work. That's true for all those other pictures doesn't work here. So, again, I have these spaces by plane B. This map lifting is the same as having a spin H structure. But what's different now is that there's a problem here because SQ1 is not abelian. I can't take B twice. Right, so this map doesn't even exist because this space doesn't exist. Which is related to the absence of products and Exactly, yeah. It's not like that. So, also, even if this space exists, and so if you think to the orientable case, spin case, spin C case, I said each of these is equal to k of something. A space with one non-zero homotopy group, and that determined a single cohomology class, which was the obstruction. Even though this space doesn't exist, you can still talk about obstructions in terms of the homotopy groups of. Homotopic groups of SP1. SP1 is diffeomorphic to S3. The homotopic groups of S3 are not just one of them. So pi3 is Z, but there's a lot of non-zero ones. In fact, everyone above 3 is non-zero. Every single one. This is known now. So what obstruction theory tells you is that in this spin H problem, there are potentially infinitely many obstructions. All we've done is found the first one. Found the first one. I say potentially because what obstruction theory gives you is it says for each non-zero homotopy group, there's a cohomology class in some cohomology group whose coefficients are these pi i's that has to vanish. But that element could be the zero element already, in which case you don't have to check anything. So there's potentially many, infinitely many obstructions, but there's infinitely many groups where those obstructions could fit. Good late. So we've just found the first one. Okay, so let me move on to further generalizations now. So, in particular, we've seen this idea I said of why we're not going up this list, this higher and higher list from ON to SON to spin n to string n and so on was because we're getting more and more restrictive. I mean, what I want to do is the opposite. I want to get include more and more of my manifolds. And by passing from spin to spin C to spin H, I've been able to do that. Seemed to spin H, I've been able to do that. Each time I've exhibited for you some manifold which is not having one structure but has the next one. But the blue manifold across the blue manifold shows spin H is not enough. I don't include everything. There's still manifolds I'm missing that don't have this structure. So just as Spiro alluded to earlier, you can think of spin as the real analog of spin C and spin H, crossing with O of one instead of U of one. And these correspond to the reals complexes and proton. To the reals, complexes, and octonions. And as we learned in the first talk, there are four non-division algebras. So, octonians is the next thing you would think. You think, is there an analog? So, as Diego pointed out in his talk, the natural thing to try is the unitary Octonians, which is not a group because they're not associative. But you might think, well, Octonians, G2, you know, maybe I can just put G2 there, tap that on. Unfortunately, G2 doesn't have a Z2 subgroup. Have a Z2 subgroup, a central Z2 subgroup. It's kind of the analysis breaks down. So, in physics, they have considered kind of the general case of spin cross any Li group with a central Z2 subgroup. They call these coupled systems. I think you need a spin structure for a fermion. So, these allow you for fermions in different contexts. But we didn't kind of pursue it any further because G2 didn't work. If you did it on the X7, you would just go. Yeah, so you could ask, you know, there was some talk about this earlier in the week of like a slightly weaker geometric algebraic object. Could you ask, is there a notion of classifying space and homotopy theory for these objects? I don't know. But that's a potential avenue. So I'm going to forget about that. And then I'm going to generalize as Diego did and notice that these three groups instead are spin groups themselves. And introduce, I use spin k rather than spin spin spin. Introduce a spin k rather than spin R as the product of two spin groups quotient by Z mod 2 generated by the diagonal. So this discussion includes spin, spin C and spin H as one, two, three values of K. So again, we have a notion of a spin k manifold in lift to spin k. We have this diagram, pullback diagram, in the exact same way. Pullback diagram in the exact same way. And therefore, we see that your manifold is spin k if and only if there is an oriented rank k bundle e, such that the sum is spin or equivalently bare the same w2. Right, so one point of difference that's worth pointing out is that when k is equal to 3, this is exactly the statement we got for spin h. But you might say, well, when k was equal to 2, that's spin c. And instead of e being a rank 2 bundle, I had a complex line bundle that they're the same thing. Bundle that they're the same thing. Orientable rank two bundle and complex line bundle were the same thing. So the fact that it's complex was kind of an accident, a low-dimensional accident, wasn't a feature. Okay. So I have a different characterization of spin K, which is potentially more useful than is there some rank K bundle? And it's the following. An oriented manifold M embeds in a spin manifold M. Embeds in a spin manifold n with codimension k, it's an only if it's spin k. So having this structure is about embedding into a spin manifold with a controlled codimension. So how do you show this? Well, suppose your manifold M embeds in a spin manifold N with codimension K. Then if I take its normal bundle, that's a rank K bundle, because the co-dimension is K, it's orientable because M and N are. And then you can show that because the And then you can show that because the tangent bundle of n splits as the normal bundle plus the tangent bundle, the w2's coincide. And hence, by the previous characterization, it's in k. The other direction, suppose you have the bundle E coming from a spin k structure, how can I see that my manifold embeds in a spin manifold? Well, the bundle E has a total space, and that total space is spin, which follows from this decomposition of this tangent bundle. And I can embed my manifold. And I can embed my manifold as the zero section of this vector. And of course, these two are related by the tubular hyperpoint theorem. This gives us a way of thinking about these spin k manifolds. They're precisely the ones that exist as codimension k submanifolds of spin manifolds. So for example, the blue manifold is not spin C, so that means I can never embed it as a codimension 2 submanifold of the spin manifold. But it is spin H, so I can embed it as a co-dimensionifold. spin H, so I can embed it as a pro-dimension 3 sub-manifold, a spin manifold. Also, I haven't said it here, but if M is compact, I can choose M to be compact. In these examples, M is non-compact, but I can always arrange for it to be compact. So the initial question I asked you was, is there an integrity of K such that every orientable manifold embeds into a spin manifold with codimension K? By this proposition, that's the same thing as asking. This proposition is the same thing as asking: is there an integer k such that every orientable smooth manifold is spin k? So, in terms of this picture of allowing different structures to encapsulate more and more manifolds, is there a k such that everything is spin k? What this question is asking. So, finally, we have an answer. I think most of you were right. So, it's the theorem that Alex and I proved in the same paper. Paper. For every integer k, there are infinitely many homotopy types of closed, simply connected manifolds which are not spin k. So the answer to the question is no. So people's intuition was pretty spot on. So there's lots and lots of examples. So you give me any integer k, I can find some manifold which cannot be embedded code of integer k in any sort of manifold whatsoever. So say a couple of things about the proof. Proof one of which is interesting geometrically. So there's this integrality theorem of my from the 60s. So suppose you have a closed even dimensional spin k manifold, and L is one half of k, mixture part. Then we have this following integrality statement. So m of E is some expression in the Pontry eigenclasses of E, and this A hands some expression in the Pontry eigenclasses of M. So you've got two lots of. So you've got two lots of cohomology classes interacting here. This expression, which has rational coefficients in general, has to be an integer. So this is related to the index of a spin k Dirac operator. It's not exactly that, but it's related. So this gives you a restriction that you need to satisfy. So what we were trying to do is find manifolds which violate this. So how do you produce manifolds which violate something like that? Well, the general principle Well, the general principle is that this is complicated with lots and lots of terms. So we're just going to look at manifolds where most of the cohomology is zero, so we don't have to worry about them. So what we looked at are what's called rationally highly connected manifolds, which are manifolds that you think of like CP2, HP2, OP2, which are manifolds which have only three non-zero cotomology groups, bottom dimension, top dimension, and middle, but you allow the middle one to be any dimension you like. But you allow the middle one to be any dimension you like. Everything else rationally vanishes. Then the majority of these classes disappear. You have less you have to control. Basically, the top Hontriagen class and the middle one. So there's a theorem by Barge and Sullivan that allows you to produce such manifolds. So if I have a manifold, I can take its rational cohomology, which is a ring, and you can ask which of these rings abstractly arise from this process. If I just give you a rational This process. If I just give you a rational cohomology ring, sorry, a ring, a graded ring, thank you. A graded ring, what are the conditions I need? So that is the cohomology ring of some manifold. The Barge-Sillovin theorem answers this exactly. And the conditions are just the necessary conditions you might think. It has to satisfy concrete duality. There has to be Contriaging classes. And those Pontry argon classes have to compute the signature. That's basically. Have to compute the signature. That's basically the theorem. These necessary conditions are actually sufficient. So we use this theorem to reduce this construction problem to some Diophantine equation. You just need to choose your ranks in the appropriate way to solve some Diophantine equation, and then you have such manifolds. And then we solve the Diophantine equation using the branches of four squares theorem, which says that every integer can be written, every positive integer, can be written as the sum of four squares. So it turns out we could do that. So it turns out we could do that and we can produce these manifolds which violate this construction. So I think I have okay. So you asked before about other obstructions. Maybe let me mention that. So we use the spin 8 version of this, which I can write down. So there you get two times times hyperbolic cosine of the square root of P1 of E over 2 times the A hat genus of Tm is an integer. That is the expression that this reduces to for spinach counterpoints. So what we did is we found an M8 using the Barge-Sullivan theorem violating this and in fact infinitely many but it's a theorem of But it's a theorem of Hertzerbruck and Hop that for any closed orientable eight manifold capital five vanishes. So if you take the statement that every closed orientable four manifold is spin C, one way to prove that works in any manifold, any dimension who's a multiple of four. Any dimension who's a multiple of four, that same argument will imply, yes. It doesn't always imply that capital W vanishes, but some class vanishes, namely the root class, expose the root class. So this is saying that our first obstruction vanishes, but it can't be spin H because it violates this. So there's some intermediate obstruction. We believe that the next two obstructions vanish, and it's the degree 8 obstruction that's missing. We have no idea what it is, but it's a Z. We have no idea what it is because it's a Z12 obstruction. So we don't even have a guess at what to try. So, yeah, so basically, we can show that if M is closed orientable and the dimension is less than or equal to seven. M is spin h. So we have an argument for five, but actually we have a separate argument that works for six and seven. And then we show that dimension eight is where the first non-examples exist. So we can kind of bridge this gap. What about speed argument? So how would you do it? So there we don't have any type of track control. So the examples we produce using this method are massive in dimensions. So the examples we produce this way to produce a non- Examples we produce this way to produce a non-spin H manifold, its dimension is 32, which is far from optimal, and it only gets worse. So, for any given R for spin R, you can find some example, but it might be very far from optimal. And no, not really. We were really interested in the Skin H case, and this was just kind of an afterthought. Yeah. So maybe. Yeah. So maybe, am I done? No, let's leave that for a minute. Okay. Let me mention then what I should have mentioned at the start is I sent you this question, does every orientable manifold embed in a spin manifold with a controlled co-dimension? Kind of the preemptive question for that is coupes. Why ask that question? So, you can ask the easier question: Does there exist K such that every orientable manifold embeds in an oriental manifold? Into a round forward with code in which you pay. That's just the same analogous question, but for one step earlier. You could do the same analysis, and what you find is that, well, you're looking for a bundle E which satisfies this. Instead of looking at W2, you're looking at W1, and then you can rank with this bundle E. So you're asking. This one will be. So you're asking, given w1 of my manifold, is it w1 of some rank k bundle? The answer is yes, you can take k equal to 1 because w1 of the determinant line bundle is the same. So what this tells you is that every non-orientable manifold invented quietimension one of an orientable manifold is the zero section of this thing. So this is kind of the one reason you might answer this question. Also something that you are Also, something that you asked me last time, and I'll mention that. In this case, if you take the determinant line bundle over M and you take the sphere bundle, that's a Z2 bundle, and that's precisely the oriented double cup. So what happens if you take a sphere bundle in these spin H cases? So what happens is you have some vector bundle E over your mouth. Bundle E of your manifold of rank K and then you get a sphere bundle like this and your spin K if this thing is spin so it's kind of like a generalization of the orientable double cover it's like the spin cover but the fiber is not a double cover it's a different dimension sphere so the example that Gavin mentioned is this one It's this LF World manifold. It's a two-sphere bundle over the group manifold whose total space is spin and hence has a G2 structure. So we showed every five manifold is spin H. So over every five manifold, we find a two-sphere bundle whose total space is spin and therefore emits a G2 structure. In GABLAN special case, those bundles have additional information which allows you to. Bundles have additional information which allows you to write down that you can structure it precisely. We were discussing yesterday: could it be possible that we have a connection or other structure? Could you do this for an arbitrary SO3 bundle, provided this is skinned? I think I'll stop there.
