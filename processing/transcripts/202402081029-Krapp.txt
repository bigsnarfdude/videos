Introduction and also thank you to the organizers for inviting me to this amazing winter wonderland where snow is actually still a thing. So I'm going to report today on, I would say, the last one and a half sections of joint work with Samar Kuhlmann on ordered trans-exponential fields. So some people here have already seen this talk either once or even twice, but it's not the same talk. So I'm going to start. I mean, I'm planning to talk about three things to have the time. Three things. So, in the first part, I'm going to introduce a first-order theory that we consider. In the second part, I actually changed a bit while I was here. I'm trying to do something I called the basics of trans-exponential valuation theory. And in the third part, I'm going to present the main result and see how far I got with the main proof steps. And the second part is actually going to consist mainly of pictures. So there's going to be a long interlude where everybody can just sit back and relax. Everybody can just sit back and relax. Okay, so let's start with the introduction of the theory: OTFs, all the different exponential fields, and the growth property. Okay, so I should say before I start here, what kind of the idea, the basic idea is that we have, because there are some people also in this room. Because there are some people also in this room that have been working on trans-exponentials or rather maybe also hyperlogarithms. And what we do is in some sense, in some parts, similar to it. But we are not aiming to look at, let's say, hyperlogarithms and also the algebra and trans series. What we are aiming to do is to introduce a first-order theory. And this means that we want to try as simple as possible, staying first-order, and having Staying first order and having a suitable axiomatization, and then we aim to find out what can be deduced algebraically and valuation theoretically from this simple axiomatization. So it's very much similar to, for those that have been around for a longer time, to what has been done in the late 80s by Dan and Polita in the 1990s about exponential fields. So back then, people didn't have an idea how to axiomatize the theory of real exponentiation, which is pretty. Exponentiation, which is pretty difficult, as the developments have shown. But there were these first naive approaches. So people tried to find some easy first-order theory, and then they figured out, well, this is not an axiomatization of real exponentiation. And that carried on for a while. And it was mainly Zelmer's work in the late 80s, 1990s, where she actually considered a very simple axiomatization. Considered a very simple axiomatization of so-called ordered exponential fields. I'm going to say what they are in a second. And then she developed some valuation theoretic frameworks. So just starting from very simple axioms, she studied how much algebra, how much valuation theory you can all already have on them. And I think this is a pretty nice approach, starting from first principles, and that's what we do here too. So you stay model theoretically correct, let me fix the language, language of order, trans-exponential fields. Exponential fields. So it's the language of ordered exponential fields with a unary function symbol E and just the ordered field language. And we need another unary function symbol which we are going to call T. And the T, of course, is going to stand for the trans explanation. Okay, so the structure. And this is the only time I actually write out the component structure. Time I actually write out the complete structure. So later we're just going to write kt is an order trans-exponential field. In short, OGF, or a transactional field, if the following axioms are satisfied. If you know the axioms, so let's start with the basic things that are more than sensible. You should have that the base structure is actually an order field. Okay, so no debate about that. And here's the first thing where we actually already have to make a choice. So what about the symbol E? E is something we called, called the GAT1 growth axiom, Taylor axiom one exponential. Okay, and if we just say what that actually means, so it means that the following have to be satisfied. First of all, what is actually an exponential in our sense? In our sense, an exponential is an order-preserving isomorphism from the additive reduct of k to the multiplicative group of positive elements. Of positive elements. So in symbols, E maps isomorphically the additive structure to the multiplicative structure of K of positive elements. Okay, and even here, and this I think this is the first point that might be surprising to some people. Might be surprising to some people, this exponential does not necessarily grow fast enough. So just having this doesn't mean that E eventually dominates every polynomial. That's what we need the GA for. So the growth axiom, which states that for all natural n, equals n and for all x and k, if x is sufficiently large, and sufficiently means at least n squared, then e to the x, so e of x, should be greater than x to the n. Okay, so that is first semester, first year analysis proof, show that the exponential function grows faster than any polynomial with an actual doubt that we get. With an actual bound that we give. But it will later turn out when we go to the valuation theory that this bound doesn't matter because the interesting stuff is going to happen on the infinite elements anyway. So, and just to have a very clean model theory, yeah, a very clean first order model theory, I mean, maybe I want to, I should point out at this point what other people do. Other people do not define t on all of the domain, on all of k. Other people would jump straight into the infinitely large. To the infinitely large positive elements. But since we are interested in model theory, we also care about what t does on, let's say, the Archimedean part, on the standard part of K, on the valuation ring, if you want to say it like that. And that's why we need the other axiom to have some nice also analytical behavior. So it's the Taylor axiom number one. What is Taylor axiom number one? x is sufficiently small, between 0 and 1, then we can do the first Taylor approximation. Alright, okay, so this is teleaxion one because there's a bunch of them where you would just also have a long. Also, have a longer tail expansion of the standard E function. Okay, so this is not yet in trans exponentials. So let's start with the first axiom that tells us something about T, the trans exponential. So the first thing it should satisfy is that it maps defined in all of K, again, I'll point this out, and it maps to positive elements. And it maps to positive elements only. But more so is order preserving. Strictly increasing is another word for order preserving. This order preserving end by debt. Okay, so there are some choices that we made, but so far it also kind of is a nice axiomatization because Because it's pretty much also what the exponential should satisfy. The exponential maps only to positive elements, it's an order-preserving bijection. So they kind of live in the same world. And now the important, the two important axioms. So how do T and E interact? So far, T could be, for all we know, just any kind of function, could be an exponential function. So what does it satisfy? Satisfy. On the closed interval, 0, 1, that's the most controversial one because I know that lots of people have doubts about this, but I'll explain in a second why I do, or we do not have a doubt about this. So on the closed unit interval 0, 1, t and e coincide. And this is kind of giving to the trans exponential the initial value it needs for the valuation ring, on the standard part. Ring on the Steinberg part. Okay? And it is controversial because this is not what Bushansen did. So just saying t is equal to e will give us some very bad properties, some people would say, but in our context, these are not bad properties. These are just properties we do not much care about when we do the valuation theoretic study of trans-exponentials on the infinitely large numbers. Okay, so that is a brief disclaimer. But we need some initial value to have nice model theory. So the most Model theory. So the most important axiom, the functional equation, that we all saw already two days ago, I write down like this. So in Chris Miller's talk, there was this functional equation, which probably everybody knows works in this area. So t of x, if I go one step to the right in t, then I go exponentially up. Then I go exponentially up in its image. Okay, and again, to do key model theory, what about the negative part that we will quickly disregard because what t does on the negative numbers is not that interesting or that important. So let's just make sure that we do not get a contradiction with the axioms above. So the easiest and quickest way to deal with negative numbers is to say that 0. t of minus x is 1 over t of x. Okay, so this goes very well with t being order-preserving and bijective. And again, this is something that also the exponential function satisfies. Okay, so we change color. These two axioms is so this here, very important. Important functional equation. And this here is what we call the compatibility axioms. So this says that T is compatible with E. Why is that? Again, maybe looking at the hyper series people. So in the hyper series context you often just fix a model of real exponentiation. So you have that one fixed exponential function. So, you have that one fixed exponential function. We don't do that. We say any exponential goes that has ga and t1, so which grows fast enough and has some nice analytic properties. And this is actually something I'm going also to do today. We're going to switch between exponentials. So, we're going to have a field which comes with one exponential, and maybe with that one exponential, there is no compatible T. Actually, it's going to turn out that such fields exist a lot. Actually, it's kind of in some sense low. Fields, kind of, in some sense, most fields that have an exponential do not have a trans exponential. Well, where this is hard to quantify, but we will see that if we replace, in the countable case, it's all about countable, if we replace the exponential by another exponential, then suddenly we can have a trans-exponential compatible. So, this is going to be one of the main results today. Okay, and this all together? So, So these all bracket is the axioms for TOTF, the theory of order trans-exponential fields. Okay, now I can talk about order trans-exponential fields. I can also talk about models of TOTF, and I use very specific terminology in order not to upset anybody in the following remark that I made. So let me change the third colour. If we change the blood colour, TOTL has no minimum models. Okay, so this is why I'm changing to TOTF rather than saying there is no minimal order trans-exponential field, because then people might just wake up and be like, no, we didn't just say that. So, TOTF, our theory. Our theory of order trans-exponential fields has no O-minimum model. Okay, why is that? Well, firstly, why is that on the sense of motivation? Why do we not care about it so much? Well, I have to mention it again. We are not here for the quest of finding an o-minimal trans-exponential field. I mean, we try to contribute to it by developing some modern evaluation theory, but we can quickly disregard this and then do what we actually want to do, namely evaluation theory. Want to do, namely validation theory. And now, what is the reason that this has no minimum models? It's number four, axiom number four. It's because of the choice of the initial value, because, I mean, it's also something Chris Miller explained in this talk. So on the Archimedean part of the field of K, this completely determines what T has to look like. So we know what it looks like on a closed interval of like one, and we know what it looks like when we go one step further to the right. So everything that after finitely many So, everything that after finitely many iterations of adding plus one, anything we can reach from the interval 0, 1 will actually be determined. So, the image of that will actually be determined by these two compatibility conditions. And now what happens? So, this is some kind of gluing. And what happens is that at the gluing points, so exactly at the integers, we will have not twice continuous differentiability. So, I could even say something stronger. In any model of TOTF, we can define We can define a discretely ordered subring. We can define the integers, which makes the theory extremely bad from a tailness point of view. Okay, and this settled, we can now turn to what we actually want to work on and still help you discuss these questions. And also, for those people that want to know how you might not achieve this, what can be done about that. But not now. Okay, so another important property. Another important property, this is again a nice historical analogy, is the following. An ordered trans-exponential field has the growth property. Show that's the definition. Okay, if the following holds, we again write it down as an axiom or an axiomatic way. Down as an axiom, in an axiomatic way. So for all naturals n, for all x which are sufficiently large, and sufficiently large in this case is at least n plus 1 squared, we have that t of x is greater than the nth iterative of e of x. We wouldn't let me just write down what this notation means. Write down what this notation means. It's just E of E of E of X, and this is all n times. Okay, and this might, actually this is, I think this is surprising, but it's a perfect analogy. As I said earlier, when we just had the axioms for the exponential without the growth axiom scheme, it is not ensured that the exponential grows faster than Not ensured that the exponential grows faster than any polynomial. And now we have these axioms for trans-exponential. And again, it turns out, as we will see today, that the growth property is not guaranteed. So just by these axioms, we do not get that the trans-exponential, that the function t, I have to say here, grows faster than, eventually, than any iterative of e. So that is a property that we're going to investigate today. So let me first present a positive example. So what is the Present the positive example. So, what is the order trans-exponential field with a growth property? And of course, we have the example which is not too hard to come up with. Let's just take the real numbers. We take the exponential, which is just mapping x e to the x, the standard exponential. And the trans-exponential is defined as follows. It's defined as follows. It maps x to the rounded down integer value of x times iterate plus 1 of x minus flow function of x. Okay, so this is what Christmilla referred to about the trans-exponential being completely determined on, well, in this case, it has its own valuation ring, so on all of the fields. Ring so on all of the field if we are in the Archimedean case. Because every time we go one step further to the right, we actually go one step further up in the iteration. So this is quite simple to see. And just for completion, so this is for x greater than or equal to zero. And it's one over t of minus x for x less than zero. x less than 0. Okay, so we have a nicely defined trans-exponential. It's straightforward to verify all the axioms, because of course, this is the example that one has in mind. And one other thing which is straightforward for everybody who attended some analysis one course is to verify that this trans explanation has the work property. So Okay, what more is there to say about this simple case? So one thing I also want to mention, maybe I don't write it down, I just say it. So any other Archimedean model of the theory of order trans exponential fields, any other Archimedean order-trans-exponential field, What a trans exponential field, it's already a substructure of this. This, I would say, is not 100% straightforward, but you can do it just from the axiom. So you can actually show that if you have an Achimedian-ordered field with an exponential function satisfying these two, then it must already be a restriction of the standard exponential function. And then the trans-exponential you get for free in the Archimedean case. And it will be also the restriction of this here to the domain. Okay, so the Archimedean models. Okay, so the Archimedean models of our theory are extremely simple to understand. Well, so at least we know what they look like. And so the question is: what about the non-Archimedean models? This is what I'm going to do today. So the multi-weight question. Are there non-Archimedean models of the EOTF without the growth property? Depending on how far I get, I either at least state it to you, but maybe I even convince. You, but maybe I even convinced you by proof that the answer is yes. And we focus on here in this talk today, but in our preprint, we did a lot more. But here in this talk today, we focus on countable models and use valuation theory. And use valuation theory. Okay, so this is what I'm going to do now. Introduce some valuation theoretic observations that will help us in finding these obscure order trans-exponential fields where we have everything we think would suffice, but still the trans-exponential doesn't grow as fast as we want it to.  Okay, we're in the middle part of the presentation, which means now you can sit back and relax while I draw some pictures. So this section is called the principal exponential rank and I adjusted it. And I adjusted it just for this conference, very spontaneously, through the title basics of trans-exponential valuation theorem. Okay. So, when I say valuation theory, I asked some people, but nobody could answer the question: what actually is valuation theory? People, but nobody could answer the question: what actually is valuation theory? And well, I did get a few answers, but let me describe what valuation theory is to me. So, we are here in the context of valuation theory of ordered structures. So, what I'm going to present is really basic ordered structures considerations, which I think are very beautiful, because you just have a line and then we kind of do the standard stuff you do when you have infinitely large elements. So, you want to get whole of sizes, although you have infinitely large and infinitely large large large large Although you have infinitely large and infinitesimally small sizes, the infinitesimal bit is not interesting today. So the infinitely large elements are the ones we care about. And valuation theory, for me, is a tool to actually get hold of different sizes of infinity. So now there's the standard way, which I'm going to introduce, that you associate to a non-Archimedean ordered field the natural evaluation. We saw that on Monday in. The natural valuation, we saw that on Monday in Mikhail Madosynski's talk, and that valuation gives you kind of the Archimedean equivalence classes. Okay, and there you have a nice group structure. But what it is, in the end, is actually equivalence classes on the original structure. So for me, valuation theory is studying equivalence classes on an ordered non-Archimedean field. So that's what we're going to do today, and for that, I'm going to introduce several equivalence relations. Introduce several equivalence relations, which will all give us convex equivalence classes. So the setting is K is a non-Archimedean field and E is a G81 exponential on Kay Right. Okay, so the motivating question here is: when does K admit a transponential T compatible? With E. So, as I said earlier, it's not always for granted that a trans-exponential compatible with E exists. So, we will establish a criterion in the countable case. So, some notation, and I think this is what many people here are familiar with. So, if I have a non-zero element of k, then the natural valuation of a is just the Archimedes. Is just the Archimedean equivalence class. What is that? It's all elements from K, which, after multiplying it with a suitable N, dominate A in absolute value. So it's all those where there exists a natural number n, such that A is less than N times B in absolute value, and B is less than n times A in absolute value. Okay, so the value group, I mean, I'm just introducing this because there's the additive and the multi-negative community. I'm part of the additive communities. I'm sorry. No, no, no. Oh, it depends on how you see that. I think it's fine. I mean, B being zero never dominates A if A is chosen in A first. But for sanity, For sanity reasons, I could also have that. Okay, so G is just a collection of all Archimedean equivalence classes, non-zero elements. And D is what we call the natural valuation. So this is what we call natural valuation. And G is the value group. Actually, it's an ordered value group. Let me just write down the main features. So 0 is the valuation of 1. If you have two elements and you want to add them, it's just the valuation of the product. And the last thing is: what if you want to compare sizes? And this Want to compare sizes, and this is why I'm writing this down. If you want to compare sizes, in this case, it switches around. In the other case, if we do, it doesn't switch around. Okay, so V of A is less than V of B, if and only if V of A is not equal to V of B and A is not greater than B latitude. Okay, so that is the only time where the order switches around, but I'm going to also indicate that on later pictures. So in these pictures, I'm actually not going to talk about G, but rather on things that happen on K, which are related to G. So here's the first picture, which has the caption natural variation. Natural valuation. Okay, so what does the natural valuation do? The natural valuation looks at k and we are mainly interested on the positive part. So let me make this small. And what happens around zero is that here we have the infinitesimals. So these are the elements with positive valuation. Using zero, which will get the valuation infinity. I didn't say that. So zero gives me. Infinity. I didn't say that. So zero gets mapped to plus infinity. And we call this Iv maximal ideal of what evaluation ring, which I'm going to introduce, of infinitesimals. So what happens next? Then, to the right of it, we have somewhat bigger part of the line of k. And this line is part of the line, consists of. Consists of the elements with exactly zero valuations. So it's those which are in the valuation ring but not in the valuation ideal. In this picture, these are even the positive ones. So this here is like this. This is what I call OV, which kind of has a symmetric mirror image of its left boundary on the left-hand side in the negative. On the left-hand side in the negative points. Okay, and this is all just to actually also introduce some notation. So, this is what I call pk. PK are the positive infinitely large elements, and they have the property that their valuation is less than zero and they are positive. And that's the characterization of the positive infinitely large elements. Okay, let's track. Okay, let's track what the valuation does with elements in here. So let's choose an element A and equivalence classes that I'm going to introduce, they all work the same way. So I can multiply A with 2 to get 2A. And then I multiply them with 3 to get 3a. I can continue this game, but it will actually never leave the valuation ring. And this Evaluation ring. And this will then end up to be the valuation of A, the equivalence class. Like this. So this is just A, the Archimedean equivalence class of A. Okay, so of course in the other direction would just be A half, A quarters, and so on and so on. So what can happen? So, what can happen on Pk? On Pk, the following might happen. I take an element C and I apply the same thing. The function which just adds C to itself. And then it finishes somewhere. And what we get is that somewhere here, this is No? So this is V of C. And here on the infinite numbers, of course it can happen, that then something is to its right. Well, I say, of course, it can happen. I mean, in our case, it always does happen, that we have some D here, and D comes with its own equivalence class. So this is just V of D. V of D. Okay, so this is something that most people here are familiar with, but I just wanted to present this idea because this is what we're going to apply to other functions than the function that just maps C to itself. So we're going to apply the same concept to the function that always takes exponentials. We're going to apply it to a function on G, time permits, which is something called a contraction map. And we're going to apply it once more to the function which is even more basic than this one, that always adds plus one. This one, that always adds plus one. But it's always the same idea. This is what I would call valuation theoretic ideas to get hold of infinitely large elements. Okay, so that's how we can imagine the natural valuation. Now, for the second picture. Okay, second picture: the catching exponential. Okay, so the thing. Okay, so let's do the same trick again. There's this part which is less interesting, so I'll make it a bit smaller. This is OV. So what does the exponential do? And this is actually not that clear just from the axioms we get here. But let's look at this. So the exponential, for example, takes let's even start with something negative. Let's start with, just for fun, with minus epsilon. With just for fun, with minus epsilon, some infinitesimally small element which is negative. What does the exponential do? It takes it somewhere, where would it be? Slightly left to one. So it's infinitesimally close to zero, to its left, so it will get mapped to something infinitesimally close to one. So what happens here is now we actually have something which is not infinitesimal anymore. So this u of minus epsilon. So this is u of minus epsilon. What happens is it goes here, goes here, and so on, but it never least evaluates A. So that is something I would say, I could pose it as an exercise, but which is not straightforward if we just have the axioms, but this is satisfied. So this is here, and I actually do not use minus epsilon as representative for zero. This is something I would then call the E-equivalence class, exponential equivalence class, or whatever you would want to call it, of zero. So it's the convex set where when you have two elements and they dominate each other by some iterate, some finite iterate of the exponential function, then they are equivalent. We just write it down to have the definition on the board. So we write A is essentially equivalent to B, if and only if If and only if for some n it is the case that b is less than the n average of the exponential applied to a and the other way around. We're one direction of that of course always for free. Okay, so what happens on the interesting part? What happens on TK on the positive infinite ones? So what can happen there? So let's track the path of an element C. Of an element C. So the element C and the element D from the left picture, they had the property that C was very much smaller than D. Here we had C was less, less than D. So the valuation of C was bigger than the valuation of D. Okay, but what can happen in the exponential case is that we The yellow equivalence class again. C comes with its natural valuation equivalence class from the left, and D with its Archimedean equivalence class from the left. And now the exponential does the following. Takes C, takes it outside its Archimedean equivalence class, actually always does so. And its sub point lands away, or even above it. And this is the case where then suddenly. Case where then suddenly C and D have the same exponential equivalence class. But now, what can also happen, and that is the interesting stuff that I will also talk about, is that there's some element, C D sp F is down here. And no matter how hard D and E play together in the team, it's never reached. So now we have. So now we have here the exponential equivalence class of C and D, and there might be a bigger one to the right. So F, in this case, the equivalence class of F is much bigger than the equivalence class of C or D, for that matter. Okay, I'm not going to introduce the ordering, it really is just that. So the ordering I'm using here, everywhere is just the ordering inherited. Everywhere is just the ordering inherited from k. Okay, and this is pretty much it in this part of the talk. Let me just give it a name. So if you, I mean, this is the part which is uninteresting. So this part here is just one single element on the set of equivalence classes, exponential equivalence classes of K, which is just the first element. So we just take that out. We just look at PK, look at the equivalence classes, and this is called. Is called, so ordered by a relation less than inherited from k. This is the principal exponential rank. Okay, so the principal exponential rank is extremely difficult to understand, I would say, because I would say. Because we might have the case that here everything is actually just in one equivalence class. So no matter where we start, we can dominate everything else by an iterative of the exponential. It might be that we have exactly two, or three, or countably many. Or maybe, I mean, this is just an ordered set. Maybe it's a dense linear order without endpoints. That's the good case, by the way. Maybe, it is a dense linear order without an endpoint, then some like three discretely ordered elements in between. Like three discretely ordered elements in between, and then another dense linear order without endpoints to the right of it. And one of our main results in this section is that in the countable case, everything I just said can happen, and everything I just said actually always happens when you choose the right exponential. So the principal exponential rank is completely arbitrary in the countable case, as arbitrary as we can make it. Okay, so before I continue to that main result, and then to see how Main result, and then to see how many minutes more there are left to present the proof. Let's look at the trans exponential. This is what we're here for. For that, let's look at what the trans exponential does when we restrict ourselves, this is labeled transponential, when we restrict ourselves to PK, because the trans exponential will map from PK to PK. It's an order-preserving Order-preserving bijection. So let's start with an element A. Now, A plays around with the plus one function. And what we obtain here is A plus valuation. So A comes with its own copy of its valuation, of the valuation bring of K. And this is the equivalence class that we get when we apply the same principle by the plus one function. Plus one function. Okay, and now what has the trans-exponential? So a gets mapped to T of A. But A plus 1 gets mapped much further to E of G by the functional equation it has to satisfy. And we see where this is leading. Is this in fact This is in fact just the E jump. So what we obtain here is on top floor we have, okay, let's immediately consistent with the colours. This doesn't have a colour yet, so this is now the purple equivalence class. This whole thing gets mapped to an exponential equivalence class, which I think in my spontaneous color coding was three. And these And these are much bigger. So they swallow a lot of the equivalence classes we had before. Not only those purple ones, but also the yellow ones are much more swallowed inside here. So observe T of A plus OV is equal to the exponential equivalence class of T of A. Okay, so Of A. Okay, so what we have to make sure is that here, on this side, we do not run out of elements. So the trans-exponential can only exist if such a small equivalence class, A plus OV, by the way, not even 2A is contained in V. 2A is much bigger than A plus any natural number. So that this very small equivalence class gets a seat here in the principal exponential rank, which is quite a big seat. Which is quite mixed. And this is what our first main theorem says. So let me make some space. And then I have actually five minutes to talk about the main result. As I expected, I will not have much time to get into this group. Okay, so our proposition from our free print so far here is that is countable Then it admits a trans-exponential. I fixed it at the start of the section. So K is a fixed non-Archimedean field. So, K is a fixed non-Archimedean field, and E is a fixed GAT1 exponential. It comes with K. It comes with K, yes. So, K is countable, comes with an GAT1 exponential, and it's non-like input. Then it emits a trans-exponential T, compatible with E. If an only F. Its principle, exponential rank, is a density. Its principal exponential rank is a dense linear order without endpoints. Take the time to actually spell it out. And once you realize that this is the case, it's actually kind of straightforward to construct a trans-exponential. There's a lot of work to do with it. Do with it to construct it. But the main ingredient really is to do a back-and-forth method and realizing that, as I said it earlier, for all elements in here, so actually also the equivalence class or the set potentiated by this equivalence class will be denselinear order, and then actually it's enough to do this correspondence. So there is some work to do, but that is the main principle. Okay, and now we have a criterion for the existence of a trans-exponential compatible with E. Of a trans-exponential compatible with E, we just need to make sure, in the countable case, that this here is a dense linear order without n. Okay. So, my last section where I at least want to state the main result and then maybe same words, a bit about the proof, or unless somebody wants to ask about two steps, and then I can actually present them. So the theorem. So the theorem, our main theorem in our last section, is the following. And I have to point one more thing out. I adjusted it. I made it weaker for this presentation. So the theorem actually tells you more. More about, again, the residue field, which I did not introduce yet, and about the existence of an exponential E. But I just want to give the base version I can state here with everything I've introduced. Contributions. So let K E field E be accountable non-Archimedean G81 exponential field, meaning that the exponential satisfies G81. Okay. Then, it might be the case that K does not have a principal exponential rank allowing trans-exponentials, but let's replace the exponential. Then you get, for free, without any further conditions, there is one, there's a G81 exponential. E on k and there are nice exponentials T1, T2 on K compatible with now the one fixed E. With now the one fixed E, so I do not need different E's for these two trans exponentials, such that now the main result: K E with first trans exponential has the growth property, or T1 has the growth property, eventually dominates every iterative of E. And the second one, K E T two, does not Does not have the growth property. Okay, so since I'm running out of time, let me just very briefly explain how this is achieved. So the first thing to achieve is to find the exponential. And that actually is the difficult thing. Because the exponential needs to witness this. The exponential has to be in a way that has to be in a way that it gives to k a principal exponential rank that is a dense linear order without endpoints. So once we have this e, then there is a trans-exponential. And the second part, adjusting whether it has the growth property or not, that is quite technical, but it is just a back and forth method. Because in order to have the growth property, let me use my last available colour to so what do we have? So what do we have to find here? We have to find a trans exponential which has this property. So looking at the principal exponential rank, T of A must be bigger than A, because in that case, we already have, I mean, we know that then this is satisfied. And that is what we need for the growth property on the infinite large. For the growth property on the infinitely large numbers. Okay, so once we find T of A which satisfies this, and this is, again, as I said, a back and forth method, then it has a growth property, and also the opposite, we can also use a back and forth method so that the other inequality is satisfied. So there we just play around. It's countable, dense, linear orders, which is all good. That's where it's going. Thank you very much. So at the end, do we have questions? Wasn't your structure on the rank? Yes, thanks that you're asking. Okay. So this would have been the next thing I would have talked about. With rank, do you probably exponential rank. Oh, sorry, the induced structure on the principle of exponential rank. Oh, induced structure. Or induced structure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of what? Is it just an order, or does it probably with any? I see. It's just an order. It comes with nothing else. So it all is very clean order theory. No, I think the question is whether the trans-exponential principle exponential. Right, okay. If that's the question, then I can actually answer it the way I wanted to. So um there's the auxiliary map, the construction map which I have not introduced. Map which I have not introduced, but I'm glad that I can do it now. So the contraction map is the induced map on the value group. What does it do? It takes the valuation of an element from K and maps it to V of e to the minus 1, the logarithm of A, where A should be positive element. Okay, and positive and Okay, and positive and therefore also infinitely large. And this map induced, I mean, this is a map, a constraction map on G. What is a contraction map? It's a monotonically increasing map which maps two elements with the same valuation on G. Careful. The same valuation in the group sense, so groups also come with valuations to the same element. And in this particular case, it's something we call centripetal, which means that every element gets mapped to some. Which means that every element gets mapped to something which is bigger than g less than zero. So I'll not go into detail with that, but this gives you a new equivalence class. Okay, so g less than zero, together with the equivalence class where we look at g somewhere here's the zero, and what does chi do? It takes an element g and maps it again. An element G, it maps it again like this, and this is just G under this equivalence relation. And it turns out, and I mean, this is not a full answer to your question, but this is isomorphic as an order structure to the principal exponential rank. Okay, so the equivalence classes we obtain here mimic exactly the equivalence classes we have here, which is due to the fact that whenever I get collapsed upstairs on k by Collapse upstairs on k by the E function will lead to some collapse down there on the value group. And now your question was: what kind of structure does it induce on here? And I would like to answer the question by what kind of structure does it induce on here? Because there's more natural to deal with. And the answer is another collapse. So I mean we here, another collapse. So we now even have here, maybe we can draw it like. Maybe you can draw it like this. So, this is what the zero is. And now this consists of, so this here would be a single element. So, this is what I drew here. And what the trans-exponential does is collapsing many of these sets, and you can somehow get hold of that, but I think this would be going too much into detail. What we would have is that the trans-exponential induces a map on G such that two of these previous equivalence classes then become one again. Classes then become one again. So it's the same game that happened before. We have a much faster growing map. We apply the same idea of the equivalence relation by reaching one element by iteratively applying a map to another. And then many equivalence classes become one equivalence class. And this is in a, we can do that in a structured manner. But this is not, I mean, we can't say more because what else, what structure is there? We have here just a linearly ordered set. What further structure can you induce on a linearly ordered set? On a linearly ordered set. We just induce another equivalence relation, which makes the set even smaller, which collapses more convex intervals, more convex subsets, just to a point. So the derivative of the trans-exponential function. But taking the derivative is how you witness that it's not, the models are not on the model. Yes. And Chris mentioned in his And Chris mentioned in his talk that there's, if you're trying to do some kind of funning argument or a back and forth argument, it's difficult with a kind of exponential function. My experience with Vincent, this is the difficulty is understanding the yes, how to use the so is there any can you say anything about the derivatives with the the valuation theory you've developed? The valuation theory you developed? So, um, the derivatives on the infinitely large part in our theory are completely arbitrary. So, uh, actually, we even have an example, I think, of a trans-exponential function which is differentiable nowhere on the positive line. I'm not 100% sure about it, but we made it at least we can arbitrarily choose points where it's not differentiable. And I think maybe the big problem is we are not in a nice tape structure here. We are really just in an overall setting. Just in an overall setting in first-order theory, and we are non-Archimedean fields, and these classical arguments from real analysis do not apply. So, something like differentiability is very hard to get hold of in our framework. So, to answer your question briefly, I don't think there's a connection. I'd like just to make a comment. So, the fact that any linear order can be realized as the expression of the Can it be realized as the exponential rank? It's actually true in general, not just for the countable case. So, for any linear ordering, as crazy as it can look, like it could be the chain of rationals followed by some discrete points and an integral individual, can be realized as the principal exponential rank of an EN series that is. E n series that is a model of T sub N X that I want to describe. And the same, exactly the same construction and consideration apply to the notion that is called the principal difference rank. So when you consider optimal physics instead of exponentials, this was worked from the first one. And also the same applies to the notion called principle differential rank. So that's in the case that you consider. So that's in the case that you consider derivations, formal derivations on ELCUR. And that's the thesis of Gabrielle received. Yeah. Well, maybe to react to the first question, I really have to point out, we have something much stronger. I didn't write it down here. But what you just said is I give you an exponential rank, and you give me a field with that principal exponential rank. What we have here is we take a fixed, countable exponential field. Countable exponential field. And now we can equip it with another exponential that has the exponential rank that you gave me. So that's the big difference. We here have a fixed field, and there we can realize any possible countable exponential rank. And I guess that's the strengthening of that. So here, because, I mean, this is the beauty about the countable fields. We have these very basic, almost stupid methods where we construct something which just follows pure. Just follows purely from, I don't know, something called Brown's theorem, for example, some very basic valuation theory and back and forth methods. But still, in the countable case, yeah, this is strong enough. And the other comment is the back and forth methods here work because this is just by counter theorem. This is just the linear order of the rations. Are there questions for this? Um so I think we can both further questions for later. So let's go ahead and one.
