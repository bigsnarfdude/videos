This is a little stranger than a totally online conference. It seems like I can't see anybody in the audience, but then you can nap at your own on your own, you know. So I'd like to thank the organizers for putting up with me as being a co-organizer. So Sarah and Rasir did most of the heavy lifting, you know. So I looked and I only have 130. And I only have 131 emails about the conference. So it wasn't really me doing all of it. Before I get started, I want to acknowledge Greg Rompala's role in getting this meeting started. He organized a meeting in Oaxaca in 2019, or 1BC, you know, as we call it now. So, and we talked then about doing another meeting and About doing another meeting, and you know, it evolved into this. At some point, there was not enough room for him on the organizing committee, but that may be good news for him after all. So let's see. That's about all of the intro there. So let me get started. One of the reasons why I'm back in Durham is not just because it's a delightful place to be. It's a delightful place to be in the summertime since it's 100 degrees. But I'm doing this. It's called do math. You know, it's some sort of pun. D is for duke. O is for opportunities. And it also makes the word do. So it's a very deep concept here. So here's my team. There are five undergrads. There are five undergrads, three males and three women and two men. June is actually, his pronouns are he, him. So, and Ray is there. So Ray can answer all your questions about this talk, you know. So, and that's me. All right. So, let's see. Let's see. So, so I'm going to show some pictures first. Feel free to shout out in the middle of it because I have 23 slides, which probably is going to mean 23 minutes. So what the heck is fun can get done early and then you can go to lunch and hang out in the afternoon, you know. So this is what's happened in South Africa. It's something that we can look to South Africa and see what's We can look to South Africa and see what's going to happen a few months later in the US. I like this graph because it shows how the frequencies happen over time. So we have, we start with the other wave, and then we have beta. So beta arose and it came down to a little small fraction. And then delta came up. And this is a slide. This is a slide from sort of like February, so only Omicron is starting to spike at that point. So, um, and this shows how the frequencies happen. And what I'm going to be talking about is how this competitive exclusion happens as the models go on. So, if you look at beta, it was a small fraction, it came up and it spiked, and then And then along came Delta, and beta sort of hung around for a while, but eventually it was mostly Delta. And I don't know about you, but I certainly remember the Delta wave pretty well. So here's another picture. This is the United States with the waves labeled. I'm not sure what this little hiccup is here. I mean, it's also there in South Africa. Also, there in the South Africa data, you know, it seems to be about the time that school started, or, you know, maybe this is some data anomaly or something like that. So we have, and Sarah mentioned the things in her talk, beta, delta, omicron, and now we have BA4 and five. And again, sort of the slides as they move on, they get more and more sort of frequent, you know, so more and more recent. So, more and more recent. So, this is sort of May, BA4 and 5 are moving up. So, here's another picture from South Africa. So, it's normalized. So, things are percentages of the beta wave. And one of the things you see here, which is a happy story, is that the emissions The emissions. The cases still go up pretty high, but the number of people going to the hospital and the number of people dying are going down. So this is something that, well, I'll talk about later. It sort of happened due to the way the virus evolved. All right. So, and then my last thing, this is. This is um this is a slide from Monday. This is, don't ask me why we were interested in New Jersey. We've been trying to do some spatial analysis. So it's sort of interesting that New Jersey, you know, this is like beta and delta in New Jersey. You know, it's like maybe the virus was afraid to go to New Jersey. I don't know. Afraid to go to New Jersey. I don't know, but they had a pretty good Omicron spike. And the thing I want to point to is that BA4 and 5 is, you know, pretty much a done deal at this point, you know, so, which is good. I mean, when these new variants came out, then there was worry it's going to, we're going to have another big spike, you know? So, all right. So, all right, so let me start by telling you what the take-home message is from the talk. So, it's a very, very simple story. I mean, when early in the pandemic, I wondered why does one variant competitively exclude the others? Because it seems like there are, you know, all these unvaccinated people out there. People out there, you know, so why do they sort of come head to head? But what I'm going to do is calculus. I mean, so I write down the differential equation for, you know, different variants in an SIR model. Okay, so at this point, I should, you know, admit that, yeah, just because there are undergraduates involved, we're just looking at SIR even. At SIR, even though SEIR is probably better. So I take the SIR model, I change variables and do some calculus. It took me like two months to think about this. And I find that the fraction of buyers two follows a logistic differential equation. So this is used to model selective sweeps. On a slide, Sweeps. On a slide later on, I'll tell you what lambda of t is. And while arguing in the class, is that in the class in the talk is that data shows that this correctly predicts the rapid turnover from one dominant variant to another? So what's the biological message? Evolution seems to have worked in our favor. The virus has evolved to be more transmissible, which means that. Which means that it's adapted to replicate faster in the nasal passages rather than in the lungs, all right? Which is good for us because if it doesn't replicate fast in the lungs, then it's not going to kill you as well. So our analysis and expert opinion suggests that new variants that are successful will be the ones that can evade immunity from infection by previous strains. Infection by previous strains. Okay, so all right, so let's say I'm going to skip beta and all the stuff that happened at the beginning. So there's delta. And this is called B.1.617.2. So this notation comes from phylogenetic relationship of samples. Of samples. It was, Sarah mentioned this, it was identified in India late 2020. It has additional mutations that increase the ability of the spike protein to infect cells. I'll show you a picture of that later. Yeah, Delta was believed to be more than twice as contagious as previous variants and more likely put you in the hospital. And I'll continue to read the slides, although you can probably read them yourself. Slides, although you can probably read them yourself. It swept rapidly through the country and Great Britain before coming to the U.S., where it quickly surged and became the predominant SARS variant. And it was a real nightmare because the hospitals and emergency rooms filled up, you know, intensive care filled up with patients. So we don't want to go back there again. All right, so Matt. All right, so math. Let's have the math here. I'm going to take a two-strain SIR model and write it in terms of scale variables so that I get rid of the population size. I'm sorry to explain this to an audience of experts, but anyway, so I get this thing. They have two strains that are infecting individuals. Individuals. And of course, once you're infected, you end up at either I1 or I2. There's no point in writing down R because S plus I1 plus I2 is R. So I have these things. To begin with, I assume, I allow the possibility the infection rates are different, but to get a formula, I'm going to assume they're the same. You know, maybe this is reasonable, maybe it's not, but you know, anyway. And so, if I look at the fraction of things that are strained two, I get this logistic where the lambda is the difference in the two betas times the number of susceptibles. So, if you ignore the fact that S is not a constant, this is a logistic differential equation. To just take differential equations. All right, so this is what the data looks like. So, good thing about having undergraduates is they know how to use software, you know. So, blue is a fraction of things that are delta. Let's see, alpha or whatever is not on the picture. So, these things don't add up to one. So, it goes up, sort of levels off. Long comes. Off, long comes Omicron, and then things add up to one. And then green is the later strains of Omicron. All right, so, and if you fit the logistic, I don't want to, you know, so maybe this is not the best fit in the world, but we put two. We put two points here and draw the line through it. Well, it's not beautiful, but how much can you miss when you're comparing two monotone functions here? And it tells me lambda is 0.0745, which is an idea about the difference between beta 2 and beta 1. All right. So let me move on to Omicron. This is reminding me of teaching during the pandemic. Here I am sitting in my office at home talking to myself, you know, so, but anyway. So this is an early picture from Science Magazine. So here's Omicron. And it looked like they go, wow, if you look for at least last column. At least last common, most recent common ancestor with, you know, the green guys are Delta and the blues are like beta and alpha and I have no idea what the, oh, okay. These other guys, the great guys are previous coronaviruses. It's like, wow, this goes back to the beginning of the pandemic. So, where was this guy? So, where was this guy? He was hanging out in South Africa somewhere. Or maybe we just don't have all the strains on here. This is a really nice paper about the spread of COVID. Kachi Cole was at Duke until Georgia Tech made her an offer she couldn't refuse. So here's a picture of the Of the phylogeny. So, okay, so working backwards, at the bottom is Omicron. And this is a little guy gamma, which never really made it into the Greek letter hip parade. But when you add it to the phylogeny, you see that Omicron is close relative to gamma. And then we have our friends beta and Friends beta and delta. And up here, you have the original sort of Wuhan strain had whatever amino acid D is at position 614. And then one of the early improvements in the spike protein was that it was replaced by whatever the amino acid that has G in it. Amino acid that has G in it, and it became more infective. You know, so all right. So more calculus is more or less the same calculus, but from Delta to Omicron, we had breakthrough infections. So people that were had had Delta or even had been vaccinated. Had been vaccinated, could get Omicron, which made the spike a lot bigger. So we've added to this a variable RCB-1, which are people who are immune to Delta due to previous infection or vaccination. And they can be infected by Omicron. So change of variables works the same. And I now have a Lambda. And I now have a lambda, which is the improvement in infectivity times the number of susceptibles plus this fraction of breakthrough infections. So when we fit the curve, and I'll do it in a second, the lambda has gotten a lot bigger, presumably due to the presence of this term. And here's proportional. And here's proportion on Omicron. Again, you know, you can tell I'm not a professional statistician, but, you know, I blame it on the undergrads here. So it, you know, it sort of fits the logistic and we get this 0.1798. So if the things were exactly logistic, then why Logistic, then when I look at log of x of t over 1 minus x of t, that would be linear. And if I do this for the beta to delta and delta to omicron things, it's a little curved, all right? Well, that's not so crazy. We have, we're getting a reduction in S of T and potentially there's spatial structure that's keeping. Structure that's keeping the thing from going to fixation, right? And this little green thing is a thing that I didn't show. This is fitting the logistic to the beginning of Omicron 4.5. All right, so let's have a little, you know, I guess they didn't really track the Delta variants that much, but Omicron variants we have sort of at the wazoo. We have sort of out the wazoo. You know, they made this nice Greek letter thing and then it just totally broke down. So the first two things actually diverged genealogically before they emerged in South Africa in October 2021. And BA2 spreads a little bit more quickly than BA1, but if you have antibodies against BA1, BA1, then it still products against BA2. And then there's BA1.1, which sounds like not much of a change, but it has a mutation in the spike protein that makes it more effective. B1.1.529, it started in Botswana in November 2021. November 2021. And this was labeled as a variant of concern because it has 30 mutations in the spike protein, and 15 of which are in the receptor binding domain. Now, this has always mystified me a little bit. I mean, I remember the cartoon book of genetics where I learned my genetics. It says, if you don't believe that most mutations are deleterious, Mutations are deleterious. Try making random changes in your toaster. So here, 30 mutations. It's not necessarily making everything better, but maybe it's involved in immunovasion. And then there's another BA 2.12.1. You know, so mutations in the spike protein help you. Help you break into cells or help the virus break into cells. So here's a picture of so COVID binds to a surface protein called ACE2. So here we have an omicron binding to the surface protein. And I guess you And I guess you never knew that proteins are actually made out of modeling clay, you know. So, and when I got this picture, you know, it's my talk's all about pictures stolen from the internet. This is BNT 162B1. But, you know, this thing, as we all know, is a lipid nanoparticle formulated nucleoside modified RNA vaccine. RNA vaccine that encodes a perfusion stabilized anchored SARS-CoV-2. That's something you made in vaccine. So this guy, which I naively think of as an Omicron thing, is binding to ACE2. And these mutations tell you, show you where the ones that are sort of increasing the binding are happening. All right, so what happened with the strains? You know, so originally there was BA1, but BA 1.1 is a little bit more effective. So it wiped the thing out. Here we had the variant of concern, BA1.1.529, but it's losing out. Along came BA2 and it's losing out to It's losing out to be a 2.12.1. All right. So there is three strain calculus. And my calculus skills are really pathetic. It took me two or three tries to do this. So I don't really get logistic because there are three species, but I get this sort of competition thing. This is something. Thing. This is something we haven't really done anything with, perhaps because we don't really know how to fit the three species composition thing. But anyway, so it's there. If you want to fit this model, go ahead. We live in North Carolina, so like to look at North Carolina data, you know, so. Data, you know, so blue is delta. So, actually, where we live, where I live, uh, B11529 came first, and then BA 1.1 came afterward. And we're just sort of getting a little taste of BA2 at this point. So, this is up through the end of April. All right, so. All right, so lately we're dealing with BA4 and 5. They were started to merge in March 2022. And this goes to the evolution thing. All right, so the Wuhan strain, you know, may start in the nose, but it settles in the lung. But these things replicate fast. Replicate faster in the nasal cavities, so they're more infectious. And the good news is they can't optimize everything, so they're giving up a little bit on how fast they kill you, which works for me, you know. So these two guys had the same mutations in the spike protein, you know, which is about all that matters. And they've been shown a remarkable ability. Shown a remarkable ability to evade immunity from vaccines, which is not a thing I'm happy about, or previous infection. And I saw an article that if you're thinking about using monoclonal antibody treatments that are based on a previous strain, you should forget about that. I think generally you should probably forget about. Should probably forget about monoclonal antibodies unless you're living in Florida where you can't do anything else. But all right, so what's happening in the future? One of my messages here is that immune escape will be important for success. So, okay, I have this equation and even I'm a little hesitant at making this interpretation based on this. This interpretation based on this. So I have the difference of the two betas in one term and the sort of breakthrough infections here. But okay. So let's see what people who know what they're talking about say. So Delta made a significant improvement in its ability to infect human cells. But I mean, there's not an unlimited amount of improvement. Amount of improvement in your infectivity. So eventually it's going to pretty much optimize how to bind with ACE2 and infect cells. So I'm quoting this woman who I never met, but anyway, as gains and infectivity start to slow, the virus will have to maintain its fitness by overcoming immunity. And another quote, very Another quote: variants, this is Omicron that gain much of their transmission advantage from a mating immune response may become the norm. So it may be that we have start seeing immune evasion as we do in influenza. But we tried to think a little bit about immunovasion and influenza and do math project, and we realized we didn't. Project, and we realized we didn't know enough biology to do that. So, here's a small number of references. The slides are on the webpage somewhere. So, the first one is a really great article by, you know, it's a night, and it's your staff member, however you spell member, you know, so, and it's only four pages, but you know, it's probably spin about four. I probably spent about four hours reading this. This Caitlin Gendalina's blog, you know, is, I guess, this is how you get tenure from your assistant professor. She has a great thing about COVID variants, and she's gotten involved in the sort of, let's see, treating gun. Treating gun violence as a disease in the same way that, or a public health problem, in the same way that we got people to wear seatbelts and stop smoking, you know. So this is Cacha Cole. It's in science. It's a good survey, but in the world of COVID, you know, something that was written in March is, you know. You know, it's sort of ancient history. And now, if you want to learn about the biology, this is a great paper. It's an 18-page summary of 300 papers. So, like I said, good luck reading this. All right. So, I'm going to stop the share and see if anybody is actually there. I mean, I can't. There. I mean, I can't. It's bizarre. I can't hear anybody laughing at my jokes, but maybe nobody was laughing at the jokes. So, anyway.
