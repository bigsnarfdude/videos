So, I think the people gathered at this meeting know many of Bill's influential works, starting with the Castleman-Scheleker formula, which is used as bread and butter by people working in periodic groups and real groups alike. And there are many other celebrated results of Bo, which I Results of Bo, which I hope others might mention. But let me mention some papers of his that may be less known, but which have impacted me greatly. One of his papers is from 1975. It was kind of a, I think, a follow-up conference to Castle's Froelich, which was very influential in terms of people learning what the subject, what class field theory is about, and what Langlands sort of early on in the game. Sort of early on in the game. And Bill has a beautiful paper about just called GLN. And in it, he's got, and for me as a student, this was enlightening. I live around mass forms. And he explains the importance of the eigenvalue, one quarter in terms of Arten's conjectures, just in the up half plane in great detail, and explains how inevitably half of the Half of the Delaware representations are going to be problematic. They're not going to be transcendental, which is the title of my talk. They're going to be algebraic, but he gives a very lucid explanation. And maybe I think things weren't clear about this point before. In fact, according to Langlands, in one of my many discussions with him, I don't think Andre Vey, when he Andrei Wey, when he wrote his influential paper in 68 on the converse theorem, first appreciated that it applied. I mean, he certainly addressed elliptic curves, but I don't think he appreciated it applied to finite Art and Galway representations. I think maybe Langdon's pointed that out to him. Anyway, so that's what these eigenvalue one-quarter is about. I'll return to it at the end. Another paper of Another paper of Bill's that I'm a great fan of is a paper in which he was often challenging people like me to prove his conjectures about Eisenstein series, tricky questions about growths and location of poles. Of course, the location of the poles for Eisenstein series is intly connected with the Riemann hypothesis, if you ask a hard enough question. And the Eisenstein series are, for many of us, the be-all and end-all of everything. Be all and end all of everything. We saw that from Bernstein this morning, a beautiful and completely general Meromorphic continuation without using L2 theory. But Bell is like an older cousin to me because the Eisenstein series have always been where I started. And for him, the analytic continuation of Eisenstein series is not a black box. There are many people who are just using it as a black box. Langland suffered through it, and then it's handed to them as a black box. Like Box. But for him and for me, and for Bernstein and for some others, actually, why does that work is very important? Because, after all, it does give the analytic continuation of L functions who we don't know how to do any other way. So it's a very deep theory. It's fundamental. And I share that with Bill. By the way, Bill, you haven't said a word so far, which is very unusual. Maybe he's behaving because it's his birthday. I don't know. By the way, does anybody hear me? I hear nothing back. Please interrupt. We do hear you, Peter. Yeah, I don't read the chat. So let me. So, Tasha, please, if somebody has something in chat, just interrupt me. I interrupt everybody, so I'm willing to take my own medicine. Sure, I will. All right. There's another part of Bill that always impressed me was that he was the editor, the figures. Editor, the figures editor for the cover of the notices for many years. I don't know if he still is, but the quality of the notices cover changed dramatically because not only would he make illustrative covers insightful and explaining what the subject's about, but he would really get into each cover and understand what the mathematics behind it was all about. And here's one about expanders. I wrote three lines maybe about what is an expander. Maybe about what is an expander. And he said, and I guess they decided to put some examples on the cover. These are examples of the biggest planar Romanojan graph, cubic Romanojan graph that we know. It's got 84 vertices. Actually, we found it in a book on full arenes. And in this article of mine called What is an Expander? There's a relation between the expander and what's called the Chigas constant, which is why they're so interesting. Chiger's constant, which is why they so interested, interesting. And he said, Well, what is the Chiger constant for this graph? And of course, that's very difficult to compute. So I kind of waffled a bit, claiming I could determine it as a specific number, as you'll see in a second. But he's a prickly kind of guy, and he eventually decided he would prove it himself. So he actually solved the problem. Here's the page 815 of that. Page 815 of that notices, in which you can see in preparing these diagrams for Sarnak's article on the issue of Romanojan Groves, we decided would be an interesting exercise. So, basically, after listening to me talking about what I thought the answer was, he actually proved it. I actually, he caught me of not really knowing how to prove it. And I think probably many people have experienced this with Bill. Anyway, he's a little prickly, but always you learn a lot from him. Lot from him and a delight. Okay, and I don't know if he's still the editor, I doubt it, but the notices, I think it was transformational for the notices to have someone like him do that kind of job. All right, so we are celebrating his 80th, if I understand correctly, with this conference. And this conference is about beyond endoscopy. And I have very little to add to beyond endoscopy. Add to beyond endoscopy. In fact, the part that I will talk about that's new here, which is the middle of this talk, will all be about one dimension. And finally, I have a toy problem where we can study these things, as you will see. But let me say what it is I'm trying to understand here. It's something we're all trying to understand. It's also something that Langlands has most recently, maybe in the last three or four years, he kept on asking about the question. Asking about the question, Arthur can verify this. He was asking both of us, for example, about the question: what about these transcendental objects, which to me are so important? Are they really transcendental? That's what I want to address. And these are very difficult questions. Okay, so the setting is, of course, we have a real semi-simple group. In the end, of course, it should be an Adele group. Gamma is an arithmetic group, even a congruent subgroup. In Joseph, Group. In Joseph's talk, I want to emphasize something. I don't know, I'm going to just because this morning I was inspired by the talk. The analytic continuation of Eisenstein series makes no use of arithmetic. The only use of arithmetic was to understand the nature of the parabolic subgroups, which are things that are understood without arithmetic assumptions. And there's no idyllic gain from that. It's really that the principle that he gave, or any other principle which is spectral, is something. Spectral is something fundamentally new in analytic continuation. But in this talk, I'm interested in algebraic and transcendental part. It's certainly about congruent subgroups and completely the arithmetic setting. All right, I want to talk about a symmetric space, a globally symmetric space. So k is the stabilizer of a Cartanian volution that defines a globally symmetric space, G mod K, if G is semi-simple. And these globally symmetric spaces Globally symmetric spaces, we are interested in their quotients. I'm just reviewing quickly what an arithmetic manifold is, of which I'm trying to understand the spectrum. So that's S over gamma, or G mod K mod gamma. And we're interested in the spectrum, the L2 spectrum. The point that Joseph was highlighting was that his analytic continuation of Eisenstein series never makes use of any Hilbert space. But of course, any trace formula, any theory of automorphism. Any theory of automorphic forms absolutely does. So we need the full spectral decomposition. And for this talk, you can even assume that this is compact. All my locally my symmetric spaces of this type. That, of course, eliminates many of the most interesting ones. And I will actually return to that, but that's not so much an issue. And as we all know from the theory, that you don't study really the spectrum of the ring of different. The spectrum of the ring of differential operators in the Cartan symmetric space, but rather it's better to look at the homogeneous space G mod gamma and not divide by k and then study the full spectral right regular decomposition of g on g mod gamma. And these are what we're interested in, what everybody, I think, in this beyond the endoscopy are interested in is one side of the story. And I want there to be. And I want there to be discrete spectrum because I want to talk about numbers and whether they're transcendental or not. And I want to talk about whether these numbers are transcendental or algebraic. All right, so that's the set. Now, the simplest case of everything that we talk about, and is often explained when one is explaining the trace formula, is just the circle. That's not semi-simple, but it's still the simplest case. The abelian case is. Still, the simplest case. The abelian cases we all know are much fundamental and much more, much easier to write down everything explicitly. But let me review it for a second because I'm going to return to a sort of decoration of this that's really involved. So I'll start with a circle, which is R mod Z. So that's a Riemannian manifold of one dimension, compact. There's only one parameter to describe it, its length. And we look And we look at the differential operator. This is homogeneous, the differential operator. The ring here is generated by this is the only interesting differential operator which commutes. And it's d2 by dx squared. And for the spectrum, if we're going to talk about algebraic or transcendental, it's usual to choose the right coordinates. And since when I start talking about transcendental, it won't make so much difference. But if I want to talk about what number field you lie in, then it becomes more subtle. And then it becomes a more subtle issue, and that's an issue which I'm not going to address much here, which has been addressed by people in locally symmetric spaces, of course. So the spectrum is we're solving for the eigenvalues, but we take the square roots of the eigenvalues. It's a more natural parameter. And in general, there are natural parameters associated with the group. All right. So you can write the eigenfunctions, a e to the two pi. can write the eigenfunctions a e to the 2π i mx over l, and the eigenvalues are 2π, the square roots of the eigenvalues are 2π m over l. That's an exact arithmetic progression with multiplicity 2. And just for fun, because this will come back, if the length of the circle is an algebraic number, then since pi is transcendental, that's a very deep theorem, then the spectrum is actually each of the non-zero eigenvalues is already transcendental. Eigenvalues is already transcendental. However, you only have to add pi here. So the transcendence degree of the spectrum, and I'm going to look at the entire spectrum, is one. So this is not seriously transcendental. If I just have to include one transcendental number, I'm not going to view that as transcendental in any serious way. All right. Now, the Selberg trace formula in this case is just the Poisson summation formula. It's a quite striking formula. It's a quite striking formula from the point of view of harmonic analysis. It says that the sum of delta masses at the integers, because that's what the spectrum is here, its Fourier transform, hat is a Fourier transform. To get round the silly pi, you always define the Fourier transform with a 2 pi in it, otherwise you'd have 2 pi's messing everything up. And then the Fourier transform of a sum of point masses at the spectrum is remarkably a sum of point masses of the same type. Of the same type. In general, when I write the sum of the spectrum of a locally symmetric space and use this Selberg trace formula, say it's rank one, on the right-hand side, we get something which is trying to be discrete, but it's also got a Plancherel term. And so it doesn't look like a sum of point masses, there's a sum of point masses. This is special to this abelian situation. But that's the simplest case, and I will return to it for a reason. I have it there, and I'll. Reason I have it there, and I'll return to it later. All right, so if that's the end of one dimension, there's only one smooth one-dimensional Riemannian manifold up to its length. Let's go to dimension two. So you could take a sphere. Now, it's a remarkable fact that the round sphere can be analyzed for its spectrum, meaning the spectrum is given by spherical harmonics. It's still algebraic. It's a remarkable fact. The eigenvalues just you take. Is just you take harmonic polynomials, restrict them to the sphere, use Euler, and you get up to pi's and the length, the radius of the sphere, you would get that the spectrum is algebraic. And of course, by representation theory, its multiplicity of each eigenvalue is 2j plus 1, and the eigenvalues are nice and algebraic. J into j plus 1, they're actually integers. If you take the square roots, Integers, if you take the square roots of the eigenvalues, you would be using a little bit of the wrong parameter, and you would anyway observe the algebraic. It's a remarkable fact, you know, that the product of two eigenfunctions on the sphere is an eigenfunction. That's something very general in the sense that it's true for any, oh dear, what happened there? This happens resume share. Resume share. Did I disappear? No, you were always here. Yeah, there's something called crowd strike. I don't know what the hell that is. That's something at my computer. There's somebody that comes and crowd strikes every now and then. And I then have to get rid of that crowd strike. Somebody must show me how to get rid of that. So it only happened to me, but I'm back. Okay. So more generally, any compact globally, any compact, I emphasize compact globally. I emphasize compact, globally symmetric space. The spectrum can be computed and is algebraic. And this, of course, follows from the Weyl character formula, one of the great precursors to what we are all trying to do here. So if G is a compact, semi-simple real group, one of the classical groups, for example, you can write down the characters, the irreducible representations, they're all finite dimensional. Because they're finite dimensional, you can write things down in the right coordinates and they'll be okay. Down in the right coordinates, and they'll be algebraic. So, it's a remarkable fact, and it's a great generalization of the theory of spherical harmonics, in my view. So, if the group, if the symmetric space is compact, there's not much more to say. And in fact, all you would do there is you might think it's boring. But in fact, of course, if we work idyllically, which I'll have a comment about in a second, then there is something very interesting there. Of course, if G is not come back, and we saw in the If G is not come back, and we saw in DeLorme's lecture when you have various other quotients of G, but not by a discrete group. The discrete group is where the number theory comes in. So if you look at L2G, or L2 of the non-compact globally symmetric space, then of course for the symmetric space, it's not difficult to show there are no discrete eigenvalues. And there's continuous spectrum, so there's no issue of talking about algebraic or transcendental, as far as I can see. As far as I can see. But at the level of the group, one of the greatest discoveries in the subject are Harishandra's discrete series. There can be square integrable eigenfunctions. He describes them. They are, in my terminology, algebraic. I'm being a bit loose with the term. He gives a complete description of when this happens through his character theory and the asymptotics of matrix coefficients. I should say Langlands often pays Langlands often pays tribute to Harishandra. Most recently, when he won the Abul Prize and gave a speech at the Institute, his speech was all about Harishandra, not about anything else. So he pays big tribute to how much his work depends on Harishandra's even formulation. All right, so Harishandra's discrete series would be an algebraic part of G, but the issue is if G is not compact, Issue is if G is not compact. So if the group, if the real group is compact, then it might seem that everything is algebraic. And in fact, it is, even if we are interested in the Adele group. So if G is defined over a number field, maybe over Q, and I look at G A, then we're not only interested in the spectrum at the real place, that is G R, and so if G R is compact, then the representations are all algebraic by Hermann Weil. By Hermann Weil. But if G is defined of a number field like Q and G R is compact, then because on the real place all the irreducibles are finite dimensional, after you decompose, the other operators, by strong approximation, the HECA operators will act on these finite dimensional spaces by convolution operators. And so either by actually using the elements and using these. Using the elements and using these convolution operators in the finite dimensionality, or you can use the trace formula. You find that if at the real place the group G is compact, then the idyllic theory of the other operators is nice and algebraic in this loose sense that I'm talking about. So it's really only when G, the real group or the Archimedean places is non-compact, Gr over gamma is compact or finite. Gamma is compact, or finite volume, anyway, but it's only when the real place is non-compact that the issue arises. So the transcendent, and it's only from the Archimedean place. So the transcendence of the automorphic spectrum is entirely tied to the Archimedean place. So if you don't like Archimedean places, there's nowhere to hide. This is what makes the real group and all the problems that we stuck at with Ramanujan and the transcendental part. Manajan and the transcendental part difficult. It's because there is a real place, and it's when that real place is, the group is non-compact, we really are out of the realms of any obvious algebra. All right, so I think this is just summarizing what you know. And now I want to spend the middle part of this talk, which is the most part of this talk, to something that might be new to most of you. And it turns out that there is, in one dimension, something that you One dimension, something that you can still do. So, once you go to two dimensions, you look at the upper half plane divided by SL2Z, which I'll return to. It's got all the difficulties in the world. We can make questions there. We ask questions. But there is one thing that I was not aware of until a few years ago, and that there is a one-dimensional situation that's very similar to what we're studying. It's one-dimensional, so we have much more chance of saying something wrong. We have much more chance of saying something non-trivial or something complete, let me say that way. And that is the only compact real Riemannian manifold is a circle. But what happens if we allow singularities? And after all, we allow cusps, we allow orbifold singularities, so we should allow singularities in one dimension. So if I want to make a manifold out of pieces of homogeneous manifolds in one dimension, this means finite number of intervals of length L1 up to L. Of intervals of length L1 up to Ln. So I'm going to make now what is known as a metric graph. I'll review where this comes from in a second. So I have L1 up to Ln. They are glued at vertices V1 up to Vn. Vm. They are M vertices, N edges. And this is actually drawn incorrectly. Maybe it's a good idea that I do it incorrectly. I don't want there to be a vertex of degree two. So this vertex, I should. So, this vertex I should not have allowed. I should have maybe put another edge here in this example, because the vertex of degree two, from the point of view that I'm going to study here, is I'm going to resolve the singularities at the vertices. And if there's a vertex of degree two, that singularity really doesn't exist. So I'll be assuming throughout that you don't have degree two vertices. So that imagine there's a edge going from there to there as well. So it's a finite arrangement like this. A finite arrangement like this, and you should think of a finite number of vibrating strings or guitar strings that you're trying to understand the spectrum of. But notice because of the singularities, this can be quite complicated. For example, as a topological space, the fundamental group of this metric graph X that I've drawn for you here is already highly non-abelian. It's a free group on the number of edges minus the number of vertices plus one. Um, vertices plus one. So it's got the complexity already of what you might have on a Riemann surface in terms of the fundamental group. All right, so how do we make a Laplacian here? So we are going to have the Laplacian on the on where you're not singular is just going to be the only thing it can be. It's the d2 body x squared. So on the edges, the operators d2 body x squared, but I have to tell you how I'm going to make the conditions at the vertices. Conditions at the vertices. And the condition we'll choose is the free or Neumann boundary conditions. You could put other conditions here, but not any. So I'll look at all functions from this metric graph into the complex numbers. Phi is continuous at each vertex. I'll assume that the functions, of course, are going to satisfy d2 by dx squared applied to phi is lambda times phi plus lambda times phi equals zero. So that will mean that in on So, that'll mean that on the inside the edges, it's really sines and cosines. So, it's nice and smooth. And at the vertices, I'm working out how I can possibly glue them. So I'll assume that phi actually is continuous at each vertex, and that I can look at the Neumann boundary condition, which is that if I sum over all directed edges which end at any vertex of the directional derivative of phi, which makes sense along the edge coming in. sense along the edge coming in. The edges are parameterized by their length. And I sum these directional derivatives evaluated v, that should be zero. That's a natural boundary condition which makes this Laplacian self adjoint. And its spectrum, in one dimension, its spectrum will be a set of real numbers. And I go to immediately to the square root, the correct parameters to discuss this. So put k squared here. This. I put k squared here. I take plus and minus k. So the spectrum is a discrete subset of the real line. It's a one-dimensional thing. It should have a vial law that's roughly one-dimensional, and it does. And the question is, what is the spectrum of a metric graph? So if it's just a circle, it just was an arithmetic progression. How much more complicated is this than an arithmetic progression? And is the spectrum, what's the additive structure? Is it transcendental? Is it algebraic? It algebraic? And remarkably, this is an interesting question. I should say these graphs, and if you add a potential, which is what a physicist would do as well, but these metric graphs, they study these in great depth, have been studied already by Linus Pauling, chemists and physicists. And I mentioned Udi Smiel Uzi Smielansky, who has popularized this study and done a lot of numerical experiments and has proved a formula that you'll all recognize in a minute. That you'll all recognize in a minute. All right, so what does the spectrum look like? And it's going to have the features that our arithmetic manifold has. In other words, they're going to be, in this case, some obvious eigen arithmetic progressions. And that is, suppose the graph has a loop, as this one did. Suppose I've got a loop here. I can make an eigenfunction on this loop for the whole x globally, satisfying our boundary conditions, by setting the function to be sine 2 pi mn. function to be sine 2π mx over l that'll be an eigenfunction on that edge on the loop itself and it vanishes at the place where the loop's taking place so that you can then extend the function by zero elsewhere and you can see that that's formerly official eigenfunction in our space and it produces so each loop produces an infinite arithmetic progression 2πm over l m over the integers in the spectrum In the spectrum. These are the only obvious eigenfunctions that one sees. And one might ask, what does the rest look like? There are three manifolds that we must avoid. The circle itself, which is a perfect arithmetic progression, an interval, and this figure eight, which is two loops of length L1 and L2 with one vertex. Remarkably, because say take this third one, there will be an arithmetic progression corresponding to. Progression corresponding to this loop. There will be an arithmetic progression corresponding to this loop. But there's some miracle here, and you'll see where it's coming from eventually. There's a third arithmetic progression of length one of L1 plus L2 capturing the entire spectrum. So these metric graphs are very, very, they're too simple. Their spectrum is just an arithmetic progression. So I'm going to avoid these three because the theorem is these are the only ones that are special and the other ones. The only ones that are special, and the other ones are already as complicated or transcendental as you can imagine. So let n of x be the complement of the arithmetic progressions coming from the loops. So if there are no loops, then n of x is everything. And if in general, if you're not one of those three, then n of x is always non-empty. It consists of a positive fraction of the spectrum. It's everything, as I said, if there are no loops. And now I want. And now I want to describe some joint work with Kurosov, who works in these metric graphs, and had asked the question: what is the additive structure and transcendent structure of the spectrum? So we're going to assume firstly that the lengths are linearly independent over the rationals. So we have this metric graph. If there are relations amongst the lengths, things descend and they become related to other. So you should view this as a world, a one-dimensional world we have. A world, a one-dimensional world where we have a new kind of complexity, a little bit reminiscent of what we're trying to understand in locally symmetric spaces. So, I'll assume that they're linearly independent over the rationals. Then, our main theorem is that their span. So, if you look at this non-linear part, that's n stands for the non- or non-progression part, which is always there now. If you look at the non-linear part of the spectrum, it's as a subset of the real line. So, if you're interested in the Q. So, if you're interested in the Q-span, which means any linear relations amongst the eigenvalues, the answer is there's no persistent linear relations, meaning the dimension of this over the rationals is infinite. That's our first theorem. And much to show you that it's very far from an arithmetic progression, which is what he was interested in. There's a constant. This constant can be written down effectively. This comes from a Written down effectively. This comes from some of the deepest Diophantine theorems, so you, but it is effective the constant, though the solutions aren't. So that any arithmetic progression in the reals meets the spectrum in at most finitely many points. So it's not only that you don't contain an arithmetic progression in this nonlinear part, you meet every arithmetic progression in most 10 points. Usually you don't meet any arithmetic progression, but if you try to find the arithmetic progression which has many points, Progression which has many points, you won't. So, this is a very general theorem, which is coming from, as I said, deep diaphantine finiteness theorems. One can say more if one believes a conjecture, which I'll return to later also. There's a beautiful generalization of the great theorem of Lindemann, which was that pi is transcendental, and the generalization by Beierstrass. Generalization by Biostruss, which is called Channel's conjecture, which remains unsolved but highly believed, and analogues in function fields are known and so on. And that's the beautiful following statement that if I have n numbers which are linearly independent of the rations, these are complex numbers, then the transcendence degree of the two n numbers, z1 up to zn, capital n and little n, are the same here, of the numbers themselves and their exponentials. And their exponentials. So they are linearly independent over Q. And if I take the numbers and their exponentials, the transcendence degree is at least n. That generalizes pretty much everything in transcendence theory and is the holy grail of the subject. And special cases with n equals 1 are known or z1 to zn. So Weierstrass theorem is a special case and so on. Anyway, let me assume that I haven't worked very hard to see. I haven't worked very hard to see what, in terms of what's known, we can relax this, but that's not what the point of our work was here. The corollary is this is going to be the analog of my arithmetic manifold. Suppose that L1 to Ln are really independent over Q and are algebraic. So that's going to be a metric graph where the actual lengths are not only real numbers, but they're actually algebraic. Maybe they even lie in the same field. That to me is the analog of being an arrow. That to me is the analogue of being an arithmetic manifold. And assuming that, so if you are very algebraic in your lengths, then your transcendence degree is infinite. There's no way of writing down the eigenvalues in any kind of reasonable way in terms of algebraic functions or anything of that nature. The transcendence degree is infinite. And it's quite, well, we haven't proved that. We are going to only prove that assuming Chaniel, but it's a consequence of our. It's a consequence of our main theorem, which we do prove. All right, so this is an arithmetic manifold. I want to show you that actually it does look a lot like our locally symmetric spaces because there's a trace formula. And this is why I mentioned Smielansky. He's the first to really write this down in a physics way. And this trace formula looks very much like the Selberg trace formula for the case of the upper half plane and a compact quotient. And a compact quotient. It's got all the features. After all, the fundamental group was a free group, but this is really much more exotic than any Poisson summation formula. So let me explain the terms in this formula because I think we, this particular audience, can really appreciate this. So we're going to make a measure just like we did in Poisson sum, or as we do in the Selberg trace formula. Usually with the Selberg trace formula, you have a test function. So I just write it in this Fourier transform notation. Fourier transform notation. You put a point mass, delta k, for each k in the spectrum. Now, remember, now the spectrum is a discrete subset of the real line, which we have just proved has got some very transcendent features to its description. It's very far, if we're not one of these special guys, to being an arithmetic progression. And we take the Fourier transform of putting point masses at this discrete set. And lo and behold, we get a sum. And lo and behold, we get a sum of point masses again, just like in Poisson's sum. In fact, the trace formula reads that the Fourier transform is a delta mass at the origin. So there's one of the support. It's only a sum of delta masses. The support is at the origin and at the lengths of the closed orbits. These would be the conjugacy classes in the case of Selberg with some coefficients. And it reads exactly like in the Selberg case. Reads exactly like in the Selberg case. In other words, you look at the generator of the conjugacy class. So the P is a set of oriented paths on the metric graph closed. So it should be oriented periodic. These are closed paths. That's a whole point about the trace formula. And up to cyclic equivalence. So it doesn't matter where you start. So a closed path doesn't have a starting point. We do allow backtracking. This is very important. Is very important in this definition here. The length of the path. So, if I have a closed path, it's going on this metric graph. It's a closed path topologically. I start at a point, I come back to where I start. I add the lengths of the sides that I visit as I traverse the closed loop. And that will be the length. So, we'll see in a minute that these lengths, of course, also are in a discrete set. The lengths are positive. So, because I took the square root. Because I took the square root, so the spectrum was a square root, so it's always even. I have to make this even. And then the coefficient here, which in these orbital integrals in the trace formula, are very simply in this one-dimensional situation, could be thought of scattering. In other words, you either are transmission or reflection when you go around a path. So if you come to a vertex V and go back to where you started, so this is where I'm allowing. So, this is where I'm allowing backtracking. Then, this S is minus one plus two over the degree of that vertex. And remember that that vertex never has degree two, otherwise it's a removable singularity. And otherwise, it's two of the degree if I'm transmission in this kind of scattering language. So, I sum over all the exponential number because the group's free on some number of generators, periodic orbits. Periodic orbits, and I put delta masses at their lengths, and the sum of delta masses at lengths at eigenvalues. So, this is the geometric side, and this is the sorry, this is the spectral side of the trace formula. This is the geometric side. The geometric side, remarkably, here is supported on a discrete set as well. In fact, there's a notion that's very important in quasi- Very important in quasicrystals, which is an attempt to understand generalizations of the Poisson summation formula. That if you take a measure and you put, in this case, it's a positive measure, you put delta masses at numbers which are a discrete set, how could you possibly get that the Fourier transform is a sum of numbers supported on a discrete set? And in this case, it's a discrete set because the lengths are positive multiple. That are positive multiples of L1 up to Ln. So they're positive multiples. That's a discrete subset in R. Such a measure is called in the subject maybe by Yves Mayer as a it's called a crystalline measure. And not only are these metric graphs providing us with a crystalline measure, this is one reason we got into this, is they are so exotic that they solve a slew of problems that were raised in the subject about the existence of crystalline measures. So these are kind of poison. Crystalline measures. So these are kind of Poisson summation formulae in which you are very far from an arithmetic progression. That's why we were using these Diephentine methods to understand the arithmetic progression and now the transcendence properties, which are more relevant to us here, of the spectrum. So the spectral side is very transcendental and the geometric side is very given by algebraic expressions, just as it is always in the trace formula. That's why the trace formula. Trace formula. That's why the trace formula is so powerful. We can always compute conjugacy classes. Maybe it's very difficult, but we can try. On the other hand, we don't know how to compute the spectrum. So this is an example where we can prove the spectrum is got no relations, no linear relations, and in fact, transcendental under Channel's hypothesis. I want to emphasize that you might think you could use the summation formula, the trace formula, to prove these things. After all, maybe you can show numbers transcendental by showing. Show numbers transcendental by showing you can't approximate it too well by rationals using the side. I don't know how to do that. I'd love to be able to do that because that would work in the case that we're really interested in, not this toy problem. Anyway, what we do use, and if I have time, but I don't think I'll have time, we use a very deep theorem of Wolfgang Schmidt. It's called the Schmidt subspace theorem. It's a far-reaching generalization. Theorem, it's a far-reaching generalization. It's the first higher-dimensional and most influential generalization of the Tua-Ziegel-Roth theorem to higher dimensions. And it gives the finiteness and it concerns a proof of a conjecture of Lang. It's called Lange's GM about taking finitely generated subgroups and their division groups in algebraic tori and asking about the intersection of such a finitely generated subgroup. Finitely generated subgroup with an arbitrary, arbitrary sub-variety of the torus, algebraic sub-variety. And that intersection, which looks very complicated, actually structured. And that structure is what brings out those special cases. And for the rest, the intersections are very unlikely. And that's why there aren't progressions. And that's why things become transcendental. So it is a case in which we have this remarkable picture. I should say, and this actually connects a little bit with Joseph's talk in the following vague sense. The reason we can study this at all is that the spectrum, what's the connection with all this Diophantine geometry, is the spectrum can be written down in terms of a determinant, a finite determinant, as the zero set of an entire quasi-periodic function. And we have to understand its zeros. It's obviously not a periodic function. It's obviously not a periodic function, but a quasi-periodic function, which means you have a function on a torus, which is maybe a sum of trigonometric polynomials, and you're evaluating it on some irrational angle line, which is what the linear independence is, where the linear independence input is there. And we can still study it. While if we go to the discrete spectrum and ask whether it's transcendental in the problem that I'm about to describe, the main problem. About to describe the main problem. Then one can use functional analysis, one can write it down as a Fredon determinant, and so on. But who knows about zeros of arbitrary entire functions that are defined and are not special functions? I emphasize you can't solve this problem explicitly as far as I know. We don't know how to write the eigenvalues explicitly. Okay, so that's our toy problem. And it has the features that you'll see, I think, are the ones. You'll see, I think, are the ones that I think are true. So, somehow, there's a one-dimensional problem here that you can actually study the transcendence, but not by using the kind of tools that we have available, which is the trace form. And it has also the feature that there are some obvious arithmetic progressions in the spectrum, and then the rest is highly transcendental. And I expect the same holds as long as the Lie group G in the In the group defined over Q is non-compact. There should be obvious, no, the word there is not obvious anymore because this has to do with functoriality, but there are sub pieces which are algebraic coming from comology, maybe coming from Galois representations and not from comology. And then there's the kind of rest, which is supposed to be transcendental. That's, of course, what I believe, and I think you probably all believe. All right, so let me turn to that quickly. Turn to that quickly. So, suppose I look at abelian G. This question was studied by Andre Vay. In other words, we do understand the representation of the abelian group. That's one thing we do understand. And we understand it in the number setting. That's class field theory. And these algebraic and transcendental questions were asked and answered by Vey, answered by Walt Schmidt. So if I look at GL1 over K, Hecker distinguished. Hecker distinguished two kinds of Grossen characters, two kinds of Hecke characters, ones which are finite image and ones which he called Grossen because their image was infinite. Now, Wey wrote some beautiful papers realizing the certain of the Grossen characters has a VL function. So he wanted to understand, well, what about these Grossen characters of all types? And that's one of the reasons he invented the Vague group in order to capture all representations of the Vague. All representations of the V group, not just the Galway representations, one-dimensional, and they correspond to all the Hecker characters. And then he distinguished between two types of characters, which is very close to the problem I'm trying to understand. It is the problem in GL1. But he looks more closely. He says, let's define the ones of type A0 where the coefficients are not only algebraic, but lie in a fixed degree number field. And the rest, he says, are not of type A naught. And he Of type A naught, and he, I think, wanted, but I don't think saw how to prove that they're transcendental. And what that boils down to is if you take a real field, so again, this real field or S011, which you must be non-compact at infinity to get something which is not algebraic, then Hecker gives us the Hecker characters. They are, say, it's class number one, and you look at And you look at the following character on the ideals or on the integers. This is invariant under the units: alpha over alpha prime, alpha prime is a conjugate. And you take, there's one for each m to power pi m, i pi m over log epsilon, and that's invariant. And log epsilon is the log of the fundamental unit of this real field. These are Hecker-Grossen characters not of type A naught. Characters not of type A naught. And as I said, if we start with an orthogonal group which is abelian, not semi-simple, but abelian, then as long as we're non-compact, then we are probably in the transcendental world. This is the same example, basically. So it's not completely obvious how to show that these coefficients are transcendental because you have to find the right, you don't have Shannul's conjecture, but there is a theorem, and that's what Wolschmitz used. It's due to maybe Lange and maybe. To maybe Lang and maybe Siegel before him, and Ramachandra, I think it's called the six exponentials theorem, and you can recognize that it's kind of a weak version of the Chanuel conjecture. And that is, if you take three complex numbers, which are independent over Q, and another two complex numbers, which are independent over Q, then at least one of these exponentials of these six exponentials is transcendental. And if you use that, you can show that the Hegger character is not. Show that the Hege character is not of type A0 are in fact transcendental, but that's when we vary over all its values at all the places, not at just our comedian place. So at the Archimedean place, we'll be transcendental, but then we'll be in an arithmetic progression. That's what I'm interested in, is just looking at that part, because the other part will come with the same transcendence with it. All right, so let's get to the real problem about which I have. Problem about which I have only nothing new to say other than to highlight it and popularize it, and to say that this one-dimensional toy problem tells us what we want to prove. So, we're looking at GR non-compact, we're looking at the L2 spectrum. You could put cusp if GR, if this quotient is finite volume, you should put cusp there. There. And Clausel, and more recently, Buzzard and Guy have formulated the analog of type A naught. So that's a stronger condition where they put conditions on the Satake or Langlands parameters, what algebraic properties of those numbers would define something of type A naught. They're just trying to define the analog of type A naught and to capture various automorphic forms which are algebraic in their nature, including the idea. Algebraic in their nature, including the eigenvalue a quarter, of course. There are subtleties in these definitions. So, Clausel made a definition, but doesn't G explain there are subtleties, especially got to do with twisting. And in fact, even with SL2 and some definitions of the dual group, Bernstein gave a lecture at the Institute a couple of years ago, pointing out to other subtleties. So, there are subtleties in these definitions connected with twisting that I don't want to go into. Don't want to go into. All right, so rather than look at the general G, where I think the picture is going to be the same as what I'm saying here, but of course, taking into account everything we know about functoriality. And functoriality is supposed to, the question is, how does functoriality mix these transcendence and algebraic features? But let's just take the uphoff plane, which is the one place where it's sufficiently rich and it's got all the features. So, of course, in the uphoff plane, the discrete series are the holidays. In the up plane, the discrete series are the holomorphic forms. I'll ignore the weight one forms. The holomorphic forms and limit of discrete series are all algebraic, and we understand their algebraic nature very well. And this is very well understood for that aspect for holomorphic forms. And the other ones are the mass forms. And the mass forms are the ones that we write in the following way. So we have a congruent subgroup of SL2Z. We are invariant. We are cusping. invariant. We cusp form, these exist as you know, from because of the Selberg trace formula. So there are many of them, they're Hecke eigenforms. And we write the eigenvalues a quarter plus k squared. If we want to measure a fine structure of algebraic or arithmetic progressions, this is the right parameter. It also shows that if k is real, then we, of course, satisfy Selberg's eigenvalue conjecture. We can also work with weight one. Castleman points this out very clearly in his discussion of In his discussion of Galois representations, even Galois representations. So, the question is: what can I say about the k-spectrum of this two-dimensional example, the basic two-dimensional example? And all the number theories, of course, because we are congruent subgroup of SL2Z. And I think, and as I said, this paper of Castleman is so succinct and beautiful, explained this point. He didn't conjecture the converse. I've noticed Langlands more recently. I've noticed Langlands more recently conjecturing the converse. This is, I think, quite bold. But anyway, let's put down what we believe here: that k equals zero is in the spectrum here, must correspond, should correspond if and only if there's a two-dimensional even, even, meaning under Gaua conjugation, it's even. So half the Gaua representations are going to be odd and half even, and the odd ones are understood in terms of holomorphic. And the odd ones are understood in terms of holomorphic forms, and for two dimensions are now completely understood. That's, of course, a tremendous achievement. But for the even ones, which are the other half, they've all been thrown out the window because they are sitting as part of a transcendental piece, but they're not transcendental, of course. So we believe that the eigenvalue of quota can only happen because of it being corresponding to an art in even Galway representation, irreducible two-dimensional. Irreducible two-dimensional. And of course, Maas, who invented the theory, already constructed these examples with eigenvalue one-quarter and Langland's tunnel prove one direction, as you all know, if the group, the two-dimensional representation is solvable. There's no icosahedral case known as far as I know, not one example of even icosahedral for which we know this. Of course, numerically, everything looks like it's absolutely true if you experiment, but how do you actually? But how do you actually prove anything? And that's because this algebraic guy is sitting inside what is transcendental. If k is not zero, can we find arithmetic progressions in the spectrum? And in fact, that's the only explicit examples of mice forms that we know. And they come from functoriality. They come from SO11, where again, we wrote down what that's abelian. So we know that we can write down the We know that we can write down the eigenvalues, they're transcendental. So, in fact, the Km's lie coming, they lie, you can certainly put them in gamma 4D, where d is the same d in q root d. And you'll get a full arithmetic progression, which will be transcendental officially. But of course, the transcendence degree will be just one. So, this is very similar to what we had in the metric graph. There are these arithmetic regressions coming from. Arithmetic regressions coming from obvious examples. Well, these aren't obvious anymore. Before they were obvious, now they are very deep, but they're still very special. So there are these, and you can make an arbitrary large number of arithmetic progressions here. Yanis Petridis does that. By the way, it's a kind of a remarkable thing. If you look at the Selberg trace formula in this case and this trace formula, this trace formula that, sorry, you look at the Sorry, you look at the Poisson sum. Sorry, you write the Selberg trace formula, which is analog of that formula. In this case, you will find. So I said it's obvious, it's not of nothing's obvious here, but there is this arithmetic progression and there is a length, a closed loop, just like we had there. There's a closed geodesic of dual length log epsilon sitting inside this arithmetic manifold. But there are many other closed loops. So why these come up in gamma? So, why these come up in gamma naught d, 4d and not other ones is a bit of a mystery. And that's because you don't take that closed geodesic and construct a trivial eigenfunction. It comes through theta lifts or through functoriality. It lies much deeper. But the upshot's the same. There are these finite number of arithmetic progressions. And what we're really eager to prove is this conjecture, which I now put forth. And even in the metric graph. And even in the metric graph, I don't know how to use the trace formula to prove anything like this. That would be very useful because it might apply here. But the conjecture is that the span, so now we're looking at a congruent subgroup in the upper half plane. We look at the spectrum. It can have finitely many arithmetic progressions. But I claim that the Q-span of all the eigenvalues should be infinite dimensional. So the rest should not have persistent linear. Have not have persistent linear relations over Q. And much more, just like before, where we could prove these things, the transcendence degree should be infinite. That is, you can't write down the Laplace spectrum explicitly in any algebraic way that's meaningful. They're there, they're important. When you can prove something, you prove something about them. But the transcendence degree is infinite, and this space is kind of a primitive space. Is kind of a primitive space. You can't single out the eigenvalue a quarter by itself, making the whole problem when you have an Archimedean place very difficult. This is the stumbling block of many, many things. So very little is known towards this conjecture. There is one theorem of myself and Brumbly. It's very weak. It's modest, but it's at least a theorem in this direction. And it says that if you assume that pi, this mass form, is very, very Is very its eigenvalues lie are actually integral and lie actually in integers in a quadratic field, except the quadratic field is not allowed to be q root five because that would contain the icosahedral case that we don't know. But if all the Hecke eigenvalues lie or integers in a fixed quadratic field, and pi is a mass form with any eigenvalue lambda, then necessarily lambda is a quota and pi does correspond. Quarter and pi does correspond to a two-dimensional solvable Galway representation. So, this is the only converse theorem of this kind of theorem towards this that I know, but it's assuming way too much. We're really trying to understand the generic guy is actually all in total have transcendence degree infinite. So, uh, I said, I didn't realize it was 45 minutes, so I think I can stop here. I had was going to give you a uh Give you a sales talk as to why this is a fundamental problem and a stumbling block. And that, so to speak, the trace formula, if it works, does not know how to distinguish between algebraic and transcendental. Here's a good example with eigenvalue or quota and general and these other arithmetic regressions. And for that reason, we have to face the transcendental part, even if we weren't interested. Part, even if we weren't interested in it. Of course, we're interested in it because half the Galway representations, the arten ones in dimension two, are embedded inside there. They're algebraic, but they're sitting inside there. But even the transcendental one, the real transcendental one, the other ones, are absolutely critical in the analytic theory of L functions, even if what you're trying to prove is something about an L function of a motive. The other ones play a fundamental role. The other ones play a fundamental role in ever trying to do anything. So, the subject where you try to break these up and treat them separately, which of course you do because one can make so much progress on Galway representations, is at some level unsatisfactory in that it leaves out half the theory and also, more importantly, also leaves out these real transcendental things for which many of the same conjectures, I hope, are true. Which is, I hope, are true, like Ramana Jan and Riman. All right, I think I was going to say more, but let me stop there. Thank you very much.
