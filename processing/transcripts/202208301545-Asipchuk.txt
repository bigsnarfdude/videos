Thank you very much for the introduction and thank you for the opportunity to give a talk on this conference. This is joint work with Vlad Resils and partially we obtain all our results during MRPUFAU that was sponsored by NSF and NSA. So first I introduce our split intervals. Our split intervals. We have two sequences of AJ and BJ, they're finite sequences, and using the sequences, we can construct the sequence of intervals. So first of them, it's ij with endpoints Aj plus one and translated. I j is jj, which is translated to the right using bj. Write using BJ. These sequences of intervals we can combine in with one interval. The first one is the union of O ij, which is the interval from 0 to 1, and the second one is the interval j that we consider as a split interval. And the length of jj or ij will be, we do not like gamma. Be we do not like gamma G. We're going to talk about read basis. So, this is the definition of read basis. The first set of inequality corresponds to the frame and another set of inequality correspond to resequence. Together, we have re-spaces, and constant AB will be the same if we have RIS-BASIC. We are more interesting in exponential basis. It is basis in the form of a set of exponents. And the first problem that we consider about existence of the basis, some explicit of the basis, is the example of such exponential basis. It's Cadet's theorem. So if we have a small delta n that satisfies this condition, Uh, they satisfy this condition, uh, we can tell that the basis in this form will be an exponential basis. And our problem is we're trying to find such exponential basis in such form on of L2G on our speed interval. Also, we can see another problem and And if our PJ are all integers, we will have that our standard exponential basis, e to the power 2 pi i and x, will be the normal basis of L2j, now split interval. And we some sort of want to check the stability how peak should be. How big should be our perturbation now, delta n, uh, to have still have a basis of L2G? And known result on this topic, first of all, was obtained in 2012 by Cosmo Mitsun. And we definitely know that on any finite union of intervals, we will have basis. However, we don't know how. However, we don't know how the basis would look like exponential basis. And another result was obtained by Laura DeCarli in 2017, when we have endpoints of intervals are rational. In this case, we have necessary and sufficient condition that we can check and figure out do we have basis or not? However, one more problem that sometimes it's really hard to check. It's really hard to chance. Now, some words about weighted exponential basis. So, for example, if we have our original one from zero to one, and we separate it using our small intervals ij. So, to obtain the basis on split interval, we just Interval, we just need to put weights on each of the pieces of the interval, and we will have this basis. And conversely, this will be true. And this lemma describes what I said before about this. So if we have the weight in this form, the sum of exponents that involve pKs, how far we speak. How far we split down the interval and multiply by the characteristic function of this interval. And two sentences are true. So first, the set of exponent is the risk basis of 2j, if and only if the weighted basis is the risk basis of the weighted set is the risk basis of L2. Is the basis of L201. And conversely, it's also true, but of course, with conjugate weight. And the constant will be the same. Next, I'll introduce the sequence that we're trying to use for our basis. First, the sequence of sine. So Cm is Cn is a sequence that gives us one or negative one, depends on how big is the decimal part of the sequence Bn. And delta n star will be a sequence that we can represent using distance between integer numbers and bn multiplied by cn and divided by b. Also, we prefer to use different notation for Prefer to use different notations for this delta n star. For example, instead of distance, we use just a minimum between decimal part and one minus decimal part, and also one more representation using the floor function. And so, of course, if we have a sequence of dead hand star, we can set the set of exponent e to e to the power 2Ï€ ix multiplied by n plus delta star n. And the first result will be good. It's that this simple lemma that if our b satisfy this condition, then we will have exponential basis of L two zero one and what about split into well we have similar condition on B. Similar condition on B, but also because we have a sequence of sequencing, we also need to put condition on them. And if this ratio VK will be always integer, and we once again satisfy all conditions from previous lemma, we can claim that our basis beta star will be exponential basis of L2G. Of L to J and more the constant that is constant will be the same. So, what's good about this result that here we do not need to put any condition on AK. A K can be irrational, rational, the length can be different, but the basis will work. And also, our PK potential can be also irrational, but But of course, they should be multiple of our P. And of course, now we're working on improvement of this result because we want to improve the condition when B between one and two. We want to replace it just to itself without B from Russian. Now, about stability. Now, about stability. So, once again, I remind you that if bj are all natural, in this case, our standard exponential basis will be risk basis of L2j. And our problem once again is to find the bound on delta n, how big the delta n should be to us to have still a half a base. To us, to have still a half a basis. And here, the serum. So we still have our condition on L that the supreme delta n should be less than one quarter. But also, we need to add one more property. Our delta n should satisfy this inequality. Inequality. This inequality is pretty messy, especially if you have a lot of M. And we can slightly improve it if we in the sense of we can make it not so sharp, but better looking. So using the convexity of trigonometrical function or function A L and or B. L and or B gamma G L. In this case, the quality will look like this. So once again, not so informative, but I will try to describe it using the example. For example, when we have m equal to 2, we have only one inequality. So our supremo of the distance will be less than some positive number. Should be less, one positive number. Be less than one positive number, and delta n in this case should be from this intersection between the interval negative l and this union of intervals. And this intersection always not empty. For example, if you check the case when k equals to zero, we definitely will have an intersection. And if b will grow, will be really big. Row will be really big, say like this, we will have a lot of intersections. And if we consider that greatest two, we need to compare such intervals, such sets of intervals and figure out do we have intersection or not. So also I need to mention which tools did we use during our co-cup. We use during our calculation. First of all, it's a lemma that similar lemmas you can find in the menu sources. It's mostly just theorem, but we wanted this lemma in exactly, or better say this in quality exactly in this form. If exactly in this form to be more useful for our particular problem. And also, of course, we used Penny Universarium to help us to obtain our result. Also, let me summarize what we did. So we found explicit basis for some particular case for specifications. For speed interval and roof stability result. Of course, we're still working on improvement, especially about stability results and hopefully about existence of the basis. On the speech interval, we're trying to jump to infinities. Thank you very much for the attention. Okay, so would you like to ask any questions? People online would like to ask questions? It seems it's not the case, so we thank Oleg for his talk. Thank you.
