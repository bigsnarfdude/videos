What I will discuss today is based on joint works with Espiros Alexokeis at the University of Toronto. I'm Larry who's here. This is essentially, we call it as the Lorenzian-Calderon problem because it's the analog of anisotropic Calderon problem with Riemannian geometries, but just with Riemannian geometry replaced with Lorentzian geometries. But it's maybe a misnomer because this is just an inverse problem for linear wave equations that has also been around over the past. That has also been around over the past 30-40 years. Okay, so let me just set some notation from Lorentzian geometry that I will use. So we start with the manifold itself, which I will assume that topologically has the form of a cylinder, with the axis of the cylinder representing the direction of time, and this transversal manifold M0 representing the spatial variables. And then on this manifold, I consider And then on this manifold, I consider general families of Lorentzian metrics of the following form, where C is just a positive smooth function, and these G0s can be viewed as a family of a smooth Riemannian metrics on this transversal manifold that depend smoothly on time. So, this is a very weak assumption on geometry. For instance, in the context of Lorentzian manifolds without boundary, this is equivalent to saying that your manifold is Equivalent to saying that your manifold is globally hyperbolic. So, this is the geometric generality that we will consider. Throughout the talk, when I mean Kaowski metric, I will mean the flat Lorentzian metric, which is given coordinates via the following expression. Now, a bit of a vocabulary from causality in Lorentzian geometry. Given any vector in the tangent space of a point, we say the vector is time-like. Is time-like if the inner product of the vector with itself is strictly negative. We say it's null if this inner product is zero, and finally a space-like if inner product is positive. And finally, just to give you a picture near each point in the Lorentzian manifold here, which I've denoted as an observer, you can divide the region into three regions. One is uh these cones that I've shown in this picture, which is the paths that light travels on. That light travels by in electromagnetism. So you can view this as geodesics starting at this observer in the direction of a null vector. So this gives you these double null points. There is the region in the inside of this, interior of these null cones, which is the set of points that are causally related to this observer point. And a region that will be important for us in this talk is the exterior of this double null cone, which is in physics also referred to sometimes as the physically forbidden region. Sometimes, as the physically forbidden region. Okay, so let's now formulate this main inverse problem that we are interested in, which we call the Lorentzian Colder problem. So, we'll start with, again, the geometric set of this Lorentzian manifold Mg, as I described in the previous slide, with a time-like boundary. So, again, I've drawn a prototypical example of what this means. You have this topologically cylindrical structure, I've drawn it. Cylindrical structure. I've drawn it between two time slices. And on this Lorentzian manifold, we have some a priori unknown function v that I've highlighted here in red to signify that it's unknown. For the data of our inverse problem, I assume that we are given the following boundary data, which consists of the Cauchy data of u and the derivatives of u on this natural boundary, where u solves the following wave equation. Solves the following wave equation, namely box of u plus v times u plus 0. Where here this box is nothing but the wave operator or just the Laplace-Beltromi operator on this Lorentzian manifold that is given in local coordinates by the following expression. So we look at smooth solutions to this wave equation, we record the Cauchy data on the boundary, and we want to see if we can uniquely determine this unknown. This unknown coefficient V from these boundary data. Okay, so you can also formulate this in terms of the Dirichlet-Meyermann map, but this is perhaps the easiest way to formulate the Singer's problem. Okay, so the Lorentzian-Calderon problem is precisely this injectivity question. And ideally, the most complete answer that one would hope for is to say that I can solve this Lorentzian-Calderon problem on any Lorentzian manifold without any assumption on the geometry. Geometry. But as we will see in the literature, there have been quite stringent assumptions so far on this problem in terms of assumptions on the geometry. So let me discuss what is known. And really, based on the method of approach I've divided here, the previous literature on this problem, there are some results on this problem that are purely based on propagation of singularities or somewhat equivalent. Or somewhat equivalently geometric optic constructions for wave equations. So, using these approaches, this inverse problem has been solved, for instance, by Stefanov if the metric is real analytic. And additionally, there is a convex foliation problem in a joint work with Jonos, Jovar, and Lowry, we also solved this inverse problem for certain This inverse problem for certain classes of ultra-static manifolds. So, here what I mean by ultra-static manifold is somehow that there is this strong assumption on the metric, namely that this G0 is completely independent of time. For people who are more familiar with inverse problems on Riemannian manifolds, these ultra static manifolds are analogous to transversally anisotropic manifolds. Yes, so they are quite a So, they are quite a strong assumption of the geometry. And as you can see, the components of the metric, for instance, are completely independent of time. Okay, so here we have some results, assuming really strong assumptions on the form of metric. Then there are some alternative results in the literature that are based on the boundary control method of Galicia. So, this boundary control method is an altogether different approach where you actually use Altogether different approach where you actually use unique continuation principles for the wave equation together with some controllability theory for the phase, for solutions of the phase from the boundary. This part I will sweep under the rug completely, this controllability aspect, just because of the amount of time. But unique continuation and in particular optimal unique continuation results are key to making this approach work and this is the realization of pellets. Now what is known based on this Now, what is known based on this method is that if the manifold is ultra-static equal, and additionally V is assumed to be time-independent, then this inverse problem follows from the work of Belisha Fakurilev. And Eskin was also able to use a variant of this method to solve this inverse problem, assuming that the metric and the function v both depend real analytically on time. Okay, so in particular, you notice that in all of these results in the previous literature, there is some. So, at best, we have this, I would say, result of BESCAN in which everything must depend real analytically on time. So, in particular, the results are highly non-generic. So, now joint with Larry and Skiros, we have we can at least solve this Lorentzian-Calderon problem on open sets of Lorentzian manifolds. So, let me So let me discuss a corollary of our main result, which is perhaps much easier to state in a short talk. And this corollary is as follows. We start again with these cylindrical manifolds topologically, but this time I take any Lorentzian metric G, which is in a C2 neighborhood of some ultra-static metric of negative curvature, of a non-positive curvature. Non-positive curvature. Okay, so the only thing that we impose is that the metric is in a small C2 neighborhood of an ultra-static manifold where the transversal manifold has non-positive curvature. Then we can solve the Singer's problem. Namely, we can uniquely reconstruct the zeroth order coefficient from the boundary data of waves. Sorry, is it still a restriction on length of the time? On the length of the sign on the boundary data. So, this, this, yeah, this, this is a stated in this moment for an infinite cylinder, but how much precisely you need to measure to recover at a certain point the quantum. So there is a precise amount that you need to know in terms of time. But yeah, this is a state in the infinite suit. As a yet more transparent corollary, for instance, we can solve this problem near Minkowski geometry, which is easiest to use. The geometry, which is the easiest way to state. Now, our main result replaces this condition of being near ultra-static metrics with being near certain Lorentzian manifolds that satisfy certain curvature points. And in terms of the method of approach, our approach can be seen as a variant of boundary control method again. The key ingredient for us is a new optimal unit continuation for geometric vapor equations. For geometric flape equations, that I will not try to discuss. So now the talk will become a bit disjointed because, as I said, these kinds of approaches to solve the inverse problem has two aspects. One is an optimal unicotuation result. And the second key thing is a controllability theory, which I will not discuss. But I think this unique continuation results may be also of independent interest. Okay, so at first I want to just discuss Just discuss local unit continuation results for wave equations and the link between local unit continuation results and global optimal unit continuation results. Okay, so what is the best, and here what I mean by local unit continuation result is that generally suppose you have a hypersurface in your manifold, you have a point, you have a solution to the wave equation on your manifold, let's say box plus potential u is zero, where u is Where u is zero on one side of the surface, and you want to see if there is a neighborhood on the other side where you can conclude that the solution is zero. This is what I refer to by the local unit continuation. And you can immediately see that this kind of result is not true if this surface is characteristic or a null hypersurface. Just because take for instance the plane waves in Minkowski space-time. There's plenty of counterexample basin. Plenty of counterexamples based on finite speed of propagation. But then there are two other kinds of surfaces in general that you can consider. One is the space-like surface, which are like time slices. And the others are time-like surfaces, such as the one on the right, in black. What do we know about local unit continuation across these surfaces? The first one is almost trivial. We do it in any undergrad course. It's just energy estimates. But why is it trivial? But why is it trivial to show unit continuation across space-like surfaces at a deeper level? It's connected to the geometry of null geodesics. So if you take a point P on a space-like surface and you draw out the null geodesics, you notice that all of them are hitting the surface transversely. Somehow this makes the theory of unicontinuation across these surfaces rather true. What about the time-like surface? So again, here. So again, here you have a point P on a time-duck surface, you draw out the null geodesics emanating from this point, and what you notice now is that in dimensions 1 plus 2 and higher, you will get some null geodesics that will be tangential to this hypersurface. Those are going to cause difficulty. And this is why this unique continuation has been such a difficult question. So what is known about unique continuation across time-like surfaces? Time-like surfaces. This is a deep result of Tataru in 1995, where he showed that as long as all the coefficients in the PDE depend real analytically on time, then you can show this unit continuation locally. What makes the situation less hopeful is that if you just want to consider smooth coefficients, then there are counterexamples by a linear. Okay, so in some sense, this is optimal. Optimal. So, this is the picture for local unicinuation results if you just want to consider general surfaces without any geometric assumptions on the surface. Why are these local unicinuation results important, you might say? Because they can be used as building blocks of obtaining quite, I would say, cool global optimal unit continuation results. So what do I mean by that? So, what do I mean by that? Let's take the wave equation in Minkowski spacetime, this simple wave equation. So, as you can see, the coefficients are time-independent, and I have added this zeroth order v, which is again time-independent. So, we are in the setup of Tataru. Then I take this space-time cylinder, I take a portion of the boundary gamma, and I look at it across time. I get this rectangular region on the boundary. And now, suppose that you have a solution to the wave equation whose Have a solution to the wave equation whose Cauchy data is vanishing on that red set. And now you ask, what is the optimal region inside in which I can push and show that the solution is zero? What do I mean by optimality here? I mean that you can immediately construct counterexamples beyond that. So what is the type of surface that you will get by just running domain of dependence arguments? If you think about it, the optimal set that you get is the following set. Optimal set that you get is the following set, which is the set of points that I've drawn. It's the set of points from which there is one non-geodesic that goes back to this red set, goes forward to this set, and one that goes back to this set. So in time t equals zero, this is precisely this blue region, which is the set of points whose distance to this portion here is less than or equal to capital T. Okay, so that's the optimal region, and using Optimal region and using the local unicontinuation result in the previous slide, you can prove this unicontinuation. This is an argument of Fritz John. You can also find it in this book of Cachello of Guru Loflazas. All you need to do is to show that this region can be foliated by time-like surfaces. Okay, so this is the way to look at it. In this sense, these local unit continuation results are important for us because they give rise to these optimal unit continuation results. To these optimal unit continuation results. And then, for instance, the theory of Belyshev, in the case of recovering this V, builds a controllability theory that at the end of the day tells you the values of V on this edge of this blue region. Okay, but unfortunately, as I mentioned, the disappointing thing here is that if you want to use this unique continuation result of Totaru, you have to assume real. Tataro, you have to assume real analyticity in time throughout the PD. So now the question that we ask next is what about other local unit continuation results for the wave equation? Are there other more general results that are available that works in the smooth case? And this goes back to Hormander in the 60s, where he did this for much more general real principal type operators. But I just stayed here. Operators, but I just stated for this box plus potential on the Lorentz manifold, and this is tied to the notion of pseudo-convexity of a surface. Okay, so the story is that if you, I will explain in a second what pseudo-convexity means, but what Horvander showed is that if you have a pseudoconvex hypersurface, which is a geometric assumption on the surface, then if that surface is, let's say, the zero-level set of a function psi, and if let's say u is Psi, and if let's say u is vanishing on the set where psi is positive, which is the right-hand side, then you can always show that it must vanish on the other side, local near P. The condition says that the Hessian of this psi acting on the tangent vector x with itself must be positive, where this x is any tangent vector to the surface, which is additionally a null vector. Geometrically, it's much easier to describe in a picture what it's Describe in a picture, what it says is that, so take this, for example, red curve. This is a null geodesic that is tangential to the surface at this point. If you draw that null geodesic to the surface, it must always lie on the good side of the surface at the point of point. It cannot cross to the bad side, where you don't know a priori if the solution is zero. If the surface satisfies this condition at P, then it's called to be pseudo-convex. And then we have this. Pseudoconvex, and then we have this local unit continuation across it, thanks to Oman. In fact, this is a really strong condition. You can even say more. You don't need a smooth solution to the wave equation for this to be true. Even if you have a distributional solution to the wave equation in as rough a space as you wish, and it's vanishing on this side of the hyper surface, you can still conclude that it must vanish locally on the other side. This requires also a bit of micro-local propagational signals. Propagational simpleton. Okay, so unique continuation across pseudo-convex surfaces is true. Now comes the big question. Can you use pseudo-convex surfaces to construct global optimal unit continuation results? And this is a question that I would like to think that for some time it was believed that the answer is no, because you always miss a bit compared to using just time-lapse surfaces. But with Larian and Spheros, we have been able to find at least one candidate of a setup where you can use this pseudoconvex surfaces to foliate this optimal region. And that is the unique continuation result that we prove. So let me just state this theorem. So we again consider this kind of geometric generality that I described in the theorem. We take a manifold with In the theorem, we take a manifold with a Lorentzian metric that is a perturbation of some ultra-static metric of non-positive curvature. And then I consider, let's say, a point in the manifold and I shoot out the non-geodesics. That is going to cut the boundary in a connected set. It's going to hit the boundary here and here on the other. Hit the boundary here and here on the other side. And this is the region on the boundary that we will consider. So we are going to assume that we have a solution to the wave equation whose Cauchy data is vanishing on this part of the boundary that is sitting between the two null points. And then we want to see what is the optimal region inside the manifold that you can show that the solution must be zero. You can convince yourself that the optimal region is all the way up to this red point here. The way up to this red point here. Because if you solve the wave equation with initial data that is supported at this red point, then by finite the speed of propagation, you do get a solution to the wave equation whose Cauchy data is vanishing here. So at best, you can hope to prove really vanishing all the way up to this point. And what we prove is exactly that. So if you are in this context, for example, of being near some ultra static, Near some ultra-static manifolds, then this unique continuation property is true for any distributional solution to the wave equation. And well, the proof should not be a shot. What we want to do is to foliate this region in the exterior by pseudoconvex hypersurfaces. And this is really the crux of the proof to construct these pseudoconvex foliations. Prior to our work, the only setup where this unit continuation was not. Setup where this unicontinuation was known was for sufficiently smooth solutions in Minkowski space-times. Okay, maybe I'll just say one comment about this Minkowski case to just give you a picture of what is a good candidate for this pseudo-convex volume. So here I'm assuming that you know the metric is Minkowski, so flat. And you have the, let's say, one plus two dimensions. You have the, let's say, one plus two dimensions, so you have the time direction and the x1 and x2 coordinates. Then you just define this function, which is given by this quadratic expression. This would be the distance function to the tip in the Lorentzian sense. Its level sets are described here in this picture. They are hyperboloids. And this is the expression for the Hessian of this function. You get twice the metric, the Minkowski metric. So you see that if you So, you see that if you plug in an all-vector here, you just get zero. So, it's not really pseudoconvex. You're at the borderline case. And geometrically, I mean, what do we know about hyperboloids? It's that if you shoot out a straight line that is tangent to hyperboloids, it will always remain at the hyperboloid. Okay, so even in the Minkowski case, it's not clear what is the right choice of the function, but turns out that you can perturb these functions just a little bit. Just a little bit in a special way to make them pseudo-convex. And what we do in the more geometric context is to find first sort of a natural candidate, similar to this Lorentzian distance function to the tip, and try to create a pseudoconvex volume out of that. But maybe I'll just stop here. Thanks for your attention. Thanks very much. Questions? Can you say something about how you can perturb? Sure. This is the additional slide. So the story is that, okay, so let's say that we have a manifold. Again, I just give this structure that you're near some ultra-static manifold. Then the key observation that we have is the And the key observation that we have is the following. The key observation is that there is a conformal scale. Okay, I should have said this. Pseudoconvexity is conformally invariant. As you can see, I mean, non-geodels remain non-geodes in the conformally scaled metric. The story is that we can find a conformal factor such that this weird curvature condition is satisfied for the conformally scaled metric. This refers to the curvature tensor for the conformally scaled metric. Conformally a scale metric G hat acting on null vectors and a space-like vectors where the null and a space-like vectors must be orthogonal. This curvature condition will always be negative. If you are near this kind of ultra static matrix, there is always... So even if you're Minkowski, you can find some conformal factor that will make this true. Then what you do is you go to that scaled metric and you take the Scaled metric, and we take the distance functions to the tip for that conformally a scaled metric. That's the right choice. That's the function whose level sets will be superconvex. This curvature condition just somehow comes from the fact that the level sets of the distance function solve a Riccati equation, and this Kirvati condition with this precise form appears in the Ricotti equation. And that must have a good sign. So does the so in the theorem there was a condition on the sectional curvature, right? Yes. Does that somehow contribute to the sort of convexity of these surfaces? Yeah, precisely. So the point is that so for instance, let me give you a picture in Minkowski again. In Minkowski, you have zero curvature, so this curvature condition, for instance, is just zero. So it is somehow believed. So it is somehow believable that maybe if I do a conformal scaling, I can make this slightly negative. That's somehow the intuition. Whereas if this was to begin with something positive, other two things that you can perturb it. But that's a sort of question that we are at the moment thinking on, about removing this uh being near ultra static manifolds, let's say, or this kind of curvature conditions. It's kind of curvature conditions. Work in progress. So we kind of have a picture of what's the optimal geometric conditions, let's say, but we just need to prove. So how about if you are not close to an ultrostatic manifold of this type, but you have this more general Lorentzia manifold curves about that you had in your paper? So is the proof similar or? It is, it is similar. Or it is, it is similar. So the the the conditions that we impose in in in our papers is that this curvature tensor R N D and D must be less than or equal to zero. That's the curvature bound at the most, right? So that does not mean that you are near ultra static in the system. So if that is less than or equal to zero, if you have a manifold with that curvature condition, then we can even perturb those geometries and solve the problem. Solves the problem. Just thank all the game. The sectional code is quite a bit of a single direction. Yeah. We can just continue. Yeah. Okay. So next speaker is Johannes Guillermo Hiruta from University of US.
