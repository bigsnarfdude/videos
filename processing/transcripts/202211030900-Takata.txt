Morning sessions. The first speaker in the morning session is Dr. Iguru Takaka, and he will talk about a kinetic model for the phase transition and its numerical seminars. Now it's your turn. Okay, thank you. Hello, everybody. I'm Shigeru Takata from Kyoto University, Japan. From Kyoto University, Japan. I will talk about a kinetic module for the phase transition and its numerical simulation. The contents of my talk is as follows. I first introduce some background and my motivation, and then I propose a minimum model to realize phase transition under the Phase transition under the isosomer approximation, and I talk, I will talk about the balance law and the static pressure, internal energy, and so on, and then move on the HDRM of the proposed model. And after proposed dimensionless description, I talk about some continuum limit. It is a Kahn-Heliers type equation in impact, and then show some. And then show some numerical simulation results and conclude my talk. So, okay, first, let me start show some background and my motivation. In the kinetic theory community, the evaporation and concentration from the liquid phase into the gas phase was one of the major topics, and it has a long history. And it has a long history, and the accumulation of the important results is good enough. But traditionally, the people essentially interested in the gas peroxide, assuming the liquid state is fixed or given. So, but recently, many people Many people are more interested in the simultaneous simulation or description of the gas and the lake phase. Those people are using the full or hybrid molecular dynamic simulation or sometimes kinetic equation of gas and leakist based on the ENSCOC or ENSCOC-VLASOF equation. Equation. These are the examples of such type of research. The aim of the present study is to propose a simple kinetic description and try to find a minimum setting for reproducing the phase transition. So, the fact that we propose is a very simple one. Okay, this is a system that we want to propose. This is a minimal setting in the sense that we have a very simplified collision integral, which is a relaxation term towards a given Max variant characterized by a given temperature and lasting Max variant. Testing max area. And okay, and F is the first term, which is a potential type. This potential type is decomposed into the short-range part and the long-range part. And here we essentially short-range interaction as a Interaction as a localized effect and the correcting long-range interaction is treated in this part like a browser thumb. So more precisely, we introduce a potential into two parts. The long-range part is just the browser type correct. Type collective interaction attractive potential and I artificially subtract and add the same amount, then compose this part into the large long-range interaction and the rest. And the resting part, this is an attractive one, but it is local, it acts on the local density. And this is combined with a repulsive local interaction and make the short-range interaction. So, the origin of the long-range potential is clear because it is directly related to the atmosphere. Dated the attractive intermolecular potential, but in that way, we defined the short-range potential for S. Here, by the way, the long-range potential, if you introduce a moderate change of the density in the scale, in the usual scale. Then, because C is an intermolecular potential, it is effective only a short range. So, therefore, this part can be approximated by the Laplacian of the density because we use simply the Taylor expansion of the density. Of the density around the position of interest, of your interest. So, this is in this way you recover the typical interface energy, interface energy expression, mostly used in the hydrodynamic equation. Then, how about the short-range one? We will determine this form. We will determine this form with the aid of the balance log momentum. So here I show only the result of the balance equation and collective interaction potential force potential. These two equations are readily obtained from the kinetic model by the usual standard technique, standard integration. Integration. Then, this is a continuum equation. This is a momentum equation. Here, you have a potential part. And as I mentioned before, phi is decomposed into two parts. And the form of phi L is already fixed. So this part, because phi is assumed, depends on Assumed depend on density only. So, this part can be transformed into the gradient form. So, therefore, this part can be moved into the gradient part of this momentum equation. So, you have here the combination of the usual kinetic. The combination of the usual kinetic stress tensor plus this additional effect as a local force. So this corresponds to the stress tensor in our module. Okay, so therefore, in addition to the usual kinetic pressure, static pressure, we have a Static pressure, we have additional part for the pressure. And because of the usual definition of this one to the internal energy, this part is rho times RT plus this part. So if we consider the foundry was fluid, the dense gas. Gas, then we have this form of equation of state. So, from this correspondence, we can identify the form of this phi S. In fact, this relation is used under this summary approximation: T is nearly equal to T sub T star. T sub t star so from this one we recover we obtained the form of phi s in this way we determine the phi l and also phi s so that we now the kinetic module is now closed. So there are some tips to define the internal energy and specific Specific entropy, but I skip this one and then move to deriving the H-theorem and its relation to the Helmholtz free energy in this model. So here, because this collision integral is a relaxation to the given Max variant. To the given max variant, resting Max variant with a given temperature. This is a system not conserving energy and momentum, but the system is kept at a uniform temperature, roughly speaking. Therefore, Therefore, the minimizer of this problem is not the entropy, but the Helmholtz free energy in thermodynamics. More precisely, if you introduce the relative entropy relative to the Relative to the Gibbon Max variant, then you can obtain the form you can get from this model equation to the equation, the system below. Okay. So then So then, so this is an equation at every point in space. So if you integrate this equation inequality over the periodic domain, we are considering now the periodic domain over the domain. And thanks to the then E of 10. Then you obtain that divergence, this divergence term disappears due to the periodic condition and the remaining external force term. Once you integrate this one, this can be imported to the time derivative of this quantity thanks to the mass conservation law. To the mass conservation law. Then you find the monotone decreasing function, capital M, I denote it, which monotonically decreasing in time. And the stationary state is established only when the distribution Below distribution function is a given max failure. The meaning of this capital M is clear. This because once F reaches a given Max variant, velocity is vanished and this part is also vanished. So it remains to the capital. The capital A plus this part. This capital A is the free energy defined by this quantity, Helmholtz free energy. So it means internal energy minus temperature times entropy. And the other blue part is the interface energy. Interface energy because and also it is interesting to see that this part when we use this approximation a Terra expansion with this approximation this can be converted to this Sorry, gradient, the square of the gradient of the density. This is a familiar form of interface energy in the hydrodynamics. So this is a system and HTRM that we obtained for the simple modeling. And once we introduce Introduce some dimensions qualities, then the system is as in the case of the Boltzmann equation. The system is characterized by the Strohar number and the Knussen number and the coefficient kappa in front of the Efficient kappa in front of the Laplacian of density and dimensionless B and A. This comes from the van der Waals equation of state. Non-dimensionalized parameters in that equation of state. And And so this one, two, three, four, five. Five characteristic parameters. But in fact, follows in numerical simulation, I just set Strohar number to one. So essentially, the problem is characterized by four parameters. And I mainly use C, which is a racial. C, which is the ratio of A to B in place of A. So the combination of Knussen number, kappa, C and V as a characteristic parameter. So then it is natural question what kind of macroscopic equation we obtain Frankness and number tends to zero so. So it is what I call the continuum limit. To obtain a proper continuum limit, it can be obtained by the so-called diffusive scaling. That is, if we set the Strohar number is the same order as the Knussen number. DC epsilon is the Knussen number. epsilon is a Knussen number so and taking the limit of epsilon tends to zero and by the standard procedure like the child mine scope or Hilbert expansion you will you obtain this type of equation for density and here you because phi l is approximated by the laplacian so this because of the existence of this part this equation is a conhelial type equation which is commonly used in the segregation or separation of the alloy for the derivative if you If you are interested in the further derivation of this continuum limit, please check my paper with Dr. Naguchi 2018. Okay, so because our interest is phase transition, so what we first did was to check the linear stability of the linear. The linear stability of the uniform equilibrium state. And it is also the very standard way to substitute this type of perturbation into the conheriate and check the condition that this. Condition that this the real part of the sigma is positive, then you obtain the this criteria. So this criteria is given by dashed line in this on the right map. And above this line, the state is unstable, uniform state is unstable. And there are also And there are also you need some other method to check the metastable state. Then here you have you can draw another curve which is called a binodal curve and below which the state is. Which the state is expected to stable. This is also done in our paper in 2018. So, and we also did some numerical computation in 1D preliminarily in these papers. In these papers, then we found that the parameter C, it controls the stability of a uniform state. And the parameter B controls which face has a larger volume of fraction. For larger V, dense phase, has a larger volume of fraction. Has a larger volume fraction and copper is this factor. This controls the thickness of the interface. For larger k, you have a thicker interface. And the Kunsten number seems not influential in quality. However, approach to the final Approach to the final equilibrium state seems slower for larger Knussy number. So, the rest of my talk, I will show you some result of two-dimensional simulation. For the case, the Kunus number is 0.1, and this ratio is 2.5 times n to the minus 4. We start the uniform state, uniform equilibrium state, but we give a sinusoidal disturbance of density in both x and y direction and compute under the period in the periodic square domain. Okay. And I will show from And I will show from now this point, this point, this point. The first one is this case. This case is enough above the stability line. You see that from at the beginning, by the way, I forget to explain it. This is a To explain it. This is a 2D density map. And this is a profile of density along this diagonal line. And this is a monotone function m during the time duration. So at the beginning, this m Decrease, then it reach it the decay is slower, then again it sharply drops and becomes reaches a stationary state. Sorry, I restart it again. So at the beginning. It again. So at the beginning, this change mainly is a creation of the interface. And again, here it is changed because you see this small dot, leakage drop, disappears at this timing. Timing. So, next simulation is just above the stability line. So, therefore, at the beginning, almost nothing happened at the beginning, and then suddenly liquid droplet appears. Droplet appears, then the monotone function decreases rapidly, then it is a stationary state. Then, next is a metastable case because this is a metastable case for usual with the case. With large disturbance, in fact, it is about 10% disturbance. The uniform state is unstable and changed to the two-phase state. But for the same position, but starting from a smaller disturbance. Monotone function decreases, decreases, decrease, tends to the stationary state, and the state becomes go back to the uniform state. So in that way, we succeeded to reproduce. To reproduce the phase transition by a very simple kinetic module. And okay, this I will stop here. Thank you for your kind attention. Okay, so any questions from the Zoom audience? So, any questions? I have a question. Oh, you have okay. So, yes. Yeah. Hi. I'm on YouTube. I'm on your Zoom, part of your Zoom audience. I was interested in knowing, it's very interesting talk. Thank you. So, you've done the stability analysis in order to figure out where the line is. Have you determined anything analytically about the shape of the stationary states that are non-uniform? I see that you're computing them. Do you have any uniform results? You mean the including the thickness of the interface? Yeah, so I think what you've shown numerically is that you get droplets forming. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, do you have anything about? Okay, so let me say that although I show you the movie, it is a time evolution of the kantic solving the kantic equation. Solving the kinetic equation. But in fact, if you are interested in the final two phase state, you do not have to pursue the time evolution and you can, in some sense, simplify very simple equation you need to solve, but it is. You need to solve, but it is, you need numerical computation, but it is a very simple one. And if you are interested in that part, please check this our paper, which was published in 2018 in Physical Review E. Okay. Here we discuss. Here we discuss this part. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Very simple relation we actually solved. Yeah. Okay. That's great. That's that answers my question. Thank you so much. Yeah, welcome. Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Dr. Takata. So because we have time limits, so if you have any questions, you can communicate with Dr. Takata and afterwards. So we have to go to the next talk. To go to the next talk. Thank you. Thank you very much.
