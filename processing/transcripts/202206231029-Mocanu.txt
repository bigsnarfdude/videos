Uh thank you very much and uh thank you for the organizers for putting together such a nice conference. Uh I want to say that this is roughly the first time I do a talk on my own work so sorry if I'm in advance and a little bit nervous. But yeah, so to get us started, yeah, so my talk has a little bit of overlap with Felipe's talk from Overlap with Philippe's talk from last week. So I'm going to present a bit the modularity approach and then I'm going to show how to use it in the context of totally real number fields. And then I'm going to give an example for an equation with signature PP2. But to start with, the generalized Fermi equation looks like this. So it's x to the p plus y to the q equals z to the r, where p q and r are some exponents greater than two. Are some exponents greater than 2. And so we have this conjecture which we've already seen. And as Felipe has said, it has various names in the literature. I said here Ferma Catalan, but don't stick with that. So it says that over all choices of prime exponents PQR, which satisfy this inequality here, so This inequality here, so the sum of the inverses is strictly less than one. This equation admits only finitely many integer solutions, which are non-trivial, so none of them is zero, and coprime, meaning that their greatest common divisor is one. And here there is a comment about the fact that we don't double count solutions. And it is well known that this is a consequence of the ABC conjecture. And we also have a partial result. And we also have a partial result towards the conjecture, which is a theorem due to Darman and Gramville, which says that if we moreover fix these prime exponents with the same inequality holding, then there are only finitely many co-prime solutions to the equation. And this theorem can also be easily extended to co-prime solutions in any fixed number field. Okay. Okay, so just a little bit of notation. I already used this word today, but also Philippe defined this. It's the triple of exponents, we call it the signature of the equation. So, for example, these are some families of signatures that have been solved, a lot of them by people in this audience, but this is an incomplete family, of course. So, for example, if we have So, for example, if we have PQ and R, so signature N and N corresponds to the Fermi equation, Darman and Merrell and Punen proved that there are no co-prime solutions for NN2 and NN3. So from a result of Krauss, it follows very easily that there are no coprime solutions to non-trivial co-prime solutions to this signature. Bennett, look at twenty five. Look at 2N2N5. Samuel and Samir looked at recently at 2L2MP with these P's, and all of them, as you can see, have some constraints on the exponents. And this is what Filippa's talk was about, was about 2 to L3P, where L is greater than a constant depending on your P. So just to Just to make sure that the setup is very clear, from now on the talk is going to be about instead of working on the rationals, we're going to work over a totally real number field. And we look at the same equation, at the generalized Ferma equation, and we are interested in solutions, ABC. So in particular, we want to show there are no solutions, but I'm going to denote it by ABC, and there are solutions in the ring. And their solutions in the ring of integers, okay, which are non-trivial and co-prime in the sense that the ideals are prime. And now I'm going to give, I know this might be a bit elementary for some of you, but I'm going to look again at the sketch of modularity method. And on the left, I'm going to present the origins of modularity method, so Fermalis theorem over the rationals. And on the right, I'm going to explain very And on the right, I'm going to explain very briefly how what I'm going to use on a totally real number field. So I'm going to break it in five steps, as you've already seen in Philippe's talk. So the first step is selecting a Frey curve. And so in the Fermalas theorem, you probably have seen already that if we have, suppose we have a positive solution to the Fermalas theorem, we construct the following. Theorem: We construct the following Freight curve, which I written here. So, in this talk, I'm gonna always consider the mod P representation of the elliptic curves, which shows how the absolute Galois group acts on the P torsion points of B. And I'm gonna call this Artine conductor. I'm just gonna denote it Artine conductor, but I refer to the Artine conductor. Uh so Zoro, you look mute yourself. No, no, no, that's that that's one of the different uh parallels. Shall I try to go ahead? Okay, so yeah, I was just making this kind of point that I'm using art and conductor to mean the article conductor of the mod P colour representation. And in this case, Color representation. And in this case, it can be computed to be 2, as we probably all have seen before. And then, so I'm going to call the step more generally, selecting a Fry curve. So more generally means in the generalized form equation over a totally real number field. So if I let ABC be a solution, the Fry curve, which depends on A, B, and C defined over the totally real field K and has to have the property that the And has to have the property that the artin conductor is bounded independently of the solution. So, in my talk, everything is gonna all of the artin conductors are just gonna be constants. Okay, the next step, the famous step, which Wilts proves the modularity. So, I put here in parentheses, so Wils proved the modularity of semi-stable elliptic curves, but later on it was proved for all elliptic curves over the rationals. In our case, In our case, modularity, which we can treat it a bit as a black box for today, but I just wrote here for completion that it means that there exists a Hilbert new form f over k which has priority 2 and here and rational Heke eigenvalues such that the L function correspond of E is the same as the L function of the Hilbert. Of the Hilbert new form. And in the results which I'm going to show later on, we use this result by Freitas, Hang, and Samir, which prove the modularity of elliptic curves over totally real fields up to a finite number of exceptions. But in the case of quadratic fields and cubic fields, this is an unconditional result, so without this finite number of exceptions. Okay, so first two steps. The third step. First, two steps. The third step is meant to allow us to use this level lowering theorems. So this is actually the theorem which Barrinder very nicely explained in his talk in the first day. So the representation associated to E of P is irreducible by a theorem due to Maser. So this is a theorem which says that it has no P isogeny. Says that it has no p-isogenies. So, this is the theorem which we've seen already. And in the more general case of a totally real number field, the reducibility that I'm going to use comes from a result of Samir and Anna Freitas that proved irreducibility for elliptic curves with some local condition. But we can get over this local condition by taking P large enough. I'm going to discuss. Large enough. I'm going to discuss more in more detail later on about this. So we're ready for the fourth step, which is in the case of Fermat's theorem the famous theorem of Rebet, of level lowering, which says that to our Fry curve corresponds a new form at this really nice level, at the R Tino conductor level, and which has weight two. Which has weight two. And in the more general case, again, I'm going to use this theorem from Samir's and Nunoz's paper, which is a level-lowering theorem, which says that we, so the representation corresponding to the elliptic curve 1 p, is isomorphic to the representation coming from a Hilbert new form over a. Form over K, which has parallel weight 2, and the level equals the article conductor of E. So everything goes really nicely up to this step. So the next step is something which in general is really, really challenging. But in the case of Fermala's theorem, it was quite easy to eliminate this this new form. Eliminate this new form at the predicted level of 2 because there's simply no new forms at this level. So here we get the contradiction, but more generally this elimination step is not very easy. So the rest of the talk I'm going to focus on this elimination step for signature PP two. But first I just wanted to this is a a bit of an introduction slide. of an introduction slide technical stuff. So actually you you can remember this by smile, which was Philippe's idea in his talk. Just to summarize, first you assume you have a solution, you select a cry curve, use modularity and irreducibility to get a level lowered sorry to get a new form at at a level which is lower. Level which is lower than what we started with, and then we eliminate the new forms. Okay, so I'm gonna start talking about this step five, so the elimination step. So because I started with Fermala Stural and I kept on mentioning Samir's and Nuno's paper, I'm just gonna give firstly the example in their paper and then using the same. And then using the same methods as they did sorry using the same methods as they did in their paper, I applied in my paper for signature PP2. So how it works for Fermala's theorem. So we want to show that this has no solutions. For the purpose of this talk, I'm going to assume them to be co-prime and non-trivial to get rid of some technicality. To get rid of some technicalities. And if we employ the first four steps in the modularity method, we get a phry elliptic curve E over K, which gives rise to a Hilbert new form F at this level curly and P, which is here are only primes above 2 at some exponents depending on the prime. And the exponent can go up to 2 plus 6 valuation at my prime at 2. Prime at h2. So this is not very important, but the important part is that this can get a bit obviously bigger than 2, and in general, we can find new forms at this level. So we cannot do the elimination step as easy as before. And what Nuna and Samir did in their paper is they use here, so they use So, they used something about the image of inertia of the representation of the elliptic curve. They also used a result which is a partial theorem to the Eichener-Shimura conjecture. And then they ended up with the study of some S-unit equations, which gave them the desired contradiction. So, I'm going to talk in more detail about this in the following slides. Okay. So the kind of results that we get in this setup of totally real number fields are a bit weaker than on the rationals, in the sense that we get something called asymptotic results. And by asymptotic, I mean that, so for example, in the case of Fermala's theorem, we say that the asymptotic Fermala's theorem holds for our equation if there is some. For our equation, if there is some bound depending only on the field k, such that for all p's greater than this bound, the equation has no non-trivial solutions. This bound is in general effectively computable and is very much contains a lot of the terms in the bound that Philip explained in his talk. So it can be very, very large. But I'm not going to focus too much on computations on this one. Too much on computations on this balance today, but it's important to know that we can compute it. And so this is one of the theorems that resulted from their paper. The main theory is much more technical and applies also for fields of greater degree, but this is just a bit of a glimpse of a bit of a motivation, maybe, for why we would like to use this method of. Like to use this method of inertia comparison, Ekler-Shimura, and S-unit equations. So, okay, their theorem says that if we have, so one of their theorems, if we have D to be a square free integer greater than 2, which is congruent with 3 modulo 8, then the effective asymptotic Fermalis theorem holds over this field, q adjoint square root of t. Effective here means that this bound is effectively computable. Bound is effectively copyrightable. Yes, so are there any questions? Okay. So I'll get to the part of the talk where I present my work. So first of all, this is something Ishikara and Eki Nosman work. Ishik Kara and Eki Nosman worked on, and they looked at the equation xp plus yp equals z squared over totally real number fields, and they applied the method in Samir and Nano's paper. And what we did, we improved a little bit their result, and we also applied the same method on signature PP3. For the sake of today, I'm only gonna present signature PP2, but every Present signature BP2, but everything which I'm going to say from now on applies exactly the same for signature BP3. So the main result looks a little bit technical and there are a few comments which I'm going to make about it, but I'm just going to read it first. So K is a totally real number field. We have this condition on the class number, so two does not divide the class number K and we denote by S all of the primes above two. By s all of the primes above 2. Why? Because we want to talk about S unit equations. And then we have a condition on some equation involving S units. And subject to this condition, we can show an asymptotic result for AP plus BP equals C squared. So what is the condition? The condition is that if there exists some distinguished prime, If there exists some distinguished prime in this set, so a distinguished prime above two, such that for every solution to this equation here, alpha plus beta equals gamma squared, where alpha and beta are some s units and gamma can be just an S integer, which satisfy this local condition. So the valuation of this distinguished prime at the ratio alpha over beta is less or equal to 6, the valuation of equal to 6 evaluation of the same prime at 2. So if this condition holds, then there is a constant pk, which depends on Lk, such that for any rational prime p greater than this constant, our equation has no prime non-trivial solutions with the distinguished prime dividing p. So this is a bit of a weaker result, which says that there are no solutions of this specific form. One comment on One comment about this condition here is that this alpha over beta is actually a computable quantity and it takes only finitely many values. So this comes from the study of S2 unit equations, which I'm going to talk about in the end of the talk. But the idea is that there is actually an algorithm in Sage which can compute this, and then we can explicitly compute this. But what we saw Compute this, but what we sometimes like to do is to not compute them and just say things about the solutions of this equation. So, for example, if d is greater than 5 and is a rational prime which satisfies 5, is congruent with 5 modulo 8, and we look at this field q adjoint, so at a quadratic field, q adjoint square root of d, then there is a constant decay such that for each rational prime greater than this. Rational prime greater than this constant, our equation has no coprime, non-trivial solutions in the ring of integers with 2 dividing b. So in this case, we could actually compute all of them. They're trivial in some sense. So we can compute all of these solutions by knowing some local information about these nice quadratic fields. So also note. So also note that in here 2 is inert. So this is why the only distinguished prime that I can take is 2 itself. And also because this is a rational prime, I have this condition on the class number. So 2 does not divide the class number here. Okay, so I'm going to try to go a little bit in the main ideas of the main proof. Of the main proof. Are there any questions about this? Yes. What about D equals 5? What about D equals 5? I actually don't know. I don't know. I'm going to come back to you on this one. I'm not sure right now. Yeah. Okay. I had a question. Okay. I had a question. Is the fry in in the S step of SMILE, do you use the the usual fry uh curve over Q for PP2? Is that the fry curve that you use? Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm actually the fry curve, I think, it's on the next slide. Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, it's the usual fry curve, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So yeah, so this is a natural question to go to the proof of this. So it's a proof by contradiction. We suppose we have a non-trivial co-prime solution, such that this holds. And suppose we have this distinguished prime such that above 2, such that p Above 2, 5, this distinguished by P, tilde divides B. And then we employ the modularity method. The first step, we consider the try curve corresponding to ABC, which is the one someone asked on Zoom. So it's the usual one. But here we view it over the total real number here K. And then we can compute its artin conductor to be so. Be so it's very similar to what I've already shown. It only has primes above 2, so remember S are the primes above 2. And we also know something about the exponents, so we know this inequality about the exponents of the primes. Okay, so next, the reducibility step is the one which follows from this theorem, but with the mention that But with the mention that this theorem had some local constraints, and we can get over these local constraints by possibly enlarging the bound BK. Okay, so the next steps are steps two and four, that we have Hilbert-Eigen form F of parallel grade two that is new at level equaling the art and conductor of the curve, and there is some prime in. This is the field which contains the eigenvalues of f. So this is a prime above p in this field. And okay, so sorry, so we have this Hilbert-Egan form that respects this, so the isomorphism of the curve and the curve at P is isomorphic to the representation. The representation corresponding to the Leaky curve is isomorphic to the representation corresponding to the Hilbert-Eganiform mod P. And here, so this is, I'm actually very lucky that Philip already went through all of these very ugly bounds. So after enlarging this bound BK, we can actually assume that this field, so all of the eigenvalues of F are rational. Because if they won't, Because if they want, we would have that the exponent p divides some constant. So we can just take p to be greater than that. And yeah, so in particular, this prime here is just p. Okay, so these are the first four steps. And so we want to tackle now the elimination step. So we cannot get rid of the sorry, we cannot get rid of Rid of the, sorry, we cannot get rid of the new forms at this level, so we are going to employ Samir Enano's technique. So I think most of you know the Eicher-Schumoura conjecture, which says that if k is a totally real number field and curly F is a Hilbert new form of level n, parallel negative 2, which has rational eigenvalues, then we have an elliptic curve which corresponds to f that has equal equals equal to corresponds to F that has conductor N having the same L function as F. So we don't have this conjecture, but we have a partial result of this conjecture which is done in the same paper of Nunaye and Samir which says that so which gives us in this specific case an elliptic curve which I denoted E prime over K such that all Such that all of these representations are isomorphic under the P. So we already knew that the representation corresponding to E is isomorphic to the representation corresponding to the new form, but then we also get this third representation here corresponding to my E prime. And we also know that it has conductor equal to the conductor of the Hilbert New form, which is, in this case, NP, which was the art and conductor of the Freiker B. Okay, so going on, we're gonna get this elimination step by saying things about this E prime, so by studying E prime. So just for a little recap, we assume we have a solution, we got a Free elliptic curve, we got a corresponding Hilbert new form, and then we got a corresponding elliptic curve E prime, which is elliptic curve B prime, which is different from the starting elliptic curve. And now we are going to look at this new elliptic curve B prime and we're going to try to find a contradiction. So what can we say about it? So we've already seen that the representations are the same. We can say that E' has good reduction outside S. This is because E' has the conductor N P. Conductor NP and NP, if you remember, only had primes inside S. And we can also assume, I'm not going to go too much into detail of this, but because maybe I should have mentioned this. So the phry elliptic curve has a two torsion point. I forgot to mention this. So it has 0, 0 is a two torsion point over k. So because of this, after a little bit Because of this, after a little bit of more technical work, so after possibly enlarging the bound BK or replacing E' by a two isogenous curve, we can assume that E prime has a k rational point of order 2. And then the last thing which we know about E prime, or which is useful for us about E prime, is that it. us about E prime is that it has potentially multiplicative reduction at this special prime special prime p tilde and this is after possibly enlarging our constant our bound on p okay so I'm gonna talk a little bit about this this step here because it's it's it's not it's not obvious so so this is the step so it has potential multiplicative reduction at PTL to Of duplicative reduction at PT yield, which is the same as the valuation at G invariant being strictly less than zero. So what I'm going to use to prove this is something about images of inertia. So I'm going to use this lemma. So this lemma is for any elliptic curve over k with gene variant. k with gene variant ge and if we let p greater or equal to 5 and then we let we let a prime which does not divide p prime of k and then we have this equivalence so p divides the order of the image of inertia of the Galois representation on Le P if and only if E has potentially multiplicative reduction at this prime. Reduction at this prime, and P does not divide this valuation, the valuation of the prime Q at the G invariant of P. So this uses the study of the Tate curve, but I'm not going to go into detail of the proof of this. It can be found in this paper which I keep on referring to of Samir and Nana. But I'm going to show a little bit how to use this tool for our curve. For our curve. So remember the Phryllipti curve looks like this. And you have to believe me that if I compute its G invariant, it looks like this. Okay, so what I'm going to do, I'm going to use this if and only if, because I know that the representations of E and E prime are the same, so I can correlate with this bit. So E has potential. E has potentially multiplicative reduction at this prime p tilde. You can just look at the valuation here and remember that p tilde divides b and a and b are co-prime. So just by, you can do this very easily, you can see that the valuation is smaller than zero. And if we make p large enough, so here there is also another possibility of enlarging the Another possibility of enlarging the constant by an effective amount, we can also show that P does not divide this valuation. So, this implies that E, the Fry curve, respects this here. So, P does divide the order of the image of inertia of the Fry curve. Well, they have the same representation, the Phryg curve and E prime. So, this also holds for E prime. Well, then. Holds for E'. Well, then it means that, so it's an if and only if, that E prime has potentially multiplicative reduction at the speed yield. So we're going to use all of the information we have about E' right now. So sorry, can I quickly ask how much time is it? We have quite a bit of time in our essential Tenden okay. Okay, so ten ten more minutes. Okay. Oh, sorry, fifteen more minutes. Sorry, so sorry. Oh, sorry, 50 more minutes. Sorry, so sorry. Okay. Okay, so how do we get? So I told you about some S units, right? So how do we get from the elliptic curves to the S units? So we have an elliptic curve, so we have this elliptic curve E prime over K, and we know that it has a K rational point of order 2. So we know that all of the So we know that all of the elliptic curves with the k-rational point of order 2 have this model here. So e prime is y squared equal x cubed plus a prime x squared plus b prime x for some a prime and b prime. And then we can compute the gene invariant to be this quantity, so 2 to the 8 a prime squared minus a prime squared minus 3v prime q and then this b prime squared times a prime squared minus 4v prime and then we're trying to see what kind of information we we have from from from our elliptic curve so we knew it had good reduction outside s so in particular this implies that the gene invariant of e prime G invariant of E prime is in the S integers of our number field. Well, this is because good reduction outside S means that if I take a prime in S and I look at the valuation of that prime at the gene invariant, this has to be greater or equal to zero. So this happens for any prime outside S. So in other words, I'm only allowed to have numerators in primes above two. Prime subjects. And then I'm just going to take a little bit of pictures. So then, so we knew also that we have potentially multiplicative reduction at P tilde. This came from the inertia argument, image of inertia argument. So this is if and only if the valuation of the prime at the G invariant of P prime. Of the prime and the gene invariant of B prime is less than zero. So from now on, we're only gonna, so what's gonna happen from now on, we're gonna kind of try to parametrize these curves in a pretty elementary way without thinking of any sort of modular curves or anything like that. So we are gonna try to parametrize the gene invariant in an elementary way as follows. So, yeah, this is the expression. And so we parametrize it by taking lambda to be this a prime squared over b prime and mu to be lambda minus 4. So yeah, maybe I should have written here. So if I divide all of this by b prime to the 6, I'm going to get an expression of the j-invariant in terms of lambda and mu. And by this expression and the fact that And by this expression and the fact that the G invariant is an S integer, I can deduce that this mu, so this mu has an expression in terms of A prime and B prime and some other numbers. So we can deduce that a mu is an S unit. And then by doing the same thing, so looking again at the fact that this is an S. Again, the fact that this is an S integer, we can also deduce something a bit weaker about lambda. So we also use here this condition on class number. And then with some technical work on how the prime ideas behave, we get that lambda is u ness unit times gamma squared, where gamma is just an integer. Okay, so how are we gonna So, how are we going to use this? Well, if I rewrite this thing here as mu plus 4 equals lambda, and then I divide everything by this unit here, u, I'm going to have mu over u plus 4 over u equals lambda over, equals gamma squared, sorry. And remember, because mu over u is going to be a unit, because mu is a unit, u is a unit, 4 over u is an s unit because we are talking four is an s unit. We are talking four is a nice unit, it's it's a it's it has only factors of two, and then I'm gonna have here the gamma square. So, this is where this uh mysterious equation in our in the statement of the theorem comes from. So, this alpha plus beta equals gamma squared, so alpha plus beta is just after I divided everything by u here, with alpha and beta being is units. Okay, and Okay, and uh we we had this local condition right on on on the solution. So the local condition said that the norm, the val uh norm, the absolute value of the valuation at p tild at alpha over beta is less or equal to six the valuation of p tilde of two. And if I try to write, I can write the gene invariant in terms of this alpha and beta, and I can alpha and beta, and I can just translate this condition in a statement about the valuation of the p-tield of the g invariant. And this condition gives me that the valuation of p-tield at the g invariant is greater or equal to zero, which contradicts this statement, right? Contradicts the fact that we have potentially multiplicative reduction at this prime. So maybe this is a reason why we need it at This is a reason why we need it, and we get a bit of a weak result that we had no solutions with this prime tie dividing B. So we needed this mysterious prime B tie to get a contradiction. So we needed it to have this sort of inequality on the gene variant. Okay, are there any questions about this? Do you need this condition? Because potentially multiplicative reduction came from the fact that the elliptic curve had potentially multiplicative reduction, and this was because the J invariant looked like this, and P tilde divided B and the cochromium P A and B are cochai. A and BR cocaine. So, this has potential multiplicative reduction, and by this, also, the EPRIN has it. Yeah. So, yeah. Are there any other questions or comments? I'm just wondering how essential the requirement of the class number beyond is. It seems like you're not maybe using it in just one situation, but I'm wondering if there's any way to get around that. Yeah, so because I wanted to have this nice thing here, alpha plus beta equals gamma squared, but if you don't assume this, you're gonna have here just like, you're just gonna have alpha plus beta, you're just gonna have maybe mu plus 4 equals lambda, where mu is an S unit and lambda is an S integer. So you probably want to study these equations and see what happens. But I wanted to assume this so I can have here a unit. This, so I can have here a unit because I know how to. The next slide, I'm going to study this equation. So I know how to look at unit plus unit equals a square. Yeah. Yeah, it definitely makes life a lot simpler. I was just wondering if it's necessary. Can't you just enlarge S a bit to kill the class number? Sorry. Can you just, I mean, of course, you have a very specific S in mind, but can't you just enlarge S by a little bit, a little bit, so to speak, to kill the class number? In other words, it could be less than. In other words, who S? Yes. So you're saying to okay, to build up last number? I think, yeah, I think there might be an option. Yeah. I I haven't thought too much about it, but uh yeah. But get more solutions to this to this equation and then you have to check it. then you have to check that the condition is still satisfied for the initial solution. Yeah, but you you can still compute the solutions. Like this uh there are even in SAGE you can compute the solutions. Probably. Yeah, so maybe this is okay maybe some of the conditions here just make things more simpler, especially in these computations here. But I'm sure there can be some generalizations. Yeah. You already had some questions. Can you share it? Yeah, I'm I'm okay. Take your time. So, one more minute? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Sorry. I thought I had too much time at some point. Sorry. And I went a bit slower. Yeah. So this was what we were talking about. So we know these terms by many people. I only mentioned three of them here, but we know that. Here, but we know that if we have a number field and a finite set of primes, we know that this solution when x and y are S units has finitely many solutions. And there is an S unit solder in Sage implemented by these people, and Benjamin Macchev has, I'm not sure how to pronounce his last name, but has another private S-Unit solver. And yes, so I just wanted to. And yes, so I just wanted to briefly briefly show why from this result it follows that it follows that this equation has finitely many solutions. Sorry, not this equation. The ratio alpha plus beta is going to give me a finite number of values. So this is because this equation in fact has finitely many solutions up to this very natural scaling action. So the scaling action is just So the scaling action is just if I have two solutions and I multiply the first two things by delta squared of a unit and then the last one by just the unit itself, then we can show by a pretty nice argument, but maybe I'm going to stop here, that this equation has a finite number of solutions up to this equivalence. So I'm going to stop here, but yeah. Thank you very much. Wonderful. Are there any other questions? So you mentioned you had some results for signature PP3. So if I remember correctly, like we don't have a solution to that, or or we can solve that. So do you also kind of have a local condition of like P or something like that? On like video or something like that? If so, what is it? So I think we solved it on the rationales by Darman, Merrell and Punan. And so how it looks like for totally real number fields. So for the rationalist solves, I think I put an example for n greater than 4, something like this. Maybe I mixed up my signatures, but either way. It's now other than 3. I think. Ah, okay, but either way. Ah, oh, okay, but either way, do you have some local condition on the solutions there as well? Yes, yeah. So the theorem there, so basically it's always replacing all of the twos with trees and everything works the same. So this is a tree here, a tree here. So I'm going to look at S unit plus S unit equals a cube. And here is going to be something like 3 evaluation of Pt on the tree. And here I'm going to have the distinguished prime. I'm going to have the distinguished prime above 3 and it's not dividing B. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think this is. And the phry elliptic curve has a 3 torsion point, so everything works the same. Yeah, yeah, excellent. Wondering about this other elliptic term, E prime. So this came from this partial result of Indian Raj. So what property does, yeah, I was wondering why, where does that come from? Where does that come from? What property does E' have that E doesn't? Oh, so what allows me to apply this partial result, right? So kind of this theorem here. I don't know. It has the right item kind of goes easy, it's how it does it. You manage to give it another new form and then you want it to say there's also curves associated with that new form. I'll watch all of you. I did hear all of the conversation there, but it seems like it started out. All right, any Zoom questions? Regarding the question of P equals 5 in your second theorem? Yeah, everyone asks about that, right? I don't remember what I think I don't know why I took D greater than 5. There's some problems over Q5. So I think, so honestly, I think it was easier for me. So, honestly, I think it was easier for me to look at this S-unit equation when D was not 5. I think that the S-unit equation had a bit more solutions when it was Q square root of 5. Yeah, it's a miracle. Can I suggest? I think it's because 1 plus root 5 over 2 is easy added to 1 minus root 5 over 2. You get one, which is a square. So it the criterion is not satisfied. So let's thank the speaker again. Let's start again at 25 after. You mentioned something like Grampy's Darmone film? Because I thought you could show theorem? So you put in the symbol and you have the unit as unit equals square. You can look at the unit modulo and you get coefficient and cubes. Coefficient and cubes. Maybe 50 power. So first meet of the basic one. No, no, no. And only for those of us who use models which I don't know. So basically one of the five and so how is this? Because these are images. Yes, yes. So can you stay with the path? Okay, I don't know why this is so cool. I didn't know. But then you can find it and she said that this is from Grandma? Oh yeah, okay, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean. So my thing was a bit more. Yeah, so that really yes. Do you want to make sure? Of course, 59%. So I just wrote this. I just wrote it. So I just feel like I'm not sure. So this is our S termination.
