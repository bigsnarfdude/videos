Oh, you see everything? Okay, hi. So I'm going to talk about dislocations and disclinations in two and three dimensions, like it says. And I'm showing you a picture here of pyrals. Pyrals was trying to understand how it's possible to shear a crystal. You shear a crystal, right? When you shear a crystal, you might think, oh, well, there's, you know, there's like a mole of atoms, right? At least a mole, right? On each. Least a mole, right, on each on a surface, and you try to pull it, you have to break all those bonds all at once. You know, so a mole times an electron volt is a really big number, okay? So, how do you do that, right? And the and we know the answer, right? The answer is we do it like this, right? We move one row at a time, right? I mean, only, only, I mean, I'm sure you could be a wackadoodle and like go back to here and try to crank all of them at once, right? But, you know, you don't have to, all right? But you don't have to. And that's how you do it. And so here's a much more boring, atomistic version of it. You move it one at a time, you have dislocations. And this dislocation goes across. And that way, it's the same thing as the principle of the lever, right? Which is you end up exerting the same energy, but smaller forces. The picture is just looking at just me, so I better stand back here. Okay. Okay, fine. Okay, fine. Let's do anything. Okay, so let's warm up. Okay? And I know this warm-up doesn't seem like it has to do with anything, but let me remind you that every polynomial has a root in the complex point. It's a fact. Okay? And how do you prove that? So you start with your polynomial, and then you do the best thing. Here's the polynomial, nth-degree polynomial. You assume that it has no roots. Assume there are no zeros. Assume there are no zeros. If you can do that, then you can make this function, which is the function divided by its magnitude, which never has no problem. The magnitude is great. And then what you do is you say, oh, but if I go out to a circle far enough out, then this function just becomes e to the i n theta, right, where theta is the angle. And then you can calculate the winding and the winding around 2 pi n, right? The phase goes around by 2 pi n. But then you can take the circle and shrink it, right? The circle and shrink it, right? And you shrink the circle back to nothing. And if you can shrink it to nothing, the function's a constant. P of z is a constant. P of zero is a constant. No winding, right? And if there's no winding, there's a contradiction. So what was wrong? I forgot. I was wrong when I assumed that it didn't have any zeros. Okay? And in condensed matter physics, people make a big deal about, here's the quantum Hall effect. Uh, here's the quantum Hall effect, you know, it's famous, right? And they and they say, here's the Hamiltonian, k is the wave vector of the band, it's band theory. So there's the identity, it's a two by two Hamiltonian, right? So it has the conductance band, the conductance band, and the valence band, right? There's the one that goes, there's the one that's that there's one band that's unoccupied, one band that's occupied. And the whole trick to get something to move is that. To get something to move is that you have to. That picture's too big of me. You can't see my screen. If you put up more on the slide, the picture of you gets smaller. Brandy, why don't you turn off this monitor? Yeah, it's distracting me. No, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm dead. I'm going to sit in the funny zone. So, here we go. So, here you have a 2x2 matrix. To get conduction, you have to have the two bands come together. Have the two bands come together. There has to be a removal of a gap. But if you assume there's a gap, right, then these are the Pauli matrices, then that means that D is never zero. So in other words, you take your Hamiltonian, it's a Hermitian matrix, a 2 by 2 Hermitian matrix. Part of it is the identity. That part's uninteresting. That's the common energy. And then you have some combination, linear combination of Pauli matrices. And this is automatically Hermitian. If there's no gap, then D. If there's no gap, then D, this vector D, it's a three-dimensional vector, can't vanish. If it vanishes, then the two things are degenerating energy. And you do the same trick. You create N, which I'm calling N because it's N, right? And you take D over the magnitude of D. So if you say it's always gap, then you can construct this vector N. And then you take this vector N, and this is the two-dimensional Brouon zone, right, where all the conductant, you go to Fourier. All the conductant, you go to Fourier space and you have a periodic system, and here are all the k vectors, and they live on this torus. And this is a map from the torus to the two-sphere. Okay? And then you calculate how much area is swept out by n on the two-sphere. And here's that formula. I think I wrote it down on Monday also. Right? Okay, and this is always an integer. And so then you say, suppose you put two systems together. Suppose you put two systems together. Suppose you had a system where you calculated this winding and were one. And then you put it next to a system where the winding is zero. When would the winding be zero if D were just a constant vector? In other words, it was just like the vacuum, right? Okay. How is it possible to have q equals 1 next to q equals 0? It's impossible. There's no way to smoothly go from q equals 1 to q equals 0. This is forced to be an integer. Right? And so in the integer quantity, in the integer quantum, Right, and so in the integer quantum Hall effect, you arrive at a contradiction. Oops, okay? It must be that you can't construct this vector. The vector must have a problem somewhere, which means that D has a problem somewhere. D must be zero, and means that on this, where's z zero? Oops, right there. And that's the the surface conductor. Okay? So what's it have to do with us? So the usual story. Recognize this, Dan? Recognize this, Dan? Okay. Usual story is that, okay, so you can see, right? It's a spring. Okay, a spring and a rot. Okay, so the usual story is, and this is going to be more important for us, is you start with this spring on this stick, okay? And the ground state of the spring is the spring points straight up, which of course is the same symmetry as the potential itself. Same symmetry as the potential itself. Alright? And then what you do is you, hold on, I have this sliding thing on purpose. You slide it, you slide it, and then, whoa, okay, I'll get that. Now the ground state is not the same, it does not have the same symmetry as the energy. The energy is rotationally symmetric, but you get for free this mode, this zero mode, which is the Goldstone mode. And that's all I'm going to talk about today. And that's all I'm going to talk about today. But I'm going to remind you that if you go around this room and you tell me that this thing winds as you go around, then there must be some place, just on the same way we should prove the polynomials, there must be some place where it's standing up. Right? But that's not the ground state. So it costs energy to stand up. That defect costs energy. Without me telling you any details about what kind of energy, how it costs energy, it must cost energy. Cost energy. It must cost energy fairly topologically. Okay, this Moisha Chepich showed me this. She showed me this with lots of springs, but you can dissemble it. Okay, so let's continue. So here is my crystal, okay, which I've twisted a little bit. So here is the crystal, and here is the dislocation that I was telling you about. This is the dislocation that Pyrles was talking about. And Pyrrhus made some argument that as the made some argument that as the dislocation moves, the potential is periodic. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Which of course seems clear to you because the whole material is periodic. Boom, boom, boom. Okay? And he says, how do you describe this motion? And he wrote down an energy and Nabaro followed up and said that there'd be some sort of bump, bump, bump motion. There would be sort of this jumping motion. But how do you describe a crystal? And I talked about this on Monday, too. You can think On Monday, too, you can think of a crystal as a bunch of density waves. See, here are the red density waves, and here are the blue density waves. And the crystal, the points, live wherever you have a double maximum. Okay? And of course, this is exactly what you see in experiment. If you talk to an experimentalist, these are the Bragg planes. How do you know you have a crystal? Because you do X-ray scattering off of the red planes and the blue planes. And the fact that you have this one point, which is a little wrong, you can't see that in X-ray scattering. You can't see that in X-ray scattering. That's very difficult to see that one point. And so, even with dislocations, you see long-range order. And I'm talking about very small angle scattering. So let me simplify the problem for a second, back to Monday, where now, oops, now I throw away the blue lines and I just have the red lines. You see, now it's a smectic. I just have layers. Okay? And here I have a dislocation and a smectic. And like I showed you. And, like I showed you on Monday, on purpose, right? The semectic, these are the density maxima, they're also density minima. And what you can see is that, in fact, a dislocation is made out of a pair of disclinations, just like Dan Shonas. Right? Here they are, right? There's a disinclination here of charge one half. Here's a minus one half sitting on the minima. And the minima and the maxima can't touch, and that's why they can't come together. Okay? And like I said, you have the density wave. Like I said, you have the density wave, which is rho naught delta rho cosine phi. Phi has the symmetry. Phi goes to phi plus 2 pi and phi goes to minus 1. And how do you pick delta rho? Delta rho is the order parameter. And when you're in the crystal phase or the smectic phase, t is negative. Delta rho wants to be non-zero. And that's a situation where the spring tips over. Okay, when the spring tips over, delta rho wants to be non-zero. And now the question is, And now the question is: what happens when you have a defect? I already showed you, in two cases, where you may have to make delta rho not be the value it wants. This is not in the minimum anymore. Okay? So delta rho loses, is no longer in the minimum value it wants to be. Okay, so let's talk about the ground state manifold for a second. This is important. So here's the ground state manifold. I think I mentioned this. I think I mentioned this. Here, you can take the smectic and you can rotate it. And when you rotate it by pi, you get back to where you started. That's theta. And you can also take the smectic and you can shift it. And when you shift it, you go back to where you are. If you shift it by 2 pi, it's back where you are. And so you see that there's some set. Everywhere we're in here is a point in the manifold of ground states, right? The ground state is specified. States, right? The ground state is specified by the orientation and this offset. Okay, and we've been talking about this forever. But this is twisted up in this funny way because if you shift and rotate, it's different than rotating and shifting because they don't commute. And so the translations have this twist in them, and this makes a coin bottle. And like I said, some people think that's cool, right? It is cool, right? Because if you take a path that goes like this, which is flip. Which is flip, shift backwards, flip backwards. That's the same thing as shift forwards. So in the math world, that is flip, shift, inverse, flip, inverse, and shift. So flips and shifts don't commute. Okay, so it's non-abelian. It's very exciting. Okay, but let me show you why it's interesting. But let me show you why it's interesting. Here's my ground state manifold again. Now look. What is this red line that goes across, this path down? This is a dislocation. This is a closed curve that changes phi by 2 pi, goes across. Right? So that is a dislocation. Now I can take this dislocation and I can distort it. I can distort the path. I can go down this line, over, up, over, up. Up, over, up. And I've done something kind of cool now because this path here, which is a displacement, and this path here, which looks like the same displacement, are now going in the opposite directions. So, in fact, there's no dislocation here anymore. There's no translations anymore. It's just disclinations. You're just doing rotations. And that's what I show you right here. You see, I don't have to have a dislocation in order to make... In order to make a dislocation at a far field, I can actually break it into two disclinations. Who cares? That means delta rho doesn't have to vanish. I can make the system happy. Right? So the system's happy. Everybody's in the ground state. The smectic is still a smectic. The pneumic has a problem. What nematic? I don't have a direct effect. But if there were a pneumatic, they would have a problem. Okay? But the smectic has no problem. Now, I did something kind of special. Something kind of special, I picked these directions. So, what would happen if I, instead of using a disclination that went from top to bottom on zero or pi, suppose instead I went at pi over two? Suppose I tried to make a disclination that started on a layer at pi over two. Well, what if I went straight up, it would end at three pi over two? This is not a closed loop on my manifold. However, these are closed loops because of the symmetries. Loops because of the symmetries. So I get an extra fact. The dislocation, the disclinations, they have to sit on special places. They have to sit in special places, the minimum and the maximum. If they don't, then I have to melt out the row. Then I lose the crystal. But otherwise now, I'm very happy. I have a situation where the energy is actually good. I can take any far-field structure of a dislocation. Any far-field structure of a dislocation and fill it in on the inside with disclinations and never have to make the order parameter match. Okay. And if you think about it, and I showed you this last time, any dislocation you have is always going to have a plus one-half defect, a disclination. There's no way around it because the only thing you might have done is had a plus one disclination, but that can't connect to anything because it doesn't have any lines. Thing because it doesn't have any lines coming in. So, if everything has to have a plus a half disclination, and if every disclination has to sit on a maximum or minimum, if you try to move a dislocation up, dislocation glide, you have to melt the crystal in between. You have to violate the rule that the disclination sit on the minimum or the maximum. Or you have to bring the minimum and the maximum together. There it is, there's the pyrals barrier. There's the pyros barrier, right? With no calculations, right? I'm not even relying upon periodicity. All that matters is that you have layers. All that matters that you have this phi. It doesn't matter where the phi sit. See, the phi's are living in a different space than x and y. If I took this and made a diffeomorphism of the whole space, nothing would change. My argument would be identical. And so this summarizes what I'm saying. And so this summarizes what I say. You can go to crystals now, back to crystals, which was the original story. Instead of a crystal being one density wave, it's two density waves. And the crystals, the lattice points sit at the double maximum of the density waves. And each density wave is a reciprocal lattice vector, g dot x, that's the basis vector, plus the offset. In other words, g tells you which wave. In other words, g tells you which way the layers are going, and phi is its offset. Well, now the symmetry is a little more complicated. Theta tells me how I'm rotating the basis vectors, how I'm rotating the lattice. So when you rotate the lattice, notice that if you had, for instance, a square lattice, where g1 and g2 are the same length and 90 degrees apart, if I rotate by pi over 2, phi 1 becomes phi 2 and phi 2 becomes minus phi 1. times minus phi 1. If it's a rectangular lattice, I can't rotate by pi over 2, but I can rotate by pi. And I can go by pi, and then it just flips the sign of each of the phi's. So these are the symmetries of my ground state manifold. And I can draw them. So if I have a square lattice, you take phi 1 and phi 2, you give it a quarter, a pi over 2 twists, and you glue it back to itself. Here, you do a pi twist and you glue it back to itself. Here, you do a pi twist and you glue it back to yourself. Here, in a triangular lab, you need a third phase, which is the sum of the other two, but you get a hexagon, and you twist it by 2 pi over 6, and you glue it back to yourself. Okay. And I can draw them like this, or I can draw them like that, depending on how you like drawing. Okay? But now, the disclinations must sit at the fixed points, right? And so now you can find the fixed points. And there's only a finite And there's only a finite place. And for instance, in a square lattice, the disclinations either sit on the double maxima or the double minima. In a rectangular lattice, they can be mixed like this. A square lattice, if you only talk about rotations by pi, is of course the same as a rectangular lattice, so it mixes it up. But on a triangular lattice, it has to sit at a double maximum. That means that the disclinations on a triangular lattice have to sit on the lattice points. Lattice has to sit on the lattice points. Of course, that's what we learned a long time ago, right? Here is a disclination dipole. Okay, there's the seven disclination. There's the five disclination. And it makes a dislocation when you take the Berger circuit. Double maximum. They sit on the vertices. They have no choice. In the square lattice, it's a little different. In the square lattice, It's a little different. In the square lattice, you have this one, which is a three. That's a double maximum. Turns out the other one sits at the double minimum, which you say, what is that? You see, that's a five. There's five lines coming out. So, in the square lattice, they sit like this. In the triangular lattice, they're like this. That's what's so special about the triangular lattice. The disclamations, the geometric disclamations that you might have constructed if you were Volterra, are exactly. If you were Volterra, are exactly the same as the phase disclinations that I'm talking about. But it's not true in other lattices. On a rectangular lattice, this is not the case. You don't think of dislocations on a rectangular lattice as being made of geometric disclinations. That would just be terrible to eat pie out of the system, right, and glue the stuff together. You don't do that. It's just that these angles are kind of small and you can manipulate. Okay. Sometimes the phase ones and the geometric ones are the same. The phase ones and the geometric ones are the same. Okay. Are the other rows of your table saying that for the higher charge displayations, you can put them more places? Yeah, but still only a fixed number of places. Yeah, they can be on the middle of edges, right? They can be on the middle of edges too. Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. So, I've told you everything in 2D. In 2D, I only have to worry about edge dislocations. But of course, now I'm going back to smectics. Smectics, of course, enjoy. Smectics, of course, enjoy, oops, smectics enjoy screw dislocations as well. And in the Landau Degene, or whatever you want to call it, the Degene, the Dejen, what are you doing? You talked about in DeGene's famous mapping from 50 years ago, right, where you think of a superconductor and a smectic as being the same thing. You say, well, there's that phase field phi. When do you have a dislocation? When you integrate phi around some coil. When you integrate phi around some closed curve, you get an integer times 2π. It makes no distinction in a superconductor or superfluid what direction the defect is. Dislocation is dislocation. You go around it, you get 2π. It always bothered me because these kind of look different. Okay? But they are different. Let me show you how. Right? Screw dislocations occur in real crystals in case people are concerned. This is a Frank Reed source. Okay, so let's start by talking about oily streaks. We've heard about oily streaks today. Here's an oily streak. What are the defects in the oily streak? Alright, well, you have two disclinations here, charge one half plus half disclinations. You say, uh-oh, does this have net disclination charge? No. Because remember, they're the half layers, right? And there's two minus a half disclinations here. In an oily streak, there's no charge of any kind. But of course, it takes a long time for them to relax. Course, it takes a long time for them to relax. So, you know, they might be permanent on the scale of a gradual state. Okay? Or even longer. Here are actual pictures of a real Euler Street texture. Here, no charge. What about this? Here I can actually have two half disclinations. And if you imagine the far field, in the far field, the layers go around in a circle, and you can measure the winding of the director field. Of the director field, and the disclination charge is plus one. No dislocations there. How do you make a screw dislocation? What you do is you take this and you twist it. And you imagine, you twist it like this. Okay? So you go like this. I have a better picture, or a different picture, like this. So here are the layers. These are the disclinations. The disclinations. These two disclinations are on the half layers. This one, there's a disclination on a full layer and a disclination on a half layer. This one, there are two disclinations both on half layers. And you see the middle surface? The middle surface is layer zero and it's just a nice heel coin going straight up the axis. This is the core of a dislocation, a screw dislocation. Clayman and Meyer and Metitian, you know, drew this picture. We followed up a little bit. But the main point... Followed up a little bit, but the main point is that the screw dislocation seems to be made out of two plus one-half disclinations. Does that bother you, Tim? That's so crazy. That's crazy, right? And you could ask the question, where did the charge go? Well, here, you see, some people say that you escape into the third dimension. I'm going to say you escape from the second dimension. Because if you look at a helicoid, which is how we think of screw dislocations, at the center, if you look at the normal, the layer normal has a disclination in it. It goes around by plus one. But as you go away from the center, the molecule point out. So the charge doesn't seem to be conserved, which is a real problem because, you know, that's like one of the key things in topology: that we say there are charges and there's Is that we say there are charges and they're supposed to be conserved. Alright, so where'd the charge go? How is it that a screw dislocation seems to be made out of two half disclinations, going like this? And it gives you no net disclination charge, but there's net dislocation charge. And the answer is Dan already told us, right? You know what this is? No, it's Frank. Okay. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right? Saddle splay. Okay? And here it is: saddle split. And as Dan said, the saddle split is also the Gaussian curvature if these are normal to a surface. Okay? This is twice the Gaussian curvature. Okay? And I know, I don't know if Jonathan's out there listening, but you know, Frank, I understand there are different ways to look at it, but this is useful here. Okay? Because I found something. Because I found something out. You see, this is a surface terminator, it says, who cares? Right? Null Lagrangian. You guys say null Lagrangian? You guys say that. Okay. Right. I can integrate it to a surface term. So it's along the z direction LZ. I have the integral R d theta. Nu is the normal. And here is the thing I have to integrate. And I integrate from R0 to infinity. I evaluate this, but I have to do the integral around the circle. Well, wouldn't you know it? This vector, the annual circle, Vector, Dan already told us, right? This vector, if you have a defect in the pneumatic, a planar defect with winding number m, this vector is minus m over r. The sign changes, right? This is what the source of the Gaussian curvature is in the helicoid. That's what gives you the Gaussian curvature in the first place. And in fact, what's really happening is the Gaussian curvature is eating. Curvature is eating the disclination charge. Whoa, okay. However, the Gaussian curvature is still there. There's still a number you can measure. There's no ambiguity. A screw dislocation has Gaussian curvature. An edge dislocation does not have Gaussian curvature. Okay? Period. End of story. Okay? And we can go further. You can do the integral. You can do the integral sumpoid. We can go further. We can imagine and ask the most important question: how does a screw defect become an edge defect? After all, we talk about dislocation loops all the time. People go on and on about how that's the whole source of melting, right? So here's a screw defect. It's made of two one-half disclinations, the blue one and the red one. See, you just have the layer. This is a half disclination. This is a layer. This thing is a layer. Layer. This red one comes around, comes to here, and connects itself to this minus one-half disclination, which then goes into the board. Into the board, you have a minus a half and a plus one-half. That is your typical edge dislocation that we talked about at the very beginning. And on this side, you just close everything up. You seal it up, you just have layers. There's like bumps in the layers, but they go away. But those bumps have Gaussian curvature. But those bumps have Gaussian curvature, so let's not forget that. That you can always measure them. And so, some people, like my collaborators, they say, oh, oh, well, so what's saying is, is that you're going from a situation where you have a plus one-half disclination to a minus one-half disclination. Now, in a pneumatic, as Dan will tell you, as Tyler will show you, in a pneumatic, you can go from this to this smoothly. You can escape. There's all these twisty ones. Can escape. There's all these twisty ones. Smectics can't twist. So think smectics can't twist. You have to go from here to here at a singular point. That's a place where you insert, you know, a boat onto the edge. You go from having one layer coming out to three layers coming out. So there's a new kind of defect, a new kind of point defect. It carries some kind of charge. What kind of charge does it carry? Okay, here I have a picture. Let's see. Oh, man. Very important, very important. I don't know what my time is. Half an hour. I have half an hour left? No. I was at a conference. I was at a conference, and it turns out every time you cite the chair, you get an extra five minutes. So, my understanding is that we're just as big experiments along these lines, isn't that right? With Hill on this, right? Yeah. Just saying. Okay, so what is this? You guys all know, we've talked about it a thousand times if we haven't talked about it once at this conference. Okay? Start with a focal conic donate. See it? Now, take it and stretch it. Stretch it, take that center line, stretch it this way, stretch it this way. You see how this is a phoboconic. You see how this is a focal conic domain? This is a quarter of a focal conic domain? That is exactly a place where it goes from a plus one-half to a minus one-half. Four of these together give you a focal conic domain. Focal conic domains have charges, like we were talking about this morning, Manuel. Focal conic domains are not saving you from having defects, but now they're point defects instead of line defects. And these point defects. Defects. And these point defects, if you divide them up, you can make a whole plane. You get this. There's a whole sheet between this half defect and that minus half defect. There's a whole sheet that's different. It's bounded by these disclinations. And there's still this charge when you're all done. Oh, the next slide is a mistake. Okay. I was just, I added this this morning. Okay, so what's the story? You have edge dislocations, and we're very comfortable. You have edge dislocations, and we're very comfortable with edge dislocations. Edge dislocations are always made of something with three layers coming out and one layer coming out. Three and one are different. Agreed? And the layers have to come out at integer quantities. So, you go into the, you look at the far field of a defect, you go into it, you fill it in in a way that does not destroy the synecic order, which had. The synectic order, which I just showed you, you could do. You do it by putting the disclinations always on the minimum or the maximum. And so I can reconstruct a core that looks like this. Maybe that's not what the core looks like. Maybe it melts. That's not important. Topologically, I could fill it in this way. Far away, you couldn't distinguish this. So that's an edge dislocation. A screw dislocation, if you go close up to it, If you go close up to it, it is made of two plus one-half disclinations. You can't turn this into this. You can always tell at the core that you reconstruct, is it made out of two things with one sheet coming out, or is it made from two things, one with one sheet and one with three sheets? So you can distinguish an edge from a screw. They're different. So to me, that's exciting because there's actually a top. To me, that's exciting because there's actually a topological distinction between edge defects and screw defects. Right? It's captured in the Gaussian curvature. Now, I was, these are the people who helped me. I want to draw a picture for you. So, you might be thinking in your head. Right, so the layers are like this. So you'd say, oh, this is screw defect. I know what a screw defect is. Oh, this is an edge defect. Screw, edge, screw. This is a loop. And you'd say, oh, and you know, this makes perfect sense to me. And then somebody asked me, well, what happens if you take the layers, like so, and you have a loop like this? Which, if you look in most textbooks that talk about melting, they would draw a loopy thing. About melting, they would draw a whoopy thing. Does that mean that there are these point defects everywhere? That switch screw to edge? Tim, what do you think? I think probably not. Why not? You can't get out of there that easy. He's correct. Because whether something is a screw or an edge is not whether or not the dislocation is along the layers or perpendicular to the layers. Right? Right? That picture that I showed you before, this one, not this one, this one, I can take this and make an arbitrary diffeomorphism of space. I can take the whole space and do anything I like to it. And if I do that, it does not change the fact that only one layer is coming out of each of these defect lines and three layers are coming out of that defect line. And three layers are coming out of that defrect line. So, what happened to this loop? Yeah, there's some place where it has to have a screw component, and some place where it has to be edged, but you can make the whole thing wiggle and wobble and do whatever you like. And it's still, in terms of the topology, there's no problem. So this geometric characterization that we're taught, that a screw defect is a defect where the Burger's vector is parallel to the dislocation line, and an edge dislocation is one where... And an edge dislocation is one where it's perpendicular to the dislocation line. That's true if you're only distorting and putting one defect in the ground state. But it's not true if you are taking a situation and you're taking an arbitrary system that's wiggling around and wobbling around and you're putting in more than one defect. Let me ask you something. Let me ask you something, Tim. You're not getting any more time, Bradley. You just said one. No, I wasn't citing you. If you take, let me find the right picture here. Not this one, this one. If I have a screw defect, so the first screw defect, you know what to do, right? For the first, no, you have flat layers. For the first screw defect, everyone knows what to do to construct it. In fact, everyone knows what to do, to construct it. Yeah. Now, the second one. Does it go parallel to that screw defect? Does it go normal to the layers? What does it do? How do you build the next screw defect if you're so insistent that the definition of a screw defect is geometric? Probably like parallel. I guess it depends on how you build them up. On how you build them up. You can have a twist-screen boundary phase, you can have a row of them being parallel. You can have other constructions. The point is that telling me which way the layers point, this is not parallel to the layers. If I draw another one that's straight up and down, it's not parallel to the layers. Perpendicular to the layers, right? If I want to draw a perpendicular layer, you say, oh, it would have to be one that twists it around. But then you'd say, from the point of view of the ground, State from the point of view of the ground state has some edge component because some of it is parallel to the dislocation line and some is perpendicular to the dislocation line. But I think that that description of that dichotomy is a special case of the topological fact that you can distinguish the two kinds of defects. So, this is all new. I was supposed to give a talk in Bristol, and most Give a talk in Bristol, and most of this stuff I did with Tom Michone. And I felt silly because he could have given a talk. So I was compelled to figure something out new for him. And then he wasn't even there. All right. Thank you. Thank you for your time. If uh dislocation is two oppositely charge disclinations and the screw is two plus one half disclinations, what's two minus one half disclinations? Oh, that's an excellent question. You can, of course, this won't surprise you. You can build a screw dislocation out of any combination of dislocations that add up to plus one. So that picture I showed you was too easy. You was too easy. I could have this. I could have a minus half with three plus a half coming out. I could twist that. That would be a much more symmetric charge three dislocation. So you can start building them. You're saying, can you just have two like this? I couldn't think of anything. But that doesn't mean that it's not there. But in Dan's language, this would be a source then of This would be a source then of positive Gaussian curvature. So, you know, you'd start there. You would start thinking about what kind of defects would force positive Gaussian curvature into a small thing. So I don't know the answer to what this does. However, I know that a minus one can be a minus one defect. I'm never going to be able to draw it. A minus one defect. You can actually make a cross cap. You can actually make a cross-cat. You can actually build a saddle on top of it. You can go a saddle on top of it, and you can actually make the defect line disappear. See, the fact that you can go from plus one-half to minus one-half at a single point means you can go from plus one to zero at a single point also. So it obeys all the rules that pneumatics have. There is no plus one disclination. Why? Why? But to make it disappear, you have to make it disappear at a point. It can't gradually stop or escape from the second dimension. Oh, does this mean that in Dan's simulations where he was simulating these smectic-ish layers, if you were to look at the Gaussian curvature? Gaussian curvature density, the saddle slate. Curvature density, the saddle slate density, you would be able to tell the topological conservation, how it's topologically conservative. Somehow that seems right. Somehow that's the measure, right? Because one thing you could do, Tim, if you insisted on it, is you could take all the Gaussian curvature of this keel coid and squish it. You could build flat layers. In fact, every building you've been in does that. They always put staircases and they always have flat layers. It doesn't gradually relax off to a Relax off to infinity to be flat layers. So you can concentrate all the Gaussian curvature, but you can't get rid of it. And then once you've done that, now you have flat layers again. You can do whatever you want. Then the geometric and topological descriptions are identical. Dan, you should do this. Well, I'm not in 3D yet. They are. But I will. I wanted to ask about the magnitude of the burner's vector, which Of the burger's vector, which for an edge tells you the number of layers that went in and didn't come out, or vice versa. And so you nicely map that a lot to display nation charge because... Yeah, but this does the same thing. After all, what's a helicoid anyhow, but one layer that's been twisted around and coming out? Right, so there's no net difference of different layers going in and out. And so that is like what a plus. And so that isn't like what a plus one disclination does, right? No, no, see, a plus uh uh no no no this is a half dis this see this is a half disinclination. Charge one half. If I drew the minimum layer in here, it would come out like this. So I'm sweeping the layers around. So I have disinclinations, and I'm sweeping the layers around. I'm just not connecting. I'm just not connecting them to a flat thing. I'm connecting them to this twisted thing. The hyperbolic, the negative curvature has more space for me to attach things. That's how I can do it without seeming to add extra layers. What is the magnitude of the Berber spectrum at the skew dislocation? It's the distance between the two disclinations. It's the same. That way, Dan. That that way, that way, Dan. This look the burger's number is concerned. Is concerned. This is a charge for a Berger specter. Because it takes, the red thing takes, it takes twists to go around. And then when you go across this way, it's still the same charge. You don't believe me. Sorry, this is charged too. This is charge two. See the space in between these. These are on opposite. They're both on density maximum. They're both on density maximum. So there's a minimum in between. So it would be a charge 1 dislocation if there was a maximum and a minimum. It's charge 2 and there's 2 maximum. Here, it's charge 2 because these two are too hard. And so the Burger's number is conserved, whatever that number is, right? It's just telling you how far apart the two disclination lengths are. So it's a whole different question from disclination chart. Of disclination charge on the point. Exactly. Exactly. But you see, the point is that the disclination line charge somehow talks to the point defect charge at the center of a focal conic domain in a way that I don't understand. Now I know why you just told me I don't get extra time. Well, you got the extra five minutes. Well, you got the extra five minutes, so that's perfect. Alright, so if there are no more questions, then I just want to thank Benny back. We have the last uh part of the conference.
