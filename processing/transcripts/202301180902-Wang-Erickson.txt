All right, thank you very much to the organizers for the invitation. It's been a pleasure to be here and back in person in conferences and seeing everyone. So I'd like to explain some things today about how questions and deformation theory naturally give rise to an infinity algebra. And I just want to sort of introduce it as if we're discovering it and how it's natural. So, the situation that I'll usually have today is that k will just be a base field, which I'll usually be thinking of of any characteristic, and usually just thinking of it as a finite field. And then if we're in the situation where we have a group G, and then we have a representation like this, we've seen quite a bit of the universal Lifting or deformation rates. I'll usually just write like this. And the one sort of different convention I'll make today is that these will always be, I'm always going to be talking about equal characteristic. In other words, I want everything, if I, these are deformation functors, I want it to be honest. I want it to be on Artinian K algebra. And then it's understood that, let's see, this is the maximal ideal, that we have a tangent and obstruction theory. The tangent space comes from cohomology in this way. And I'm always going to be using star today for a k-linear dual. And then there's obstructions coming from H2. The adjoint action of G on this endomorphism ring. So what is the R norm with R square mean? Oh, that's the deformation ring. Oh, that's the defamation ring, when it exists. Oh, when it exists, I see. Right. And then how are these obstructions actually realized? Well, Maser explains this, that you just could, with a good deal of choices, take some sort of surjection and take the completed symmetric algebra, right? The completed symmetric algebra, right? Just the power series ring, and so Jack onto here. There's no canonical such map. You could just lift one, lift the code tangent space. Then you can take the kernel of this rejection. And then you can get that H2, and so I'm going to abbreviate these as H2 and H1 and so forth, receives. H1 and so forth, receives an injection from J mod MJ squared. Yeah, J mod Mj. We got fourth MJ is this kernel, and this is, this is right M the maximal ideal of that power series. And then that tells us about obstructions. And so the questions that got me into thinking that for which the answer is that at least an answer is expressible in A infinity algebra. Is expressible in A infinity algebras. It doesn't necessarily make the answer anything different than if you just would compute by hand, but it's a nice structure. Maybe question number one, for which A infinity algebras are involved in an answer, is how if I wanted a tangent and an obstruction theory for pseudo-representations. Okay. And when I started thinking about this, there was a paper of Belliesch that explained this for pseudo-deformations where your pseudo-representation comes from a row with two irreducible factors. And it explains the tangent space. Each of these are irreducible. And the pseudo-representation comes from that, and we want to take the deformation rate of that pseudo-representation. But even beyond two factors, the tangent space wasn't known, and obstruction theory hadn't been expressed, or what to expect for obstructions. And a second related question you could ask for is in the setting of the derived Hecke algebra, so let's just say. Hecke algebra. So let's just say that G, some sort of p-n group. And then we're interested in this drive-Hecke algebra, which can be thought of as an X star in some sort of category of smooth representations. And as what structures A infinity is adequate, I can recover any at least the derived category probably is smooth. with an ifixed vector. Right? And so those are the kind of questions that I'll try to explain that A infinity algebra's naturally appear in an answer. And basically what we're the approach that we'll take is that That we'll take is that we're going to sort of say that we want to calculate classical deformations by means that are derived. Then, of course, this does lend itself pretty naturally to Saying that the infinity algebras and similar objects on adjoint polymology could describe these derived deformation rings as well. If you work with them in certain settings, the equal characteristic over a field, that's really where they work well. Okay, so I want to sort of now build up to the definition of A-infinity algebra from actually And affinity algebras from actually dealing with deformations. So let's say that we, I'm gonna establish a bit of notations computing the title of this section. So a little bit of notation. Just for convenience, I'm gonna write k epsilon sub n for sort of ring supporting nth order deformations. And okay, so we can start out with what do first order deformations look like. We can think about what kind of matrix representation am I actually thinking about. So of course this would be something valued in GLD of k epsilon one. In GLD of K epsilon 1. But if I just wrote this out with maybe the most natural choice of K basis for this now rank 2D, K vector space would look like this. And I'm writing a little extra epsilon as a decoration to show you where the epsilon multiplication happens. Multiplication happens on this rank D K epsilon 1 module, which is a rank 2 with a dimension 2g k vector space, right? And then the condition, so it's not just any function f1, of course we want this to be a homomorphism valued in GLD of k epsilon 1. And we're familiar with the idea that we want the differential of df1 to be 0. In other words, we want f1. 0. In other words, we want F1 to be in Z1. Let me just establish some notation. So I'm going to write C star. I'm always going to be working with this co-chains valued in the endomorphism ring here. And then this contains the co-cycles, and that contains V star, the co-boundering. Okay. All right, let's say that we want to keep deforming this, right? So now we want to go to, so next what I'd like to do is take this, and we have the usual map from Kopspawn2, projecting here, and we can say, okay, I've already got this map here, V1, say, and I'd like to lift it to. Say, I'd like to lift it to V2. So then we can say, what are lift V2 of V1? And we can think about what representations those would be. So now I need some sort of 3x3 setup. Okay, and now the condition is no longer that F2 is a host cycle. Instead, we want that F2's boundary. If you just write out what does it mean for this to be a homomorphism, given that these are already homomorphisms, it would be that it's equal to the cup product of these two cup surfaces. So in particular, we see that we can lift, in particular, we see that there exists an F2, making it a homomorphism if and only if this cut product of co-cycles is actually a two-coboundary. And then, but then And then, but then when there is one, then the options for F2 is a torsor under Z, under Z1. Okay, so right, and I should say, what exactly is this product? What exactly is this product? So, this is a composite of the standard product in cohomology. So, first of all, what, or end in co-chains, actually, right? So it sends Ci cross Cj to Ci plus J. I better write out what module it is, right into the tensor product of these modules, which is that Andro tensor itself. Tensor itself. So that's a standard product in group cohomology. And then end is an associative algebra, and you can use the multiplication n. And then that gives you an element of Cij, Ci plus J. Great. So now you're valued in N again. So that is the cut product in code chains. Eraser. Eraser type button. And then it's something you can check is that actually this cup product makes the co-chain complex a DG algebra. Within the usual difference. So C dot within the usual differential, and this color is a dg algebra over k. And then, you know, this is something you can think about what this means for deformation theory. And Maser actually wrote this in his original deforming LR representations paper. There's also, other people were certainly way of. So, a lot of people were certainly aware of it beforehand, and I'll mention that one example in a bit. But for example, our deformation ring modulo, the cube of a maximum idea, right, so I'm interested in deformations up to second border is determined by, of course, the tangent space, and then if you take a tangent tangent, If you take the dual of the cut product, so I should say then H, I'm going to use H for the, just H for the homology of that quotient complex, right? So then you get, you think of it as having a trivial differential, and then I'm going to try to distinguish, I'll call them both cup products, but then I'll maybe write that one like more vertically. And this is Is the dual map of the cup product. So you can first take the dual map of the cup product, then project to the sim clotient of the tensor square. Whatever the case may be, you can just take it. It's defined, certainly. It goes from It goes from H1 tensor squared to H2. Then I take the dual, then I just produce this. And it may have additional properties. Let's see. So one could ask or hope is, is this all? Is this technology that we just see with just thinking about DG algebras and their cohomology good enough? And sometimes it is. So, you know. You know, there's a few. It's one of the two previous examples of deformation theory of representations that Maser cites at the beginning of his paper. One of them is the paper of Goldman Milson, which says that RO is quadratic. Basically, meaning, what do I mean by that? I mean that RO is actually, you know, this is all you need to understand enough to isomorphism. So sim hat. So sim hat of H1 star, right? So this is the presentation by a power series ring we already talked about. And then up star H2 star. Just the quadratic terms. That's good enough in some cases. So when G is the fundamental group of a compact, of a compact Calendar manifold. Compact Kayla manifold and row from G to some Lie group is unitary. I just mean that the image is contained in a compact subgroup. And then in this case, we're talking about C star G and then of course the Lie algebra with the adjoint action. algebra with the adjoint action. And then Goldman and Nilsson prove this by comparing these local systems with vector bundles with a flat connection. And then they can actually get from this comparison that this DG algebra coaching. This DG algebra of co-chains is, all right, but it's now a Li bracket, so a little bit different. It's a DG Li algebra, right? Just how did we, when you get a DG Li algebra, you do exactly the same thing as here, but then you just have a lead bracket instead of a multiplication. It has this additional condition called formal. And what does this mean? It means that their formal definition of formal is that this is quasi-isomorphic to its cohomology. I'll just rewrite the same section. And this is the notion of plasma isomorphism. And this is the notion of quasi-isomorphism in the category of DGV algebras, meaning that you can connect them with a bunch of quasi-isomorphisms by hats. And then the additional thing you need to know to really see why that would matter is the question of, you know, how would you express a deformation functor in terms of a DG algebra? Algebra. This is known as the Moore-Cartan functor. So you'd also need that the deformation functor is the same as the Moore-Chitan functor. What is this? McC dot. So this MC, or a carton functor, of our DG algebra is something that sends Artinian K algebra. In this case, of course, I'm thinking of K being complex numbers. Maybe you could think of it as reals in this case. Okay. Unit of Artunian rings to sets. And what does it do? It just takes quick content C A is defined to be C in degree one items all elements that's maximum ideal such that ideal such that dc plus one half cc equals zero. And then the d and the leaf accident of course come just from c but you can just extend them essentially a linearly or a multilinearly as a program. So this is actually you can check, right? It's in bijection with With loose. And then there's a quotient by a so-called gauge action of C0 tensor MAP C0 tensor MA. And the quotient of this action. And the quotient of this action, the quotient by this gauge action, it just is the action by strict conjugation. Because what's this? This is just the matrix algebra. So you're talking about matrices valued in the maximal ideal, and you can conjugate by 1 plus that thing. What's the notion of gauge action here? You just get, I'll use MCR as rotation here, but then. Here, but then just check because that's the strict conjugation action. This is then zero. And then, right, and then you need the fact that this, generally speaking, and the fact you need, and then more carton. Equivalence class, the age equivalence class filter is quasi-isomorphism therapy. Pause that isomorphism there. Okay. All right. And so then, but the computation of the Mohr-Cartan set for a DG, sorry, a graded Lie algebra here is then just quadratic. That's sort of a very nice, explicit case. Map from 0 squared a total. A to C A to say D rho squared A to to here. Yeah. So it would just be you send C to rho plus C rho. Yeah, and I guess you are taking and C2. Yeah, so it only depends on C0, C1, C2. You can, the way that you can start getting dependence on other things is that you can start to put in DG ardent algebras, and then you'll see other degrees of cohomology. And then you might be looking at. And then you might be looking at, you know, you'll be seeing a tangent vector in different degrees, for example. So that's the, I'm sort of, this is what I mean, I'm using derived technology without you ever writing down a derived deformation problem, but it's extendable to a derived deformation problem, by which I mean you could replace ardent k algebras with dg ardent k algebra. Okay, so there's uh So, this formality case is rather special. It comes from comparison with vector models with flat connections. And the sort of predecessor theorem to showing that that theory is formal is the theorem, Deliene Griffiths-Morgan-Sullivan, that the Durham complex on these compact Kayler manifolds is one. Yeah, so classical deformation theory only opera RCs, very, yeah, only C's degrees 0, 1, and 2. So let's just say that we, and we'll start to see that more, let's just say that we inductively extend. So back to our story, you know, we don't have any reason to believe that Have any reason to believe that the Gala groups that we tend to think about and have been written down in this conference, like local Galois groups and global restricted ramification Gala groups, are formal. In fact, Pozotselvsky has explained that they're not. So we can't just hope that everything's quadratic. So the inductive extension, let's just say that we have an element of rho n, anime rho n minus 1, in element. Minus 1 in the lifting functor of k epsilon mod epsilon, k epsilon n minus 1. And then what is this? Draw this diagram, kind of diagram one more time. Maybe I'll drop the epsilons just for convenience. I'm just gonna dot dot dot. And then we want to test whether this thing extends to a so this is an n minus first order deformation. We want to extend it to a to an n minus 1. Extended to an n-order declaration, right? So we have, when we ask this question, then this here is rho n minus 1, and so is this. And then, you know, just these cup products that you're going to have to be concerned with, just work in terms of matrix multiplication, right? So Fn gives a rho n. A rho n lifting rho n minus 1, if and only if its boundary is equal to, look, you just think of doing matrix multiplication. How would you multiply matrices to get into that coordinate? So F1 n minus 1 and plus, and I guess the general term is f n minus j cup f minus j. F j plus f n minus one f n right. And this here, so it's a cohomology class. So these things aren't, I guess it's not completely obvious. Only the F1 out of all this list is definitely a co-cycle. The rest are just one co-chain. Definitely a co-cycle. The rest are just one co-chains. But it is known that it is, in fact, a two-co-cycle. And its cohomology class is an element of the n massey product of that one with itself n times. F1 with itself n times. This is really meant to define what, or give you an idea of what massy product is. So basically, the n massy product of any bunch of co-cycles is that you try to solve the cup product equation for the first two, and you actually basically write a matrix like this. The title of Peter May's article where he explains this is called Matrix Massey Products. This is the way to just conceive of them. And then you want each of these things to solve this sort of. Each of these things to solve this sort of quantum boundary equation, and then there's many different choices for these things, but we've fixed one for now, and we have the symmetry caused by wanting it to be epsilon equivariant. And then, so this is a very particular massy product, but you choose all these things. It's called a defining system. In general, there's and then so this massy product is actually a multi, it's not single-valued, it's a set. It's not single valued, it's a set contained in. In this case, H2. Okay, and so I guess we can say in principle that population of these massy products, and really only certain massy products, controls the deformation theory. Deformation theory. But that's just saying, what that's saying is pretty much you can calculate it. I mean, this is the way that you would calculate it. But we'd like to make it a bit more systematic. But I think it's a good time to mention a conjecture that does appear on this level and actually has to do with arithmetic. So it's a conjecture of Minotsch and Tan building on work of Hopkins-Pickelgren and also the collaborators of the Minotaur tag is that Is that f is a field with the property that, let's see, if we don't want its characteristic to be p, and we want p through roots of unity to be in it, then there's this essentially an enrichment of the motivic block-cuto conjecture, which says that then every defined Defined an acid product in H dot of absolute Gala group, like an absolute Gala group of its field, with trivial coefficients, which is the same as mu p, isomorphic to mu p. Every military collect contains zero. So containing zero, what does that mean? It means that what I would say is that I guess, and this really does apply to if rho was the trivial representation or a character, then it would say that as long as there's any way, as long as there's any n minus first order deformation, that's the nth masky problem. That's the nth Massey product being defined, then there's a order n definition. And you know, pretty much everything we know about Galo cohomology, I think, comes from sort of descending. You know, you can restrict. Well, okay, yeah. Galo cohomology with finite coefficients comes from restricting, so it's a trivial action and then going from there. So, I mean, it's interesting to ask what would this imply for Galo representations? Or can you deduce some things from about a To do some things from about gallocomology in non-trivial modules. Yes, one quick question. So here you had masky self-products, right? Here I have masky self-products, right? Yes, one, F1, F1. And what do you mean by conjecture is? It's not the same. So this would be reflected by saying, it wouldn't be deformation theory anymore, but it's certainly related. So it would be, but this is a character trivial representation. But then I'm now not in. But then I'm now I'm now not in s and and that could be half you know, this could be half one, this could be something different. So it's saying, but then you sort of draw the same diagram, and then it's saying whenever it's defined, in other words, whenever you can get up to here, you can do that. Which is true, so does it imply that if I map, if I if I have a map from k epsilon n to k epsilon n minus one, that is induce a map or says this map is ejected. I guess in this particular case, if we require that. Yeah, so I'm thinking that sounds correct. Yeah. Okay. Ah, if it's defined at all, it contains zero. So I think not quite. It would just say if there's any, if you can get to here anyhow, but then you only consider these to be fixed, right? So the massive product being defined means The massive product being defined means that you fix these co-cycles. Then it's saying as long as you can get this far at all, then there's then at least one of those contains zero. But not everything has to be zero. So the bound to k epsilon y group, etc. Yeah, it's just that this setup, I have to think about if this setup really works all right with all the symmetry that's required in being a deformation, right? Symmetry that's required to be in deformation, right? So they're working in a situation where it can be, it's not just F1F1, F1, F1, it's anything. And then the next row is also arbitrary. So even if you make all these the same, this maybe works in the context where you have to allow these to vary. And then that's not a deformation. It's certainly representation and says something. You could think about what this says. So this is known. I actually have to look at more how far it's known. Look at more how far it's known, but this is proved for when GF is a Domuscan, e.g. F equals QP, or I guess any extension of QP, and then join the table. Yeah. So probably if we can be applying this, we've got type two, but it can't be. This is what you mean by the tuple, right? Yeah, so defined meaning that there's any defining system. There's a single defining system. Of course, there may be more than one. So if there was only one, it would say that that one has to vanish. Because if it's defined, it has to contain zero. For Kerry, you always define because that's cut from that. Yes, here it's always defined. But for a triple, it's not always defined. For a triple, it's not always defined. You need both products to match. Some sense. Okay. And this actually comes up usefully. And for example, using this kind of ideas, Gavhari Buchle used this to say, like, for example, what is the deformation rate of some representations of the absolute Gala group of Qp. QP. Using this very explicitly. All right, well, I should try to say something about A infinity algorithm. It'd be nice if we could organize this, instead of just saying, well, it looks like this is the package, this massey products is the package that calculates things, we can try to be a bit more systematic, and that's what I'll try to explain. I'll try to explain through presentations of deformation functors. So let's just say what it is. What is an A-infinity algebra? It is a Z-graded K-vector space. With a linear M n from V dot tensor N to V dot of greater degree 2 minus N. And that's the data, and then there's many conditions. So the first is, and I'll just write down a few of them. There's this notion, so these were originally called strong homotopy associative algebras, a notion developed by Staschev. And there's a very nice way to say what these, combinatorially, what these relations are by what he calls a associahedron. But I'll just explicitly write down a few of those. So the first is that m1 squared is 0, so it has to be 0. Is 0, so it has to act like a differential. And then m1 with respect to m2. So notice that m2 is like a multiplication. In particular, dg algebras are a infinity algebra, with only the first two operations being non-zero. So if you differentiate multiplication, then you want to get the Leibniz function. I'm just going to drop the signs so I don't get confused. And then, yeah, you could just say there's a signal happening, and this is not good enough to say things. And then, so what's M3? The idea is that you can take this thing called the associator, which measures the failure of associativity. So this thing, I'm writing m1 tensor1, because I'm thinking of it intaking a tensor, a tensor square, right, an element of the tensor square. A tensor square, right? An element of a tensor square, of read the tensor square. Here, this takes in a tensor square, and this takes in one, right? So I'm thinking of inputting a tensor cube element in there. And so this thing is called the associator. It's the failure of associativity. And these are so-called strong homotopy associative algebras, meaning it has the data of a homotopy that makes this a boundary. Okay, so then what does that mean? It means that that's the M3. and 3 and I need the notion of the differential on this is the differential on V but then I need the differential on V tensor Q right so M3 on M1 tensor 1 on tensor 1 so I need a bit more space so I'll say one tensor M1 right so this is the differential on V cubed On V cubed. So this is saying that the failure of associativity is given by a homotopy. And then so forth. And I actually will write down a complete definition of A infinity algebra, but I'll do it after transmodifying A of it. Okay, yeah, and so the first example of an A infinity algebra that you already know is a DEG algebra. is a DG algebra. So if we have our C D multiplication, that's a DG algebra. Then that's an A infinity algebra with D being M1, multiplication being M2, and then just letting it be 0 for and at least 3. So that's an infinity operator. Now we here's and then the next major theorem like why are these useful why bother with this definition if we're interested in deformation theory for example it's that you know the the complex the C that we saw earlier the coaching the DG algebra of value-dependent morphisms knows about lifts but we know that it's better to compute with But we know that it's better to compute with collology. We know that collology has our interesting arithmetic information and so forth. So we'd like to do something like in the Goldman-Nilson theorem, but if you're not formal, you lose information. And A-infinity algebras are the answer to the question: how can I pass to cohomology and not lose information? And so, I don't know. So, a choice of section, really this is called a like a homotopy retract between a co-chain complex and its homology. I'll just be brief. So, you choose a section of cohomology back into co-cycles, and you also need a section of setting boundaries back into. The code chains they came from. So I need a section of the differential and I need a section of the projection to cohomology. Essentially, all this is doing is it's, you could also just think of it, I'm decomposing every C into boundaries plus cohomology, right? So this together makes up the co-cycles, and then I submit. And then L, which is the lifts of co-boundaries in the next degree. So you just make this choice in every degree, determines all the data that you need to relate the DG algebra C with, so I should say I'm starting with C, the multiplication. See the multiplication of DDA that determines an A infinity alpha structure on the cohomology of that Cochrane complex and also in terms of an infinity morphism, which I won't. extending I. So I should say that this F is a tuple Fn and greater than 1, and each one has Fn goes from H tensor N to C of degree 1 minus N. But the first one, so this is But the first the first one, so this extending i, extending Yoda, which means that yoda is f1. So an infinity, an A infinity morphism is this data. Of course, there's a lot of conditions. Yeah, so you actually get this data, that is a quasi-isomortion. And then I guess another thing I should say is that, all right. So how do you get from pure to deformation theory? I'll just go toward that. There's also some things to be said about the relationship between the MNs and the massy products. Basically, certain massy products for certain defining systems can be realized as an MN, certain N-Massy products, or certain choices of Hands in box. There's certain choices of defining a system. Now you wonder if it has enough to control deformation theory. It actually does. So maybe what I'll do right away is I'll just say, what's the Mohr con functor of an A infinity algebra? It extends the notion that I wrote down for Lie algebras. A with its maximum ideal. So I'll look C in, and this is, of course, you could think of this H as being this H here, but this is for a general infinity algebra, including a DG algebra with the property that the sum of the NF expansions. Some of the actions are this doesn't have the one half that the Lie algebra case had because we're doing associative and not Lie. There's sort of a one-half factor that appears when you pass to that. So, in particular, the right-moore-Cartan notion for the associative, for a DG algebra, not a DG Li algebra, doesn't have that one half. But then you just One half. And then, but then you just, and then that would just be m1 plus m2, and you just extend it, and again, you can just make a sort of a linear extension. Okay, and then this sum will be finite, by the way, because I'm thinking of A as being part. And Mn. Every Mn sort of has a, therefore, like N copies of maximal ideal on it. So the nilpotence of the maximal ideal means that this is, the sum is finite. Maybe I just basically. Sorry, maybe I just missed the last thing you said, but essentially apply it to psi tensor with itself. I apply it to psi tensor. Yes, yes, thank you. Yeah, thanks. And then where is this actually happening? This is happening at H2. Right, because the MN, this, this is Right? Because the Mn, this is greater than degree n, and the nn is greater than degree 2 minus n. Okay? And then it's also a theorem that people usually attribute to Konsevich. Certainly that was written down by him in the L infinity case, the Lee case of this stuff. Which is that, all right, and there's also a gauge action. Say that. Oh, it's H0. And then that gives you your quotient account MC bar. And then the theorem is that that is quasi-isomorphic and is an invariant. Okay. Okay, so then what we can, what you can then check actually. Right, okay, so the Mohr Parton functor of the So the same things I said before about this gauge action is strict, is the sort of conjugation that gives you strict equivalence on representations. And then so you get that this Warpachton set is the frame deformation functor and then this is the deformation functions. Is the deformation functor. Okay, but now how to, now next, what I want to do is relate this to deformation rings. And in the process, I'll give you a faithful definition of A-infinity algebras. Let's be more specific. I want to actually present a deferred, right? We had this presentation before by the symmetric power algebra on the H1. Okay, you do it as follows. So first you suspect the source and target of the MN. And then this, now you've made them all have the same degree. Now you've made them all have the same degree. So it was degree 2 minus n. Now we just look at what happens. Now it's degree 1. And then you can put them all together, add them up. All right, and then what you do here is that you extend, you just and then make a complete a co-free co-algebra out of this. So is it? Alright, so what is a free, a co-free, co-complete co-algebra? It's this thing, but that's just the completed version, but it's complete, but it's a co-algebra, right? So dual to product is the sum, right? So here. Sum now of all degrees, thinking of k being this one degree of this. Of this, and then with this here being a coderivation, and then you can extend, but so far we just had this, then you just extend this, extend to that same sum using the co-lightness rule. Using the color lightness rule. And then, yeah, you just take, it's a free algebra, you take the free colour algebra, you take the co-multiplication. And then what we've just done is called the bar construction. All right, and now I can give you a concise definition of the relations on all the m and n's that make it in the infinity algebra. The infinity algebra. So facts is, or yeah, fact is that all these mn's is an A infinity algebra structure, right? Because I haven't used anything about those conditions. I just used that it was at a certain grade and degree. It's an A infinity algebra. If and only if its suspension is a co- A codifferential. In other words, it's square zero. And then the star construction is actually an isomorphism of categories between A infinity algebra and then cofree. And then co-free, co-conclave suspension? I just shift by a degree. Yeah. So, like now H1 is in degree zero. Now, to get from here to a deformation ring, that's just things actually work all this decently, assuming that each degree of H is quite exponential. It's whatever, I think they're an isomorphic category, so whichever you prefer. At least it makes the definition concise. Right, so let's turn things around. So you can make, so that's, if this is what you might call R of H M, then maybe I'll call the R star, the pretty dual bar construction. If you just take the dual degree by degree of that thing, right? Then we get something that we're a bit more familiar with. We get And then you can take the dual, linear dual of everything degree by degree. Alright, so now we have a complete free DG algebra. And this basically, the idea is that this is the deformation word. So uh Pom V G of Fire Star A being a classifier ring. And by the way, it could be non-commutative, it could make sense of this. It is actually do row. Right. And that just comes from the fact that this you can this follows from relating the Mohr-Cartan functor to this bar construction in so-called twisting elements. But what I want to go on to say right away, since there's not much time, is that we can then get a formula for the deformation rate out of this. It's like, what actually do these tops look like? Look like. We're talking about comms from the suspension to A, but A is classical, right? So if I'm running my differential here. So what are these Hongs? I need this to commute. Well, first of all, this is classical, and this is a free object, so it's completely determined by, just as we saw at the beginning of the lecture. Of the lecture, sorry, I didn't put a dual. Factors through H1 dual. And I guess if A is, I'm thinking of A is commutative, so sure, let's take symmetric. And then what's the condition that this commutes? Well, again, because the differential is sort of generated out of the dual of this thing here. Here, you just need to check on what ends up in graded degree 1, and that's exactly h2. So you only really need to worry about sigma h2. So on this side, you start with a differential defined here, going here, and then you extend it by the Lightness rule. So H2 star. And as a result, We get the R rho size working to see hat sigma star. Alright, so this is the degree zero piece of this whole thing. And then M star. Right, so it's it when those, again, so we see here. So we see here, for example, that when those higher operations vanish, right, when M3, M4, star, et cetera, are zero, then you get quite a bit of relations. Okay. Those are some of the fundamentals I wanted to get through, and then I had pages and pages of possible applications. So I guess I'll say that you can get some really cool qualities of this. So they also add to the So they also add that there's a there's an R-pointed version that you can define when these are distinct irreducibles. Then you can consider a nice sort of subspace of what was called xgen. Space of what was called Xgen. So you can take the Xgen for deformations with these Jordan, deforming these Jordan-Holder factors. And then within this, with a choice, you can make a so-called adapted moduli space. This is language of Bellius Chenevier in their book. And what are you doing here? What you're doing is saying this thing is representations of a completed group algebra. And you can take the completion of the kernel over. So, this is not quite, you can then take a further quotient, which would be the Cayley-Hamilton quotient, but we don't really need to do that. And then within here, you can get, right, so this thing has as a quotient the matrix algebra, sort of the diagonal sub-matrix algebra of the D-dimensional thing, with each of these, you know, being, say, D1-dimensional. Being, say, D1 dimensional. So it has that as a quotient, and you can lift, non-canonically, of course, but you can lift in potents. You can say, I'm going to have some inputs in here. But along this row map, under the sum of the row i, there's r of these hidempotents, so r of hidempotents, and they map to just the And they map to just the identity in this matrix algebra, the identity in this one, and so forth. So, one, one, one, one. Let's go. That's the first one, the second one. And this is a closed subscheme saying I want to send each of these idipotents in the group algebra when I take an element of xz. Element of x gen, I actually want this sort of standard innipotent to land in that standard innipotent. So it's an additional rigidification. Right, and then the theorem would be, you can actually get that this. That this RG completion of the kernel. And then, if you apply a certain idempotent to it, which is the idempotent is the one which is 1000 in each part. And then this makes this into an augmented KR algebra, where Kr is just the field times itself R times. The r equals one case is that you actually get the associative deformation, right? If you symmetrize it, you get the deformation, right? And then there's just an r-pointed formula for this. Right. Right. So this is the case. Okay. So that's sort of basically one thing I haven't emphasized maybe is that this, because we're working with the associative theory, not an auto-b theory, we can have associative argon algebra to be our coefficients and make sense of non-community deformation functors, particularly really no sweat in addition. But then the result that follows from this is that Is that x add is then spec, if you think about, okay, I want sort of r-pointed maps, right? I want to preserve these indipotents and send them in, is spec of a certain completion, that I call cyclic, of H1 star over sigma M star over the sigma H2 star. Alright, so the cyclic completion is that if you think of your R points as a bunch of vertices, et cetera, and then you think of each, a choice of basis of each basis element of X1 row, that's one to two, right? So row two, row one. 2, row 1, and so forth. So you draw, if this thing is just a matrix algebra, or sorry, a matrix of H1s, of X's, right, of row 1, I by row J. And then you pick a basis, you draw arrows. I want to complete at the ideal generated by all the cycles. That's sort of the natural topology that comes up in that generic matrices thing or the adjoint thing. So we get a presentation with this, and then it's a fact that you can operate on this. Operate on this by GMR. So, what are the adjoint actions that fix these determinants, these idempotents? You take the torus in the center of each of these GLDI factors. So you have this action, and then from this, you can get the pseudo-deformation ring. So RPS of that row, meaning the sum of the R things, is this thing. This thing geometry invariance. And from there, you can then get that, you know, the cycles can give you tangent vectors and so forth. And because a torus is linearly reductive, you can actually get counts on both tangent vectors and obstructions. Some obstructions arise from the invariant theory itself. So just a little bit. Itself. So just oh, this will be the last thing I'll say. So it's the path, this free algebra is, sorry, this regular local rings GM invariance GMR invariance over this thing is GM invariance. This thing is GM invariance. GMR invariance. Right, so this is, and they, so of course the M star is a, that's the unknown, but the rest is just combinatorially computable, and you can actually measure tangent dimension, obstruction, dimension, upper bound. All right, so I'll stop there. Thanks.
