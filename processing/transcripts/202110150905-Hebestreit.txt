It'll be more convenient. And the reason I want to add this quadratic notation is because this thing actually has to do with the quadratic form. It's the polarization of the sort of standard quadratic form you have on Z22. So just as a bit of motivation, why do I care about these? So people are probably used to, well, the moduli space of curves mapping to the moduli space of principally polarized above and varieties or in differential topology language, the mapping glass group of surfaces mapping to the symplectic group by evaluating the different. Simplectic group by evaluating the diffeomorphism, the action on H1. Crucially, in dimension two, that map is subjective. Every symplectic matrix is realized by an automorphism on the surface. But in recent years, these sort of higher versions of surfaces have risen to prominence. These manifolds, Sn cross Sn connect some with itself G times. N is one that is the surface of genus G, but these things exist in every even dimension. And you can do something entirely similar. You can take a diffeomorphism, let it act on the middle homology. And then it's a theorem of track. Homology. And then it's a theorem of track that if you're in dimension, say 4k plus 2, i.e., this n in the sphere is odd, you don't get the entire symplectic group. What you get is this quadratic subgroup, except when you're in one of the hot dimensions. So 2, 2, 6, and 14 are special. And if you do this with even spheres and get a 4k dimensional manifold, you end up with this quadratic lattice. That's just what happens. This is one reason one might care about these things. Upshot is: I want to consider all four of these groups, so now all four sequences. Groups, so now all four sequences of these groups simultaneously. And whenever things hold generically, I will just denote them by gg and state something for gg that there's always meant to be one of these four groups. Okay, so just as a little, I don't know, blurb about what's going on. So I want to get at the chromology of these things. I wrote out the homology here because then the torsion shows up a bit earlier. And of course, the abelianizations of these things are completely known. I mean, I wrote out the symbectic cases here. The precise values are not going to matter. The precise values are not going to matter for the talk. I just wanted to somehow give the flavor of these things. Then you can also look at the second cohomology. There's the famous Z here in degree two that's sort of responsible for the signature of surface bundles over surfaces. And if you look into this quadratic case, there's actually, this is not completely known as far as I'm aware. So this thing here is shaded yellow because Manuel Kranik and I worked it out in the coffee break on Monday. I checked the calculation again, but take. I check the calculation again, but take it with a like largish grain of salt. And then somehow genus 2 to 6, I am certainly not aware that there's a complete computation there. And then Mano Alexander Coopers calculated somehow the eventual value this has. Okay, but as far as I know, like genus 6 is what the answer is. But as you can see from this slide, all of these things eventually stabilize. That's, of course, a systematic phenomenon, which, I mean, just to get it out of the way. Which, I mean, just to get it out of the way, these groups all have homological stability. The stability slopes are all known to be one-half or two, depending on how you index things. So this is one way of like, I've chosen the best common bound that I know. Like if you like in some of these cases, it's a little bit better, but they all have stability of slope one-half. Some cases were originally done by Chani. This was generalized by Mirzai and von der Kahn, and then there's many sort of little. And von der Kahn, and then there's many sort of little improvements. And I think the ultimate results that really cover all four groups are Jutanina Friedrich's in her thesis a couple of years ago. And the goal for today is just to look at the stable part. So I don't want to care about these stability ranges so much and rationally they're better and so on, but let's just look at the stable of this co-model. So yeah, as we've seen many times, the rational stock was computed a long time ago by Porrel in all. By Borel, in all of these cases, and many, many more. And the answer is just I've collected it here. So, the symplectic group, you get classes in every degree 2 mod 4. In the orthogonal case, you get classes in degree 0 mod 4. And I've also written out here the general linear case, which Sando already mentioned in his talk on Monday, that you get these classes in degree 5 plus 1. And, well, they're not degree, so they happen to be exterior. Be exterior. And one observation is that the rational cohomology does not depend on this quadratic decoration. It's somehow the same whether you look at the quadratic thing or the non-quadratic thing. I still don't know whether there's an a priori reason for this. It certainly pops out of this calculation if you just look at what kinds of things. And so at the start of the subject of emission K-theory, I mean, when Karubi wrote his papers that really started the subject, one of the correlators he deduced was that the chromology I basically deduced was that the chromology of these odd orthogonal groups and the symplectic groups, as long as you're willing to invert two torsion, you can somehow describe them in terms of this knowledge. If you look at the chromology with two inverted, there's these Borel classes here and here. And then all the rest of the chromology is just pulled back from the general linear group. So it's just literally tensed with the image of whatever comes from the general linear group. But in 1980, not much was known about this. 80, not much was known about the stable cohomology of the general linear group, so he couldn't go much further. But this changed somehow with the advertise, I mean, with the advances in algebraic K-theory, these general linear groups became attackable. Again, as Sander pointed out on Monday, this was done by Dwyer and Mitchell. The answer depends a little bit on what the prime is like. So for a regular prime, I mean, I'm solely going to be talking about regular primes and irregular primes. There's an extra term which is understood. Understood, it's complicated, but understood at Van Diver primes, and it's mysterious at non-Vandiver primes. But let me just ignore that completely. So they worked out that the cohomology of G L Z at an odd prime, it looks like this. It again has Liebes-Borel classes here. And then there's some classes which appear in multiples of the prime or close to multiples of the prime period 2p minus 1. So I guess in Frank Caligari's talk, we were looking at whether prime and the We were looking at where the prime and the n is large and the prime is large, and then if you look in low homological degrees, these classes don't show up. But I mean, this is what the full answer is. And of course, at the time, it was contingent on the Kronich-Baum conjecture, but I mean, that has now been proven by non-conditional. So now that we know the cohomology of GL, you can go back to this Karubi theorem and ask, can you work out what the image of this cohomology is in the symplectic group and in the orthogonal group? And indeed, you can. And indeed, you can. And so I wrote the theorem maybe due to us. So this is not, I mean, this means we prove it, but we're not sure we're the first to prove it. So here's the complete answer for the stable cohomology of these orthogonal and symplectic groups with odd and regular coefficients. You can just write it out exactly as you replace the Borel classes of the general linear group. You replace them by the Borel classes for your Replace them by the Borel classes for the orthogonal and symbolic groups. And then you have to check out what's the image from the general linear group. And the statement is the Borel classes go to zero and the rest inject. That's the statement. Somehow it's as simple as could possibly be. Again, it doesn't depend on the decoration. So you can just work this out. And somehow this uses nothing in methods that wasn't available 10 years ago. So somehow this could already be in the literature. We didn't find it. So I'd be very happy if somebody knew about this and could point it out to me. Knew about this and could point it out to me. But if it would, I mean, it certainly comes out of what we do. But it's also not the real advanced that I want to talk about. The real, somehow, the thing that wasn't attackable until recently is the two primary part. So it's again, if you drop this regularity, then somehow Veniver things start happening. But the two primary part was completely inaccessible until a few years ago. But not a few years ago, until like our series last year, two years ago or something. So, I mean, again, So, I mean, again, this is, I wrote down the F p cohomology because that it's a nice clean answer, but in principle, you can also look at the p torsion, and in these cases, you can actually also work out what the p torsion and the integral cohomology is. But again, let me stick with F2 coefficients just to be able to make a clean statement. So here's the answer. The stable cohomology in all of these four cases, you can completely write out. And here it is. Okay, so now breathe for a moment. I don't want to really go. I don't want to really go through this. I mean, there's some numerology. Where do the Borel classes go? What are the classes that I've written here? And so on. I mean, it's a 20-minute talk, so maybe that's not worth attempting. The upshot is one can compute these things now. The F2 cohomology, you can completely write down. I've written down the cohomology for GLZ here at the bottom for comparison. So, for example, the classes here that are named, the way that the classes at the bottom here are named, these really. At the bottom, here are named these really are pulled back from the general linear group, um, and so on. But uh, yeah, I don't think I want to go to the piece area. Can I ask just a quick question? So, I mean, for the cohomology, even just for GL, I mean, one, you might say it's, quote, more natural to first compute the K groups, and this is some secondary computation. So, analogously here, I don't know if it's easier or was known that the symplectic K-theory at the Plectic k-theory at the prime two. Do you also know this was not known? This is precisely the advanced. So, if you give me two slides, it's going to be okay. Here is the method of proof which precisely explains what you asked. Yes. So, no, the syntactic K-groups at prime two were not known. This is somehow what came out of, like what this is based on. Yeah. Right. So, yeah, one thing I wanted to mention is: so, this is the F2 cohomology. This is I stated here because this I can cleanly write down, but also in many of these cases. Write down, but also in many of these cases, we can say a lot about the integral cohomology, the two torsion in the cohomology. So I've collected some things together here. For example, in this odd symmetric case, you can completely write down what the two torsion is. You take the orthogonal group over the integers, you can just embed it into the general linear group over the integers and then reduce it mod three. That's something we can do, or we can tensor it up to the reals and then give it a topology. Then the group, the topological group OGG over the reals, is homotopy equal. OGG over the reals is homotopy equivalent to two copies of the standard sort of definite orthogonal group over the reals. And you just project to say the positive definite part. That gives you a map from like OGG of Z to GL2G over F3 and to like the standard the bottom of group over the reals. And the statement is these two maps together induce an isomorphism in two local, like on the two torsion and the integral part of the homology. And the left-hand side, you can just go look up in books. Can just go look up in books. So we can completely understand, for example, the two torsion in the chromology of this orthogonal group. And similarly, as an example, we can now just work out what the cohomology is integrally at like low values. There might eventually come extension problems and there might be a spectral sequence away from the actual answer. We haven't sort of figured that out all out, but in low degrees, we can certainly work that out. Again, I've made these yellow because this is a calculation that we have checked once. The other calculations are we have checked. The other calculations are we have checked many times now. So, again, take the actual answers here with a slightly smaller grain of salt, but still with a grain of salt. They are subject to our idiocy, but they can certainly be calculated. Okay, and I guess my, I mean, when did I actually start? Like 23, 20. I mean, when am I supposed to finish now? 23, 25, something reasonable. I didn't know. 25, yeah. I didn't know that. 25. Yeah. Okay, wonderful. Great. So, yeah, I picked these two examples of the symphonic group. Something similar happens in the patriotic case. Let me not try to give more examples. Let me talk about like how do we access this stuff. And as Frank Caligari just asked, yes, this is true K-theory. And so recall, again, for example, from Sanders' talk that the stable cohomology of the general linear group is the same as the cohomology of the K-theory space integrally. K-theory space being defined as. K-theory space being defined as some sort of homotopical group completion of the category of projected modules, rather than the groupoid of projected modules. And this thing has an analog. So in Tony Fang's talk, he talked about symplectic K-theory, which is the same thing. You replace all projected modules, you replace them by the groupoid of unimodular anti-symmetric or unimodular symplectic forms over your ring. But actually, I mean, this works. You can take unimodular symplectic forms, you can take symmetric forms, you can take quadratic. forms you can take symmetric forms you can take quadratic forms you can take skew quadratic forms you can take many more types of forms in particular we needed a naming scheme which is not like ksp and then you need this group to have a name so we call them all grotney bit spaces so the statement is just whenever you have like a type of form lambda which i mean i hope it's clear what i mean here by plus minus s plus minus q skew symmetric forms symmetric forms quadratic variants the homology the stable homology of these types of groups can always be calculated Types of groups can always be calculated as the stable A, as the cohomology of the appropriate K-theory space, which we call the Gordon-bit space for that parameter. Okay, yeah, and the example is in like the KSP from yesterday is the case minus symmetric for the purposes translating. Okay, so the question is: like, so this completely, yeah, I never need to talk about these groups again from now on. I can just say something about these spaces, and like it was very. And like it was very for a very long time, these have been attackable up to either two torsion or if two is a unit in the input ring. And that's what we changed. Somehow, this is where the sort of step forward in knowledge that goes into these calculations comes from. So what we showed among them with the nine of us in this paper series is, and this applies uniformly to an arbitrary numbering, that you can describe these Dortney-Wid spaces as follows. So the first thing is they always sit in a So, the first thing is they always sit in a fiber sequence with a k-theoretic part and what's called an L-theoretic part. So, I don't expect everybody knows what L-theory is. Let me just say it's a higher version. Like its homotopy groups are higher bit groups that are based on like derived forms. So, this is very much a derived thing. It originated in geometric topology. Probably this definition is due to Roninsky. Well, I guess the groups are due to Michenko, the spaces are due to Reninsky. And this was a conjecture by Hasselhov and Manson, that you can somehow put Cordy-Width theory in. That you can somehow put Courtney-Wid theory into this vibration sequence, and this we were able to solve. And furthermore, this sequence splits up the universe two. So, the moment we know that, and somehow let me say here, this epsilon is just the sine plus minus one. I don't know, I probably should have written plus minus one. So the epsilon just refers to the sine that you have there. The s is supposed to be saying you look at the symmetric form parameter. And the so the k-theory part here, you have to take the homotopy order. Part here, you have to take the homotopy orbits for some action. That action depends on the sign. So that's why the K-theory also gets an epsilon there. That's just to denote which action you approve. Okay, point is these spaces, K-theory and L-theory, individually, they have been well understood for quite some time. So like this sequence splits if you invert two, so you can just read off what the odd primary cohomology of this thing is, as long as you know the outside. That takes care of the odd primary. That takes care of the odd primary part. But the sequence is not so good. So, for example, this is precisely if you like evaluate this sequence on, like, what is it, k pi 4i plus 2 or so, you get this sequence that Galazius, Venkatesh and Tony Feng, that they analyzed, like that we heard about yesterday. This sequence is, however, not very useful at prime 2. It somehow organizes the information very poorly. So, instead, one looks at a different way of describing the Word New Width space, and then you can just. Way of describing the Gortny-Witt space, then you can just forget from the Gortny-Witt space to the K-theory space, just forget that you have a form that induces a map, lands in the fixed points for the dualization action, and turns out that's a two-local equivalent. That was known as Thomason's homotopy limit problem. I guess this is, I mean, this is only one case. He conjectured this in much greater generality, but for number rings, it was also not known. This also comes out. And again, so this allows us to determine the two primary cohomology, even with two torsion and everything, as long as we can get a hand. With two torsion and everything, as long as we can get a handle on the K-theory well enough with this point. So, the first two points here really take care of the symmetric part. And the question is: how do you pass from the symmetric to the quadratic part? That's what this point three is about. Namely, well, whenever you have a quadratic form, it has a polarization, which is a symmetric form, that induces a sort of polarization on these Bortney mid spaces from the epsilon quadratic thing to the epsilon symmetric thing. And very surprisingly, we were able to prove that this is an isomorphism past degree. Is an isomorphism past degree three. So these spaces they're not all that different for any numbering, which was quite surprising and had not even been conjectured somehow. There was no numerical evidence to play with. These things were computed in degrees like one and two, and nobody knew, like there was no, nobody could guess this, it seems. So anyway, that's just true. This does not translate into the fact that the homology agrees in high degrees. Homotopy agreeing in low degrees is the same as homology. Agreeing in low degrees is the same as homology agreeing in low degrees, but homotopy agreeing in high degrees is not the same as homology agreeing in high degrees. So there's still something to do. But for example, as an immediate application, if you just run the actual calculations for the integers, you just find this sort of fighter sequence, the width space, like the zero component of the quadratic version, the symmetric version. There's only a Z2 difference. So you can just run the SAS spectral sequence on this thing and get from the symmetric to the quadratic version. And then maybe the final thing I'll mention, and then I'll stop, is that. I'll mention and then I'll stop. Is that we can completely generally show that this polarization map on homotopy, its kernel and co-kernel are always eight torsion. So, in particular, that polarization map is always an isomorphism for any ring. If you're willing to neglect two torsion, i.e., if you invert two on the outside, and that statement again persists to homology. So, the homology of the sort of quadratic variants and the symmetric variants, they agree as long as you're willing to invert two, like always, for any ring, in fact. This is not something. ring this is not something uh that's particular to number rings and i guess uh my time is up so let me let me stop with that let's thank our speaker um unfortunately we only have about five minutes for questions but if you have any questions uh please either pipe up in the in the zoom chat uh you can you can type or speak and people in You can type or speak, and people in person can also speak up. So, this is probably a naive question, but I mean, the Quiller-Lichtenbaum conjecture gives a nice description of these K-groups in terms of italic homology, of the number fields in terms of these italic homology groups, which allows people who understand those, but not K-groups, to understand them. In this case, here, I mean, can you hope? Can you hope for such a sort of direct description? Or at least in terms of? I'm not sure. So, the attempt somehow that one always makes in Hermitian K-theory is to describe the relative difference to algebraic K-theory. And this is somehow completely captured by this term, which is much, much, much simpler than either K-theory. It's like wid groups are so much easier than K-groups. So, I don't, I mean, for these kind of calculations, that's probably not. For these kinds of calculations, there's probably not much benefit to doing so. And so the simple answer is: I don't know. Of course, you can now, I mean, these things should become checkable. But the simple answer is I do not know. I mean, you can certainly sheafify what we with theory, get in, like we prove that it has a risky descent, so you can make the etal sheaf, and then you can ask, is there a Lichtenbauer type statement? Because that's true in K-theory, you can translate it into L-theory, and then probably. Translated into L theory, and then probably it's not quite true, but you can try to describe the failure and so on. I cannot say more than that at the moment. So, your theory allows for like an involution on the ring, right? So, one could talk about unitary groups. Do you know where I could find a computation like unitary K-theory? Is it in your papers? Let's say signature GG of like integers. Like integers, but with respect to some kind of evolution on the integers that you wish to take. Oh, so the unitary group will be with respect to some quadratic extension. Let's say, like, z adjoint i. Ah, yeah, so certainly not in our paper. That is not something we've done. Like in the paper, the actual computations that we've done, like where we actually somehow write down what the groups are, they're basically restricted to the integers. There's work by, like, if you're willing to neglect two torsion, again, there's work by us. Erstvar, Wendigs, and then there's some third guy whose name I forget in the Cambridge Journal of Mathematics, where they worked out lots of things for numberings in greater generality. I'm not sure whether they allow for the involution or not. But I mean, certainly this is lookupable. I can, if you if you want, I mean, I don't know off the top of my head a place where you can you can go look and see what the answer was. Like up to two torsion, we have nothing, and if you're willing to neglect two torsion, we have little to contribute. Basically, everything we do is known. The point is that we. Basically, everything we do is known. The point is that we can get at the two-tortion and remove this assumption that two is a unit in the ring. And but I think we remove that assumption, we've worked out the case of the integers, nothing else is done at the moment. There's like a big playground of things you can now go and attack. If you're willing to neglect contortion, then this might be known, but I wouldn't know where to look immediately. Should we thank Fabian again and have a two-minute break?
