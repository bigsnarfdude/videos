Indeed, thank you, Frank, for the introduction. So this is the third lecture in this mini-course, and so today I will mostly focus on Higgs bundles and explain how they relate to the twisted local systems that I defined and studied last time. And so, in particular, we will need And so, in particular, we will need to introduce Higgs bundles for non-constant groups in order to be the analytic counterpart of the twisted local systems that I spent quite some time defining in the past two lectures. Okay, so this is what this is really about is a kind of refinement of a major result of Major result of the 80s by Hitchin, Donaldson, Colette, and Simpson, which has come to be known as the non-abel and Hodge correspondence or non-abel-Hodge theory, and which basically sets up a correspondence between two very quite different kinds of objects, really. So, on the one hand, okay, we work over the same space X, which is supposed to be a very important thing. X, which is supposed to be a smooth projective manifold, but Ng is a reductive group, a complex reductive group. But you see on this side, you define these local systems. These are topological objects, okay? These are really parameterized by the representations of the fundamental group, the so-called Betty-model die space that I mentioned. Moduli space that I mentioned last time. And as you know, this doesn't require a complex structure on X. It's really just about the pi one of the object being finitely generated. And then you can study the representations into a reductive Lie group. And just like that, without any structure on X, you will have, even if the group is not on the group, on this representation space, you will have the structure of an affine variety, right? Idea, right? So, this does not involve the algebraic or analytic structure of X. Okay, on the other hand, what appears on this side very much involves the algebraic or analytic structure of X. It depends on it just for the objects to make sense. So, these are called G-Higgs bundles. So, these are kind of complicated objects, but Of complicated objects, but at the heart of it, they are holomorphic bundles. Okay, so you need a holomorphic structure on the base to even just talk about the object. All right. So I really want to emphasize this point. And the correspondence that you get is sort of already miraculous from this point of view. And the fact that you get a homeomorphism is really, as we will see, the best thing you can hope. As we will see, the best thing you can hope for because the two algebraic varieties that you have here parametrizing these objects are quite different, okay, from in their algebraic structure. So, again, here on this side, we already know what the moduli space looks like. It is this affine variety. So, maybe I should say it. It's an affine variety over the Over the complex numbers. Okay, and it's important that I mean, that's the meaning of this double bar here. That we're not considering, I mean, the points of this space are not all the G-local systems, but only those with completely reducible monodromy. Okay, so remember that any local system is parameterized by a monodromy representation, so a morphism, group morphism from pi 1x to g, but G but in the correspondence, I mean, for this to be a bijection, and also, in fact, here, just to have or to understand the point of the moduli space, you need the condition that the monogramy be completely reducible. And I recall, I remind you that this means that if the image of the representation is contained in a parabolic subgroup, then it has to in fact be contained in the Levy factor. Contained in the levy factor of a parabolic subgroup. Okay. Yeah. Which is something that you can also think about this way. So this is the condition for having completely reducible monodrome. Okay, let's not insist on that now. We've seen this already in the past lecture, and today I really want to focus on this side of the correspondence. The correspondence. Please feel free to interrupt me if you have any questions and/or just enter them on the chat, and I'll be happy to answer. Okay. So here I just wanted to mention that, as we saw last time at the end of the previous lecture, there is also another kind of correspondence, which is called the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. called the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence through which we can see this well the objects on the left-hand side as also as holomorphic objects, okay? In fact, as G-bundles with integrable connection and completely reducible monodromy. Okay, so this is kind of a third point of view on the same object. So here we have this purely topological point of view. This purely topological point of view. Here we have an analytic modelized space of, well, modelized space of analytic objects called Higgs bundles. And here we have a different kind of modelized space of analytic objects, which are bundles with integrable connection. Okay, so you've probably heard that before. We have, in fact, three moduli spaces, the Betty moduli space, which we have talked about at length, the Dalbo moduli space, which is the subject of Space, which is the subject of today's lecture. And then here is the Duram moduli space. Okay, so I would not focus too much on this one today, but of course it's also very important in the story. And the fact that you have these three moduli spaces is related, in fact, to Hitchin's original motivation to study the subject, which was finding complete hyperkilometrics on non-compact. On non-compact Fiemanding manifolds. And this is an example. So, if you know the definition of the hypercaler manifold, you know you have these three complex structures, and these are exactly what they are: the Dolbo, the Duran, and the Betty complex structure. Okay, so in fact, for the first part of this lecture, I will focus on a case which is much more Case which is much more intuitive, and in which, in fact, is needed really if you want to understand the non-Ebelen-Hautch correspondence, which is the case where the Lie group G is just GLRC. Okay, so then you know that a principal GLRC bundle can be thought of equivalently as a rank R vector bundle, which is the same as a locally free module on the structure sheaf of the variety. Of the variety. Okay. And the reason why I want to do that is that here it's much, much easier to see the analogy between a connection and a Higgs field. Okay, so remember that the connection on a vector bundle on a locally free OX module is a way to derive the section, to differentiate the sections. And so you will differentiate a local section of E to a one form. To a one-form with values in the same bundle, okay. And so this really should be thought of as some kind of differential operator, and as such, it satisfies a Leibniz identity. Okay, so a connection is a C linear map, okay, satisfying the Leibniz identity. And a Higgs field, you see, I can write it very similarly. Can write it very similarly. So it also goes from a locally free OX module to this tensor product by one forms. But this time it's not a differential operator. It doesn't satisfy a Leibniz identity. Instead, it's linear with respect to functions. So everything happens as if this part had disappeared. And in fact, there is an intermediate notion between the connection and the Higgs field that shows that the Higgs field. Field that shows that the Higgs field is kind of a degeneration of a connection. Okay, so more generally, you have a notion of Lambda connection, where there is a Lambda here in the Leibniz identity. Okay, so this is called the Lambda connection. And then you see that the connection in the usual sense is just the Lambda equal one case, and the Higgs field is just the Lambda equals zero case. Okay, so in that sense, you have a kind of Sense you have a kind of family of lambda connections, and by when lambda tends to zero, the connection becomes a Higgs field, as Lambda tends to zero, in a way. So it's a degenerate, you can really think of a Higgs field in this case as a degenerate version of a connection. All right. Even easier when the rank of the When the rank of the bundle is one, then a Higgs field is just a holomorphic one for. Okay? So that's because, well, okay, we had a morphism from E to omega 1 X tensor E, which you can think of as a section of as E star tensor E tensor omega 1. Okay, or equivalently. Or equivalently, because E star tensor E is just the endomorphism bundle, it's a one form with value in the endomorphism bundle of X. And the point is that this endomorphism bundle, when the rank is one, when this is line bundle, it's just trivial. Okay, the dual is an inverse for line bundles. Okay, so you can just ignore this part in the rank one case. Just ignore this part in the rank one case, and the Higgs field is just a holomorphic one form. Okay, also, we know that the flat line bundles or these local systems, maybe I should say here, I really want to think of them as rank one local systems like two spaces. They are parametrized by this cohomology group, okay, which is very easy to describe because this group here is abelian. Okay, this C star. And in fact, okay, well, this we always have, but the point is when the dimension of x is equal to one, okay, and maybe I should say that x Is compact connected human surface. So you see it has a genus, and then it's very easy exercise to show that this, I mean, if you know presentation of the fundamental group with two G generators and one relation, well, that relation is just the product of the commutators, so it's automatically satisfied in the Nibelian. In the Nabelian group, and then you just need to specify the image of the generators to get a representation. Okay, so this set really, you can think of it as an affine variety, and it's just a product of C star with itself, 2G times. All right, so this is again quite explicit. Okay, so now let's start to compare these two kinds of objects, these rank one local systems of vector spaces, and there's Of vector spaces and these rank one Higgs bundles. So, the key to doing that in dimension one, I could, I mean, it would not be much more difficult to prove the non-Abinhaut correspondence in rank one over an arbitrary base. But then, when the dimension is one, I can actually just linearize the whole situation and use by using the exponential exact sequence, and then everything just. Exact sequence, and then everything just becomes an application of known results. So it's easier when on top of looking at rank one, you just consider dimension one. So let me explain this more directly. So recall the exponential short exact sequence or sequences because we have two of them. So this is the sheaf of locally constant functions with values in C, and this is the sheaf of holomorphic functions. And this is the sheaf of holomorphic functions with the values in c. Okay, so of course, if you take an exponential like this, it will stay locally constant or holomorphic, but now it won't take value zero. And the kernel is the same in both cases. It's the function with value in z or maybe two pi z. Okay, and since this is discrete, well, if it's holomorphic, it has to be locally constant, so that's why there's an equal sign here. Here. Okay, so as you know, a short exact sequence of sheaves like this will induce a long exact sequence in cohomology. And I've written here the only part that is relevant for us, which is this. So this map is injective because actually the previous one is subjective. Okay, so it's not that the group is zero, it's just that the map, the previous map is subjective. And then the yeah, I mean, this one. Yeah, I mean, this one has to be the zero map. Okay. Anyway, we have exact sequences like this. And the last term is the H2 with coefficients in the first sheaf, which is the constant sheaf Z. And so here we know that, okay, again, if I'm looking at a compact Freeman surface of genus G, this is just Z, right? Uh, Z, right, and actually, this map has a name, it's the degree of the holomorphic line bundle whose isomorphism class is represented by an element in here. Okay, um, so the point is that, of course, this diagram commutes, but the maps are quite different. Here you have the degree, you can take any value here, so this is the Picard group, and it has connected components, in fact, indexed by the possible values of the degree. But here, all the flat line bundles. But here, all the flat line bundles, they have degree zero. Okay, so this map is zero. And so we will get two different, well, there are two different things that we can say depending on the line that we look at, the row that we look at. So the short exact sequence of the, sorry, the exactness of the sequence downstairs, it implies that the pre-image of zero, so the kernel of this map, has to be the image of that one. To be the image of that one, okay. And since this map is injective, the image of that one is isomorphic to this one modulo the kernel, which is this. Okay, so we get this isomorphism and degree zero line bundles, they form a variety which is called the Jacobian, okay, and which is homeomorphic to this. So, again, this is a complex torus, right? Because this is C to the G. Basically, the definition of the genus is to. Basically, the definition of the genus is the dimension of this vector space. And here we have z to 2g. All right. And then if we apply the same kind of argument for the first row of the previous diagram, well, it's the same except that now this map is zero. So instead of having just a fiber, I have the whole space. Okay, so the whole space of flat line bundles is equal to this. Okay, so you see. Is equal to this. Okay, so you see, if we want to compare this and that, since the denominator is the same here, we have to compare this and this. Okay, and this is where Hodge theory comes in in the guise of harmonic forms. Okay, so we really want to understand this map, which was here in the diagram. Okay, and so we apply our machinery. Machinery from the theory of Riemann surfaces. Okay, so here we have the cohomology with coefficients in a locally constant sheaf. And in fact, by Durand theorem, we have a resolution of this constant, yeah, locally constant, a constant sheaf, and then we can compute the comology using differential forms. So using the round complex. So, using the RAM complex. And then, by Hart's theorem, these cohomology classes here, every closed one form has a unique harmonic representative. So, harmonicity means being in the kernel of this Laplace or Laplace deltrami operator associated to D. So, you see, it's the RAM operator here, which induces the Here, which induces Laplacian, and then Hodge theorem tells me that every homology class here is represented by a unique harmonic form, okay, of the appropriate degree. And maybe a side remark is that these are C infinity objects. We are really doing real analysis here. Okay, there is a parallel story when the sheaf of coefficient is a coherent sheaf, namely in this case Ox. O x as likewise we can compute this homology group by our space by using the double bow resolution of this coherent sheaf, okay? Namely by closed PQ forms. So here the H1 will be the space of del bar closed 01 forms, modulo del bar exact 01 forms. Okay, so this is Dalbo's theorem. And again, because you And again, because you have this operator here, you have an associated Laplacian. And then Hart's theorem applies to this Laplacian. It's basically the ellipticity of this operator, which is the key, which tells you that there is a unique harmonic representative. Okay, and the definition is just the same. What one needs to take care of, or to be careful with, is that a priori is not the same Laplace. One is defined by One is defined by the Duram operator, the other one by the Dorbo operator. But the point is that a Riemann surface admits a Keller metric. And when you have a compact Keller manifold, you have the so-called Keller identities. So first of all, the operator D and del bar are always related because del bar is the 0, 1 part of E. Okay, so if you want, I can. Okay, so if you want, I can write something like this. All right. Okay, at least in the case that for one forms, in the case we are looking at. Okay, so we have a representation. Sorry, I mean the component of the Representation, sorry, decomposition like this. But the point is that on the Kerr manifold, there are some identities, a whole list of them that I'm not writing here, but that imply that the two Laplacian that Laplacians that I had before are actually comparable. And they have the same kernel. So that's really important. So it means that harmonicity here and harmonicity here is the same. Okay. So this is how decomposition is obtained, right? Because so we have this H1 with coefficient in this locally constant sheaf. By the Ram theorem, we can write it like this. And then because of the Keller identities and going through the harmonic forms, we obtain this decomposition here. Okay. But then again, by Dolbeau's theorem, these Dolbeau groups compute a cohomology with coefficients in a certain coefficient coherent. Here we had OX, it was the H1, which was actually computed by this one. And this is computed by this double cohort. Okay, so we have. So we have obtained a relation between the two H1 that we were looking at, and now the map that we were considering in the diagram is just a projection. Okay, so with this, I claim that it's enough to prove the abelian case of the non-abelian Hodge correspondence. So again, I'm assuming that the dimension of x is one. Yeah, indeed. So from the Hodge correspondence, Yeah, indeed. So, from the Hodge decomposition, so what we had is that the space of flat line bundles was written like this, okay, from the short exact sequence and the induced long exact sequence in homology. And now I've replaced this by Hodge theory by this thing here. And this subspace is, in fact, a subspace of the H1 coefficient in Ox. So, the quotient happens here. And this, as we have seen, Here, and this, as we have seen, is just the Jacobian discoursion. And these now are just the one forms. Okay, the global sections of the sheaf of holomorphic one-forms are just holomorphic one-forms on X. And that's how we get elements here, which are pairs L theta, where L is a rank one vector bundle of degree zero, and theta is just holomorphic one for. So that was. Holomorphic one flow. So that was the Higgs bundle, the rank one Higgs bundle, right? And as I was recalling earlier, this space of flat line bundles, okay, it's at least homeomorphic, or even if you take the better modelized space, it's exactly this as an algebraic variety. It's C star to the 2G. And now the Jacobian was this complex. Jacobian was this complex torus here, and this, well, okay, maybe it's also a G-dimensional vector space, right, over C because of cell duality. So you get this. So topologically, your space is a product of 2G circles and a product of 2G copies of the real numbers. And you find them again here because of polar decomposition. Because of polar decomposition, okay. Okay, so polar decomposition would be maybe with zero plus infinity, but then you take uh you take a look, uh, well, you take zero plus infinity, and then you take a log, and you will get r okay. So it's believable that these two spaces are in fact homeomorphic, but not non-Eben Hodge correspondence, even a priori, but the non-Eben Hodge correspondence gives us more information. Ben Haush correspondence gives us more information. It really tells us how the homeomorphism is obtained, right? And any questions? Okay, good. Okay, so even we can be more specific about the information that we. About the information that we have obtained so far. In the rank one case of the non-billion Hodge theory, so it's rank one case and it's also a curve, both assumptions are important. So the Betty space as an algebraic variety, it's this, right? It's this affine variety. And this space of fixed bundles, it's what will what is usually called in What is usually called in Simpson's terminology the Dolbeau space. You've seen the role of the Dolbeau theorem in that, so it's natural. And the space that we get, we saw it, right? It's a rank one degree zero line bundle, so it's a Jacobian. And these one form. But in fact, this product here naturally identifies with the cotangent bundle of the Jacobian. Okay, so it's not hard to see that this is the cotangent space at any point of the Jacobian. And the point is that since this is an algebraic group, its tangent and cotangent bundles are trivial. Okay, so that's why you find this. You can just trivialize the tangent bundle. And therefore, also the cotangent bundle. And this is the fiber at any point. It identifies with that. Okay, so we have. With that, okay, so we have this homeomorphism between the two as a consequence of the non-Neimal Hodge correspondence, but you see that algebraically and even analytically, these two spaces are very different. This is an affine variety, or if you think you're thinking in a complex analytic world, the Stein variety. And this one, on the other hand, it contains It contains, it's even fibered by a compact sub-variety. Okay, the Jacobian is a compact, complex variety. It's a complex torus. So these two can, I mean, this can never be affine because it contains these complete varieties, right? Okay, so that's an observation, but it's very important to have it in mind if you've never seen the Non-Nebel-Hodge correspondence. It's really either an occurrence of... Is really either an occurrence of categories or a homeomorphism between the moduli spaces, but it doesn't respect at all the algebraic or even a complex analytic structure. Okay, so now I want to move on to the higher rank case. So the point is that it's a long story that I will try to summarize. So there had been work by Kobayashi. Work by Kobayashi at the end of the 70s, beginning of the 80s, regarding the characterization of stability in the sense of algebraic geometry by means of solutions of certain PDEs. Okay, so I think this was already present in Kobayashi's work. And in the case that we're looking at, it was. case that we're looking at it was completely developed by Hitchin, Donaldson, Corlette and Simpson. So Hitchin and Donanson were really focusing on the rank two and four curves. And then this was generalized to arbitrary rank and arbitrary dimension by Colette and Simpson. Okay, if you look at the details of the proof, you can also. Okay, if you look at the details of the proof, you can also see some differences, but that's okay. Okay, anyway, we have this generalization, and that's why it's called non-Nabelian Haush theory, because basically we are moving away from the case of C star, which I have just recalled for you, to the case of GLRC, which is this non-abelian group now. Okay. Okay. So on the Betty side, Betty on the RAM side, here, we already know what to expect. We have these local systems of vector spaces, or flat vector bundles of rank R. And I claim that on the right-hand side, we have these. Right-hand side, we have these semi-stable hex bundles of rank R and degree zero. Okay, so this is what I now want to explain: how this actually obtained. In fact, I will focus on polystable, I mean here flat vector buttons with completely reducible monodromy, and here polystable Higgs buttons. So we've already talked about this condition on the flat vector bundle side. The flat vector bundle side, and I will today I will focus on the exponents. Okay, so exactly as in the rank one case, there was this intermediate step where to go from the Betty side to the RAM to sorry, to the Dolbo side, we needed to move through harmonic forms. What we did was linearize the problem by using the exponential exact sequence, then you Exact sequence, then use Hodge theory to in harmonic forms, in fact, to compare the two sides. That's how it works. Okay. And in higher rank, the replacement for harmonic forms is a much more complicated, but also richer object called a harmonic quantum. Okay, so this is Simpson's terminology. And the harmonic And the harmonic bundle is a quadruple consisting of, okay, it's a C-infinity vector bundle. So I think this is very important to stress is that there is no proof of the non-leman Haudenosaunee correspondence of a C, which doesn't go through this differential geometric approach. I mean, I think even in rank one, you cannot prove Hausdorff decomposition without this analysis, right? Then H. Then H is a Hermitian metric on the smooth vector bundle E. Okay, so maybe there's one word missing still. It's a complex vector bundle. Okay. Okay, then now that we have a Hermitian metric, it makes sense to speak of unitary connections. So these are the connections that are compatible with the metric. trick and finally the fourth object is a one form smooth one form on x which takes values in the Hermitian endomorphisms of the self-adjoint if you prefer endomorphisms of of E okay with respect to the metric H okay so this is just this quadruple and then to qualify as a harmonic And then to qualify as a harmonic bundle, these objects need to satisfy these three equations, okay, which are called the hitching equations. So these are the PDEs that one needs to solve in order to construct harmonic bundles. Okay. Right. So just as a side comment, this is very much related to the hypercaleb perspective, but I was. To the hypercaleb perspective, but I was mentioning. Okay, because in Hitchin's work, these are really three momentum map conditions. Okay, and it's because you have, so you start from basically the cotension space of the space of all unitary connections, and you have these three momentum maps on that space. And the so the cotangent space of the spate of connections has. Space of the spade of connections has a hypercaleous structure, and plus we have these three momentum maps. So the hypercalor quotient, which is exactly the set of solution modulog H, inherits a hypercalor structure. So in particular, three complex structure. And these three complex structures are exactly the Betty, Duram, and Dolber-Mondelei space. Okay, but this is not exactly the point of view I would like to pursue here. So instead, we want to focus. Want to focus on the way that the proof of dynamic Haus correspondence works based on Simpson's approach using harmonic bundles. And so one thing you can show, I mean, what is supposed to be the easy part is that you can go from harmonic bundles to both Higgs and flat bundles. Okay? Bundles. Okay, so let me explain first the fat bundle case. If you start with the harmonic bundle, so again, this quadruple of consisting of a bundle, a Hermitian metric, and a pair A, C satisfying the Hitching equations, then you can just forget the metric, okay, and form this nabla, which is A plus C, this will be. Which is a plus c, this will be a connection. Okay, it's not hard to show that if you sum a unitary connection with a Hermitian one form, you get a linear connection, so that's your nabla here. And the first two Hitchin equations are in fact equivalent to the flatness of this thinner connection here. Okay, so you get a flat vector boundary, all right, and then. And then, because you had also the third hitching equation here, in fact, the object that you get by forgetting the metric here, okay, the object that you get here has this extra property, and it turns out that it implies that it has completely reducible harmony. Okay, in fact, this will end up characterizing completely the image. Okay, in the sense that the converse will also hold, and that's the content of the Donovson-Colette theorem. Okay, but before we get to that, I just want to say that there is a second way of getting the metric on a harmonic bundle. And it's this time, you use the unitary connection, you take its one part, and then this will define a holomorphic structure on this Hermitian vector bundle. In fact, on this. In fact, on this complex vector bundle. So that's why it's denoted with a different letter because it's a holomorphic structure which is not related to the holomorphic structure that you get here by considering a flat bundle as a holomorphic one, at least in rank higher than two, it's not true. Okay, and then how to produce a Higgs field? Well, you just take the one zero part of this one form. Of this one form. And then the second and third Hitching equations will be equivalent to the fact that the Higgs field is holomorphic with respect to this holomorphic structure, and also it wedges with itself to zero. Of course, this condition is vacuous if I'm working on a curve, but what I'm telling you about here, I mean, this general way of constructing. General way of constructing flat and Higgs bundles from commanding bundles, it works in arbitrary dimension. Okay, and then what about the third Hitching equation in this case? First of all, one can observe that it can be written in a slightly different way, a way that involves only the Higgs field, okay, which is this, because now, yeah, okay, so it doesn't matter. Okay, so it doesn't matter however you write it, the result will be the same. It will imply that this object is polystable, so it's still a bit of a mysterious condition. But what I want to say is that basically this is the condition that controls being in the image of this map, okay, by definition. It's also true that each of these maps is injective, if you will. So the third condition, I mean, the first two. Third condition, I mean, the first two equations in each case, they tell me in which states I land. Okay. And then the third condition characterizes the image. So, yeah. Yeah. And this is how the correspondence is built, because then you have these two injected maps, okay? And then you will have a bijection between the images. All right. All right. So the point is to formulate this condition of being in the image in a more algebra geometric way, not so much using the PDE. Okay. So basically you see from the previous presentation that if you want to characterize what it means to be in the image, so when does a flat vector bundle come from a harmonic bundle by? A harmonic bundle by forgetting the metric in the sense I've just described. Well, you need to start from a flat-vector bundle and find sufficient conditions for the existence of a harmonic metric. Okay, so the first thing to realize is that if you put any metric, any Hermitian metric on a flat bundle, it will always decompose your connection between a unitary part, a unitary part or anti-Hermitian part, which is connected. Which is a connection, and the Hermitian part, which is the one form. Okay, so this, if you look at a matrix, you know that you can split the decompose a matrix between a Hermitian and the anti-Hermitian part. Okay, so if you start with the connection matrix, you will produce a connection and a one-form. Okay, and then because the connection is flat, so so far I haven't used the flatness, but because the connection is flat, these two A plus AM. These two a plus a m psi will satisfy the first two Hitching equations as we just saw. Okay, and then the theorem, which is due to the Donaldson Corlet, is the fact that if the connection is not only flat but has completely reducible horonomy, then there exists a metric such that if I look at this decomposition, the third hitching equation is also satisfied. Okay. Okay, so it means that in this case, E nabla comes from the harmonic model, right? So it's really saying that the image of this map is described by this condition of having completely reducible harmony. Okay, so of course you want something similar for harmonic metrics. And then on a Higgs bundle, so this time this is a Bundle. So this time this is a holomorphic bundle. Okay. So now if you put a harmonic Hermitian matrix on it, the holomorphic structure on E will always determine a Chern connection. So it's a unitary connection which is compatible with the holomorphic structure. And in that sense, it is unique. And if you fix a metric, you can also use your You can also use your Higgs field to produce a Hermitian one form. Okay, you just have something, you just want to produce something that is self-adjoint endomorphism. So you just do the endomorphism plus it's adjoint, you get something self-adjoint. All right. So as we saw earlier, these two A and C will satisfy these two Hitching equations. And then there is a Equations. And then there is a condition similar to the complete reducibility of the connection in the flat case, which says when a Higgs bundle admits not only a metric but a harmonic one, and it's exactly when the bundle is a so-called polystable Higgs bundle. So this is a complicated condition. It means that it's polystable will mean Would mean direct sum of stable bundles of the same degree in this case. Okay, so what does it mean to be stable? Okay, this I will describe for you in just a second, but the point is that again, it's this condition involving only the Higgs field, okay, of the Higgs bundle structure that would tell you that this very special PDE has a solution. Okay, so it will tell you exactly. Solution. Okay, so it will tell you exactly when the Higgs bundle comes from a harmonic bundle, and the answer is really provided in terms of the algebraic geometry. Okay. All right. So finally, I can tell you what stability is. So, yeah, I don't want you to be disappointed. It's still a bit of a mysterious condition. I will stick to degree zero. Okay. I will stick to the degree zero case because it's a bit easier. So, in the degree zero case, if you have a Higgs bundle, the stability condition is a condition that is to be satisfied by certain sub-bundles, actually all sub-bundles that are stable by the Higgs field. Okay, so stable by the Higgs field. Remember that you can write it like this if you want. You can also say, okay, a Higgs field is a one form with values in the endomorphism of the bundle. Endomorphism of the bundle. And if all these endomorphisms preserve or send F to F, it's a theta stable sub-bundle. Okay, and then the point is that all these sub-bundle should be of degree, of negative degree, strictly negative degree. All right. So of course, the trivial example is just a rank one, if it's bundles, because in that case, you don't have sub-bundles. I mean, you don't have non-trivial sub-bundles, so you cannot. Have non-trivial sub-bundles, so you cannot have anything to check. Then, an example which is historically very important and was found by Hetchin, and it establishes a relationship between the story, I mean, the theory of Higgs bundles and uniformization of Riemann surfaces, and in fact, the whole Teishman space. But even just for the theory of But even just for the theory of stable bundles, it shows you that a stable Higgs bundle, such as this one, does not have to be stable as a vector bundle. So what does it mean to be stable as a vector bundle? You just forget this condition. So you just say, okay, assume the Higgs field is zero if you prefer. Then you want this condition to be true for all sub-bundle. So obviously it's not satisfied for this one, okay? Because, well, this. well this sub-bundle will have sorry yeah it will have a positive degree okay yeah there's a one-half here which just means i'm taking square root of the canonical bundle which is the bundle of the contangent bundle okay so it has degree uh g minus one and g is greater than two this has positive degree so this is not a stable vector bundle but if i put this higgs field on it and that's what hitching tells us And that's what Hitchin tells us, then it is stable. Okay, so just to explain a little bit of notations, remember that the Higgs field has to be a morphism from the bundle to omega one times the bundle. So it's this one. In particular, this coefficient here should be a morphism from this to this. So it's the same as a quadratic differential. Okay? Maybe it should be a bit more. Be a bit more careful with notation here. It's okay, anyway. Um, all right, so it's a very instructive exercise to prove that this Higgs bundle with this Higgs field is stable. And this was Hitchen's observation. Okay, so yeah, I hope it gives you an idea of how the non-abelian-Hodge correspondence works. Hodge correspondence work. It's basically you construct these two injective maps and then you explain that the images are in bijection. Okay, obviously. But then, yeah, the images are characterized on the flat side by the complete reducibility of the monodrome representation and on the Higgs side by the policy. Hinks side by depositability. Okay. Yes. Okay, so let me try to tell you how this will work in the non-constant case. Basically, how we can construct these Higgs counterparts of the twisted local systems that we have studied. Okay, so there is one. So there is one intermediate step that has been very, very thoroughly studied, and which is the already since Simpson, which is the version of Higgs bundles for principal bundles. Okay, so what is a principal G-Higgs bundle? It's still a pair, E-Button, but this time E is not a vector bundle, but a principal G bundle. Vector bundle, but the principal G bundle, okay, G being a complex reductive group, and the theta, the Higgs field, is a section of this bundle. Omega 1x tends to the adjoint bundle. And the adjoint bundle is defined this way. Remember that E is a principal G bundle, so it has a G action. And of course, G also acts on its Lie algebra. Okay, so you can form this product, consider the diagonal action. Consider the diagonal action of G, and this will define a so-called adjoint bundle for you. Okay, okay, we still have this condition that makes sense. Yeah. And of course, as an example, if you take G is equal to G L and C, you can replace your principal bundle by a vector bundle, and then the adjoint bundle is replaced by the endomorphic. Is replaced by the endomorphism bundle. So it's really a generalization of the classical Higgs bundle notion. All right. So of course, it's much easier to generalize from this to the non-constant case than it is from the vector bottle case to this, I think. So here the notation itself suggests how to do the The correct generalization. Okay, you replace a principal G-Higgs bundle by a G-Higgs torsor, which will be a G-tulsor. Okay, so we know that when the group bundle G is trivial or is a constant group, a G torsor is just a principal G bundle. So it's definitely natural generalization. And then the Higgs field is really the same. It's just that the adjoint bundle is slightly more complicated to. Slightly more complicated to define, basically, because the Lie algebra of this group is a trivial bundle, but for a general group bundle, it's not trivial. So you cannot just take a product like here, you have to take a fiber product and you model by the action of G. Okay, but it's really still very similar. And of course, you get back the notion of principal G-Higgs bundles when you look at a constant group bundle over X. Okay. Okay, so now in order to obtain a non-Nembian Hodge correspondence, there's one approach that is most economical is to establish a relation between these G-Higgs torsors, which are very sort of complicated object. And so-called equivalent principle bundles, and the price you have to pay for this is you have to take a cover. Okay, so we've already seen this trick for group bundles of this form, which are defined by an action of pi 1x on some Lie group G. Okay, so it's something like this. Something like this. In fact, this is okay because we know from the classification theorem for twisted local system that we proved on Monday that this is the only case in which we can have a correspondence with twisted local systems, right? Because for twisted local systems, the group covering has to be of this form. Okay, so if you look at another type of If you look at another type of non-constant group G here, you cannot hope to find just a local system, I mean, in correspondence with it. It has to be of this form. Okay, and then if we have this action here, we can define the canonical cover of X by looking at the kernel of this group morphism. Okay, so it's Okay, so it's a normal subgroup, so it will define a Gala cover here. And if the image is finite, so if the index of this group is finite in pi 1x, it will be a finite cover. And this is really the case that we are most interested in. And it's also the case in all our examples. Okay, so the point is that because Pi one of X phi acts trivially on G, when you pull back this non-constant group to XV, you get a constant group. Okay, just get this. And you get more than this, you get when you pull back now. When you pull back now a torsor, a G phi torsor, so something on X, you will get not only a torso under this group, which means just the principal G bundles, but it will inherit an equivariant structure where F is the automorphism group of the cover. Okay, so this is what you get when you pull back something from X to the total space of the cover, it will be invariant by the automorphism group of. By the automorphism group of the colour. Okay, so now you just have to make sense of what it means for a Higgs field to be covariant. Okay, so you start from a G phi Higgs torsor on X. When you pull it back, we have just seen, you get a principal G bundle with an equivariant structure. So I recall here what it is, an equivalent structure. It is an equivalent structure on the principal G bundle. So it's a lift of the action on X to an action of the bundle, and the action is compatible with the action of the automorphism group of the cover, including the twist here by the action on the group. Okay, so it's not a morphism. If you look at this relation, it tells you that it's not a morphism of principal bundles. Of principal bundles. Okay, it's not equivariant map with respect to G, but it's twisted by this. Okay, but that's okay. So now the Higgs field or the non-constant group downstairs. So, what is the section of this? Okay, of course, it's the same as an F invariant. As an F-invariant section of the pullback of that bundle, and the pullback is now this thing that we know very well. Okay, and it's namely it's this, the adjoint bundle of a principal G bundle. Okay, so I've written here explicitly what it is, what means for theta twiddle to be. Theta twiddle to be invariant under the action of f, it means that this diagram commutes. And this f here is just okay, so obviously f acts on the Riemann surface, so it lives to the tangent bundle. And here this f action on the adjoint bundle is just defined this way. And here you really use this condition to show that this is well defined. That this is well defined. Okay, it's also a neat exercise. Okay, and then you can just do an equivariver version of the non-Embion Hodge correspondence to get the non-Embion Hodge correspondence in the twisted case. Because if you pull back everything to Xv, you just have equivalent objects. Equivaricts. If you prove the non-Ebel Hautch correspondence in an equivalent version of that, you will get that the F-equivari local systems correspond to the F-equivari Higgs bundles. But then these correspond to twisted local systems on the one hand and to non-constant Higgs bundles on the other hand. Okay, so you just have to prove an equivariant version of animal Hodge correspondence. So basically, I'm making everything equivariant here, the harmonic bond. Variant here, the harmonic bundles, the flat vector bundles, the Higgs bundles. And you will have an equivalent version of the Neben Hodge correspondence if you have F-invariant solutions to Hitching equations. Okay, so maybe in the few remaining minutes, I will just mention what is What is to be checked? Yeah, so of course, this notion of F-equivariant Higgs bundles, it makes sense as soon as you have a group acting on the Riemann surface. You don't need for that same group to act on the Lie group G, right? You don't need that. But in our case, we have that. So, if we didn't have that, we could just use Simpson's theorem because when Simpson proved the existence of a harmonic metric on the polystable Higgs bundles, he also showed it with respect to that this metric can be taken invariant with respect to the action of a finite group of automorphisms of the Riemann surfaces. But here, this finite This finite group may also is also allowed to act on the Lie group G. Okay, so it's a bit more complicated. In particular, if you just look at the stability condition, so okay, since we are working on the curve here, I can just use stability in the Ramanathan's way. And yeah. Yeah, so then when will an F-equivalent principle G-heat bundles be called stable? Well, so the condition for principal G-Higgs bundles to be to be stable is already complicated to state. You have to check with respect to all parabolic subgroup and all reduction of structure group. Of structure group, which is supposed to be compatible with the Higgs field, that you get the condition or a condition on the degree. Okay, so it's a lot to digest. And on top of that, we have to ask now that the probiotic subgroup be F invariant and the reduction be F equivariant. Okay, and yeah, this. Um, yeah, this might be quite problematic because maybe if you just start with the Lie group and an action of a finite group, you may not have invariant parabolics, okay? You may not have an invariant Borel. So what do you do? So on the curve, we could appeal to general results for group bundles that are generic. Generically trivial, which is the case, yeah, when you have a group bundle of this type, it has to be generically trivial. So you can use result by Steinberg, which was a conjecture of SER, to actually prove the existence of a Borel. But okay, in all our examples, we can actually check directly that we. Check directly that we have Borel subgroups, invariant Borel subgroups. So the condition makes sense. Okay, I just wanted to mention that because stability is a subtle issue in this non-constant setting. Okay, it's to be expected, right? Because if you think of this as a group on the Riemann surface X, a group bundle on the Riemann surface X, for this surface x for this to some orally over the generic point it's it's it's a group over um the function field of the Riemann surface, the field of meromorphic function. And that one is not algebraically closed. So you may not have Borel subgroups. Okay. Okay, so let me finish with an example. So I So, in the previous lectures, I talked quite a lot about these invariant local systems. So, let me focus on the rank one case here. So, we know that if we consider this action on the group C star, we can look at twisted local systems with respect to this non-consistent group on the quotient. Okay, so then. So then we can restrict the non-able Hodge correspondence on Y between flat C star bundles or C star local systems and rank one line bundles of degree zero equipped with a holomorphic one form to sort of fixed points of the sigma action, which will give us on the local system sign this anti-invariant local Systems sign these anti-invariant local systems and on the Higgs side, on the Dolvo side, we will get anti-invariant line bundles. So it means basically a line bundle which is isomorphic to its dualized pullback. Okay. And then the one form also has to satisfy some kind of symmetry. All right. All right, and so the equivalent version of the non-Nibbled Hodge correspondence gives us this condition, this correspondence, sorry. And this we already know how to interpret in terms of objects on the quotient. And now as of today, we know how to interpret this as objects on the quotient. Okay, maybe the point about this sequivari picture is that there are many quotients. We took a sort of a canonical cover, but there are many quotients that will give you the same Riemann surface with the same. Give you the same remote surface with the same group bundle. Okay, just think of if you have one, you just pull it back to very different things, very different covers, and the automorphism group becomes larger and larger. So you have more complicated action, but on the quotient, they're all the same. Okay, so it's really more intrinsic to work on this. Okay, so yeah, there are a few things more I There are a few things more I I could say, but the observations will be uh contained in in the notes, so maybe I just stop here on on this example. Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much, Paul, for the very nice third lectures. Are there any questions in the room here or Haka? I had one. Uh, I had one the last slide. Can you just put the last slide? Uh, yeah, this one you have this in the second observation. You have this uh description of the cotangent bundle, right? Is that correct? Um, how does it, how does it work? I mean, is it just for you so so? Remember that in the in the um ah, in the non-twisted case, we had this, right? Okay, so here I don't have to take a quotient by CC. So, here I don't have to take a quotient by cop because the action is trivial. But we have the flat line bundles and the cotangent of the Jacobian. Okay, so this side I claim it's easy to generalize. It's what we've been doing in the previous lectures, like this. Okay, and now what is the twisted version of this? So, basically, these are just line bundles of degree zero. So, now in the twisted case over the quotient. Over the quotient, I won't have line bundles, I will have torsors under this non-constant group, right? So we know we have to look at this bungee sigma. Here, okay, you may want to be careful with this because I'm not sure. Okay, so as a stack, I know what it is, but I'm not sure if there is like a coarse model line space for this. Okay, so this is a bit unclear to me. Is a bit unclear to me. But yeah, okay. In any case, the degree will still be well defined. Actually, I claim that any anti-invariant line bundle has degree zero. So I don't think that we need to consider some degree condition here. And then the yeah, so basically. Yeah, so basically, okay, maybe a better way of answering your question is to say that this should be this quotient, right? Ah, okay. Yeah. But of course, okay, this quotient you can always form and you will get this just by construction, by all that we've done. But yeah, I think there's still some work to be done to really. Think there's still some work to be done to really see it as the cotangent of this moduli stack, right? Yeah, so you really take the moduli stack here and the cotangent. Yes, yes, I think so. I mean, if you have something that's the same question here, maybe here I'm also looking at this more as a sticky portion. Yeah, right. Yeah, that was kind of my question. Yeah, yeah, I think if you, yeah, I think, yeah, if we write it like this, then it's probably cleaner, a statement. Probably cleaner a statement, and then you may ask: Does this isomorphism of stacks is it compatible with the cost modulized spaces? So, here it's very easy to know what the cost model is space here is. Sorry, here I am not entirely sure, actually. I think maybe it's an interesting question. Okay. Okay, thank you very much. Um, any more questions in the room? Yeah, what about the world? Okay, that's not okay. Then, thanks, Florent, again, for his wonderful three lectures. And we're looking forward also to your contribution to our proceedings. We get in touch with you, and thank you very much. So, we should be able to invitation.
