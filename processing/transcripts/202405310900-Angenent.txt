Yes, yes. Okay, so I'm going to continue talking about curve shortening in Rn. There's a lot of stuff that material that one could talk about. So I made a selection and I started with the distinction between type 1 and type 2 blow-up, the kinds of blow-up theorems that exist that one can. Exist that one can prove in particular why one would look for self-similar solutions or solitants as they're called and also by why one would look for ancient solutions. And then at the end, I'll give a lot of examples. So at the beginning of the talk, there will be a number of equations, and I will try to do sort of a proof. And then towards the end, it will be mostly pictures illustrated. Pictures illustrating what has been proved. Okay, so to recall, we're looking at the space curve shortening. So we have curves in three dimensions, well, two, three, or higher dimensional space, parameterized curves. And the partial differential equation for curve shortening is this one, which looks like a heat equation, but Which looks like a heat equation, but that DDS is an abbreviation for a more complicated thing. So it's a quasi-linear parabolic equation, and we've seen that there exists, if you have C1 alpha initial curves, then there always exists a solution. There is curve shortening, there is generalized curve shortening, which is this equation, where the difference is that the perpendicular part of the The perpendicular part of the velocity has to be equal to the curvature. So that means that your parametrization is allowed to slide along the curve as the curve evolves. And these two equations are equivalent. If you have a solution to generalized curve shortening, you can always reparameterize it to a solution of curve shortening. Then we did some calculations. We calculated the rate at which the arc length, so the derivative of with respect to the parameter, how that changes in. Respect to the parameter, how that changes in time, and it satisfies this fairly simple. Uh, really, not a PDE, it's an ODE for each fixed C, that's an ODE. The catch is that you don't know K, but if you know that K is bounded, then this tells you that the arc length grows or decays at most exponentially. This a different way of writing it is like this. We had a PDE for the length of the curvature. How fast does the curvature of the curve grow? And the equation was. Curve grow and the equation was almost nice, it was these two terms, but then there's this extra term which fortunately has a sign, so we get the time derivative of the length of the curvature is bounded by, satisfies a parabolic inequality. If you integrate with respect to arc length, and you get what is called the total curvature, so that's this and the time derivative of that quantity. And the time derivative of that quantity is by combining the first two the two lines above and some calculations gives you an integral of something positive and with a minus sign in front of it. So it shows you that the total curvature of a curve does not increase in time. So that's I'll refer back to that at least once. Okay, so the one thing where I wanted to give a proof or an outline of a proof is the following. Or, an outline of a proof is the following. Suppose you start with a nice initial curve and you let it evolve. And at some positive time, t, it becomes singular. T is the maximal time until which you can evolve the curve. And I'm assuming here that t is finite. Then, this theorem, there are two statements here. First of all, there always exists a limiting. Of all, there always exists a limiting curve. So, if you take the parameterization, then the limit for time going up to the singular time exists, and the limit exists uniformly for all xi, for all parameter values. And then there's this longish statement. What it says is that if you take away a finite number of points in Rn, then outside of, then away from those points, so for any delta, stay outside of a ball of radius delta. Stay outside of a ball of radius delta at each of the Pi's, whatever part of the curve is outside of those balls will converge smoothly as delta as T goes to the capital T. And I so this is one proof that I'm going to give. This was done. So actually, I wrote a proof for this in 89 for curves on surfaces, and the idea of part A is. The idea of part A is pretty much the same. So let's assume. So here's a proof of statement A. So first of all, the total curvature remains bounded because the total curvature at time t is bounded by the total curvature at time zero, which I'm going to abbreviate to kappa. Okay, so the total curvature at all times is bounded by kappa. Curve shortening, the equation is this. Let's see if I can zoom in like this. See if I can zoom in like this. You can see it better, maybe. The equation says that the time derivative is equal to the curvature. So this inequality up here implies that at each time, the integral of the velocity along the curve is bounded, is bounded by the same constant, kappa. So now you can integrate this with respect to time. So that tells you. So that tells you that this double integral from zero to t is bounded by, well, integrate kappa from zero to t, you get kappa times t, is bounded by some constant. And now at this point, we apply Fubini and we say that, so we switch ds and dt around. And what you find is that this integral is finite for almost all values of x. Values of x. And I realize that this is confusing because where did this xc come from? So let me let me write that here. Remember that the integral of the length of xt times ds. This is an abbreviation for the integral over, say, one time period. Over, say, one time period or one length period, C going from zero to one of XT, and DS is XC, DX. Okay, so this XC is responsible for that XC over there. Okay, so we have a double integral that is finite. Fubini says that for almost every value of the integration parameter c. integration parameter c the integral with respect to t is finite so for almost every c this integral is finite and now there are two possibilities x c x c is monotone so recall that the time derivative oops sorry Oops, sorry. The time derivative of x was minus something less than or equal to zero. Okay, so x key, xc for fixed parameter values is decreasing in time. So that means that that implies that at time capital T, this limit can be positive or zero. If it is positive, then xc is bounded from below for all. For all time. And then we can, that means that we can delete this thing from that integral. And the conclusion we get is that the integral from 0 to t of xt dt is bounded by, is also finite. Okay, if this integral is finite, then this implies. integral is finite then this implies that x this thing that this that x of t converges has a limit just by the mere fundamental theorem of calculus so for all c where the the derivative with respect to the parameter stays bounded from away from zero the curve The curve, the parameterization converges at the singular time. What about the points where this goes to zero? Well, those are points where the length of the curve goes to zero. So those are all parts of the curve that shrink to a point. So those also converge. That requires a little more explanation, but it turns out you don't have to worry about those. And then finally, we know that the XC is always. know that the xc is always bounded from above by one because we start with a assuming that we start with an arc length parameterization which we can always do so if you do that then these the parameterizations you get are all equi-continuous so you can apply a scoli orcela and you find that the convergence is uniform okay so part b um Part B is more complicated. Instead of describing Part B, let me just draw a picture of what this theorem claims. Suppose you start with a complicated initial curve like this, then it will evolve. This is at T is zero. Then, as T goes to capital T, there are a finite number of points. Finite number of points P1 through Pn and the limit curve is smooth away from those points and the convergence to the limit curve is also in C infinity as long as you stay away from those points okay so each Okay, so each solution always has a finite number of singularities, isolated singularities. All right, so what can those singularities look like? How do you analyze those singularities? So I went through this last time, but a bit quickly. So let me say it one more time. There are One more time. There are, and this terminology goes back to Richard Hamilton, who was applying this to curve shortening, mean curvature flow, Ricci flow, and any other geometric evolution equation that he was thinking about. You can, because of scaling invariance, each evolution equation has a natural blow-up rate, which usually is a minimal blow-up rate. And so, type one is And so, type 1 is a solution has type 1 blow-up if the quantity that blows up that you measure, which for curve shortening is the maximal curvature at time t, if it blows up proportional to some multiple of the natural blow-up rate. And type 2 is whatever is just if it's not type 1. Okay, so for curve shortening, For curve shortening, remember we have this equation for the curvature in parabolic inequality. If you apply the maximum principle to that, you find that the maximal curvature must is always, if it becomes infinite at time capital T, then it must be bounded from below by that one over square root t minus two t to the minus t. Okay, so type one blow-up is if the maximal curvature is bounded by some constant, which has to be larger than one over. Which has to be larger than 1 over square root 2, some constant times over square root t minus t. And if that is not true, which means that there is a sequence t k's, a sequence of c k and t k such that this product goes to infinity, then we say that it has type 2 blowout. When there is so, and I'm going to show. And I'm going to show you many examples of blow-up. And so some will be type 1, others will be type 2. In the case of type 1 blow-up, there's a very nice curve shortening and a number of other geometric flows. And in particular, this also applies to the semi-linear parabolic equation du dt equals Laplace U plus U to the P. So there's the work of Giga and Cohen in the 1980s. Work of Giga and Cohn in the 1980s and many subsequent works. They found that if you pass the similarity variables, the equation in similarity variables has a Lyapunov function. Huskin's monotonicity formula is the same kind of thing. If you have a solution to curve shortening and you do some kind of rescaling, you find that there is a Lyapunov function, which is known as Huskins. So the fact that it is. So, the fact that it is a Lyapunov function is called Huskins' monotonicity formula. And if you use that, what you can prove is that if you have a solution that has type 1 blow-up, then do the following. Pick a reference point, X star, and take any sequence of times converging to capital T. Then using this monotonicity formula, you can find a sub-sequence, which I'm just also going to. Sequence, which I'm just also going to denote by Tk, such that this thing. Now, what is this? This is you take the solution, you move X star to the origin. So you move X star to the origin. That gives you this. Then you magnify it by the square T minus T T minus T K. And then we do one more thing, we reparameterize it. So that's We reparameterize it. So that's the reparameterization. That's this. Like CK is there, so that this whole expression y sigma k is an arc length parameterization. Okay, so this is the curve magnified by a factor one over square root t minus t k around the point x star. Along the subsequence, this sequence of curves converges smoothly to what is called a shrinking soliton, which is Which is, so in equations, it's a solution to this ordinary differential equation. Y perp means it's the component perpendicular to the tangent. So y parameterizes a curve, sigma is the arc length on the curve. Y perpendicular is the component of the position vector y that is perpendicular to the curve. So it satisfies differential equation, that differential equation. Okay, so it's a characterization. Okay, so it's a characterization of what solutions look like near blow-up points, at least if they are type 1 blow-ups. Okay, so another interpretation of the word shrinking soliton is if you have a shrinking soliton. So if Y is a solution to this equation, then I can form, I can undo the substitution up here. I can define X is any point and I take the. point and I take the soliton y and I multiply it with a factor square root t minus t. This thing evolves by curve shortening. It satisfies this equation. By generalized curve shortening. If you differentiate with respect to t, you get y, which is not always perpendicular to the curve, but the normal component of the velocity is equal to the curvature. Okay, so basic examples of this are the line and the Examples of this are the line and the circle. So if you take a line through the origin, so that's my curve, y. Take any point on this curve, which is really a line. There's y. Then y perpendicular is zero, right? Because the tangent vector, the tangent vector at this point is this. So the component of y perpendicular. The component of y perpendicular to y is zero. So, y perp is zero, and y sigma sigma is also zero because the line has no curvature. If you draw a circle, then at any point, so this is y, this is the unit tangent, so that's y sigma. The perpendicular component is just y. And now y sigma sigma is one over the radius. So this radius is r, it's one over r squared times y. So this circle is a soliton if r is square root two. Because you want one half, one you want one over r squared to be equal to one half of y. That's this equation. And there's a minus sign here, right? Because y sigma sigma points this direction. Okay. Okay, so line and circle are basic examples of shrinking solitons. So, in particular, the circle shrinks under curve shortening, a circle shrinks to a point in a self-similar way. Way. You could ask how many other shell shrinkers are there, shrinking solitons are there. And if you just analyze this ODE, this is an ODE, then it is not hard to see that all solutions to this equation are planar curves. They lie in a plane through the origin. So you could ask for. The origin. So you could ask for three-dimensional self-shrinkers. Those will be curves that lie in a plane. So if you know all planar self-shrinkers, then you know all self-shrinkers in Rn as well. Okay, so planar self-shrinkers were discovered, were analyzed by Abrish and Langer in 1986. Maybe five. And so this is from their paper. They found that there's a whole sequence of closed curves. They analyzed the ODE in detail and they found that there's a whole sequence of closed curves. The simplest one is this trefoil, this one. That curve will shrink to a point in a self-similar way. Note that none of these things, none of these curves. Note that none of these things, none of these curves that they found are simple. They all have self-intersections. And there is, so there are numbers written here. So two means that this thing has winding number two. If you start here and you go around the curve, then if you follow the unit tangent, then by the time you've gotten here, it has rotated around once. And now you go around the curve. And by the time you get back to the unit. And by the time you get back, the unit tangent has rotated around twice. So the winding number of the tangent is two, and it has threefold symmetry. So Abrich and Langer determined that there is an interval such that for each fraction in that interval, there exists a curve with m and n, where the fraction m over n or n over m lies in that interval. Okay, so there's an infinite sequence of these. Of these, then I wanted to show these. These are other solitons. Now, these two other things, if you so, these are space curves. So, if I say that these are solitons, then that contradicts what I said before, namely that all solitons are planar. These are self-similar solutions, but rather than shrink, they also rotate as they shrink. And it turns out that there are very many of It turns out that there are very many of these. There are no compact ones. If you add the condition of compactness, then all solitons, whether they rotate or not, they are planar and they are actually, there are no rotating compact ones. But there are a large number. So this thing looks like it's compact, but that's because, for example, this one looks like it's compact. That's because it has an infinite. It's an infinitely long curve that is asymptotic to this circle. Okay, and that circle is a self-shrinker that doesn't rotate, or it rotates, but you can't see it because it's round. So there's a whole sequence of these, or a whole continuous family of these, and they produce nice pictures. Their total curvature is infinite. They've been discovered by several groups, John King. Discovered by several groups. John King in the 1990s studied this or early 2000s. Hoskolder Halderson wrote a thesis on self-shrinkers. And I also have a paper with Altschuler and Wu where these pictures came from. So there are many solitons, but the only compact ones are non-rotating self-shrinkers. Self-shrinkers. Okay, so that's for type one. So, type two: suppose you have a solution that does not have type one blow-up, then you can still analyze them. You can say you can do some sort of blow-up, and this blow-up procedure again was formulated by Hamilton, and so it was applied to space curve shortening by Kaltschuler and Grayson. And so the idea is the following. You look for an essential sequence of points. So we assume that the curvature becomes infinite at time capital T. At time capital T, our curvature, maximal curvature becomes infinite. That means that you can find points Tk, CK such that the curvature along the sequence goes to infinity. And now what you do is you find an essential sequence, and that means that And that means that TK is the first time at which the curvature reaches this particular value. Okay, so more precisely for any k, if t is less than or equal to tk, then the curvature at time t is less than or equal to the curvature at time tk at the location ck. Okay, so curvature has units one over length. So if you take one over, units one over length. So if I take one over the curvature, I get a length epsilon, which I call epsilon k, so which goes to zero. So which should be a measure of the size at which the curve is at which the curve is singular time tk. And then we rescale the solution. So we do a blow-up, and this is a little bit like the blow-up, except the blow-up now is not one particular curve, but it's another solution to curve shortening. So I define yk in this way. The CK, this is there to make sure that at time TK, or so tau, when tau is zero, so time then is equal to tk, this whole thing is an arc length parameterization. For other values of tau, it's not an arc length parameterization, but that's okay. So, and again, we take the point x t k c k, we move that to the Tk, CK, we move that to the origin, we magnify it, and we speed up time by the square of epsilon k because it's the diffusion equation. So time has unit length squared. Okay, so if I do that, I get I zoom in and I speed up time on my solution to curve shortening, and this thing has. And this thing has the property. This yk has the property that its curvature is always less than or equal to one, because I've magnified it by that much. And I know that when tau is equal to zero, so that's going to appear here in the statement of the theorem. When tau and sigma are equal to zero, then this is not there, sigma is zero. Is not there, sigma is zero, so then this becomes just ck, and um, so at that point, the curvature is equal to the rescaled curvature, which is normalized to one. Okay, so you get solutions yk that exist on, so this solution exists on a long negative time interval, starting at minus one over. Minus one over, right? It starts, right? This quantity is greater than or equal to zero. That happens if tau is greater than or equal to minus t k over epsilon k squared. And this goes to minus infinity as k goes to infinity. So, we get a sequence of solutions that exist on longer and longer negative time intervals. And then, as you let k to infinity, since the curvature of all those solutions is bounded, you can extract convergent sub-sequences. So there's a sub-sequence such that which converges smoothly to a solution that exists for all negative time. And those things, again, Hamilton's terminology, that's an ancient solution, right? So it's a solution. Ancient solutions, right? So it's a solution that is defined for all tau less than or equal to zero. And it has the property that it's not trivial. So its curvature at time one, at one particular parameter value, is exactly equal to one. So it's not a straight line. It has curvature somewhere. And for all negative time, its curvature is bounded from above by one. Okay, so this theorem, which in this formulation is, you're right, it's Hamilton ultra. You're right, it's Hamilton ultra regression for curve shortening. It says that when a singularity forms, you will always see an ancient solution. The blow-up will be, you can do a blow-up and what you will see is an ancient solution. For space curve shortening, excuse me, for space curve shortening, Alchiller and Grayson made a added to this. So, this is something that's specific to the space curve shortening. Specific to the space curve shortening. We use that the total curvature. Actually, we haven't used the total curvature yet, but the total curvature we know is satisfy evolves by this equation. So this is the total curvature. And one thing to notice, which you can just do by looking at units, curvature has units, one over length, ds is a length. Multiply those two, you get something that has no units. So the total curvature is invariant under rescaling. So now, if you use that the total, so the total curvature for the total curvature approaches a particular constant value. In your blow-up, the total curvature will also cannot must also be constant because if it drops, then you get a contradiction. And this means that along your And this means that along your blown-up solution, you get this inequality where the total curvature actually is constant. So it implies that on your blown-up solution, this y that we had above, this integral must be zero, which then implies that k wedge, the cross product of k and the perpendicular component of the And the perpendicular component of the derivative of k is zero. And then that's an ordinary differential equation for k. And if you look at that, if you write that out, it follows that the curvature always lies in one particular plane. And so therefore, the curve is a planar curve. So even if you start with a space curve and you do this blow-up procedure at a type 1 or type 2 blow-up. At a type one or type two blow-up, you get you find that you get an ancient solution which is planar. Okay, so which planar ancient solutions are there? Note that all, scrolling back, the Aberdeen-Langer curves, those are all ancient solutions because they shrink to a point, but you can extend them back in time to minus infinity if you go back in time. To minus infinity, if you go back in time, they just expand and they can keep on expanding. There's they just become smoother and smoother, the curvature goes to zero. So, these Aberdeen-Langer curves are ancient solutions. Okay, so here some examples of ancient solutions. These are also solitons, self-similar solutions. The first one is a traveling wave. Traveling wave, which in the curve-shortening literature is called the Grim Reaper. It has a very explicit formula. This is the graph of y is minus log cosine x scaled. So if you scale that thing so that its width is pi over c, then it moves vertically with velocity c. Okay, so that's an ancient solution. Back in time, it just goes. Back in time, it just goes, it goes down here, forward in time, it goes up there, and it disappears, moving with constant velocity. Then you can also ask: is there a rotating wave? Are there solutions that rotate? So, and Altchilder and Grayson found one, and they call it the yin-yang curve because they looked at this picture, and that's what they saw. So, there exists a curve, it's a solution to an ordinary differential. It's a solution to an ordinary differential equation. There's no explicit formula, but you can, it's a second-order ODE. You can integrate it once, and then the last integral is one that you can't do. So you have a pretty explicit control of what this thing looks like. It spirals out infinitely, and it rotates with constant angular velocity. One question that occurred to me. Occurred to me during Tani Gucci's talk is that these ancient solutions to curve shortening, some of them show up as, so solutions to curve shortening, especially if they're embedded, show up as limits of free boundaries of solutions to the Alan-Kahn equation. So the question, a question that you can ask is: is there a rotating solution? And maybe some of you already know the answer. some of you already know the answer and is there a solution to the allen khan equation where which is uh negative in the green region and positive in in the white region and that rotates um so i i have no idea um Okay, going to space curve. So, notice that the yin-yang curve, this yin-yang soliton, will never show up as a blow-up of a solution to curve shortening because its total curvature is infinite. If you follow the unit tangent here and you just go, you go around the spiral out here, you walk outwards, you find. You walk outwards, you find that the tangent curves around infinitely often, so its total curvature is infinite. Then, but still, it's there it is. Then there are, we did a study with Altschiller and Wu of three-dimensional solitons for curve shortening. And it turns out that there is a rotating version, which is essentially the yin-yang curve, where you take, so there are two branches of the spiral. So, there are two branches of the spiral that come together here at the origin. So, oops, sorry, at the origin. And you can take one of those two branches and move it upwards towards you, and the other branch push it downward and then connect those by a vertical line. And then, what that looks like is that looks like this picture. Like this picture. And this is so this is a space curve which rotates. So it evolves under curve shortening by steady rotation around a vertical axis. So the rotation axis is this. Then you can ask, could solutions rotate and translate? And the answer is yes. So you could take this wagon wheels rotating solution. Rotating solution, and if you allow the spiral, the outward bound spiral, if you allow it to curve upwards while it is spiraling out, so that that would give you this curve. And then connected to, and then let's do the same thing to the red thing. This gives you a curve which under curve shortening, first of all, will rotate. So it will rotate. Will rotate so it will rotate like this, but at the same time, it will also translate in that direction. And again, it's a pretty curve, but it has infinite total curvature, so you won't find it as the blow-up in a type 2 singularity from a curve that was smooth, compact initially. All great. All right, so some illustrations of these blow-up theorems. So, there is the most basic example of a curve that becomes singular and that is not a self-similar solution is the cardioid. If you take, so these are plane curves. If you take a cardioid like has drawn here, the little loop has larger curvature than the large loop, so it will become significant. So it will become singular first. And what you can prove. So where is the point with the largest curvature? Well, that happens here at the point B. So at each moment in time, what you do is you take this point B and you magnify it so that until this here, this point has curvature equal to one. And in the limit, so in the limit, you get a particular curve and the You get a particular curve, and the um, so the theorem says that what you will get is an ancient solution, uh, which is a plane curve. And um, the ancient solution that you get is the translating soliton, the so-called Grim Reaper. Okay, so notice that this blow-up theorem describes what the solution looks like here. Oh, what the solution looks like in this box in a small neighborhood. In a small neighborhood, it doesn't say what the solution looks like here. And it also does not give any information on what, you know, once the singularity has formed, what the shape of the remaining curve is near the singularity. So all those things are, so this blowout theorem is very useful, but it is far from complete in the information that it gives. Another example is the figure eight. Is the figure eight. If you take a figure eight, and if these two areas are the same, then the curve will shrink to a point. So that's a result of grace. It doesn't have to be symmetric. If the two areas are the same, then the thing will shrink to a point. And now, if in the case that it is symmetric, then what I'm telling you now is true and has been proved. And has been proved. Namely, again, you get a loop, and the point with larger curvature will be here at A, and by symmetry also at A prime. If you blow up, what you get is an ancient solution, and the ancient solution that you get is the same one. It's this translating soliton. Very recently, so this must have been a pandemic paper. This must have been a pandemic paper. Koikulesko and Richard Schwartz, Matei Koikulesko and Richard Schwartz proved another limiting theorem, which is the following. Take this curve. And so if you plot this, and so this is very natural to do if you are plotting solutions of this equation on a computer. You have the height and the width. You have the height and the width, and your computer screen will fit a square. So, you rescale these things anisotropically so that the height and width become equal. So, in the limit, I don't know how far I can see. We can zoom in here, but there's not much to see there. So, let's not zoom in. If you rescale so that the height and width are equal, then in the limit, what you get is this curve, which doesn't look smooth at all because it has corners. Look smooth at all because it has corners. And so, the paradise. So, where did the Great Reaper, where did this translating soliton go? Well, because you blow it up anisotropically, that translating soliton is here. So, you take this translating soliton and you squash it horizontally. So, so that it becomes a curve that looks like this. And when you do that, so what this theorem says is that the pieces in between the two endpoints, so the cross in between really becomes two straight lines. Okay, so more ancient solutions. I'm running out of time, right? I'm running out of time, right? Well, well, okay, so another five minutes. I'll so here are so this was the uh the paperclip solution that we heard of uh on Wednesday. Um there is uh so there's an ancient solution. So these are solutions, ancient solutions to curve shortening in the plane. So this one has an explicit expression. This one has an explicit expression. So that's the paper clip. And so I put that in a paper once. It was also, it has been found by a number of other people. In particular, there's a group of physicists in Japan that found this thing in 1994. And what I like about their paper is that they don't study curve shortening, they study curve lengthening. Because they took the backwards equation, which is a backwards heat equation, and the initial value problem is ill-produced. The initial value problem is ill-posed, but it doesn't bother them. And you could ask, suppose, so you could ask, suppose that I want to study velocity equals minus the curvature plus some regularizing term, epsilon KSS. Then as long as the curve is smooth, that regularizing term doesn't do anything. And we're looking at backward solutions of the curve shorting equation. So things that exist for a really long time will be ancient. What you switch. The ancient, once you switch time around, correspond to ancient solutions to curve shortening. So they found an explicit form of the same explicit form, and they also changed the sign of one of the terms. So they also found that there exists this ancient solution. So there's an ancient solution, which is this ancient sine wave. So in forward time, it just converges. So this is an eternal solution. In forward time, it converges to Time it converges to the x-axis. In backwards, time it is just vertical lines like this: vertical lines that are connected at infinity by translating solitons. And again, one can wonder: does there exist a solution to the Alan-Kahn equation that is close to plus one here? Here, or that is positive here and negative in the other in the complement. Does there exist an ancient solution to Alan Kant that does that? Then my student, Chan Yu, figured out that even though this solution has an explicit expression, there exist many version. There are a lot of solutions like this, and in particular, These points do not have to be at the same height. These distances don't have to be the same at all. So, what she did is she said you can choose, you can pick a bunch of horizontal lines like this. So, she rotated the drawing by 90 degrees. You can draw a bunch of horizontal lines like that, asymptotes, and then you connect them. So, the first one, you connect one with this with a grim. With this, with a Grim Reaper, and then you connect this one with a Grim Reaper, which has to be has to have higher curvature. So, there are a bunch of Grim Reapers that are connecting these lines, and they all have to translate. And the velocity of a Grim Reaper is inversely proportional to this distance. Okay, so some of these, so this red one here moves very slowly because it has low curvature, and the green one is the one that moves the fastest. So, there exists an ancient solution. So, there exists an ancient solution that has this description. And then, in a paper with three students, Ilyas Khan, Connor Olson, and Joe Jazang, we found an ancient solution that is like the yin-yang curve, except it is compact. And so, you can find a YouTube video of this thing. It just rotates. So, it rotates with. So it rotates with constant speed. But at the end, the two strands of the spiral are connected by a very small grim reaper, which is moving with very high velocity. So there's an ancient solution that looks like this, which was so we wrote a paper by that. And there's a student of Bruce Kleiner, Jomage Charyev, who Jumageli Charyev, who also found the same thing at the same time. Okay, so now there is more, but I think the last thing that I want to say, let me skip this self-intersection. Yeah, let me skip all this. The last thing that I want to say is that there's a paper by Theodora Burni and Alex Bramor who came up with a three-dimensional version of these, what they call trombone solutions. So you take three lines and they don't have to be in the same. Lines and they don't have to be in the same plane. So you have these two lines sit in this plane and the second pair of lines, the lines two and three, sit in this perpendicular plane. And so they constructed an ancient solution to space curve shortening, which has finite total curvature. And so Chinese solutions also all have finite total curvature. Unused solutions also all have finite total curvatures. They could show up as blow-ups from solutions to curve shortening. So there exists an ancient solution that has this shape. So there's a Grim Reaper in a horizontal plane that is, so that would be this part that is connected to a Grim Reaper in a vertical plane up there. And so there And so there is much more to say, but I'll stop here and thank you for your attention. Thank the organizers for organizing this meeting. And I'm sorry that I couldn't be there in person. I hope I can make that up some other time. So thank you. Which one? I think it's I think it's a theory, sorry, below, below, what is this series? Ah, so the uh Daskalopos Hamilton and Natasha Sys improved in 2012 if you if you look at ancient solutions that are convex. Convex and closed curves, and so in the plane. So they have to be convex and closed, and they should not have self-intersections. Then there are only two such ancient solutions. One is the circle, and the other is the paperclip. And the ones that I've shown you give you examples that you have to include all three conditions are necessary. So this one, the This one has no self-intersections and it is compact. It is a closed curve at all times, but it's not convex. And this ancient sine curve is, let's see, it is. Actually, that's not a counterexample. But so if you look at all the solutions found in Chan Yu's thesis. Solutions found in Chan Yu's thesis, they all give you examples of things that are missing one of those three conditions, and they are ancient solutions, so they and they fall outside this class. So cigarette cigarette so there is a there is but uh but here you can see there there if you mute yourself yourself there you can if you mute yourself yourself you can switch my microphone okay so so Okay. So so uh uh sigma so the limit the limit of the this this type of patient solution the total cover cover is one yes and is this is this type of tidy transition more into blank is it more less more less more uh no No, I don't think so. There was actually sort of a difficult question. I heard a talk by Kyung-soo Choi last year who was working on it and he had some partial results and I don't know how far he is now. So there are, it's a difficult question because you, with ancient solutions, Because with ancient solutions, you can show that certain things have asymptotes, so they will be made up of Grim Reapers, but there could be, yeah, you have to. What if you have two curves that are sort of connected like this, right? Where, and then this like a boomerang. Like a boomerang. So, something like that can't happen. So, anything, any individual curve that I draw, I can sort of rule out, but there's no way to capture all cases that I know of. So, I believe that's still not completely solved problem, or not a solved problem classifying them. So I don't hear you now. You can have the type of time for type two, type two. Please, please. So this is a visual, visual mode you wanted axis, please. Yes. And you had a square, square, logged off, logged off, yes. Yes, so we worked out the blow-up rate for the curvature at this particular point under very specific. So there are. Very specific, so rather strong assumptions in particular. We assume that the curvature, so we assume symmetry around this line, and we assume that the curvature going from here, no, the curvature going from here to here would be monotonically increasing. Which I think this picture violates because the curvature, the curvature here is rather large, here it is small, here it is small again, and there it's large. Is small again, and there it's large. Okay, so um, so for very specific uh shapes under various assumptions, we came up with um with a blow-up rate for uh for the curvature here. And there's this uh question is is uh okay okay this is this young question is uh uh written written in terms of terms of uh uh quasi linea quasarlin. Quasarlin, quasarlin. But you solve the question not just you used the use of this geometric interpretation of the curve. So surely Yes. So you need to hold it to work itself from time to time. Yeah, so there are certain things that you can do that are very useful. Namely, you can, so if you zoom in on this box, so if you zoom in on this region, then your solution is the graph of a function. Is the graph of a function. And so x, y. And so let's say this is y of u of t and x. And then that u satisfies u t equals uxx over 1 plus ux squared. So it satisfies a scalar parabolic PDE. And so there are, so I think most of the analysis we did was by looking at this PDE for the graphs. For the graphs, force considering half the curve as the graph of a function. So, so but this can this can also since it is a convex intersective convex velocity, you can you can write it right it of carbon angle. The angle of variable variables zero to zero five. Varies from zero to zero pi four pi and uh and it it can be it can be expression as as what you need to do but at the time you can focus on this uh approach approach uh uh and uh is there any any new new approach of result result uh this yearly weights on weight zone system Ways on wash on system carbon to carbon angle. So the carbon plus average words plus something, something I think. And uh and uh this the uh uh but this one this one is zero to zero to five this allows a lot uh but uh but uh I do I do you know proof proof your resources. Do you see that there is a way with Rudolph's words of this equation? Equation? Can you unmute yourself yourself? Okay, okay, so okay, yeah, so the problem that we ran into is that most of the analysis that we did takes place on this part of the curve. Part of the curve. So it is, so this part of the curve. And on that part of the curve, the tangent angle theta is just almost constant. It is, depending on where you start counting, it's roughly zero. So that means that you have to study this equation. And what happens away from theta is zero is pretty well understood because of this. understood because you because of this wants to be zero so you um you get k is some combination of sines and cosines which which describes this um uh the grim reaper the translating soliton but then there's a transition between between this end and the rest of the curve where the curvature stays finite so and that is that is this branch and there theta is very small so then you would have to zoom in on that and and then Zoom in on that, and I and then after a while, um, it didn't seem uh, let's see, it didn't give us any ideas. Whereas this, you know, studying this equation is almost a linear heat equation. When, so ux is the derivative of this function, right? So, ux is almost zero, so that means that this vertical, this horizontal branch, the red piece that I drew, evolves almost by the linear heat. Evolves almost by the linear heat equation, so that which was very useful. Okay, okay. So, so, okay, okay. So, just one, just one very approach to design, it would so there should be other approaches that make don't make as many assumptions as we did. Are there questions?
