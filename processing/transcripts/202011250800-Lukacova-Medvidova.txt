Thank you, and Mira, for this kind invitation and for the opportunity to speak in this workshop. Of course, it will be very nice to meet all of you in person in Banff, but at least we have this opportunity to interact and discuss together. And today, I would like to speak about our recent research result on viscolastic phase separation. And this is a joint work with Burka Dunbeck and Dominique Spieler, who are from Dominique Spiller, who are from statistical physics, and the analytical part was done in cooperation with my PhD student, Aaron Brunk. So if I speak about phase separation, we might have different situations. So you might have mixture in which there is no self-iteration in the favor of one species. And maybe if the environment and situation Environment and situation change. Maybe if you increase the temperature, then you might see the separation. So there is the self-interaction in one or the other species, as you see here. So we really see separated two faces. And as time will involve, typically these two spaces try to reduce the contact area and something like this will happen. And this situation is quite well understood. Is quite well understood. So, in statistical physics, you will find something which is called model H. And in mathematical literature, you find bind Kahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system. So, for those of you who maybe don't know this equation, this is the Kahn-Hilliard equation. It's the fourth order parabolic equation. μ is the so-called chemical potential, and phi is sitting here for the volume fraction. So, how much from one or the other phase do I have? And it's, of course, Do I have? And it's, of course, coupled to our well-known Avier-Stokes equations here. They are in incompressible setting. And there is a coupling through this Cortex-V stress tensor, as well as viscosity might depend on phi. And there is a big literature on this model, but statistical physicists realized that this model might not be enough efficient if you are going to describe Are you going to describe something like transient Gel? So it's a situation where one of the phase is the polymer. Well, and then I have the dynamic asymmetry of components, slow and fast. So the relaxation effects happens on different scales. And what I'm having here is the viscolastic relaxation in pattern formation. Why pattern formation? Because typically the slow phase is trying to create a transient. To create a transient network structure, and what you see here is that the solvent flows through this network structure, it's like the porous media flow. And this phenomena was, as far as I know, firstly point out by Tanaka 20 years ago, and he called it viscolastic phase separation. He even proposed a model, and I will speak about that. So, what you see in experiments, and this is the first row you have here, is Row, you have here is firstly, you have kind of the homogeneous structure, but as time evolves, the solvent, which is the gray part here, is aggregating and you have the bubbles. They force the polymer to create this network-like structure, which you see here. We have the volume shrinking of the polymeric phase. The solvent phase aggregate more and more. Solvent phase aggregate more and more, and finally, the network structure is breaken, as you see here. Well, so that's this is the experiment, and it's really the experiment of polyester with this PVME, and that's the solvent. I know what it is, polyvinyl metal eter. So, that is that. Whatever. These are the numerical simulations in 2 and 3D, and maybe I'll just show you the video. So, you see, now it comes, right? Now you will see the network structure of the The network structure of the polymer. The blue is the solvent. Finally, the network structure is broken. And if I let the video running further, you will see the classical phase separation. So at the end of the day, there will be the bubble and the rest. So what is the mathematical model behind? So here are the terms which we are using in the description. Polymer volume fraction, phi, then the bulk stress, this. Then the bulk stress, viscolastic stress, and the volume average velocity. So what this bulk stress, which might be new for you, is doing for us. It's kind of additional pressure and the gradient of bulk stress is acting from the polymer rich phase into the solvent rich phase. So it is oriented in the opposite direction as the polymer molecules flows or goes, right? Flows or goes, right? And so it effectively slows down the coagulation effects of polymers and it forces polymer rich phase to create this network-like structure. Fine, the model can be derived using generic or even using this consistent thermodynamical approach where I prescribe the Helmholtz free energy and entropy. Helmholtz free energy and entropy production. So, what is the Helmholtz free energy or the total energy? It's the mixing energy, it's the energy of bulk stress, the energy of the viscoelastic part and the kinetic energy. And I just go quick through this page, which is about the Khan-Hilliard. So, the mixing energy is the sum of the energy due to this mixing potential. It is actually double. Potential, it is actually double well potential. So, if I am sitting in one or the other minimum, it's my equilibrium of one or the other phase. But you see, there is the other mixing phenomena appearing here. So, in fact, I need some additional kickoff to go through this energy barrier from one to the other stable state. And then there is the additional term, which is actually penalty term, because the Penalty term because to minimize the energy, the aim is to minimize the surface between two phases. So that's kind of the penalizing the interfaces between two phases. Okay, so further, can I? This is the model which is the improvement of the Tanaka model, was proposed 2006 by Zhu Tsang and Bainan E. And you see, it's a model consisting of four PGEs. Let me just quickly describe what you have here. First of all, let us concentrate on these first black terms. This is nothing else just the Kanhelia. So it is diffusive multiphase diffusive phase interface model. And then this phi equation is coupled with the reaction diffusion equation for bulk stress. For bulk stress, and we have two diffusive terms. So, if you look on the phi equation and the Q equation, you see this cross-diffusion phenomena, which we have here. And this makes the dynamics, well, or analysis a little bit more complicated. On top of that, I have the Nabier-Stokes equation, and of course, I have the coupling with the volume fraction equation through this Cortex-Debye stress. Cortex-Dev stress and the coupling with the viscolastic stress evolution. And they used or they well proposed the all-droid B model, but of course you can use your favorite viscolastic model or model for evolution of viscolastic stress tensor depending on which material you are modeling. So this model had been used for numerical simulations quite successfully, and we were asking ourselves And we were asking ourselves what can be done for the understanding from the mathematical point of view. Can we say that the global equation solution exists, which solution, is it maybe unique or unique in some sense? And to this end, we have decided to replace the equation for this cholastic stress tensor by the equation for the conformation tensor. That's not a problem because the conformation tensor is just the Because the conformation tensor is just the shifted viscoelastic stress tensor, I denoted now by capital T. We use the Peterlink kind representation. So I allow more generality, more nonlinear dependence here. So usually you will just have C minus I. The most important change with respect to the model I showed you before is that I have diffusive dynamics. So I allow here very small Small diffusive coefficient in the viscolastic evolution equation as well as in the Q equation, because they are responsible for the similar effects. Now the whole system is dissipative. I have the total energy, which consists of the mixing energy, energy of the bulk stress, kinetic energy, and the viscolastic energy. And the model is a dissipative model. model is a dissipative model. On top of that, we have additionally apono functional for this system, which is of this type. So now I have really the L2 norm of C. And for that, we have the following inequality. I would just like to point out that there is this additional term which has the minus sign and well, so d is Well, so d is, I cannot say about the sign about the d, but it doesn't matter. I can put it on the right-hand side, do the Grandval argument, and I get the estimates which are needed. So, for example, I can tell you a priori in which spaces my solution will looks, will live. Due to this cross-diffusion effect, I have, however, this term. So, from this term, I cannot really say you what is the gradient of mu in which chemical potential. Mu in which chemical potential in which space it is living. So we need to do something with that. So, first of all, let me mention something about the existence, and we can prove that we have a global weak solution in 2D. And we have also, we are now writing down the result for 3D. So, in order to show the existence of global weak solution, I propose in two steps. First of all, I will consider regular case. All I will consider regular case and I will tell you what it is. And then the singular case, which is maybe more interesting for physicists, is proven as the sequence of regular approximations. So what about the regular case? If I can go back to show you the model again, you see that I have this mobility function sitting here. I have this relaxation coefficient, the coefficient A. The coefficient a, and they all depend on phi. And I assume that these are nice. So it means all of these parametric functions are continuous, bounded positively from below, and they are bounded from above. I assume that my mobility function will not be zero, so I do not get the generate parabolic situation. And I assume that the polynomial, this mixing double well potential polynomial, Potential, polynomial. Sorry, this mixing double-bell potential is of polynomial type, and it is the so-called Kinsburg-Landam potential. So that's the regular case. In the singular case, I will allow the logarithmic Flory-Haggins potential, which physicists like more, and I will also allow that the mobility function really vanish, but only if I am sitting in one or the other phase. Okay, so what about the regular? So, what about the regular case? So, here is the result. I have the global weak solution. Well, more or less standard spaces. So, for the velocity, the things that you will assume, sigma means solenoidal space, phi, right? It's the volume fraction. I had B Laplacian. So, really, we can show that it is in L2H2 and L infinity H1. And we can show that. Show that the chemical potential is in L2H1. So, how to do that? And there are two steps. First of all, we do the classical energy method and Garkin estimates, and they will tell you, well, from the energy, I showed you the energy, so you are not quite surprised that I have this information. But in the energy, I had this term, right? So I only have that this difference is in L2, L2. And I would like to have the information really on the chemical potential. Information really on the chemical potential. So, how to do that? And for that, I do something like entropy estimates. So, it means I construct the entropy function, which is the convex function having the minimum in one half. And then I use g prime as the test function in the Kahn-Hilliard. So you can think that I am doing grand normalization of the Kahn-Hilliard equation, which gives me this entropy equation. Entropy equation and building on that, if I do a little bit more well holder estimates, I end up with the information on phi, which is important for me, and I end up on the information that the chemical potential is living in L2H1. Maya, can I ask you something, Andre, here? Yes. In the second displayed line of mathematics, I don't understand this. I don't understand this modulus sign that is around minus. Did you not have earlier a combination of these terms without these modulus sign around the minus? Yes. Is that a typo? I think we can derive that, but you can, I mean, what is important here is really that you have the difference, right? So we, as you said, we have the difference between these two in L2, L2. 2 in L2L2. That's the important information. And from that, we don't know what is the gradient of μ. We cannot say what is the gradient of μ. But doing this renormalized Canheliad equation, I get this information. That's the message. Yes. So what I'm saying before, you had an absolute value of the difference, and now you have a difference of absolute values. Yes, I know. Yeah. But isn't it just simple? Estimate that you from below, estimate that. You from below estimate the absolute value of the difference by the difference of absolute values? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. But it is not, it's not essential here. You can think you have the information of the difference in, say, in absolute values. You have the information on the difference of absolute value. And I can derive from that by doing this entropy renormalization the information on the gradient of mu. And that's that's like what it That's like what is the point. So now, and okay, so singular case can be done by the sequence of these regular cases and a little bit more work with the entropy equation, which gives me then the phi is in L infinity almost everywhere and really leaving between zero and one. Now, what about the uniqueness? Of course, we might have many weak solutions, but Might have many weak solutions, but at least can we say something about weak strong uniqueness? And the answer is yes. However, we have to do a little bit something because the whole energy is not convex, right? I have the term which is the integral of F there and F is a double well potential. So if I just apply this standard technique like doing first order Tyler expansion, it will not help me. But what can one do? One can add a pattern. One does, one can add a penalty term, right? So, I mean, you remember I had these square norms, right? So, that's the term coming from the mixing energy. And then we have the energy for Q, kinetic energy, and viscolastic energy. And here we have the expansion of the double well potential. And that will be not convex. So, I will convexify the whole relative energy. And of course, this can be done by taking alpha. can be done by taking alpha penalty term appropriate. And it's interesting that this concept is of course known in statistical physics and it is statistical distance or Brendman distance in the phase space with respect to the energy landscape. In our community we know that this relative energy can be used to study the extrong uniqueness and indeed weak strong uniqueness and indeed we were able to derive the relative energy inequality so if z is the weak solution and that hat is the strong solution starting from the same initial data i have this inequality and since they start from the same initial data i have zero on the right hand side and now d is really the dissipative term so well this is the term we have discussed um is um all of them have the sign right so it this is really positive Right, so this is really positive. So, at the end of the day, we have the weak strong uniqueness. So, the weak solution coincides with the strong solution on its lifespan. Now, if I go to the relative energy inequality, I can use it even in other settings or other situation. If I take any enough smooth arbitrary functions at head and plug it into the equation. That head and plug it into the equation, I get some residual. And this residual, if I control them, I can say how far will be z from that head. So, for example, in numerics, I can do the following. I can take my z will be my numerical solution, and that head will be my exact solution, exact weak solution, which is projected into the finite element space. And for that, it is not so difficult to derive this residual. It's more or less interpolated. It's more or less interpolation errors. So this will tell me what is the numerical error. I can control the numerical error in this way. And it was like deja vu for me if I have seen that many coarse-graining models in statistical physics and really in polymer research, what people are deriving, they are derived from the so-called relative entropy. And that's exactly as it is. So they derive cost-graining model using the relative entropy, which Model using the relative entropy, which is in our case relative energy, and I see more potential here to really do rigorous analysis between the fine-scale model and the coarse-grain model. Okay, I finished with two experiments. You remember the picture which I showed you at the beginning. And so we have 40% of polymer and now at the initial data and I'm in rest. And now I randomly perturbed it. I randomly perturbed it, and the random perturbation is very small. And now I can ask how good is my numerical method, or how good is the simulation I showed you. So here you see it. This is the measure refinement with respect to like finest of the method. And here this is the relative energy. And for this experiment, the relative energy gives me the first order. And if I change it, so I do not take the random. So, I do not take the random perturbation, but small, very oscillatory, but like smooth perturbation, and do the same, then the relative energy even decreases with the second order. And I did not tell you what is the method, so it is the characteristic method finite element, but I mean, it's just the like illustration that this relative energy can be really used to discuss also the convergence. The convergence order numerical method. And with that, I will stop and thank you for attention. So, thank you very much, Maria, for your lecture. Are there any questions?
