Great event. I'm going to talk about some of my recent research on wave turbancing finite domain, rule of discrete resonant manifold. Some of the actual work in this presentation is done by my grad student, Alex Rapsky. And we would also like to thank Safar Hani for his many useful discussions and his guidance for some mathematical problems. Here is an outline of the presentation. Here is an outline of the presentation. I will start by an overview of the wave turbulence theory. I think this is necessary because not all audiences are in the field of wave turbulence. And then I'm going to discuss the current understanding of wave turbulence in finite domain based on the so-called sine-power model. And then some of my research in the framework of MMT turbulence, where we are going to elucidate the role of the discrete resonant manifold on the finite domain wave turbulence. And then some application. And then some application to a physical wave system, the capture wave turbulence, followed by some implications and some other thoughts. So to start with, I'm going to introduce the concept of wave turbulence by making an analogy to the more familiar concept of the hydrodynamic turbulence or the flow turbulence. As established by Kamgarf, there is a vortex energy cascade process in the flow turbulence. That the energy is transferred from large Is transferred from large vortices to small vortices and finally gets dissipated at the smallest vortices in the flow domain. And for the wave turbulence, the physical picture is similar as established by the cadar. So we have a wave energy cascade where the energy can be transferred from the long waves to short waves, and finally it gets dissipated by the viscous effect at the shortest waves. Due to the similar physical pictures of the two systems, there are Two cisterns, their energy spectra look similar. So, namely, we have an injection range at the large scales where the energy is injected into the field, and we have a dissipation range at small scales where the energy is dissipated. In between, we have the so-called inertial range, which has a parallel analytical form that can be written here. The spectrum I as a function of k is equal to the Karma-Garf constant C times angiflax. C times antiflux P to the power of gamma and K to the power of alpha, where P is simply the antiflux which carries energy from large scale to small scales. In this analytical spectrum, there are three key parameters, alpha, gamma, and C. So within these two systems, the wave turbine system is more amenable to mathematical analysis because of the wave turbine theory established by the curve. Established by the curve. So, for any nonlinear dispersive wave equations, we can formulate this analytical spectrum based on mathematical analysis under some physical assumptions. The general derivation process is as follows. We start from the so-called primitive equation, so which could be an LS or R equation for surface waves or stratified neighbor stocks for internal gravity waves. And we make two assumptions here. And we make two assumptions here. One is weak nonlinearity, and the other one is infinite domain, which I'm going to elaborate more later. So, under the two assumptions, we can derive the so-called Kinette equation. The Kinette equation is an evolution equation for the wave spectrum. In this case, I write it as the spectrum of the wave action NK. So, this equation tells us that the evolution of the spectrum can be computed by the integration of all By the integration of all the resonant interactions in the spectral domain. And in this case, I use an example of the charge resonance with the resonant interaction involving three wave vectors or wave modes. So then by integrating out contribution for the resonant interaction, we can get the evolution of the wave spectrum. If we make an assumption of isotropic spectrum and then we look for a stationary solution of the kinetic equation, Solution of the kinetic equation, we can get the station solution as a common garb-stack curve solution associated with the finite energy flux. So in this presentation, I'm going to use the subscript zero to denote the solution from WTT to distinguish them from the solution that we are going to obtain for the finite domain. So, this general framework of web-curbion theory. Framework of web turbine theory is pretty general and it has been applied to many physical applications. I'm not going to read through this list here, but this list is still rapidly expanding. So the framework is great, but we need to have more consideration on assumptions if our purpose is to use this theory for real world, especially if we want to observe wave turbulence in experiments and simulations. Simulations. So we need to elaborate on the two assumptions. The first one is on weak nonlinearity. So I would like to say a few more words about nonlinearity because of the different terminology used in different fields. So by nonlinearity, I basically what I mean is some measure of the intensity of the wave field or the amplitude of the waves or in the spectral level, nonlinearity is measured by the spectral level. So the higher the spectral level, the stronger So, the higher the spectral level, the stronger the nonlinearity direction, and the higher the nonlinearity level. On the weak nonlinearity side, there are two major effects in terms of mathematics. The one is that we can apply perturbation analysis to have a truncated Hamiltonian system. So, that will result in a simplified equation, but still captures a major nonlinear interaction of the physical weight systems. And then we can also. These terms. And then we can also apply the quasi-Gaussian closure model to derive the kinetic equation. So, WTT, strictly speaking, is only valid for the weak nonlinearity regime. And on the strong nonlinearity regime, we'll have the wave field contains lots of coherent structures or turbulent intermittency, which are outside the scope of WTP. And the second assumption is on infinite domain. On infinite domain, it simply means that the wave field does not have any boundary. So, clearly, this can be easily violated in experiments or simulations. For the experiments, we always have a finite wave tank, and for simulations, we already have a finite simulation domain. And in many cases, we apply periodic boundary conditions for the simulation of homogeneous turbulence, as an example. So, now the question is, how do we understand? The question is: How do we understand the wave turbancy in these finite domains? One of the most important effects for the finite domain is that the wave number k can now only take a discrete value. So a simple example is a string between two rigid walls. So because of the boundary condition of the two walls, we only have the modes with the integer wave number that can be excited. So mathematically, we will have the wave number can only take Wave number can only take from the discrete set of integer in n dimension, and the dynamics is also defined on the torus, in this case for periodic domain. So the discrete wave number has profound effect on the resonance and the causal resonance conditions for the wave field. Here, again, I use the example of charge resonance. I have the k condition and omega condition, where k and omega are connected by some dispersion relation. By some dispersion relation. In this equation, I also contain, I also include a factor of omega, which represents the nonlinear broadening. If omega is equal to zero, big omega is equal to zero, then physically we have the exact resonance. And this is the situation considered in the kinetic equation, or WTT. And this really has no problem in the infinite domain because we can find a solution on the continuous manifold, and to integrate on this manifold, we get the Manifold, we get the evolution of the wave spectrum. However, if you have a discrete domain, if you have a discrete wave number, then lots of these solutions are eliminated because of the discreteness. So the general statement here is that we have more solutions for k as a real number than k as an integer. And in certain cases, we even have no solutions in the discrete case. But we still need to transfer energy. So in this case, we'll need to rely on the causal. case we'll need to rely on the causal resonance where we allow a finite positive value of obeg omega and in this case the mechanism as follows if if we increase the nonlinearity level then we'll increase the nonlinear broadening and then we'll end up with more solutions for this equation and finally we'll have still have sufficient charge to transfer energy in the wave field enabling the energy cascade process so now we are on a good position So now we are on a good position to introduce the sun pile model. So, in the sun power model, the nonlinearity is considered as the height or the slope of a sandpile. And on this figure, from left to right, we have the increasing nonlinearity level or increasing the nonlinear broadening or the height of the sand pile. On the left end, we have a low height, so there will be no sand sliding corresponding to the situation. Sliding corresponding to the situation of no energy cascade in a wave field. With the increase of nonlinear level or the height of the sand pile, we will trigger an avalanche of the sand corresponding to the spectral avalanche for the wave turbulence. To be more specific, on the right end, we have the kinetic wave turbulence regime corresponding to the condition that the nonlinear broadening omega is much larger than the frequency discreteness due to the wave number discretion. Discreteness due to the wave number discreteness. And on the left end, we have the regime of discrete wave turbulence, where the nonlinear brightening omega is much less than the frequency discreteness. So what spectrum are we going to observe for these different regimes? Here are some hypotheses. On the KWT regime, it is postulated that the dynamics will approach to WTT. So this has two meanings. One is that the spectral Two meanings. One is that the spectral slope alpha will approach to the theoretical value alpha zero, and the energy flux P will approach to the energy flux computed by WT. And on the left end of the DWT, we may have the phenomenon called frozen turbulence. Basically, we have no spectral energy transfer, so the modes are frozen, the wave modes are frozen in this case. In between, we have a transition regime, which is already. A transition regime, which is usually associated with a steepened spectrum, meaning that alpha is less than alpha zero, and the energy flux P is smaller than the WTT value. So this hypothesis has to be supported by numerical and experimental evidences. Here, I'm not going to list all these numerical and experimental study. I'm going to summarize by a simple statement that only a part of the numerical and Only a part of the numerical and experimental evidences agree with these behaviors. So to be a little bit more specific, there are indeed many experiments and simulations showing that the value of alpha in the KWT regime is at least close to the theoretical value of alpha zero. And there are also some experiments and simulations showing that with a decrease of non-linear level, we have a steepened spectrum as here. But not all. As here, but not all of them. We also have experiment simulations which show the constant spectral slope with a decrease of nonlinearity level. And the situation regarding the energy flux is more elusive. There are many reasons for that, which I will discuss later. But the thing that I want to convey here is that whether we can consider this behavior as general for the finite wave turbulence. General for the finite wave turbulence. So, the question I'm going to ask is that if there is any hidden physics that we need to add to the framework of the sine-power model to understand the physics in the finite domain. And in this presentation, I hope that I can show you that there is something called discrete resonance manifold, which will play a critical role in the finite domain. And it's simply the set of discrete, a discrete set of resonance as a nonlinear broadening omega goes. As the nonlinear broadening omega goes to zero. Okay, for our study of the finite domain turbulence, we start from the MMT equation, which is a generic wave equation. So the reason for us to start from here is because we want to review some general property of the finite domain turbulence. So we start from a generic wave equation instead of some specific physical system. So the MMP. So the MMD equation is written here. Notation-wise, we have the partial x absolute value to denote the multiplication by k on each spectral component in the wavenumber domain. And the dispersion relation is determined by the linear term, which has a dispersion relation of omega equal to k squared, which is the same as on L S. So in fact, So in fact, we can make this equation exactly the same as NLS by choosing tuning parameters to make these partial x term to be one. However, we prefer to keep them because this corresponds to a faster spectral evolution. So this is some desirable property for computational for computer simulations. So we can obtain the parallel spectrum faster with these parameters. Faster with these parameters. So, this equation has a homotonic structure with a linear part denoted by H0 and a nonlinear part denoted by H1. The first task is to find the WTT solution for the MMT. So we can derive a kinetic equation with respect to the action spectrum NK that is defined as ensemble average of the psi K in the wave number domain times this complex conjugate. So the kinetic equation. Conjugate. So the kinetic equation is written here. We see that this system yields a quadratic resonance with four modes. This is due to the cubic nonlinearity in the MMD equation. And we can also solve for the stationary solution for the kinetic equation, which is this solution. The spectrum NK is equal to the Karma-Garth constant C times the anti-flux P to the power of one-third and K to the power of minus 14 over 3. The Karma Garth constant Three. The common graph content C can also be determined, but we have not done that. Okay, so our purpose to study is MMT on a tolerance. In this work, we are going to consider two different tolerance, a rational one and an irrational one. The size of the tolerance is 2 pi times 2 pi over q, where this q is simply the domain aspect ratio. Because of this, our wave number k can only take values from a discrete set of an integer by q times the integer. By q times an integer. And we consider two cases. For the rational tolerance, we make q equal to 1, so we have a square domain. And for the irrational tolerance, we make q square equal to square of 2. And in principle, any irrational number can make this an irrational tolerance, but we use this particular value because it eliminates most resonant quartets. So, this can be shown in these two figures. Due to by a simple mathematical analysis. On the rational tolerance, if we consider the four wave numbers k, k1, k2, k3 as four nodes on the discrete wave number grid, then we can have quadrilaterals with arbitrary orientations which satisfy the resonant condition. And on the irrational tolerance, we only have quadrilaterals with a horizontal or vertical orientation. This means that on the rational tolerance, means that on the rational tolerance we have much more red and interaction than that on the irrational torus. So we do numerical simulation of the MMT equation on rational and irrational tori. And to achieve the Komgar-Sachar solution, we need some hyper-viscosity term to dampen the solution and high wave numbers. So these are added on the right hand side of the equation in such a form. So we have a k to the power of a k to the power of a proportionality to emphasize on the high wave number and we also have a parameter nu to control the amplitude of this dissipation. And for the initial conditions we use Gaussian spectrum with different spectral levels and the code is accelerated on GPU so it can be used to treat simulations with relatively many number of modes. Here are some results Here are some results. On the top two figures, what I showed is the spectral evolution. So, on both tiles, we start from a Gaussian spectrum, which is shown by the dashed line. And after sufficient time, the spectrum will evolve into a stationary stage. And on both Tauri, we plotted a few spectrum at different non-linearity levels. So, from these two figures, we already see that on the rational. already see that on the rational tolerance, the spectral level actually, the spectral slope actually becomes flattened as we decrease the nonlinearity level. But on the irrational tolerance, the spectral slope becomes steepened as we decrease the nonlinearity level. So this can be seen more clearly from this figure where we plot the spectral slope alpha as a function of nonlinearity level. Here we define the nonlinearity level as the Nonlinearity level as the nonlinear part of the Hamiltonian over the total Hamiltonian. And the blue line shows the spectral slope on the rational tolerance, and the red line shows the spectral slope on the irrational tolerance. We also include some uncertainty bars due to the range of the amplitude of the dissipation μ. So it indeed affects the specific value of the spectral slope, but the effect Low, but the effect is insignificant, and also it does not affect the trend of the curve. So we see that at high nonlinearity level, the spectral slope from the rational and irrational tori are similar, but with a decrease of epsilon, the spectral slope on the rational tolerance will approach the WTT value of minus 14 over 3 and remains on that level. But on irrational tolerance, the The spectral level will become steeper and with more deviation from the theoretical value. So, the question is why that happens. Remember that in these two simulations, the only thing we change is the domain aspect ratio, and we have a remarkably different behavior on the spectral flow. So, to answer this question, we first did some analysis on the energy flux P. So, our purpose here is to develop an approach to exactly approach to exact eval to evaluate the energy flux exactly. So this is in contrast to the previous measurement by equating the energy flux to the either the energy dissipation rate or the energy input rate. Due to different reasons, they are not exactly equal to each other. So we hope to develop a direct and exact evaluation. And we also hope to decompose the energy flux into two parts. The energy Flux into two parts, the energy flux due to the exact resonance and the energy flux due to the causal resonance. So the basic idea is based on the energy conservation. So if we consider a spectral domain Kx, Ky here, and we consider the energy flux across the wave number Kb, then this P can be equated by the energy decay rate within this circle. So this is the equation written here. We copied this. The equation written here. We calculated by the summation over the value of k that is less than kb of the energy decay rate for each mole, which is computed by omega k times partial nk partial t. Then our task is to give some calculation of this partial nk partial t, and it turns out that this can be derived directly from the MMT equation as this equation here. So note that this equation is not a kinetic equation. Not the kinetic equation. By deriving this, we haven't put any assumptions in it. So this equation is still exact. And to compute partial nk, partial t, we are going to do a summation over k1, k2, k3, and then the right-hand side part. And we can also distinguish this from the exact resonance and the causal resonance. For the exact resonance, we are going to sum over the set of S exact. That is the wave numbers k1, k2, k3, which satisfy. K1, K2, K3, which satisfy the exact resonance. And for the causal resonance set, we sum over the set of SQUA, that is the set which satisfies the Wig number condition, but not the frequency condition. And we put the computation of partial NK, partial T into the first equation, then we can evaluate P for exact resonance and causal resonance. So this computation itself is actually pretty expensive. The computation itself is actually pretty expensive because you can see that this summation is a six-dimensional summation if we consider two-dimensional k. And plus this summation, we will have an eight-dimensional summation. But we end up with an exact evaluation of the p xi and p cosi. So here are the results. On the left figure, what it's shown is a total energy flux p on the rational and irrational tau i. So we see that So we see that the blue line, which represents the energy flux P on the rational tolerance, is consistently higher than the P on the irrational tolerance, shown by the red line. And this difference is pronounced at low nonlinearity level epsilon. So this basically means that on the rational tolerance, the NG cascade is more much more efficient than the irrational tolerance at the low nonlinearity level. At the low nonlinearity level. And on the right, we show the ratio of P exact over P for different nonlinearity levels. We see that for the retro tolerance, the blue line actually approach the value of one when we decrease the nonlinearity level quickly. And on the other hand, the increase of the ratio for the irregular tolerance is much slower. Also, from this figure, if we Also, from this figure, if we look at the critical value of epsilon where the rational tolerance ratio approached one, this is approximately the same as the critical value of epsilon, where the slope approached the WTT value. So this suggests that the understanding of the exact resonance for these two towers is the key to understand the behavior of the spectral slope. So, next, I'm going to introduce the understanding from the discrete resonance manifold and the continuous resonance system. So, I will start from the DRM. By DRM, we basically refer to a discrete set of wave number which satisfy the resonant condition on both k and omega. And another way to consider this is the set of s exact intersect with discrete wave numbers k, k1, k2, and k2. Remembers k, k1, k2, and k3. So, here I'm going to switch the gear a little bit to introduce the continuous resonance system, which is proved in the following paper on JAMS, as well as a few following up papers that I didn't list here. So, the paper proves the following theorem, which is now described in a pedagogic way. So, for NLS on the rational tolerance, at low nonlinearity level and at large. And at large box limit, we'll have the following equation. So, this is called the continuous resonant equation. When I first saw this equation, I saw that it's the same as the kinetic equation, but the key difference is that this equation is with respect to the primitive wave variable ak instead of wave spectrum. So, this is the equation in a deterministic sense instead of a spectral sense. So, we need to go into the So, we need to go into the conditions to understand this equation a little bit better. So, the first condition is at low nonlinearity. So, we need this because at low nonlinearity, we can get rid of the contribution from the causal resonance. So, we will end up with an integration of the contribution only on the resonant manifold, including the omega condition. And the second thing to note is that the statement says. That the statement says that for NLS on the rational tolerance, so we should have the summation of all these wave numbers because it's discrete. But it turns out that at large box limit, this summation can be understood in the sense of a Riemann summation. So it can be represented by an integration with a factor difference, where this factor involves a zeta function. So a number of serial problems involved in the derivation of this equation, which is written here. Equation which is written here. Basically, we have the summation on the discrete set of k1, k2, k3 of a1, a2 multiplied by the complex conjugate of a3 equal to the integration on this manifold with a factor difference. And to be more specific, this is what we call by the DRM, and we'll call this as the CRM, the continuous resonant manifold. So if we apply this. So, if we apply this remember theoretical result in our computation of partial nk partial t, then we can derive an equation which equates this partial nk partial t as an integration on the CRM instead of the discrete summation. So this is for rational tolerance at low nonlinearity level. And here I neglect the factor difference. So here I basically rewrote this equation here. basically rewrote this equation here I basically rewrote this equation here with two delta functions on the k and omega so I would like to compare this equation with the equation on infinite domain which is this equation so the only difference is that on the rational tolerance we at low non-limit level we have the doubt function on omega because we eliminate because we eliminate the quasi-resonance. Eliminate the quasi-resonance, and also we have a factor difference here. And for the equation on the infinite domain, we can derive a kinetic equation, and the standard procedure is to apply the cost-agulation closure, and then take the large time limit. So, the kinetic equation will naturally eliminate all the cost of resonance. So, we end up with the equation with only the exact resonance. But for our But for our Taurus equation, we have already eliminated the causal resonance here. So it is expected, at least from a heuristic level, that we can also derive a kinetic equation for the continuous resonance system. And this equation will be the same as a kinetic equation in terms of the structure, but it will have a factor difference behind. So this is something I discussed with Zaha, but this has not been. With Zafa, but this has not been rigorously done. But I think we think that this is possible. So then, if we use a continuous resonant kinetic equation to describe the spectral behavior, we can solve this equation for the stationary solution, which will yield the spectral slope alpha on the rational powers with the same value of alpha zero because the stationary solution is the same. But the energy flux P will have a factor difference. A will fat will have a factor difference at the WTT value because the factor here, and this can also be quantified if you have a more clear understanding of the prefactor. So, this tells us why on the rational tolerance, the spectral slope alpha agrees with WTT at low nonlinearity level. We can also have some numerical visualization of the DRM, but DRM is a high-dimensional. But DRM is a high dimensional has a high dimensional structure and we would like to limit some parameter here to visualize a low dimensional structure. So what we did is we fixed the value of k2 vector and k3x. So we end up with s exact set only containing three parameters and this parameterized by the k vector. So we can plot this manifold in a three-dimensional space and the left figure shows CRM similar Similar is the same as a WTT consideration, and more specifically, it is S exact intersect with the continuous wave number. And in the middle, we show the DRM on the rational tolerance, meaning the S exact intersect with K in CR. And on the right, we show the DRM and irrational torus. So we see immediately that for the DRM and the rational torus, the structure of the discrete matter. The structure of the discrete manifold resembles the structure of the continuous manifold in WTP. But for the DRM and the irrational tolerance, lots of the resonance are eliminated, so we have a depleted structure compared to the CRM. So physically, what happened is that for the WTT case, the CRM case, we'll have the spectral slope from the WTT. And for the rational taurus case, we'll have R5. Tyler's case will have alpha agree with the alpha zero, but will have a different value of Kamagaus constant that has not been solved. So for the irrational Taurus case, we'll have the steepened spectrum with alpha less than alpha zero. And at the limit of low non-linearity level, we'll have the frozen turbulence behavior. So this is consistent with the hypothesis in the framework of the Send Pau model, but not the rational. But not the rational torus mechanism. Okay, so it turns out that the DRM structure is very important for the discrete wave turbines, as we have already shown. And the key to characterize its structure is from this equation. In particular, whether we can relate the discrete summation on BRM to a continuous integration on the CRM. And in my limited And in my limited knowledge, I think that this has only been approved for the dispersion relation of omega equal to k squared on the rational torus. And I do not know for whether this will be hold for other dispersion relation. Actually, for some dispersion relations, this will not be hold. So that basically means we need to understand this better as a number theory problem to help us to elucidate the physics. So in general, this DRM will depend on the dispersion. DRM will depend on the dispersion relation, the domain aspect ratio, and the dimensionality, as well as the number of modes in each interaction. So, this equation is specifically for the quoted resonance, but for tried resonance, we'll have a different equation to consider. So, this basically means that different physical waves have different DRM structure. Therefore, they will have different behavior of the DWT discrete wave turbulence that have no. Discrete wave turbulence that have not been studied before. Here we also have a hypothesis, and we think it might be possible to find the critical value of Q for each dispersion relation to make this equation hold. So basically, for some dispersion relation, this equation might not be satisfied, but probably we can find a critical value of Q for this equation to hold. If that is the case, then for each different physical width system, we can find a critical With sister, we can find a critical domain spec ratio to make this equation to make this equation be satisfied so that we can maintain the WTT spectral slope solution with varying nonlinearity level. So in the following, I'm going to show you an example where example of physical wave system, which we will observe completely different magnetism. Mechanism compared to the MMP. So, namely, we'll have a system that this equation is not satisfied on the rational tolerance. So, we'll have steepened spectrum on the rational tolerance. And this example is captured wave turbulence. So, as an introduction, capture waves are basically surface waves with short wavelengths, less than 17 millimeters, and it dominates the small scales of the ocean surface. The gamma equation for the The gamma equation for the capillary wave is a primitive R equation for surface elevation eta and for surface potential psi. So these two equations are written in the Zachary form. For capital waves, the dominant nonlinear interaction is a charge interaction instead of a quartet. And we also have a dispersion relation omega equal to k to the power of 3 over 2. So under these two conditions, if we look at the DRM on the rational tolerance, it's actually an empty set. So we have no resonance. So we have no resonance. So we have no resonance on the rational torus, no matter how fine the grid is. So it means that this equation now is not satisfied on the rational tolerance. And the WTD solution for the capital wave is written here. It's Kamga's constant C times the energy flux P to the half and K to the minus 19 over 4. And we'll discuss the value of C shortly. So for our numeric simulation of the Kepler. So, for our numeric simulation of the capillary wave, we add the high wave number dissipation on the right-hand side. So, this is a simulation done a few years ago. So, I didn't, so we didn't use the hyper-viscosic term. So, we use these high-wave number dissipation on the right-hand side. So, namely, we have this gamma k parameter only to be non-zero for k greater than k gamma. And for k less than k gamma, we have it equal to zero. k gamma we have have it equal to zero. So we have the range of dissipation for k greater than k gamma and then the range for k less than k gamma we only have nonlinear interactions. The numerical scheme to solve this equation is a high order scheme, a high order spectral scheme which then efficient scheme with only an unlocked operation for each time step. So here is the results of the spectral evolution. Again we start from initial spectrum archuy one and then Archuy one. And then after sufficient time, this initial spectrum will evolve into a stationary, will evolve into a fully developed parallel stage. Here I showed three parallel spectrum here. For each of these parallel spectrum, we can compute the anti-flux. Since this is something I did a few years ago, we didn't use the exact valuation of the p, so we simply equate p by the dissipation rate. P by the dissipation rate. This will introduce some error, but it should be a good approximation. So for each of these parallel spectrum, we can compute the value of p, which of course decreases with the nonlinearity level. And then we can plot the value of alpha as a function of the nonlinearity level measured by p in this case. We see that at high nonlinearity, the alpha approach the theoretical value of minus 90 over. The theoretical value of minus 19 over 4, but with the decrease of the nonlinearity, the alpha decreases, decreases with the steepened spectrum. So this is a completely different behavior as the MD equation on the rational tolerance. And the reason is because we have a different DRM structure for the capillary wave turbulence. So we also did something for the MJ flux. Since I do not have too much time, I'm going to try. Not have too much time. I'm going to try to be brief on this part. So there are two purposes for this study. One is to look at the theoretical scaling of i eta proportional to p to the power of half, and the second one is to look at the value of Kamagar's constant. So for the first purpose, we define an integral measure of i eta tilde, which is the integration of the spectrum in the inertial range. So we plot i tilde as a function of p half. As a function of p half, and the numerical curve is a solid line with a circle. So, if we compare this with the theoretical WTT scaling of p half, we can see that at the low nonlinearity level, the level on the numerical simulation is lower than the theoretical scaling. It means that we have reduced capacity of energy cascade at low nonlinearity level. So, this is also reflected by the common graph concept. By the Kamengarf constant, if we evaluate the Kamagarf constant, we'll have an increased value of Komogarf constant with a decrease of p, the nonlinearity level. But there are some issues with the Kamagarf constant. You can see that on the high nonlinearity, we still have some discrepancy between the theoretical result and the numerical result. I think two most important reasons is that one, we do not know whether in the KWT regime we should approach WTT regime. We should approach WTT result for anti-flux or not. So, this is an open question. And the second one, there are still some controversy for the theoretical value for the capillary wave turbines common-garth constant. The first derivation is done in this paper with a value of 9.85, but when I tried to rederive it in my PhD thesis, actually, I got a different value. So, for a few years, I hope someone could confirm. Years, I hope someone could confirm this from me. Either I made a mistake or I was correct, but this has not been done. So, anyways, important takeaway point from this slide is that we have reduced the capacity of energy cascade at low nonlinear level, which will eventually lead to the frozen turbulence for the capillary wave case. And we can also do a visualization of the nonlinear broadening through the bicoherence function defined like this. So, eta. Defined like this. So eta is a wave elevation, and star denotes a complex conjugate, and the angle bracket is a time average. So this definition of BI basically measures the level of resonance coupling of the three-way modes, K, K1, and K2, which itself is defined as K minus K1. So the wave number condition has already been satisfied for these three-way modes. If you also satisfy the frequency condition, then we'll have a resonant trial. In this case, In this case, the time average on the numerator will give us a non-zero value, which after the normalization by the denominator will give us bi to one. And on the other hand, if we have a non-resonant chart without satisfying the omega condition, then the time average will give us zero, resulting in a value of bi to zero. So in the real world, bi will always be some value between one and zero, which is value as a matter of the degree of the resonance. Degree of the resonance. So, what we do here is to plot the value of Bi for a high nonlinearity case and a low nonlinearity case. For the visualization purpose, we also fix the value of k vector and we plot b as a function of k1 only. So, also shown in these two figures are the exact resonance line as a red dashed curve somewhere here. So, these represent represent sorry so these represent the value of k1 which form an exact resonant chart with this with this vector k so we see that the high intensity of bi are concentrated in the vicinity of this resonant curve and the matter and the width of this high intensity part of bi is a matter of the nonlinearity broadening so we can have a So, we can have a more quantitative definition, but I'm just going to leave it like this because, from these two figures, you can clearly see that the nonlinear broadening for the high nonlinearity case is significantly wider than the nonlinear broadening for the low nonlinearity case. So you can imagine that if we further decrease the nonlinearity level, this high intensity part of BI will vanish. That will eventually lead to the frozen turbulence for the Frozen turbulence for the capillary wave turbulence case, but for the MMT, that will be dominated by the DRM in the high non-linearity, in the low non-linearity limit. Okay, so here are some ongoing works. We have already discussed the first one, the second one. So it's basically the first one on the DRM structure for different physical wave systems, and the second one on the CR kinetic equation and the solution. And the third point, And the third point we haven't discussed too much in this presentation is on the relation between kinetic victurbance and the victurbance theory. So, the fundamental question here is whether the KWT will converge to WTD at some limit. Of course, it is a hypothesis for many years that it will converge, but there is no guarantee, especially considering that there is no confirmation of the Kamerga's constant in the KWT regime. And I think the DRM structure. And I think the DRM structure makes this problem even more complicated because for different DRM structures, we'll have different portions of exact and causal resonance in the KWT regime. So the first thing we need to consider is whether these different DRM structures lead to the same KWT dynamics. If that is the case, then probably we have some hope to find some conversion laymen in the KWT to be. The KWT to be consistent with WTT. And a guess, the third point is my guess, which is based on the recent paper by Deng and Honey. So this paper showed that the Wippinet equation can be derived with epsilon loss for the NLS equation at some scaling of the domain size and nonlinearity. So I think this is related to the question between KWT and The question between KWT and the WTT probably will eventually end up with finding that maybe some scaling of the domain size of nonlinearity is required for the KWT to converge to WTT. So anyway, lots of work has to be done for the understanding of this issue. And finally, I'll end the talk by throwing out some of my thoughts on the DNS. So I'm not an expert on DNS and I do not do supercomputation. supercomputation of DNS, but this is just some of my thoughts. So there have been continuous efforts of increasing the resolutions in the direct numerical simulation. So here I'm talking about more for the simulation for wave turbulence instead of hydrodynamic turbulence. There are some systems which have the interaction of the hydrodynamics and the wave turbulence. For example, in a stratified fluid, so we will have the stratified turbulence and Stratified turbulence and the internal gravity wave turbulence. For example, this is a simulation with 4096 cube grid with periodic boundary conditions taken from the Johns Hopkins Turbines database. So my question or my thoughts on this is that how should we understand these results? And to rephrase it a little bit, is there any caveat we should take for these results due to the study of the DRM structure? Due to the study of the DRM structures. So, again, I'm not an expert on this, so maybe these statements here is not correct, or maybe they are not even important. But anyway, I'm going to throw out this at the end of this talk. So I have two statements here. The first one is that for a given resolution, no matter how fine the grid is, there always exists a critical non-inactive level below which the results depend on the domain aspect ratio. So actually, we have already. So, actually, we have already seen this for the MNT equation simulation. Of course, we only did it for one resolution. But for a final resolution, we can still make the nonlinearity level to be low enough such that this domain aspect ratio dependence will happen. So if this is the case, then the result will be less universal at least, because it only applied for this specific domain. And the second statement is related to the first. The second statement is related to the first one, but I think it is more severe. It said that for some simulation, there may exist a critical remember Kc or scale L C above which or below which the results depends on the domain expect ratio. So my thinking behind this is as follows. So with the increase of wave number, we'll have a decrease of non-linearity level because of the parallel drop of the spectrum. And in the meanwhile, we'll have a more Will have a more larger density of the wave number, meaning that the delta K is less important compared to the wave number K. So there will be some interplay between these two effects, but it's possible to find a critical KCRL C at sufficiently low downlink level. So if we are below this, if we are below this scale, then the result will depend on the domain aspect ratio. And if this LC scale is larger than this LC scale is larger than the common is smaller than the common graph scale probably it is okay because if we consider the inertial range as our major result as our major result but if this L C is larger than the common graph scale then we probably have a problem because below this scale our result again depends on the domain aspect ratio so it is less universal in this sense okay I will skip the conclusion I will skip the conclusion and stop here. I'm going to come back to this page. And so, I'm ready for more questions. Thank you for listening. Thank you very much. Before I open the virtual floor for questions, I'll just remind people that we're going to be running a seminar regularly. It will begin a week from tomorrow. Massamo. Milo Arnold Alberti will be speaking. The details are in the chat. If you could please send me an email to the email given in the chat, wtseminarlist at gmail.com with your name and affiliation if you wish. Now, yeah, I'll open the floor for questions. I have a question. Yeah. More than a question, just actually a comment. So I'm very happy. So I'm very happy, thank you for the talk, and I'm very happy that you addressed the question of rational and irrational toros in 2D. And in particular, because really what you say matches some recent work, one recent couple of years old work that I did with Bobby Wilson. Now, the equation is different because we were just using the Schrodinger equation. But in that paper, I don't know if you're aware of the paper, but in that paper, we basically proved that the mechanism, Proved that the mechanism that was providing some kind of faint weak turbulence in the 2D Schrodinger with rational torus, which I did with Oleander Kiel, Takauk and Tao some time ago, will not work in the rational torus. And it is very similar. It is because the perfect resonance set has very Set is has very few or much fewer vectors in it. But I just wanted to comment that it really matches what you said, and I'm very happy that you give a different perspective on that. But it's the same phenomenon. Oh, yes, I'm not aware of the paper. Could you send me a paper? I can send you an email or you can send me an email because I would love to have also the slides. So let's communicate, but it's by myself and Bobby Wilson. Okay, I will send you an email on. I will send you an email and ask for the paper. Thank you. Yeah, because it's a very similar phenomenon, but it's a different perspective. So I was very happy to see it in this way. Okay, yeah. Thanks. Questions? So I'll just make a comment on in terms of references that Julian had mentioned. So for the CR equation, this was also later investigated with the Later investigated with Tristan, Pierre, myself, and Jalal in higher dimensions, and also we refined the 2D result. I think. And also, when it comes to deriving the kinetic equation with an epsilon loss in the time scale, there was also recently work of Pierre, Germain, and Charles Collot that, at least for some of the scaling laws that we considered with U-Tank, they were also. They were also they also got some results there. Okay, so that is after the 2019 paper with you and around the same time, around the same time. Sorry? Around the same time. Okay, okay. Okay. Would you be I mean, I guess it's very difficult to simulate other geometries, but would you look at other geometries and see the effect of other geometries? Other geometries on the spectrum? Do you mean higher-dimensional geometry? Oh, it doesn't have to be a torus, right? Or a sphere. Oh, yes, yes. I think I didn't think of a sphere, but I think about some different boundary conditions instead of periodic. Maybe, because in the wave. Maybe because in the weak tank it's not periodic boundary condition, so maybe we have a wall boundary condition. So, will that affect the dynamics? So, I plan to study that, study on that, but I haven't done any work on it. So, for third sphere, I think like our circle, I think it's also worthwhile to study because lots of the experiments are done in that in the WIP tank of In a wept tang of a circular shape inside of a rectangle. I hope you can formulate the problem if you had another geometry because this whole thing is predicated on the fact that the resonant manifold describes the equation. The fact that the Fourier transform, when you take a product of two functions, you add up the frequencies. Otherwise, you have a problem in a different geometry. So it's not too bad. So for a different geometry, probably I guess the whole thing is pretty clear on the fact that what you look at is omega 1 plus omega 2 is equal to omega 3 plus omega 4. And that's only true if you are in this kind of commutative Fourier transform. So I think first we'll have different Garnier equations because of the Different Garmin equations because of the on a different cottonist, I guess. And then we, I'm not sure, I'm just guessing maybe we can derive some equivalent resonance condition for different geometries, which involve different type of modes, I guess. Possibly observing the spectrum doesn't require that. Right, observing the linear, so observing proposing the function, no, but to be able to say. No, but to be able to say that the product on the right-hand side are described by the sums of the frequencies, the whole thing is predicated on the fact that you are in the flagellum. Of course. Even if you have the potential, I don't know if it can be done this way. It can be done remarkably, but for mathematical analysis, I'm not sure. I do not know how it will be done. But in the limit of L go to infinity, I think the curvature of the map. Anything, I think the curvature of the manifold will tend to zero. So maybe the uncommutative is not so important. I mean, we also have the large box limits. Ah, okay. You'd have to deal with the eigenfunctions not being all modulus one. Exactly. I have a question. I recall some years ago there were simulations for, say, defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger on the torus and looking not at small solutions, but initial conditions which are near something like a nonlinear ground state. So You look at the energy minimizing state on the torus, which is well, not the uniform solution. And then you look at small fluctuations about that, and you look at the long time evolution. And so then the question becomes just the same question as you ask for small amplitude solutions. Is there some kind of an asymptotic Asymptotic convergence to the ground state, the mechanism being that you get higher and higher oscillation. So the energy, you know, so the perturbation goes off to infinity in wave number space. So there was more. By ground state, do you mean like thermodynamic spectrum or I mean take the Hamiltonian of the defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger? The defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation and minimize the energy, minimize that Hamiltonian subject to fixed L2 norm. Oh, okay, okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not aware of that study. So there's work of, I know that I believe Zakharov did some work on this. Okay. There was numerical work, and then there was a theoretical paper by Yves Pomeau. Theoretical paper by Yves Pomeau in Physica D. Okay. I'll probably send you an email to ask for a paper. Any other questions? If not, let's thank virtually the speaker with the reactions.
