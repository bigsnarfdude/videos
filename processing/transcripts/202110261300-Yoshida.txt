She is a very prolific researcher who has done a lot of interesting works in algebraic statistics, computational biology, tropical statistics, discrete optimization. She did a PhD at UC Davis back in 2004 with Jesus de Loeira. It's now a professor of the department of Is now a professor at the Department of Operations Research at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. And today she's going to be telling us about tree topologies along a tropical line segment. Rudy, I look forward to your talk, please. Thank you so much for the nice introduction. So yeah, so it's so exciting to be this conference and I really opportunity. Thank you so much. Great opportunity. Thank you so much for having me. So, all right. I hope I can click. Okay, oops. Okay. So, I'm going to talk about the phylogenetic trees. So, phylogenetic tree is a tree representation of evolutions between different species or different taxa and so on. So, this picture, I intentionally chose. I intentionally chose this picture because this data set is a like really motivation for me to do a lot of statistical analysis over the tree space. So, all right, so this data set is actually coming from a paper published in Nature in twenty thirteen. And immediately after that, a biologist like basically generated those sequences. Related sequences like whole genome comparison, comparative analysis between African shirakans and landfish and also tetrapod. So tetrapod, those are living, like land living things. So the biology, this data set is actually really controversial data set in a sense. So biologists like Biologists, like if you remember, if you took like biology one-on-one in high school or somewhere, you learn that our ancestor came from ocean, right? So biologists want to understand how we evolve from ocean, like you know, water living things to land living things. Run the living thing. So that's kind of motivation for this data set. So biologists really want to understand the evolutionary trees between those organisms. So more specifically, question is just. So here you notice that like they are not really separated well. And this is a language fish and this is for the silicon. And so the question is that so this reading done. that so this reading land reading thing stetarapod is it closer to related to langufish or shellacan that's the question so okay um and just like it's controversial because some papers say language is closer to tetrapod and some papers say African shirakans are closer to tetrapod. Are closer to tetraquart. So that's why it's kind of controversial. Okay, so phylogenetic tree reconstruction is a pretty old problem. So like in 1960, about 1960, people, biologists applied phylogenetic theory reconstructing from genetic data. So input is like genetic data, DNA sequences. Data, DNA sequences, RNA sequences, protein sequences, and fat ever. And the outer part is a phylogenetic tool. Okay, so phylogenetic tool, just one more thing, that it has labels on that leaf, but for the internal node, they really don't have labels. Okay. All right. So five victories. There are trees there are like i said it's all the old question right it's all the like a problem to uh reconstruct a phylogenetic tree so there are tons of models tons of method great method to reconstruct good phylogenetic trees from genetic data so this is not my interest i'm interested in more like phylogenetic More like phylogenomics. So, supposedly we have a bunch of sequences, specifically gene sequences from genome, whole genome data set. And from there, we each from each gene sequences, of course, we have alignment and so on, and we reconstruct a tree. And then somehow we vectorize from. Somehow we vectorize from each story. And so the input for my problem is, in a sense, a set of phylogenetic story or set of vector representations of phylogenetic tools. And we want to understand how they are distributed and so on. So we ideally want to do some statistical analysis. Want to do some statistical analysis on a set of phylogenetic tools. Okay. All right. So, here in this talk, I assume a equidistance tree. So, I have a set of equidistant trees. So, what's the equidistance tree? So, that is the rooted of tree, phylogenetic tree. So, the distance. The distance from each leaf to root is the same distance. So, for example, here is a root, little root, and we have leaf, and from root to leaf A, we have distance two, from root to leaf B, that's one plus one, that's a distance two, and so on. So they have all the same distance. So that's what we Distance so that's what we call a equidistance, okay. And how are we gonna vectorize them? All right, so we calculate all pairwise distances, okay? So, this is called this similarity map. So, suppose I have like n leaves, so that's here. This example, we have five leaves, so this similarity map is a like um five. Like five by five metrics, and we decode the all pairwise distances. So, for example, this entry B C coordinate that has two, that is the distance from A from B to C. So we have one plus 0.2 plus 0.8, that's equal to 2. So, I report that. So, you notice that like this matrix is actually Is actually symmetric and diagonals are all zeros. So I take just a triangle part of this matrix and I like classically order them and I just make that vector. And from the previous talk, Roberto said that like yeah, we have some variation between deterogram. Between deterogram, that's the equisistance three and uratural metric. So, actually, this is a urutura metric. So, we have one-to-one correspondence. All right. So, go back to Shinakan's data set. All right, so in this paper in 2013, they had about 1300 epigene trees. 1300 gene trees they reconstructed from each gene sequence. And we have 10 species. And actually, they did quick analysis that just comparing toritopologies. And okay, so they have basically four different toritopologies. And one toritopology, one is this guy tetrapote is closer to Dango Fest, and another toritopology, tetrapote is close to. Heteropot is close to silicon, and another one is silicon, and the languifies are close to each other, and other one is just like they are not resolved. Okay. And about like one quarter each, so the topology, so it was kind of not clear, really fast going on. So that's really motivated. So, you know, 2017, actually, before that, but my colleague and I. For that, but my colleague and I say, oh, we can vectorize. So we vectorize all Tories because this guy, so they didn't really consider the branchidance and so on. So, okay, I gotta just look at like vector eyes or vector representations of trees, and then we just do just apply PCS so I can see how they are distributed. So I did that. So I did that Kuraska PCA. Just so simple-minded. Just so I wanted to see how it's going. And I saw two clearly separated clusters. So that's a blue cluster and red cluster. It's like really hard to see this, but this is three-dimensional plot. We brought this. And I thought, oh, great. This is why it's undesirable. We just don't know, you know, long. Don't know, you know, languifes or silicon, which one is closer to Keterapod because it's all separated. Wait, we found something. I thought that's going to be happy ending and I thought, wait, this shape, I realized that shape looks like kind of three space. So I thought, ah, something off. So, you know, this actually project made me really think that we Really, I think that we have to do light analysis, not the Euclidean space, but actually over the three space, we have to develop something like mimicking TCA-like. Something we have to develop that. So, we started some research. Okay, so all right, so this is Roberto in a previous talk, talk about this. A previous talk talk about this. I just want to quickly say this, like formally say that. All right. So a distance matrix D realize an equidistance three if only if this metric D is a ruthless matrix. That is the maximum of D I J, D J K and D I K. That's actually for distinct leaves IJK. To leave IJK achieve at least twice. So if that satisfies, then it's called rutorometrics, and that's actually if only if condition. So I consider the Tori space as a space of all urutural metrics, like a previous talk, just they focus on. Okay, and also there's some theorem. And also, there are some foreign fair and star fairs. And also, we also kind of reproved that because just we wanted to make sure. The space of ruthless matrix with n leaves is a tropical linear space, i.e., the solution set of the tropicalization of linear equations. Okay, so the principle. The three space is actually a union of not intersection. If intersection was nice, but it's not. That's the union of polyhedral cones, actually. And in an intuitive picture, it looks like this. So suppose, you know, this is the origin is here, and we are these are coming out to this projector, and so. vector and so that's kind of you imagine. So this is as equal to 4 and this line, so you see this line, that's a two-dimensional face of the polyhedral cone. And this actually that the vertices looks like, that's the length of the cone. So that's a two-dimensional polyhedral cone. And for n equal to four, that is the union of 15. Of 15 two-dimensional polyhedral cones. So that's the preface. So remember, go back to a little about this picture. That's a kind of I saw that. I saw that looks like kind of, it's kind of harder to see this, but I kind of see that rotated. And so it looks like kind of this. I saw that. So all the points are kind of here, and another points are here. And, you know, And you know, classical PCA says, oh, they are kind of very separated because they are in a like you know, big gap here. But actually, it for me, it looks like kind of more like three space, that's a union of polyhedral cones. So I thought, ah, that's kind of bad. Probably it looks like this because just a shape of the tree space. Okay. All right. So. All right, so and then immediately after this, we use that, that's called Borera-Holmes-Bogman metric. So this is a very well-loved metric over three space. It's, you know, there is a quick really nice algorithm to calculate the VHB geodesic over the torrent. And actually, I the Actually, the Tory space, BHV Tory space, is very nice because each cone has something like we know the Tory space, a Tory topology. For each like, you know, how like they are grouped together, we know exactly, you know, tortoology looks like. And this is actually, we wrote a paper and it's published in Biometrica, but we developed Metorica, but we develop PCA-like you know objects, so that's called low cast of weighted freshetomin. So that's we develop that. Okay, that's great. We have there something like interpretable out of birth. That's nice. However, it looks like if you look at this picture, you see this like all the points are kind of gathered here, and it's not really well distributed. Really well distributed, and after we applied for so many different data sets, and it always looks like this. I don't know why it looks like that. And also that initially with Tom, Tom and I and I started thinking that ah, we can use probably convex hole with under the VHD metrics. We can use the convex hole for Complex hold for like you know, uh, representing like you know, we can do this PCA like analysis. That's what we only generally saw. But the work with Bernard Stanfords and Chelsea and the ball, we can show that the convex hole orb under the BHB metal has unbounded dimensions. So, even just a little triangle that's a convex hole of three. That's a convex hole of three points can have the infinitely like basically unbounded dimension. It can go, dimension goes like crazy. So that's kind of why we gave up. Convex hole doesn't work with VHV metrics. But if we use the tropical method, yes, we can actually like behavior of the convex hole. You know, convex hole under the tropical metric, it's really nice, i.e., that it's similar to Euclidean metric. Okay, so that's what we did. So, this is just can I ask just for clarity in the previous slide, how should I think about the piece or the vertices of this triangle? Yeah, so that's actually that's the like this triangle. This is actually. This triangle, this is actually, you can kind of, in a sense, think that just the vertices of the not triangle, but kind of similar to triangle. But in a sense, this is actually weight equal to 0, 0, 1 for some particular point. That's a fresh etomine. So that's actually the locus of freshetomy is basically that's a set of. Is basically just a set of all possible weight for the like the freshetomine of three points. Yeah, but but what is it that we're taking the freshette mean with respect that is being plotted here? What is being shown here? Okay, so those of Okay, so those okay, so those that are data point, that's a three. And this is a lower dimensional object. We wanted to use the triangle initially with VHB metric, but we couldn't do this because the dimensional issue. So we use the locust of weighted freshetom, and that's we use, and we just basically. We use, and we just basically this is a projected point onto the object. So, black dots are projections of each observation. So, and these colors are tory topology. So, because this is over the toilet space, we know exactly that the BHD Tory space. We know exactly what kind of toll topology looks like in this. Tory topology looks like in this area. I know this area, I know this area. And those are projected basically observations onto some lower dimensional object. Thanks. Yeah, so this is basically in a sense best of locust of fresh etomine over the tourist base. That's kind of, but like I said, we wanted to use that convex hull. We wanted to have the best of convex hull for observations, just so that we can visualize that. Okay, so this is a tropical PCS. So that's the tropical triangle, and this is the best tropical triangle for. Tropical torrential angle for this data set. So we have 1,290 observations, and each pointer basically vectorized phylogenetic trees from each gene. And basically, we try to actually find the best tropical triangle so that the sun. So, the sum of the distance between observation and projection onto the triangle is minimized. That's how we got it. Okay? And here, this case, we just replace that BHB metrics and instead of convex hold, we use the low cost of weighted cracetomin. Cracetamine. So this one is actually nicer in a sense that it's split a little bit and also this is a tropical triangle. It's kind of more intuitive instead of weighted fresh set of mean. Weighted freshetomy, we prove that in this paper that dimension this paper that dimension is a for this case dimension is at the most two dimensions we can prove that but for the convex hole we couldn't like we don't have nice property like that so we couldn't use that so here that's the best tropical triangle but you notice that i don't have color in a triangle but i color that all But I color that all projected observations. So the reason is that from this picture, I don't know. For example, this part of the triangle, I don't know what the tortopology looks like. I don't know here what the toritopology looks like. So we had to color the projected point. Projected point. So we just look at this. And also we notice that each cell, so we have the each cell, they have the same, that, all that in each cell are same color. I thought, oh, that's really interesting. And we, in this paper, we prove that actually, yes, if you pick two, any two points in a cell. In a cell, so it's cell like this, cell like this, they have to have the same toritophology. Of course, it might have some branches, zero branching, but yeah, they have the same toritoprology. Okay, so that was the beginning. So this VHD metric has really nice interpretation in terms of In terms of total topology, but not for tolerable metrics. So, this is my motivation. I want to understand, like I said, and Roberto in the last talk, he said that there is one-to-one correspondence between urutorometric and tree. So, I want to understand that suppose I have tropical geodesic. Geodesic, I will define what it is. I have the tropical geodesic. Along that, I want to see how topology changes over the tropical geodesic. That one was really my motivation. Because the reason why I want to do is again, I want to understand the output from, for example, PCA or some statistical. Or some statistical analysis. We want to understand not in terms of uranometrics, but we want to understand in terms of phylogenetic treaties. Okay, so that's my motivation. So let's define the basics, the local basics. So we are operating under the Max Plus algebra. So here is a Max Plus algebra. So here is a max plus algebra. So suppose we have A and B is a real number. And we take max as an addition and plus as a multiplication. And also the tollropical matrix. So that is, suppose we have two vectors, V and W, and toropical distance between two vectors are max of difference. Max of difference between two vectors minus minimum of difference between two vectors. And this function, so this toropical distance is a well-defined metric over the toropical projective torus. Okay, and I'll show you some examples. All right, so suppose I have All right, so suppose I have like uh vector v, that's a zero zero zero, and w zero one two. You notice I got a lazy, so I picked just zero one two. And then the distance between those two vectors is the max of the difference V minus W minus mean of V minus W. So that's a max in terms of coordinate wise and mean in terms of And mean in terms of coordinate wise, so that's equal to two. Great. And if I don't take that like some vector 111111, then it's not really metric because suppose we have two vectors, V and W, that's a 000 and 333. They are not the same vector, but if you take the difference, the distance equals zero. So in order to make it that So in order to make it that like metric, we have to model by basically wow wow wow wow wow so that's equal to basically any vector x that's equal to x plus c x one plus c x two plus c and so on okay so she is a constant so that's that basically that's the total projective to us that we were working on okay all right so All right, so I don't know about time. All right, so toropical convex is a. So suppose we have two toropically convex set. That is that, so subset S, we have that, and we take two vectors from S, and then we take that like topical linear combinations of this guy and this guy. So A and B is a real number, and we are. B is a real number, any real number. If this guy is inside of the S, then basically we say that S is a toropically convex set. And a toropical polytope is a toropical convex set generated by the finitely many subsets. Okay. All right. And the topical line segment. So this is So, this is I define as a tropical geodesic. So, please note that tropical geodesic, actually there are infinitely many tropical geodesics. It's not unique. That's the negative side about this metric. However, if I focus on tropical line segments, this is a actually that's really nice that in That's really nice that intrinsic that tropical line segment, if two points are ruthless, then that tropical line segments are all points in a tropical line segment are in a case of ruthless metrics and also that's the geodesic. So, this is I actually focus on. Okay. Focused on. Okay. And also, this is also unique. That's another thing. In general, tropical geodesics are not unique, but for the tropical line segment between two points, that's a two rotor metrics, that's intrinsic and unique. So that's really nice. This is why I focus on. And tropical line segment is a tropical polytope of. Polytop are generated by two points. So that's that sort of current line thing. All right, so let's show you examples. So this is for over the tropical projective space, our total story. Okay, so that's the three points. So that's the later point. That's the tropical polytope. Of course, that's inside, the whole inside point. Those are tropical polytopes. Tropical polytope. And of course, you saw this example first. This is a tropical triangle, so this is also tropical polytope. Okay. All right. And also that if I take 000 and 025, and this line is like line segment, that's a tolerable line segment between. Tropical line segment between V1 and V3. Just for example. Okay, so this is a tropical projected torus. So now, just to focus on urotorametrix, case of urinarometrics. So suppose like here we have n equal to 4. We have a number of leaves that equal to 4. And so the dimension is actually 6. And it's kind of six-dimensional stuff. It's kind of six-dimensional stuff, it's kind of harder to fix, right? No, I think it's more than that, like that's a four-tube. I cannot calculate, so whatever, but it's kind of high dimension and it's kind of harder to see it. But so I represent it as a like BHD coordinate, so that's not the matrix but the coordinate. Okay, that's just represented by that like BHD coordinate, and that's you can. BHB coordinate and that you can represent by the two dimensions. And so here is that T2. So T2 is here, T1 is here, and this is a toropical line segment. Okay? So that's an example. All right, so phased theorem. So this is actually kind of important, especially compared to DHD tourist space. Tory space. So suppose I pick two random equidistant tories or urmatrix, then we draw a tropical line segment between them. And actually, the tropical line segment between two random urtural metrics contains origin that are 00000 with the probability. 0, 0 with the probability zero. Okay? Of course, for n equal greater than or equal to five. So otherwise, it's too small. But that's really nice. The reason why it's nice is that for, as I said before, BATD metric, that's a well-known, well-lubbed, nice metric. If you calculate the geodesic, it's really nice metric because the geodesic under the BACD. Geodesic under the BHD metric, actually it's unique and it's intrinsic. So that's very nice. However, one of the negative side is that the geodesic between any random trees, the geodesic, the probability that geodesic contains the origin, that's a zero, zero, zero, it's not zero. It's not zero, so it's actually a positive number. So, probability is positive, actually, sorry to be positive. So, that's not good because that also might cause like some kind of stickiness for the fresh etomine and so on. So, it's kind of interesting: thing is the tropical metric and the VHG metric that kind of seems like complement to each other. So, that's kind of interesting. But, I really like this. But I really like this theorem because of that. All right, so proof is basically: I use the result from my previous publication. Since we don't have time, I hope, I think, yeah, I have 10 minutes. All right, so another thing we prove is that, okay, so something about crate. So, crate is a substory. Grade is a substory. So suppose we have the, that's actually, I stole these pictures from Wikipedia. So I didn't make this. But so suppose we have a, you know, rooted equidistance tree and we take some internal branch just to chop off. Then we have the like the rotor, the just like internal, we just chop off, for example, chop off this branch. Example, chop off this branch, then the tree below that, that's called crade. And also, clades are also equidistant tree as well. And blue part, I chop off this internal branch and then the below the sub tree, below that, that's a crate. But here, green part, this is not a crate because I chop off this guy, but you know, this is not a part of. You know, this is not a part of that green subtle, so this green part of the subtlety does not play. Okay, so that's a definition of the grade. All right, so another the kind of we understood. So suppose we have two equidistant trees with like n leaves, then actually some actually subtle between um for all that. For of that, T1 and T2, species are clade for T1 and crayed for T2. They have the same tree topology. Then the geotropical line segment between those two tree, the part of the crate wouldn't change. Tree topology in a shared crate part that actually stays the same. Actually, it stays a set. Actually, it's just really, really long lines. It's just a copy and a paste from our paper. So, but I'm going to give you an example. So, suppose we have five leaves and you notice that this part, S1, S2, S3, this part, and this is a T1, and T2 is this guy, so S1, S2, S3. They have the different branch lengths, but this part. Lengths, but this part and this part they have the same toritopology. S1s2S3, SYS2, S3, that's the same toritopology. And those are tropical line segments, so that's going to be the same toritopology and it changes to this guy. So basically, this branch is getting smaller, smaller, smaller, and becomes like undissolved. And then this part moves, moves, moves, and comes. Moves, moves, moves, and coming here, and this is gonna be there. So that's the toropical line segment. That's the three topologies on the torophical line segment between T1 and T2. And you notice that this sub-tory of our grade of leaves S1, S2, S3, so this part and this part and this part and this part. Earth and this earth, it doesn't change. Okay, so that's the first, like the second theorem. I want you to prove like general, but I just couldn't do this. So I kind of think that I'm going to talk about conjecture, but all right, so nearly to neighbor interchange. Nearly to neighbor interchange is the three topology, basically changing three topologies. Tory topologies by some three moves. So that is the basically. So suppose I have those triangles are basically crayed. So we have T3, T1, T2. And suppose I have this toy topology originally, I can switch to basically this totally topology or this toy topology. So we have the same grade, but changing to this part becomes. This perk becomes this guy, or this perk becomes this guy. Yeah. Oops. Oh, I think typhoid. Okay. Sorry, this guy and this guy is the same for epology. I just realized that. Yeah, I'm so sorry. That's up to Typhoon. Sorry, that's AC typo. So, okay, I'm gonna change that. So, yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry. So, yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry. That should be. I wanted to have the same sorry topology. So, T1 and T2 are, no, T2 and T3 should be together. So, this is going to be T2, I'm sorry. And this is going to be the T3. Sorry, sorry, sorry. So, yeah, just type of. This is a horrible type. I'm sorry. So, yeah, anyway, so that's the whole. So, yeah, anyway. So, that's the code nielesto never interchange. Okay, so if another theorem is that, suppose I have like two tourists and feces differ by only one nearest neighbor interchangeable. Then, all three topologies along the autoptical line segment between T1 and T2, they have the They have that only topology of T1 or toly topologies of T2, of course, with possible like zero branching. And the conjecture, I wanted, I thought I proved this, but I couldn't prove this. Actually, I proved, I have still gap and I couldn't prove that. But that conjecture is that, so suppose we have any torn topology T1 and any torn topology T2. Torrentopology T2 and basically the Tory topologies between actually Tory topology, topical geodesic between two tories, T1 and T2, they are different sequences of the NNI move from T1 to T2. So that's I really thought. I thought I proved this. I couldn't. I couldn't. Yeah, it was really tricky, just like basically the intersection of the cone, polyhedral cone, gets really, really tricky. And I just couldn't prove this. So I only proved some past, like special cases. And also in a paper, we talked about more different scenarios. For example, like one totally topology. Like one toy topology is actually zero, that's basically representing as a statory. So, suppose one to the topology is statory, I know exactly how to retopology changes and so on, but I just couldn't prove that in general. So, this is still a conjecture, a big open problem. All right, so I have a few minutes, I think. Two minutes. Adobe ties. To meet advertisements. We have three open positions at the NPS, our department of operational research, especially for the data scientists. We really, really, really need data scientists because we have great students. I love our students. They are so brilliant, but just like, you know, no. Just like, you know, not enough people can actually take care of them. I have currently right now. Seriously, I think I have 13 students right now. I'm just overwhelmed right now. Yeah, it's just, and I kept declining the students and I feel so bad. So it's really, they're really great students. They're so enthusiastic about data science. About data science. So, if you are interested in and just go to this website and if you want have questions or send, you know, you want to apply applications, send to this email. All right. Thank you so much for your attention. Thank you very much, Rico. Very nice talk. All right, so we have some space for questions, for some discussion. Questions for some discussion. So, go ahead. Can I ask a question? So I was going to. Hi, Ronico. Good to see you. Thanks for the talk. So my main question is about this last conjecture you have. So you have these operations, I mean, these moves, N and I moves, I guess. I guess so is there a is there a notion there of how many steps do you need to go from one uh yeah so but then yeah so like it's not unique usually so but you can talk about the shortest paths no yes yes you can do the shortest path but following the shortest path in terms of an ni move that i think it would be hard okay yeah so it's not always Okay. Yeah, so it's not obvious, obvious. So, yeah, as far as I know, that's that someone proved the energy heart. I think that's like 10 years ago or something. I mean, I guess it's a more general question on tropical geometry. So, I mean, if I understand this is some kind of diameter on a tropical polyhedron, no? And I mean, you know, in usual polyhedra, you have notions of diameter of the ground. That you have notions of diameter of the graph, and people have studied that. Is there some kind of bound? I mean, like, uh, I would say that's a good question. I haven't paid attention. I don't know. Like this is a question. This is a great question. Yeah, yeah, I know. That's actually great question. I don't know. I haven't really paid attention, and I think that would be excellent. I am not sure. I am not sure. Go ahead. Yeah, I mean, I guess there are other notions probably for phylogenetic trees of distance. I mean, I know, I mean, one natural distance notion that one has on phylogenetic trees, I guess, has to do with the, I mean, in binary trees, there's a distance, right? There's like rotation distance, they call it. And there, we recently have results on, I mean, famous results on the diameter of that. When you have, I guess, n leaves. I guess n leaves. I mean, there's some linear distance between any leaves. And I mean, this is related to again the Hirsch conjecture on associahedra. So this is very. But I think that's a different metric. I think that's a different metric or a different notion of adjacency than the one that you have here. Yes, yes, exactly. And also, that's a pretty key part is that that idea wants to understand that. Want to understand the tricky part is that it's so not obvious. So, we do this any operation, you know, applying the tropical geometry to like urutora metrics, but the urutal metrics are kind of vector, right? And just like all operations we apply to onto urtural metrics. They don't think as a tweet. So, in terms of three topology, still it's not really clear. Still, it's not really clear. It shouldn't be one-to-one correspondence, but I'm not sure that, like, yeah, I'm still not sure. Thank you. Yeah, that's kind of why. Yeah, that's why I wanted to understand. Great question. I'm going to actually look into that. This is awesome. Thank you. I love Jesus is here. We all are very happy to have. We all are very happy to have Jesus here. I know. That's really great. Actually, yeah, so yeah, actually, I had a question also about that, but I may follow up maybe more later on. But I had two other questions. So one is you move pretty directly to the discussion of the ultrametrics and equidistance trees. But one part that I probably missed is how did you? Probably missed this. How did you actually go from your sequences of letters to those trees? Yeah. And the other question is: just going back to the triangle, I am, I shouldn't be a bit puzzled. Why is the, you know, the boundaries between the topologies, why are they curvy? Why wouldn't we expect this to be linear? Oh, actually, so you are saying that. So, you are saying that boundary between different colors here? Right, right, right, right. So, basically, what happens is that I'm going to show you. This is actually same way polytopology changes over the BHB, basically. So, basically, in the boundary between polyhedral cones, that is not a binary toy. So, it's like unresolved to. Und dissolved toy. So you notice that here, so this is this part moved to here. That's actually it's not anymore binary toy, right? That's the intersection between two polyhedral cones. Yeah, but so, but in your triangle, the boundaries between the colors, are these polyhedral? Are these kind of linear pieces? That's that. That's that's a these polyhedral colour. That that's that's a this polyto color is that's a polyhedral, yeah. Okay, that's a sector. That's that, yes, intersection. Got it, so yeah, that makes sense. Because I mean, initially, I thought that these were kind of curves and I was a bit puzzled by that. And the other question? Yeah, what? Yeah, thanks. No, the other question was, how did you actually go from your sequences of letters to these to the trees? To the trees. Okay. So that's, I think, like Elizabeth, like tomorrow might a tiny bit talk about that. But so this part is that like basically phylogenetic reconstruction. So we can model. So very famous, like the most popular way is a maximum likelihood estimator. So that basically is like, you know. Like, you know, they can model as a continuous time Markov chain model with finite states, for example, DNA. So that means in order to obtain every one of those black dots, you first have to do a tree reconstruction process procedure. Yes, yes, that's right. So now, here, I assume that all the trees are perfectly inferred. So I haven't really think about that's also another thing I would like to do this. Maybe just, you know, I haven't really incorporated estimation error from this part at all. So I haven't done that. So I'm after each that is basically estimated for it from DNA sequences or protein sequences. Or protein sequence. Actually, this case is protein sequence. Okay, that clarifies that. Yeah, I mean, I have a naive question. I don't know much about this, but it seems to me that not all phylogenetic come from, let's say, intersections of sequences, of DNA sequences. Is that right? I mean, that must be true. That must be true, no? Yeah, so what so you mean that all phylogenetic stories, you know, they can, you know, they might not come from sequences, like you were saying, morphologies or yes. Yeah, I mean, yes, it can be, but uh, like I'm kind of skipping this, but also. But also, just actually his senses question kind of makes me little bit think about it. Many cases, actually, this is a real problem. So here I assume that I have n species for this sequence. I have n species for this sequence. I have n species for this sequence, and so on. But in real life, it might not be. We might have a few. Might have a few species are missing because some species don't have some particular function, right? And so, like some of this gene, maybe some species are missing. Maybe this sequence, some species are missing. So, this is actually kind of harder to do because here again, another simplification is that all trees I have to have n sleeves. And leave. Okay, so just I wrote another paper for how to impute, like basically infer the missing information, like missing leaves. I actually wrote a paper on that, but also that's a little bit harder. So that's also another challenge as well, too. So like I said, I'm assuming here is that just this step, there are tons of problems like estimation error, for example, Information error, for example, that Guido was talking about, and Jesus was talking about the missing information. That's also true. Yeah, I have, but I assume this talk, I simplify. But in a Giaruda, yes, you have to infer that from sequence with missing possible missing information, you have to deconstruct the proof.
