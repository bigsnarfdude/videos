Our second speaker today is Ellen Thomas from the University of Warwick, and he's going to talk about the classification of extremely primitive groups. Yeah, thank you, Jonathan, and thanks to all the organizers for inviting me. It's really nice to be in Banff, looking out at the rain in Birmingham. So, yeah, so I'm going to talk about this classification of extremely primitive groups. And when I gave the talk, When I gave the talk, I've given the talk a couple of times, and in the previous two times, I guess I was kind of lying that there was actually a classification. But thanks to some recent work of Vanessa, Tim Baness and Melissa Lee, which we'll get to, I'm not lying this time. It generally is a classification. Okay, so what are we going to do in the talk? Well, I'm going to say I'm going to discuss some recent work with Tim on completing this classification. Oh, I didn't update that part. Oh, I didn't update that part. They've both been published since I last gave the talk, but you can find them on the archive. So we'll start very, very briefly with permutation groups. Then I'll give the definition of an extremely primitive group. We'll talk about reduction and the actual classification. There's two parts to it. And then we'll get to exceptional groups. Wouldn't be a talk by me if there weren't some exceptional groups in it. Exceptional groups in it, and then the kind of part I want to give some detail in is some tools in the proof, some various bits, and we'll get to that in due course. So I'm sure everyone is aware of what a permutation group is, but just to be quick, I'll remind everyone why we won't ever see a permutation in this talk. So we have a transitive permutation group, then it's just equivalent to me giving you a maximal sub. To me giving you a maximal subgroup of a group G. And we're only going to care about transitive actions, so that's all we're going to see in this talk. So, but let me do, let me actually remind you about primitivity and two transitivity and two primitivity. So let's fix G, our transitive permutation group of degree N, let's say. So we have some maps. So we have some subgroup H. Sorry, if I said Sorry, if I said maximal before, I was getting ahead of myself. So we have some subgroup H of G, and G is acting on the set of left cosets, which we'll call omega. And we say that G is primitive if H is a maximal subgroup of G. Okay, that's maybe not the first definition you see, but in the talk today, we're going to be talking about subgroup structure. And so this is the definition we want to think about. It's too transitive. Well, again, there's a nice definition that one might think of. I'll give you the group. One might think of. I'll give you the group theoretic one, anyways. That h intersect, a conjugate of h has index n minus one as a subgroup of h. And then we can go further, we can go to two primitivity. And that says that our subgroup H should act primitively on, well, it can't act primitively on g mod H because it fixes this point, the left coset H, but it acts primitively on everything else. Everything else. So g mod H without H itself. And as we know, K primitivity, K transitivity, etc. And we know lots about these groups. If you use the classification of finite simple groups, then the royal we can classify the two transitive groups and even the three halves transitive groups, or whatever they may be. Not going to show up today. Show up today. Okay, so what's extreme primitivity? You might think it's kind of a version of primitivity which incorporates all of these k primitivities, but it's not. It lives somewhere between primitive and too primitive. So here's the definition. So let's take a primitive permutation group and we'll enforce that it has a non-trivial point stabilizer H, if we want to remove regular things. Then we say that g is extremely primitive, or EP for short, if H acts primitively on each of its orbits in omega without this point X. So for being too primitive, H had to act primitively on this set itself. But now it's allowed to have as many orbits as it likes, as long as it acts primitively on each of those orbits. So that's what we're asking for. So in particular, For. So, in particular, if our group is too primitive, then it's certainly extremely primitive. And because I'm interested in subgroup structure, and that's what will be in the talk, we want to give an equivalent definition. And the equivalent definition, which is quite nice on its own, is that H intersect any conjugate of H should be a maximal subgroup of H. So it sounds like quite a strong condition. Sounds like quite a strong condition, although, as we've just seen, two primitivity implies extremely primitive. So, there are examples out there of these things. And so, let's see some examples. Well, of course, Sn and A n in their natural permutation actions, as long as we make n just about big enough, will be fine to get a two primitive action and therefore an extremely primitive one. And indeed, as I pointed out, any two primitive group gives. Too primitive group gives us one of these. So, how about an example of an extremely primitive group which isn't too primitive? Well, if we take the second Conway group and look at its maximal subgroup H, the McClaughlin group, then H actually has six orbits on G mod H, and the five non-trivial ones have point stabilizers U43, N22, etc. And all five of those. Two, et cetera. And all five of those, if you're up with your sporadic group knowledge, you'll know are maximal subgroups of H. And thus, we do indeed have H and so H to the G is always a maximal subgroup or the equivalent definition that H is going to act primitively on each of its other five orbits. And in fact, as the title of the talk suggests, we'll see all of them shortly. Shortly. Okay, so that's the definition. And for the rest of the talk, it's this one that I guess we want to take away. So we've got some primitive permutation group G, so we've got some maximal subgroup H of G, and we're asking whether or not H in set H to the G is always a maximal subgroup of H for every element G and G. Okay, so there was already work on this before. Before Tim and I worked on it recently. So, one of the first papers by Mann, Pragman, and Serish in 2007. And they showed some nice first results about if your group G, and in particular your maximal subgroup H, has any one of these properties. So, if it's got some non-trivial center, if its fitting subgroup is not elementary abelian, and Subgroup is not elementary abelian and slightly weaker statements as well, then your group is not extremely primitive. So these are, you know, unfortunately, if you look at your action and one of these things is true about your maximum subh, your point stabilizer, then you're not going to get something that's extremely primitive. And I'm not going to go too much into it, but the proof is essentially the Onan-Scott theorem plus this nice theorem. This nice theorem due to Manning in the 20s, where he was actually thinking about extremely primitive groups. He didn't coin the phrase. And he showed that if you have this property, then H actually has to act faithfully on each of its orbits. And that's important with the Onan-Scott theorem to be able to show that any of these things rule you out from being extremely primitive. Okay, so. Okay, so from that first result, they were able to prove a reduction theorem. So I claim the spot theorem breaks up primitive permutation groups into eight families. I think eight is up for debate, depending on your favourite way to write down the Jonan-Spotted theorem. But anyway, for today, we'll need just two of them. And I think those two are not up for debate. So the first family of So, the first family of primitive groups that we'll need are the almost simple ones. Let me remind you: that means that there's some non-abelian simple group G0 such that G lives somewhere between G0 and its automorphism group. And then, of course, we're still thinking of omega just being G mod H for some maximal subgroup H. So, those are the almost simple ones. And the other family we need are the affine ones. So, on this occasion, omega has the structure of a Omega has the structure of a vector space over some prime field FP, and G acts by affine transformations. So it sits inside AGL DP for some D. Okay, and why do we only need those two for today's talk? Well, the reduction theorem indeed says that if you have a primitive, if you have an extremely primitive group G, we know that means you have to be a primary primary primary We know that means you have to be primitive, that was part of the definition. Then G has to be in one of these two families. It's either affine or it's almost simple. So those are the two things we need to look at for the rest of the talk. And let's do the affine case first, because that was something that was mainly done in this paper from 2007 and recently. And recently finished off by Tim and Melissa. So, if G is one of these affine, extremely primitive groups, so there's the setup again, reminding you of what it means to be affine, then there's a relatively short list. And I won't go through reading them out one by one, but there's some interesting cases and lots of them when the prime is two, but not always. When the prime is two, but not always. Here you need some primitive prime divisor, r of p to the d minus one. And h is what I'm telling you in this table. And then there's some interesting examples with h being these sporadic groups, some sporadic groups, some alternating, etc. Okay, so the theorem says you're an affine, extremely primitive group, then A. Uh then A B C A that's how to get back. Good. Okay, so it says that A, B, C, and D, actually every group in there is extremely primitive. Okay, so that's good. And then there's this little bucket at the bottom, it's E, which says P is 2, H is almost simple, and G is simply primitive. And G is simply primitive. Okay. And there it's not clear that it's a catch-all to say, well, we've classified everything in this affine case, apart from there might be some examples here that we don't know about. And the conjecture that they made in the paper was that there aren't any further affine extremely primitive groups. And they didn't just leave it. And they didn't just leave it at that. They were able to show that that's true, subject to Wall's conjecture for almost simple groups. So, one that we, I believe, still believe in, rather than the more general version. And secondly, removing a finite number of exceptions. So I'll just mention that one of the two archive papers was getting rid of everything in part two. Was getting rid of everything in part two. So if we assume Wool's conjecture, then the conjecture holds. There aren't any other further affine extremely primitive groups. So E, this kind of catch-all bin, was actually empty. And half of those cases involved exceptional groups. And because we're in this affine case, we have some almost simple group H acting on some module for H. Module for H. And so the exceptional ones had the supples with the minimal and adjoint modules. And because we just need to know that H intercept H to the G is not a maximal subgroup of H for some G, then it just sufficed to check that there is a vector with a stabilizer not being a maximal subgroup. And it's actually incredibly hard to get HV to be a maximal subgroup. And we understand those stabilizers. I should have had one more pause. Okay, so. Had one more port. Okay, so we could remove part two, and then further, rather recently, this result that I mentioned of Timberless and Melissa Lee showed that actually there aren't any further affine extremely primitive groups without having this caveat about Wall's conjecture. And so the way they did that was to go back a bit in the method and use. Back a bit in the method and use work of Jonna Fossett and other people, and of Melissa in her PhD thesis and recent results on the existence of regular orbits. So up here, I was talking about a vector whose point stabilizer was not a maximal subgroup. Well, regular orbits are much, much stronger and have the property that the point stabilizer, the stabilizer of that vector is trivial. And using work on that, they were able. And using work on that, they were able to find another path to avoid this assumption that Wool's conjecture holds. So, yeah, fine case is done. So, let's move on to the almost simple case. So, here the classification is complete, just like it is in the previous case now. This time I give the talk. So, in 2012, a paper of the 2012, paper of Vanessa Prager and Serish did the case. So we're now in the, so now G is an almost simple group. And so there are these, you'd probably break it up into what your software of your almost simple group is. And so they did it when it was classical, and that'll appear on the next slide. I'll give them all together. Then if it was alternating or sporadic, Autographic. I think I have the wrong reference, but apologies. I'm not going to read it all line by line or anything, but so the rank, if it's two, then that's telling you that actually it was a two primitive action. But so I guess the more interesting ones are perhaps when it's larger than two. So it wasn't a too primitive group, but it was still extremely primitive. So here's this nice six in the second Collin group. My group. And you look down and you see some classical groups, and you see some alternating groups, and then some spreads. And then just down here, oh, need to stop doing that. There's one group whose soccer was an exceptional group. It wasn't a very big exceptional group. It's G2 of 4. And its subgroup is G2. This alpha is just telling you what's on top of your almost simple, on top of your supple in your almost simple group. Of your supplement in your almost simple group, but we won't go through all of the exact conditions. But so, sort of sadly, in doing the classification in the exceptional case, the entire game was to always find an element g such that h intersect h to the g was not a maximal subgroup of h for h, ranging over all the possible maximal subgroups of the almost simple groups whose support was an exceptional. Okay. So, what time are we at? Okay, almost halfway. So, with that in mind, what I want to talk about for the rest of today is, well, first of all, just briefly going over some things about the subgroup structure of exceptional groups and what was important, what was more tricky in proving, well, in doing the classification, which as we've now In doing the classification, which, as we've now seen, was essentially showing that unless you're in this G204 case, you can't find an extremely primitive action. And then I'll move on in section four to showing some tools of how to do that in some cases. So yeah, we're going to concentrate on G in almost simple finite group with subtle G0 for exceptional finite group beta. And just to make things easier, we'll not worry. Just to make things easier, we'll not worry about things on top of our soccle. We'll just look at G actually being the simple group. And yeah, there are lots of ways to define these, and I won't do any of them properly. But for today, the easiest way to think about them is as essentially the set of fixed points of an exceptional algebraic group. And of course, then, if it's not something you're familiar with, you'll say, well, how do you define those? And I'm certainly not going to do that today. Do that today. But the thing to keep in mind is that one way to think of GLNQ is as the fixed points of the standard Frobenius morphism, the map which raises every entry in a matrix to its Qth power. Then if you take the fixed points of that Frobenius morphism, that standard Frobenius morphism, you get GLNQ when you do it to GLN FQ plum, over the algebraic closure of FQ. Algebraic closure of FQ. And so you can do that analogously with E8 and with G2. And so there are five exceptional groups. And the closest I'll get to saying anything about their construction is there are these Dinkin diagrams, which are enough to describe almost everything about them. But what I want to focus on today is how understanding Want to focus on today is how understanding the subgroup structure of these algebraic groups, and we know they're algebraic because I haven't written in brackets some Q, that's going to be the notation for today. How does that feed into the finite group of Li-type? And how do we use that in one of the tools at least at the end to rule out these actions as being extremely primitive? So, to do that, we need to see how we understand. Need to see how we understand the maximal subgroups first. So we always have our action is we fix some G, and then we want to look over all the possible actions. So we need to look at all of the possible maximal subgroups of these exceptional finite groups of V-type. And there's a very nice result due to Lee Beck and Sites, which says something about the finite groups of V-type, maximal subgroups based on the ones up in the algebraic group block. Uh, up in the algebraic group button. So I've tried to be not too technical, but we'll skip through some of the parts. So what does part one say? It says, well, if you we're talking about maximal subgroups of the finite group of e-type, and we're asking where do they come from in terms of the algebraic group, if they come from somewhere. And part one says there's a nice way that they can come from a nice That they can come from a nice maximal subgroup, give or take, of G, of G bar, my algebraic group, and that comes down to a maximal subgroup G. Part two is sort of similar. We're not going to focus on that one today too much. Part three is a relatively short list. They're nice, maximal subgroups, but not something we're going to worry about too much today. Part four is an even shorter list of subgroups. And then there's part five. there's part five which again is a bit like part e in in the in the affine case it's this sort of um bin that we have to have at the bottom but this time the bin is certainly not empty it's just it doesn't fit necessarily into being the fixed points of some algebraic subgroup coming down into the finite group of e-type um so in some and in some instances i guess it's fair to say these are the hardest maximal subgroups to understand Understand. And that's why the ones in one to four are determined up to G conjugacy, give or take. So David Craven will talk about this on Friday, that, okay, maybe there's a few times where it's a little bit difficult to know exactly what's maximal in the simple group versus the diagonal version, but for today's talk, that's not a problem. That's another problem. So, as I say, we're going to split these up informally. So, part one are algebraic subgroups. So, a subgroup of the finite group of V-type, which comes nicely from the algebraic group. And so, this might be nice if we understand something up in the algebraic world. Things tend to be slightly nicer. There's no, I don't know, I find it nicer. There's less things which get complicated depending on whether your queue is one mod four or three mod. Q is one mod four or three mod four, and so maybe we can see things a little clearer up there. The second ones were also algebraic, but we'll skip them today. Three and four were straightforward for this problem. They might not be in general, but they were for this extreme primitivity. I'll mention briefly why they were straightforward for us on that. And part five, you can kind of see them as small subgroups, and they're not yet completely classified for all exceptional G. Completely classified for all exceptional G. Again, David Craven will be talking more about this on tomorrow, Friday is tomorrow. And so, what I want to do is talk a little bit more about one and five. So, part one said we take a maximal connected subgroup of our algebraic group and we can sort of bring them down to the finite groups of metal. So, they've all been classified in all characteristics, and it was finished in 2004. In 2004. So they come in three flavors. So there's flavors upon flavors here. So this is talking about maximal connected subgroups of our exceptional algebraic groups. So we're up in the algebraic world. So there's parabolic subgroups, and they're nice. They come from the Dinkin diagram essentially that I showed you already. You can cross out some nodes and get parabolic subgroups. And the maximal ones correspond to crossing out one node. For the purposes of today, just think that they're quite. For the purposes of today, just think that they're quite nice. There's then the maximal rank ones, and they're also nice. You draw the Dinking diagram with one extra node, the extended Dinking diagram, and again, cross out some nodes, and you get something that looks what you get from the Dinking diagram. So, again, they're quite nice. And then there's the rest, which again is a sort of, well, other things can happen other than that. And the reason I just put this red dagger here. But this red dagger here was just to advertise that in some recent work that David Craven's been doing on the maximal subgroups of the finite groups of E-type, he found an extra maximal subgroup in E8 in characteristic 3. So this isn't in the paper that Tim and I wrote. It's still not extremely primitive, but it's something just wanted to briefly mention. And there's a recent paper of David. Paper of David Stewart, myself, and David Craven, where we give some details about this subgroup. Like, actually, give essentially a presentation of it and give the generators and talk about the classes inside it and the classes inside its Lie algebra, just in case people need that information going forward. Okay, so the take-home is that we know all of the maximal subgroups upstairs in the algebraic. So we don't necessarily know them all. In the algebraic group, so we don't necessarily know them all in the finite group of E-type. A few instances we don't, but in the algebraic group, we do. And how do you then bring them down to the finite group of E-type and get your maximal subgroups down says, well, it's kind of easy in one. Let's say it's easy for today. Part two has been done for us in this very nice paper of Liebex Saxon sites. They take all these maximal ranked ones and decide which ones come down to be maximal. ones come down to be maximal and then again in three we'll we'll say it's essentially straightforward okay so the small subgroups i'm not going to say too much about this because that's definitely what david's going to talk about tomorrow um builds on work of lots of authors here are some some examples and so it might seem that they're going to be difficult to deal with because we don't really know all of them um well we we we do actually to some extent We do actually, to some extent. One of the biggest questions that's left is conjugacy of them. How many? So we might know there's definitely a maximum subgroup of E8 that looks like a certain isomorphism type. But then the question is, well, how many conjugacy classes are there and in what ways can it embed? So we might be able in this extreme primitivity setting, just to be able to deal with them without really knowing or caring whether they actually. Knowing or caring whether they actually exist. Okay, so I have about 15 minutes left, maybe a slight bit longer, which is nice. So let's go back to thinking about extreme primitivity. So this is what we're trying to do. We take a group G, which for today and for the paper with Tim was an exceptional type, finite group of B type. And we want to find And we want to find elements g and g such that the intersection of h and h to the g is not a maximal subgroup of h. And what we haven't really spoken about so far is how we might do that. So I've discussed some subgroup structure of these finite groups of e-type, which are going to be important just in knowing what H's we have to deal with. But then we've got to have some strategy for actually showing that H in set H to the G is not maximal in H. I mean, it's a good start to know the H's. I mean it's a good start to know the H's, to then know their subgroup structure, but what's going on when we start conjugating by things in G is not so clear. So let's describe some of the tools we used in the proof. Okay, so first of all, before we do anything else, we throw lots of them away. So we go back to the first result. For example, if you tell me your maximal subgroup had a center, then I don't care. Then I don't care that my action is not extremely primitive, or maybe it is elementary abelian, but H quotient its fitting subgroup is not isomorphic to a subgroup GLDB, then I don't care. So I can go through my list of maximal subgroups plus this list of possibly maximal subgroups at the bottom and just cross lots of them out and say, no, no chance. So if I get my link back carefully enough. Okay, so that's one way. Okay, so that's one way we just throw this out. So, secondly, if the group is small, and I'm not giving any proper description of what small enough means, then the action is well understood and we're okay. We can just, in our case, we asked magma: you know, here's the group, here's the maximal subgroup. It can then understand the action, understand all of the orbits, and check whether or not. And check whether or not HACKS primitively on each of those orbits. And again, almost all of the time the answer is no, unless. So G is small enough when it's G to a 4 with our one example of J2. Okay, so that's kind of a throwing out. And then we don't want to deal with things where things are too small. So the third tool, which is a big tool, is we might be able to prove that G acting Might be able to prove that G acting on G1H has base size two. And I'll say a little bit more about that shortly. But Tim is talking tomorrow on some results in base size and also they came up in Melissa's talk, which I must admit I wasn't awake for as I think it was three in the morning. That's the power of being able to watch things afterwards. And the fourth one, which I guess is kind of what I've built the talk around that I just like to talk. The talk around that I just like to talk about is when the subgroup is algebraic, we might be able to use our understanding of subgroup structure to be able to prove that we can find one of these little g' such that this is not a maximal subgroup of h. And I guess this was the bit that I brought some tools to, more so. So that's why we're going to concentrate on that. Okay, so there are parabolic subgroups. There are parabolic subgroups. So we start, we look at our list and we start with an exceptional group, maybe G2. And we first want to just kill off all of the parabolic subgroups. Well, tool one, which was this first lemma, said, oh, do you have a center? Do you're fitting subgroup of a certain type? Well, that deals with essentially all of them. One way to see that is all but three, if you go through all of the G2, F4, E6, 7, have non-abeliant visiting. Have a non-abelian fitting subgroup. And then there are three cases where you do have an abelian-fitting subgroup. So P1 and P6 and E6 and P7 and E7. If that means anything, it's not too important. And then, but they get killed just by going one part further down because the size of the fitting subgroup doesn't divide the size of omega minus one. Okay, so parabolic subgroups don't cause us too much trouble. Too much trouble. So, tool two. So, that's sorry, that's one example of what you can throw away. So, parabolic subgroups just go straight away. The computations, I'm not going to talk about them in detail at all. These were the sort of groups that we were able to handle without having to do anything else, just put them into magma. And there were lots of other cases where we needed a computer for much bigger things, and there's a computational node. And there's a computational note on our websites with details about that. Okay, so the third method has base size two. Okay, so first of all, let me remind you what base size is. So you have G, your permutation group acting on some set omega. Then B of G H is the smallest size of a subset of omega, subset B of omega. Of omega, subset B of omega, such that when you intersect all of the point stabilizers of the points in that subset, you get the trivial loop. So on the face of it, you might think, well, what's that got to do with extreme primitivity? Well, the base size is two if and only if there exists an element g in g such that h intercept h to the g is one. Okay, so our point stabilizer was h, all of our other ones are. As h. All of our other ones are the conjugates of h in our transitive setup. And so if the base size is two, then I can find an element of g such that h in set h to g is one. Okay, well that's great, because no maximal subgroup of an almost simple group has prime order, so the trivial subgroup is not maximal in h and so extreme primitivity forces the base size to be at least three. Now we don't get Least three. Now we don't get anything, or we can see anything else to say, oh, well, if it's if it's three, there are cases where, I think there are cases where the base size is three and it's extremely primitive. So the tool is, if you can show your action has base size two, then it has no chance of being extremely primitive. Which is just what I say in this lemma. And there are lots of results in the literature on Of results in the literature on base size, and say I'm not really the person to give a talk about them, but lots of them gave a bound on the base size. But as I've just explained, we really needed base size two. So we did. So the paper contains lots of results about certain subgroups being of exceptional finite groups of lead type, the actions being base size two. And they take many pages and And they take many pages and detailed knowledge on the prime order elements in H and their fusion into G classes, and you plug them into fixed point ratios. And that's me being very succinct about this part of the method, just so I can get on to the other part. But here is just a brief example of the results. So if your subgroup H is one of either the normalizer for a maximal torus of G or ones in, so table one and table two are going to come on the next slide, then the base size. The next slide, then the base size is indeed two. So these were the new base size two results in the paper, and they allowed us to throw away lots of maximal subgroups. So here are the two tables. The first ones are maximal rank. They've come from an algebraic group that had maximal rank. So one of the ones in part one of the theorem of Lubert and sites. And here are some of these. Okay, so they're given in the paper. And they're given in the paper, and there are some interest in their own right. But what they certainly do for us today is mean we can throw away all of these subjects. They don't lead to an extremely formative action. Okay. And why did I think before that the small subgroups in inverted commoners were not going to cause us any trouble? Well, they're small, is why. Small is why, and the fact that they're small, they were all small enough that the base size was two, apart from the following two cases. So in twisted E6 of two, there's Fisher 22, and in that case, the base size is actually three, and we need to do something else to show it's not extremely primitive. And this subgroup, L4 of three and F4 of two, and at the time of writing the paper, couldn't actually decide whether it had base size two or not. It certainly got base size at most three. Certainly got base size at most three, but either way, we couldn't get base size two for sure, and therefore we just had to do something extra in these two cases. And this theorem, of course, relies heavily on the work of David in getting rid of lots of the candidates. So otherwise, before that work, there was a list of candidates that was much bigger, and lots of those would not have necessarily been basis two for three. But here we could do that. Here we could do that. Okay, so I've got almost 10 minutes to talk about how the subgroup structure can give us another way of showing an action is not extremely primitive. So what's the basic idea? So in base size 2 method, we wanted to show that there was an element g such that intercept H to the G was trivial and thus not maximum. Okay, so that's saying I can actually move H. I can actually move H far away from using G as far away from H as possible in such a way that they only intersected the trivial subgroup. Well, instead, how about we took something where we actually knew some subgroup of the intersection and perhaps a really big subgroup of the intersection, so big, in fact, that we understood the maximal overgroups of K inside H and thus. Inside H and thus also inside H to the G. And then, if you understand that hopefully small set of maximal overgroups, then perhaps you can control or understand that when I move from H to H to the G, that none of the maximal overgroups that are in H of K and the maximal overgroups in H to the G of K, because K is in both, match. So if none of those are the same, then I can't have had that my intersection was a match. Can't have had that my intersection was a maximal subgroup of H because the intersection contains K, but it doesn't contain any of the maximal overgroups of K and H, and none of the maximal overgroups in of K and H to the G. And I mean, I guess it seems sort of naive as a method, perhaps, but then equally, it was quite fruitful on the cases we couldn't do. So either when the base size wasn't two, or it would take a lot more work to even look at whether the base size was two. To even look at whether the base size was two, then this method actually came to our rescue. So, just to be precise, what am I saying with this basic idea? Well, if you have G a simple group, maximum subgroup H as a simple, we'll not worry about the almost simple case, it can be dealt with just the same. And you take a proper subgroup of H and you look at this curly M, the set of all maximal overgroups of K and H. Maximal overgroups of k and h, then if you have some element g which normalizes k but m to the g is not an h for all m in this curly m, then you can check that h intersect h to the g inverse will be a non-maximal subgroup of h, and so we won't have extreme primitivity. And I mean, this really is a lemma. It's not too difficult to prove. It is just from that basic idea. It is just from that basic idea that I explained. Okay, but it's not a lemma where you can just go away and plug everything. So, base size two, if I tell you it's base size two, you can throw it away. Whereas this is more of a method that you're going to have to go away and find things to apply it to. Because first of all, you need to find a good candidate for K, and there might have been better candidates than the ones we used or not. I'm not sure. I'm not claiming they're optimal. Claiming they're optimal, and understand its set of maximal overgroups, and then look for this element g, which does this. So, there's still a lot of work to be done, and the best way I could think of to sort of explain that work was just to pick two examples of how we use the length. So, the first one is one of these, so it's always in this algebraic setup for today. So, there's a D8 inside E8 comes from the extended D8 diagram. Okay, so you can think of this, I've written it. Okay, so you can think of this. I've written it as half spin 16 to be correct, but you can just think of it as SO16. There's an SO16 inside E8. And so inside SO16, there's SO8 cross SO8, that I've said. And this is what we're going to choose as our k. So we're trying to take H dAQ, this SO16, find a conjugate of it under E8, so that the intersection is going to contain this K. Contain this K, but doesn't contain the maximal overpowered. Okay, so we need some facts which you can get from calculation in the Wall group or other ways. So what's the normalizer in SO16 of this subgroup? Well, it's this SO8 cross SO8 with a two cross two on top of it. So there's a two which swaps the two factors and there's a two which induces a graph automorphism simultaneously on both. You can calculate that or you could. That or you could, yeah, well, I would calculate that if I'm well. Okay. So, and that actually happens to be a maximal subgroup of H. Okay, so then you go to your copy of Preidman and Liebeck and you look for all the maximal overgroups of K in H. And you find that they actually all have to be conjugate to M, which means in fact M has to be the unique maximal overgroup of K in H. Okay, so in this case, Curly M. So, in this case, curly m has just one element in it, m. So, we're looking at k inside m inside h. And so now we want to keep k where it is, move h, and hopefully also move m. Because if we move m, m as the unique maximal overgroup of k and h, it can't then be inside, m can't be in h and h to the g if it's been moved. To the g, if it's been moved, and so we'll be done. Well, so what do we do? Well, it's the subgroup is quite nice, probably well known to a few people, that this D4D4 has more normalizer in E8 because there's an element which acts simultaneously as a triality on both factors. So our normalizer in G of K is two cross-s. And so if we take an element of We take an element of order three in here. Well, we're fortunate enough that that's not going to normalize our two cross two using the great fact that a subgroup of order two inside S3 is not normal. And so that's going to move. So there's actually sort of three overgroups that look like M above K, but they're not the same. So I can use this element to move, to keep K, but to move my M. My M. And so a quick check shows that indeed that means that K is in H and set H to the G, but the unique maximum overgroup is that. Okay, so I've got about a minute left. So let me just show you very quickly another application of it. So sometimes I at least couldn't find a subgroup which only had one maximal overgroup or necessarily had this nice normalizer action. So instead, sometimes you can. Normalized direction. So instead, sometimes you can find a k inside h which has a bigger centralizer than h does. And indeed, you can't always find it with a unique maximal overgroup. However, the sort of next best thing was finding an overgroup S of K. So I've got K inside S, such that every maximal overgroup of K contained S. So then, if I've moved S when I move from H to H of the G, then of course I can't have any of my maximal overgroups still being. any of my maximal overgroups still being from h still being h to the g because they would have to contain this unique overgroup s and i'm going to say that it doesn't so so that's what we need to show this time and this one is again a sort of technical thing that in f4 in an even characteristic it turns out that you can deal with this d4 case because b3 has a bigger centralizer than the d4 so Of them default. So again, I guess this has been known for a while. My reference for that is a paper of the Beck and Seitz in 94, where they calculate these centralizers and you find there's an SL2. That SL2 doesn't centralize the D4. And so you go through and you use the lovely book of Bray Holton and Dougal to tell you about this time we're in eight rather than 16, as our sort of As our sort of orthogonal group. And so we can find out all the information we like about K. And it turns out to be a maximal subgroup of this S. And all of the maximal overgroups look like S extended by something, so they contain S. And then you go through and you realize you can keep K where it is without moving, without keeping S with you. And so your overgroups don't contain X. Okay, and that's all the technical, but that's. All a little bit technical, but that's the idea of how we use the subgroup structure as another method for sharing extreme primitivity. And that's the end of my talk. Thank you very much, Eda. If anybody has a question, please just speak up. It seems like you didn't leave anything to ask. So thanks again for your talk. And the next talk by Aruna Visoli is going to start at 10:30 bump time, I think.
