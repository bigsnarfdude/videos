The carboniferous 300 million years ago, and Carboniferous from 300 million years ago probably means next to nothing to you. So you do but you do know something about them being dinosaurs. And before there were dinosaurs, there were some other vertebrates on land. And before that, there were no vertebrates on land at all. And where these sit in time is kind of white at the beginning of the battle. So I'll try to always be oriented in time as I jump around with something like this. But the point of showing these four leaves is that they all kind of look like fern leaves, and none of them are. Leaves, and none of them are. These are all unrelated to ferns. And in fact, even the common ancestors of these plants would not have leaves at all. So these are independently derived, even though they look very similar. Now, what do I mean by that? If we look at modern vascular plants, it looks like there's a lot of continuity across that phylogeny, that evolutionary tree. They all have similar structures to them. But the common ancestors of these lineages are way back in time in things that are very small and simple, about 400 million years ago. Simple, about 400 million years ago, about 400 million years ago, they lacked all these structures. So then, as these lineages evolved, they're separately evolving groups and wood and leaves. And we can see this happen in real time with the fossils. Here are four different lineages that evolve leaves. And you can see that the lineages are distinct, and they don't really have leaves. They just got these little feathery structures. Later on, the same lineages have leaves, laminate structures with lots of. Leaves, lamb-made structures with lots of veins and so on, like that. So, we can watch this play out again and again and again and compare how these different things have evolved. And the fact that these all feel kind of ferny, there's an actual fern there, suggests that there's some kind of constraints on how this process can occur. And that suggests that there might be developmental constraints on what's going on. So, we can look at modern development of use. And there's two really kind of use exclusive end members perspectives on how that would. Perspectives on how that would work. Traditionally, the notion has been that there's marginal growth of the leaf, and this is shown here in this growing leaf here. By the time the thing's a millimeter or two, all these little dots that you see, those are individual cell divisions, and they're all confined to near the distal margin, and that's where that growth is occurring. Alternatively, this is a clonal analysis study here. They zapped a plant with X-rays and then looked at patches of mutated cells that would be clonally related to each other and saw. To each other, and saw that the patches were kind of distributed throughout the leaf with no special relationship to the margin. And so they said, no, the margin doesn't matter. This leaf is growing everywhere. And this was very much framed as an argument. They were saying that they were refuting the simple notion of how leaves grow. The problem is that this is a fern. This is angiosperm, a flowering plant. That's tobacco. The common ancestor of those plants didn't have leaves at all. There's no way you can refute one with the other. You can refute one with the other, it doesn't make any sense. So, these are really both coexisting possibilities in how things can work. So, I brought up flowering plants, that's the first time they've been mentioned. Flowering plants are most of the plants alive today are flowering plants. Flowering plants are one lineage of seed plants alongside conifers and ginkgo and stuff like that. And then the seed plants as a whole are one lineage among the vascular plants alongside horsetails and ferns and stuff like that. Most of these lineages I just mentioned. Most of these lineages I just mentioned go way back in time, at least 300 million years, in some cases more than 400 million years. Flowering plants, that one lineage of seed plants, is a very recent addition to the system. They only show up about 120 million years ago, and then they very rapidly, after 100 million years, just kind of take over the planet. Anywhere on Earth now, they're 90% of the species. Even here, all the trees are conifers, all the shrubs, all the herbs that are near, they're all firemans, and that's most of the actual species that we're seeing. So they are important now, but they're this weird end number to the system. Now, but they're this weird end number to the system. So, we have two alternative modes of growth that are both real and they're out there, and they are reflected in alternative different formations of the veins within that system. This guy has open dichotomy venation running to that distal margin along which growth occurred. This one has much more complex systems with internally directed veins and lots of articulations and closed loops and so on, like that. And not to belabor what was covered quite a bit. To belabor what was covered quite a bit yesterday, but that makes a lot of sense based on what we know about how veins grow. You have distal production of oxygen that's transported proximally, and then veins get cannalized along that gradient. So it would make a lot of sense for this kind of vein pattern to be associated with marginal growth, and it would make a lot of sense to see something very different from that in plants that are growing diffusely throughout the leaf. But we can see those vein patterns in the fossils. So we can look at how things change through time. How things change through time. And if we take these four independent lineages of leaves, they all follow the exact same sequence of form as they evolve. Now, some of them don't get very far before they go extinct, but however far they do get is following the same sequence each time. And what that reflects is initially you just have linear dichotomizing little segments with a single vein in that segment, which presumably be growing at the tip. If it's dichotomizing, it has to be growing at the tip like that. Like that. If you modify that and make that into a planar growth rather than a point-tip growth, you're going to end up with a marginal growth front. There's the nation associated with that that's just kind of openly, evenly dichotomous. You can modify that marginal growth in various forms, eventually including reticulations and closed loops, but initially a simple form of closed loops. And then eventually, once you have this kind of marginal lambda in place, you can deviate from that mode of growth entirely with more. Mode of growth entirely with more complex vanation patterns reminiscent of flowering plants, although they're not always flowering plants. That suggests kind of departures from marginal growth and more diffuse growth throughout that line. And it's the same sequence every single time it happens. Now, when I say there's kind of various kind of modifications of marginal growth, kind of everything that you can imagine doing to a marginal growth zone does appear in the fossil record. Now, I just drew arrows and little triangles on existing pictures. You may think, you know, yesterday was. You may think yesterday was a little bit more rigorous in how it was done. That may be true. But the basics of how this works is all there. You can modify the duration of growth, the rate of growth, perpendicular or parallel to that marginal growth zone, and you can do it symmetrically or asymmetrically. But all those are actual leaves that exist that appear to imply these different options. And if we kind of look at that record in aggregate, this is a That record in aggregate. This is a principal coordinates analysis, so it's based on discrete characteristics of belief just added together so that you can kind of see what's happening without looking at every belief. And we're kind of time goes through like this. Everything kind of starts out in the same place with those very simple linear leaves. As you evolve this kind of more diverse lined forms, very quickly you kind of saturate. And all the forms that are going to exist among marginal growing forms, they're there. And they're independently there in both seed plants and ferns. Both sea plants and ferns. And the reason they all look like ferns to us now is because sea plants eventually stopped doing most of these morphologies. And that's why they look like ferns. But both groups are independently doing both. And they're all present relatively quickly. And then it's just a wait until you get greater departures from this with more flowering plant-like venaceous patterns and growth patterns. So that is all based upon two points of real knowledge. We know how ferns grow, and we know what ferns look like. And we know what ferns look like, and we know how some angles ferns grow and what they look like as far as their main patterns. And then I'm applying that to the false record via the venation patterns. I can test whether that's a reasonable approach by looking at other living groups and trying the same approach, but then I can then actually look at how they're growing, right? So there are plenty of groups that also look to me like they should have marginal growth based upon their donation pattern, and then I can actually look at them and see what they're doing. And so we have two groups here. We're gonna look at a psychad, these guys here. Look at a cypad, these guys here, that's not a palm tree, that's an independent group among the seed plants, kind of like gangdora conifers. And we're going to look at buttercups and specifically the petals of buttercups. And so both of these have open dichotomous spination running to the distal margin, which suggests to be distal marginal growth. And then we can see what they're actually doing. And in both cases, this would be independent of ferns, too. The common answers are cypads and ferns didn't have leaves at all. And in this case, we can further say that the And in this case, we can further say that the petals of a buttercup flower are very distinct from the leaves of the very same plant, which looks like a typical angiosperm. So they would be independent even of the leaves of the very same plant. And sure enough, when we look at the distribution of cell divisions and transects along these structures, yeah, the cell divisions are all at the distal margin. And then it declines from there and declines to zero, and then that tissue's done. And it's only growing along that distal margin in both cases. So, yes. Cases. So, yes, the evolution of distinct forms convergently reflects the convergent evolution of similar development. I think that's really kind of cool. I was very happy with this result. It was hard work. It's really hard working with these things. They're very small. They're very delicate. They can boil them massively. Turn into goo. It's very hard work to do. But I was very proud of this result. And I published this result. And I cannot say this strongly enough: nobody cared. No one. So I was trying to engage developers. Trying to engage developmental biologists and I just failed. They never read this paper, they don't cite this paper, and it makes sense to me retrospectively because they're very interested in molecular developmental techniques, and I'm using techniques here that existed before I was born. And also, they're very wedded to model systems, and this was intentionally going as far away from model systems as possible. So it kind of made sense, but it was really kind of a limitation. It never occurred to me that I should look for a physicist interested in MOOCs. Physicist interested in MOOCs. It never would occur to me. I'm very glad and grateful that you found me. I never would have found you. But that's kind of where I was. I was looking for a pick-they're audience and I failed to reach that audience. At this time, I was an assistant professor working for tenure. Doing work that has no audience is not necessarily my best interest. So there are plenty of other things, though, I could do with that, right? So I have a question: the slide that you were showing. So, based on those photographs that you put in, that you left on. That you had from the back how the demation was. Yeah, you can see the veins in there. That's not how you would go about it. We stayed more from the nuclei, so they're not as clear as they should be. But yeah, you can see the open dichotomy. How many time points are there? How many what? How many time points? Oh, oh, God, this was 18 years ago. I believe I did three different stages. That's roughly those three there are the ones I was looking at, and then kind of following. Are the ones I was looking at, and then kind of following work on it. So I built up this kind of body of knowledge. Paleontologists appreciated it. To go further with it was engaging developmental biologists who did not want to be engaged. That's fine. I've got plenty of other things I can do with this. Specifically with leaf venation patterns through time. And one thing in particular that really stood out is that the way this is presented, there's an issue with it. So here's the venation of the flowering plant, and here's the venation of a fern that looks a lot like a flowering plant. The problem is that these are not presented as. The problem is that these are not presented at the same scale. But they were building like that. There are vastly more veins in flowering plant than in many other plants. And we can kind of quantify that through all of time because we have the veins from fossils. And what we're looking at here is the length of vein per square millimeter of leaf surface. And if you look first through time, through all of time, it's very stable and low. It's about two millimeters of vein per square millimeter of leaf surface. It can go up to four, it can go down to one. It rarely goes out. To four, it can go down to one, but it rarely goes outside of that range until this last time step here. And suddenly, the average is three to one three. That is specifically just the flowering concept. All other plants, the average is two, maybe it goes up to five. These things have an average of eight to ten, and they can go above 20. So the mean and maximum are both increasing by a factor of four. And that should actually matter for the plant. Plants are all about gas exchange, but gas exchange is relevant to photosynthesis. And it's potassium change relevant to photosynthesis. So it's carbon dioxide in to fix the sugars. And as CO2 diffuses in through the schematic pores, water diffuses out. And if you cannot replace the water you are losing, you must shut those pores to prevent water loss. But then you're also preventing photosynthesis. So the more water you can afford to lose, the rate at which you can afford to lose it, determines how much photosynthesis it can do. So photosynthetic capacity is going to be tightly correlated with hydraulic capacity. Overall, in a plant, at least a third of the resistance. Overall, in a plant, at least a third of the resistance of the entire plant through the roots, not the stem, out the branch, to the leaf, is just in that little last bit of the leaf, because that is where water leaves pipes that are designed for water transport and has to go through living tissue with much higher resistance. So anything you can do to shorten that path length through that living tissue will increase the high hydraulic conductivity of the entire plant. And the easiest way to shorten that path length is just to add more veins. So this should actually matter for the plant. So, this should actually matter for the plant having more veins like that. We can see this in practice. This is vein density here versus maximum transpiration rates. And they're very tightly correlated with each other. And all the blue dots are the flying points. They're the health at the top. They can transpire much more water. And that matters for the plant, but then it also starts to matter for the earth. Transpiration is important for climate. Evaporation of water, moon through plants, transpiration is the evaporation of water passed through a plant. Pass through a plant is very important. So, if you look at a rainforest, up to half of the rain that falls in a rainforest has been recycled from that rainforest. It falls out of the sky, the plants take it up and put it right back up into the sky so it can fall again. If transpiration capacity is four times lower than all other plants other than flowering plants, what did the world look like before flowering plants? So, we can actually explore that with climate models. This is a global model. It's all modern conditions, modern sea surface temperatures, modern sea. Modern sea surface temperatures, modern CO2, modern vegetative biomass, all we changed was the physiology of that vegetative biomass and made it like ferns instead of like flower. That's what's daunting people in these systems. And what this is, is a difference map. It's showing how much precipitation is lost based upon the change we initiated. And at the center of the bullseye, they're losing 1,500 millimeters of rainfall per year in the Amazon basin. It's going to be drier. It's going to be drier. If it's drier, it's also going to be hotter because there's less transition between latent and sensible heat with less evaporation from the transpiration. It's more seasonal. And overall, geographically, the area of ever-wet rainforest decreases by 80%. So prior to the evolution of flowering plants, rainforests are a much more risky proposition. They still exist, they're still tropical rainbows, but the extent of them has really been propagated by changes in the vegetation. So flowering plants are the most diverse in rainforests, but they're also helping. But they're also helping propagate the environment in which they are the most diverse. That's transpiration, but of course, what the plant is really after is assimilation of carbon. If we look at that, that too is going to be correlated with the vein density. The blue is what angiosperms can do. And then this little area here is what all other plants can do. It's obviously much lower on that scale there. And that matters. It's going to matter in really fun, weird ways for the carbon cycle, which I won't get into. For the carbon cycle, which I can't get into circumstances. It also matters for the plant itself. This is a classical rendition of plant ecological strategies based upon trade-offs between stress and disturbance and constitution for nutrients and so on, with kind of three end-member strategies of things that grow very slowly, have very low reproductive output, they live for a long time, called stress tolerators, and then things like weeds that grow very fast but die very quickly and have to get through a life cycle before the next disturbance, and then kind of stately competitors like this tree. Stately competitors like this tree or whatever, and so on. Two of these three vertices are dependent upon high productivity that is only seen in flowering plants. Prior to the evolution of flowering plants, everything would be kind of pushed down to what's more probably stressed water going out. And we can actually see that in the fossil record. So this is looking at one very narrow time slice of less than a million years. It's only looking at fossils from England, right? So this is basically a self-contained, complete flora of plants that live with each other. With each other. And all of them look what would look like deep shade plants in the modern world. Even the trees, everything looks like a deep shade plant. So there's this classic notion of competing for light and growing over each other and all that kind of stuff. These plants don't care. They're not competing for light. They're all getting more light than they know what to do with because they can't do that much photosynthesis, which kind of raises kind of fun questions of why bother being a tree at all. If you're not competing for light, why be a tree? Why go through the effort doom? There are answers to that, and I don't have time to explain it. Answers to that, and I don't have time to explain it. But you can think about that. And that kind of will lead us back to the actual kind of vein patterns and what they mean, and so on. I'm going to start with this study. I was not a part of this study, and what they did here is they made artificial leaves out of gel, and they had channels carved in that gel with water in them, and they evaporated water through the gel. And what they found is that you can add more and more channels, and you'd evaporate more water, but that would saturate at some point, because the curves would plateau. And where you plateaued, And where you plateaued depended on the thickness of the gel. And they found an optimal spacing of the canals was about the distance, the distance between canals should be about the same as the distance from the canal to that evaporative surface, which had clear implications for actual leaves, which is that you can imagine thin leaves with lots of veins, that's fine. You can imagine thick leaves with few veins, that's fine. But you should not be able to really have thin leaves with few veins. Veins, thin leaves with few veins because they would dry out and die. And you shouldn't have thick leaves with lots of veins because that would just be stupid and wasteful. The surface can't see all those veins, so why they're eating there? So then they measure a bunch of actual plants, and sure enough, they're all on the line like that. The senior author on the study was a close colleague of mine. Apparently, I did not know this until this meeting, but half of all Polish men are apparently named Machi. And so I talked to Machik all the time, and I read this paper. I talked about it all the time, and I read this paper, and I was like, this doesn't feel right. I looked at a lot of plants. I feel like there's a lot of things that should not be on this line. And sure enough, they just grabbed a bunch of plants and measured them, which means they grabbed a bunch of flowering plants. They were not thinking about an evolutionary tree, and that matters. And I would advise all of you to think about evolution of trees when you're kind of looking at biological systems and look at the things that are nearby within that evolutionary tree design. So, if we went back and stamped a lot more with an evolutionary tree in mind, we get a very different. Tree in mind, we get a very different pattern. There's still nothing below the line, which is amazing. They really got it right as far as the mechanisms of what's going on here, because that's the thing would be overinvested. And flowering plants are still on the line, but it's not mull underline, it's a triangle. Ferns have thin leaves and few veins. I already knew that, and that's where I expected them to be, and where they are. And so, what does that mean for a fern? They have thin leaves, so they could do a lot of gas exchange because the diffusive distances are short, but they're also going to dry out. Short, but they're also going to dry out and die if you put them in the sideway. So, in theory, they could do a lot of photosynthesis, but they can't do a lot of photosynthesis because of the risk associated with it. They have to be in these more sheltered environments where they can't use that potential that they have in them. Seed plants other than the flowering plants tend to have thick leaves. So they can actually end up on this line, but only by virtue of having few veins, but in thick leaves, right? And in that original study, they did have two non-antiosperms. It was a cycad and a conifer. And so, yeah, they're on the line, they're on the line way up here. They're on one living. So, those plants can tolerate full sun, but they can't use it because they have thick leaves and long diffusive distances for a gas exchange. The only things that figure out the trick of how to take thin leaves and put them right at the top of the canopy where they can use all that light are the flying lines. So with their changes in vein patterns, they really have invented completely new ecologies that just couldn't have existed outside of the changes that they had initiated. So, which leads to one last thing I want to say. Which leads to one last thing I want to say, which is, and this is just two slides, you don't even have to stand up. You can stand up if you want. You can stand up anyway. So if this high vein density is so important, why don't all plants just involve get more veins, right? And this is work of a student of mine named Andreas. And what he did is think through what would actually happen with a ginkgo sitting up with 1.5 vein density tried to add more veins. And the answer is it wouldn't get very far because you can't just add more veins. That's half. Can't just add more veins, that's half of the pathway. You'd also have to add proportionally more stomata, where the actual water and CO2 exchange occurs. And if you add them proportionally, you rapidly end up running out of space on the epidermis because they both occupy the epidermis, right? So this is a leaf cuticle here. All this modeling are the little stomatal pores, and then the banding around that are the locations of the veins. And wherever there's a vein, you can't put the stomata because even though a vein in the thickness of a leaf is The thickness of a leaf, it's running through the middle, they have these bundle sheath extensions that act as pillars and then occupy parts of the leaf surface. And wherever they do, you can't put stomata, right? So if you add more veins, you're taking up space. You also have to add more stomata, that takes up space, and you end up running out of space when you only increase the vein density by a factor of three, when angiosperm can be 10 or 15 times higher than that. So, what are angiosperms really doing differently? And the answer is leaving networks. It finally gets. Answer is leaping networks. I finally get to justify my existence. Because if you look in this leaf here at the vein patterns associated with it, this is a flowering plant. And there's actually a lot more veins than you see in that cuticle bit. And it's because they have this hierarchy of many vein orders. And so they can express these bundle sheaths in the bigger veins and not in the smaller veins and get away with that. Whereas if you don't have that hierarchy, in fern, gango, psychak, whatever, you can't do that. It has to be all or nothing. There's real problems with not. To be all or nothing, there's real problems with not having the bundle sheath extensions. And so you end up with a situation where they all have it and then they run out of space. So this is showing vein density versus bundle sheath density. Non-angiosperf are kind of stuck on this one-to-one line. It's nothing you can really do about it. But flowering plants can migrate away from that to much higher vein densities by virtue of this hierarchy. If you look at the density within an angiosperm, the density of veins that have bundle seeds is equivalent to the vein density of non-antiosperms. It's just they add in all these other veins that come. It's just that they add in all these other things that don't do that. And that's how they get up to these very, very high densities. And you couldn't have done that without evolving the patterns that you see in firewalls. Okay, I will stop there since I got the looping networks in. This is just a summary of what I've said. I can stop there. So send you up to us. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So, question: your model you did with the looking at a world without flowering, plants, flowers that are poller and drier. I was just thinking about obviously deforestation and destruction of the environment. If you wanted to help the planet recover as much as possible, shouldn't you be planting a lot more flowering plants than ferns? I don't think people are planting ferns. It's not a coin concern that if they're going to do that, they're not planting ferns. It's a tough. It toughly, I see the logic, and they do do these things, where they plant lots of trees, but it's a hard thing to recover for it. And it's not, you know, a decade later, everything's fine type of thing. It will take hundreds of thousands of years to actually kind of work these things out. There will always be a tropical rainbow, there will always be some rainforests, but as these things came online, like and and it's clear that flying must evolve from the rainforest in the first place, so they couldn't have invented it, but then as it propagates out, as it gets out. Then as it propagates out, that's a geological process. It's the next year we call it a geological process.
