In these difficult times, even if we are not in Bonn, it's still a great pleasure to attend this meeting. I would also like to thank the organizers more specifically for putting me at the end of this day and not before, because my talk will be related to, in fact, many earlier talks. And I will be able to skip most of the general introduction part and Introduction part and respect, I hope, the timeline. Basically, you can think of my talk as a kind of illustration of the robustness of the method that was shown in the very previous talk. So, the problem I'm considering in a very general way is the problem of competitive displacement between two species that are in competition in a in a in a habitat. In a habitat, so let's say the real line. You have the two species N1 and N2, and they are located each one on one side of an interface that is moving at speed C. So obviously I have traveling waves in mind. And what I want to do with this setting is compare different dispersal strategies or growth strategies. I want to know if, let's say, linear Let's say linear diffusion is a good idea to win the competition, or if you should perform, let's say, cross-diffusion or self-diffusion or anything. I want to be able to compare as much strategies as possible. So, there are many applications of such problems in biology, let's say in ecology for territorial expansion, in cancer for resistant responsible cells, or in biodiversity conservation, etc. Biodiversity conservation, etc. etc. etc. So, let me go straight into the mathematical nightmare. So, this is the system I have in mind. It's a kind of very general two-species competition, diffusion, and vection loctavoltera systems with full non-linearities and strong couplings everywhere. So, let me spend a bit some more time on this system. On the first line of each equation, you have Of each equation, you have a general non-linear and strongly coupled diffusion term. You assume that the matrix D of diffusion terms is C1 in the square 0, 1 that will be the phase space. You assume that the self-diffusion parts have a positive minimum, so that the system is strongly parabolic in some sense, and you assume that the And you assume that the cross-diffusion parts are well behaved. That is, if, let's say, N1 is zero in the first equation, then there is no cross-diffusion with N2. So you want zero to be a steady state of both equations. On the second line, you have advection terms that are also strongly coupled and fully nonlinear. So the matrix H is continuous and you assume again that the cross advection terms are well behaved. Terms are well behaved. And on the last line, you have the reaction terms. So the first part is N1 times G1 and N2 times G2. So the function G is continuous. You assume that G is in a very loose stance, a monostable growth rate. So it is positive in the absence of the other species. So if N1 is alone, let's say, then Alone, let's say, then G1 of N1 is positive, and it is zero at one. So you have carrying capacities at one for both species. The parameters alpha and k are positive and constant. So again, the k here is the same one as in the previous talk. So I'm very lucky I used the same letter. And again, it will go to plus infinity. And you have also this new part, which is this omega of n. I do not assume. And I do not assume any kind of regularity on omega. I just want it's essential in FEMO to be positive. But you can always think of omega, you can think that omega is one, it doesn't matter in the rest of the talk. The problem I consider is the convergence of monotonic traveling waves for such a system. So when I say monotonic traveling waves, I have in mind solutions of monotonic profiles. So if you have the picture of the previous slide, P1 goes P1 goes from 1 to 0 in a decreasing way, and P2 goes to 0 to 1 from 0 to 1 in an increasing way. And you have also this speed CK. And so I want to know the limit as K goes to plus infinity. I insist on the fact that I'm focusing on monotonic traveling waves. So, what is the tools and the literature we have at our disposal? First, Disposal. First, so everyone here who worked at some point on cross-diffusion systems or chemotaxis systems knows that there is a very huge literature on the well-posedness for elliptic or parabolic systems with such a cross with such strong couplings. And I'm definitely not going to detail this literature. I just want to let's say highlight that it's been growing a lot since It's been growing a lot since the beginning of the millennium. Regarding the strong competition limit, or what was called in the previous talk the fast reaction limit and the underlying free boundary problem, there is also a wide literature starting in, as far as I know, 1994 in a paper by Donso and Du. And since then, many, many people worked on this. And I apologize for not citing everyone, but in Horse Cooks, Mimoanomia. In horse, cooks, pneumoaninomia, teracini, biestiki, conti, verzini, kafali, and many others. Regarding the strong competition in so, sorry, regarding the previous point, all this literature is concerned with weakly coupled systems, parabolic systems. If you look at strongly coupled systems, let's say cross-diffusion systems of the Shigezadakawazaki tarmototype, then there is one team. Then there is one team, as far as I know, that's working on this since 2012, but it's limited to bounded domains and to the elliptic case. And finally, regarding the speed of the traveling wave or the pulsating traveling wave, especially when diffusion rates differ for the two species in a weakly coupled setting but possibly especially periodic, I did some work with Greguer Nadin during my PhD. And join my PhD. What will be the main tools we will use in this work? So, first, so sorry, I think I forgot to say at the very beginning, and I'm very sorry, that this is a joint work with Daniel Il Host. And of course, it's very important. Sorry. So, again, we will use the strong competition limit. And we hope that due to the segregation property that was illustrated in the previous talk. In the previous talk, we can hope that strong couplings will become negligible and that in the end we will not care so much about the cross-ifusion or the cross-addiction. But you might know that, let's say, cross-diffusion can generate singularities. So at least what we can hope is that the strong competition limit is sufficient to prevent the formation of singularities when the profiles are When the profiles are sufficiently regular. And this is where the monotonic traveling wave framework comes into play because it gives us a priori monotonicity of the solution and also a priori BD regularity of the solutions. And actually, a fun fact is that with this framework, attractive interactions between the two species become actually nicer than repulsive interactions. So, what are the results we obtained with Danielle? So, what are the results we obtained with Danielle on this problem? The main results are twofold. The first part is the convergence of the profiles. So, under, let's say, weak bondedness assumptions. So, what are these weak bondedness assumptions? You assume that the family of speeds is bonded and you assume that the profiles are, let's say, locally compact in Holder spaces. Then, with such bounty-ness assumptions, monotonic traveling waves do converge and Do converge and their limiting profiles P1 infinity and P2 infinity are specially segregated and some combination of them is of class C1. So this is what is illustrated here. The solid lines are the profiles, the two segregated profiles. So here you have the profile of N1 and here the profile of N2. And the dashed line is the linear combination of them that is of class C1. So this So, this regularity, this C1 regularity, gives you the free boundary condition here. And I want to emphasize here that you can think of this situation as two elliptic, strongly coupled, but strongly nonlinear, but two elliptic problems in a half-lines. And so, in this way, this is related to Cole Graham Stolk from yesterday or two days before. Two days before. The second result we obtain is the sign of the wave speed when you assume that the self-advection is constant and equal for both species. So in this case, you know that the sign of the limiting speeds infinity is given by this formula. And I do not want you to try to memorize this formula, but just remark that it only depends on the parameter alpha and on the equation. And on the equations satisfied by each species in the absence of the other. So, for instance, here you have the coefficients of the equation on N2, but you do not have N1, and similarly on the denominator. The second remark is that because of the integrals here and there, studying the neighborhood of the free boundary free boundary is a point, but still, so it's the point x minus infinity t equals zero. point x minus infinity t equals zero. Studying this neighborhood is not sufficient to characterize the sign. You really need to take into account the whole real line. So I can make the results more understandable by thanks to some applications. The first application is of course the classical Locta Volterra system without any strong couplings. So if you do so on this system then what you find applying the formula What you find applying the formula is that the sine of the limiting speed C infinity is the sine of alpha squared minus Rd. And in particular, if alpha is one and R is one, so that the two species differ only in diffusion rate, what you find is that increasing the diffusion rate will help N two to invade. So N two needs to have a large diffusion rate in order to win. This is an advantageous effect of diffusion. Advantageous effect of diffusion. This is a result we proved directly with Pl√©go Nadin in 2015 and regarding this problem when the value of k is finite, I wrote a survey article last year on this. I want also to recall that this problem is far from being obvious, and in particular, if you change just a bit the competition and you use this kind of gross Pitaevsky competition, Competition, then you can compute exactly the sign of the speed for any value of k, and it is always has the sign of alpha minus r. So no effect of the diffusion in the rational case. So if you have this in mind, then maybe the advantageous effect of diffusion in the Locta Volterra case comes as a surprise. The next example is this time a real strongly coupled system. It's what I Strongly coupled system. It's what I call the Potspetrovsky cross-taxis system. So it's the same system as before, but with these two new terms, two kinds of chemotaxis terms. So if gamma i is a positive, you have attraction between the two species, and if gamma i is negative, you have repulsion. And if you apply the formula we obtained for the sign of the speed to this system, what you find, in fact, is that cross-taxis does Is that cross-taxis does not have any effect at the limit? So again, the sine of the wave speed is the sine of alpha squared minus Rd. This time, you do not know a priori that monotonic traveling waves exist, so you need to assume that they exist. And you also need to assume that their speeds are bounded and that you have this local holder bound. But I want to emphasize that you need this compactness estimate only. Compactness estimate only if one of the two interactions is repulsive. In the attractive-attractive case, you can prove directly by hand that you have this compactness. I'm calling this the Potts-Petrovsky system because in an article in 2017, Jonathan Potts and Sange Petrovsky studied numerically this problem and they found that monotonic traveling waves seem to exist indeed. So my assumption is not. So, my assumption is not stupid, let's say. And they also found surprisingly that when k is 2000, so not infinite, but still, the choice of gamma i can still reverse the invasion. So let me recall that in the previous talk, the value of k was typically in the numerics 1000. So, here what you find is if here what they found, I mean, if you relate our result to If you relate our results to their numerics, you find that actually 2000 is not a good approximation of infinity in this context. The last system, the last main system I have in mind is of course the Shigezeta-Kawazakitaramoto cross-diffusion system. So this time you have diffusion of this form. So you have linear functions here in the diffusion. Diffusion and the coefficients a ij that are positive. This time, if you apply the formula to this system, what you find is that cross-diffusion has no effect again, but self-diffusion has an advantageous effect. The formula is this one. And so, again, L22 is the self-diffusion of N2, L11 is the self-diffusion of N1. Again, you do not know that traveling waves, monotonic traveling waves exist, so you need to assume their existence, and you also need to assume. Assume their existence, and you also need to assume that their speeds are bounded. But you can prove directly that the profiles are locally compact in holder space, so you do not need, again, an assumption on the profiles, which might come as a shock for some of you, but still. And I can apply the result to more systems, so just to play with. So, for instance, if you replace the logistic growth rate by a The logistic growth rate by a kind of alley effect here. You can compute the effect of the exponent Q. You can also introduce exponents in the Shigezatakawazakitar moto system like this. It's in particular what was studied in a paper by Laurent Devilet and co-authors. And again, you find exactly the effect of these exponents. The sketch of the proof is the following. First, by using any one of the two equations, you Any one of the two equations, you find easily that the product of the profiles goes to zero, let's say, in distributional sense. And then by using a linear combination of the two lines of the system, you find an equation that does not depend explicitly on k anymore. So you can hope to pass the limit, and this is what you do. You pass the limit along a subsequence at first using the compactness estimates, and you find that the limit point you obtain, so which is alpha p1. So, which is alpha p1 infinity minus p2 infinity and the limiting speed c infinity is a weak solution, so a weak solution in the sense that it is continuous with a distributional derivative of a bistable equation of this form. So, of course, it's a bistable equation, but you have non-linear diffusion and non-linear advection. Then you prove the non-triviality of the limit. So, non-triviality means that neither P1 nor P2 is zero. Is zero and the continuity of du prime. And I put stars here because this is typically the part where you get stuck if you don't have this monotonic traveling wave assumption. In the previous talk, there was an assumption on the regularity of the free boundary. Here, because the free boundary is basically a point, but mainly because the profiles are monotonic, we do not need any assumption on the Assumption on the Freemanda way or on the profiles, we can directly prove the non-signality and the continuity of DUU prime. The uniqueness follows from a paper on these nonlinear equations by Malaguti, Marcel and Mattucci from 2004, Uniqueness of the Limit. And then you can find the sign of the speed C, assuming that H of U is a constant, just by multiplying the equation by du prime and integrating as usual. and integrating as usual with bistable equations. If you want to know what is the limiting equation in more details, so the d of u is given by this, the h of u is given by this, and the g of u is given by this. I do not want to spend too much time on this, but just notice that again, let's say d11 inside you do not have n2. So it's fully segregated. As a conclusion, first we proved that any sufficiently bonded family of monotonic traveling waves converges to a monotonic traveling wave with segregated profiles and with a free boundary condition. We used the fact that the reduction of the system to a scalar equation transforms the sign of the wave speed into a very easy problem, whereas for the full nonlinear system, the sign of the wave speed is probably a nightmare. Probably a nightmare. We also show how dispersal growth strategies can be quantitatively compared, even though we do not have any comparison principle on these fully non-linear systems. And we prove that the interactions between the two species become negligible in the limit and they do not influence the regularity of the solutions. You cannot have blow-ups or anti-aratmasters or anything like that. And if you think of this in a Think of this in a biological way. This is very surprising because it shows that any mutation that changes how your population depends, how the strategy of your population depends on the behavior of the competitor is a neutral mutation. So it's never advantageous to try to adapt the strategy to the other population. And this is because basically you never meet the other population in this segregated regime. Of course, the main perspective of this work, the elephant in the room, is the existence of monotonic traveling waves for arbitrary strong couplings D, H, G, and omega. And of course, the conjecture is that this existence is false in general, especially due to the monotonicity condition. But we expect that this existence is true if k is large enough and if the limiting problem admits. And if the limiting problem admits a solution. And in order to prove such a result, we would use an homotopy method established by Dancer and Du in 1994 and that I used also with Alessandro Rosilio last year in a slightly different setting. But there are important difficulties when you try to apply this method to this context, mainly the linear stability of the solution, which a priori is false, and also a compact. Is false and also a compactness in the real line which is not compact. But we need the limiting problem to have a solution. And regarding this, it's already done again in this paper by Malaguti, Marceli and Matucci, where they prove that this non-linear bistable equation admits a continuous traveling wave solution, monotonic, if and only if the two underlying monostable speeds are correctly ordered, and in such a case. Ordered, and in such a case, the bistable speed is stuck between the two monostable speeds. So it's basically what you would expect. It's what you have in the classical framework without strong couplings. And here you expect to have the same thing. That's it for me. Thank you. And thank you again to the organizers. Thank you very much. Very nice talk. Are there any questions or comments? Any questions or comments? I had one question. Yes, please. Are there any examples or maybe even numerical computations where you start where the time evolution does not converge to a traveling wave, but something more like a spreading wave or What do you mean by spraying wave? Well, where it's not it's not a traveling wave, but where the so where the transition between one state and the other state does not happen on a bounded region. Okay. So as was shown in the previous talk, when you study the Cauchy problem in these strongly competitive systems, you typically assume that the initial conditions are already successful. The initial conditions are already segregated. And if you assume that the initial conditions are already segregated, then you might get, let's say, in short term, you might get some kind of mean curvature motion of the interface, but then if your initial condition is sufficiently, let's say, close to a traveling wave, then you will get a traveling wave. However, I did not perform. However, I did not perform any numerics. I can refer you to the Potspetrovsky paper, where they did actually a lot of numerics, and they, as far as I remember, there were not any surprises. It's always the traveling wave that appears in the long term. So then, but then your conjecture at the end that there might not always be a traveling. End that there might not always be a traveling wave. Okay, so, okay, very good point. Very good point. My conjecture is that traveling waves will exist, but monotonic traveling waves might not. It was shown in the previous talk that you typically get, let's say, bumps, and this is due to the lack of comparison principle. And here, you do not have any comparison principle. And this is something that is very startling for me because in the Malaguti Marceni matrix. The Malaguti, Marcini-Matucci paper, they managed actually to prove a comparison principle, but it's a kind of ODE comparison principle, and it's completely hopeless to try to get a comparison principle for the full system. So probably you will have some bumps in the waves, and so they won't be monotonic, and so the sketch of our proof does not apply. And there are more, many more technicalities. Okay, thank you. Are there other questions or comments? So in your proof, you assume that the existence of boundedness of the speed of the traveling wave. But when you have a limiting traveling wave, can you prove that the existence of a traveling wave for some boundary? For some bounded speed. Okay, so yeah, as I wrote here, from Malaguti Marshali Matucci's paper, we know that for the limiting problem, the speed is bounded indeed. So you expect that if you apply this homotopy method, then the waves you will obtain will have a bounded speed. The question is: what happens if when you are working on the system, sorry, when you Working on the system, sorry, when you are working on the system here, what happens if CK goes to plus or minus infinity? And I mean, obviously, I don't think it's possible, but if CK goes to plus or minus infinity, we have problems. Maybe, I mean, yeah. At first, I thought it was possible to prove directly that the speeds are bounded by some. Directly, that the speeds are bounded by some kind of contradiction argument, but we did not manage to prove it, so it's an open question. Okay, thank you. Are there other questions or comments? Okay, let's speak again. Thank you very much. So, today is the last of today's session. So, tomorrow we So, tomorrow we will have
