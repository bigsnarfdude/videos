An independent postdoctoral fellow, a resident sustainability fellow at Caltech. And he did his PhD with Richard Murray. There's a Richard Murray connection, strong Richard Murray connection here. And I'm looking forward to hearing his talk on reaction order analysis from Gill's Global Polyhedral Constraints on the Behavior of Biolecular Reaction Systems. Great, thank you. So, yeah, really excited to talk about this work today. So, yeah, I'm affiliated with the Resident Sustainability Institute. So, for my day job, we think about horizontal gene transfer. We think about morosal gene transfer and engineering soil microbiomes, but I'd like to talk today about a theoretical project that I worked on during my tuition. And, you know, the title is very long, but if you want to take away one thing, I like to have this idea. Can we go beyond Michaelis-Menton? Can we do holistic analysis of biomolecular reaction systems? And so this project is really a collaboration with two major people, my good friend Fong and Daniel Capoletti, who both started their own independent groups at various universities. Started their own independent groups at various universities recently. And although I'm the person standing here talking to you about it, this is really Feng's baby. He was the one who had the initial critical insights and really brought it through throughout all stages of the project. So I really want to give him credit where credit is due because it's really fun to stay here. So let's talk about how do we do analysis generally? So if you want to have a really simple reaction system, like an enzyme and substrate binds to form a complex, and you're Binds for the complex, and you're interested in knowing the steady-state concentration of the complex as a function of the enzyme and substrate, you know, you can get the exact solution. It looks kind of hairy, but you can plot it out, and you'll see that on the heat hat there. But we don't usually do this, right? Usually, we do something like the Michaelis-Menton approximation, where we get a much more tractable mathematical expression that we can actually analyze and do something with. However, you see that if you look at the solution of Michaelis-Menton across the entire state space, it's not a very good approximation. It's not a very good approximation in the top left corner, right? But this is why the Michaelis-Mentemoximeter comes with an explicit assumption that the enzyme concentration is less than the substantive concentration. And when you do make that assumption, you're essentially slicing away the relevant part of state space. And now the Michelis approximation looks really good. You know, if you just look at the lower right triangle and compare it to the exact solution, it's a very good approximation. So this is typically what we do as theorists thinking about biology. As theorists thinking about biology, and it's fine because when you're thinking about enzymes and substrates, usually it really is the case that the substrate is much larger than the enzyme. But what if we're not thinking about enzymes and substrates, right? What if instead of E and S, I call it A and B? The mathematics are still fundamentally the same, but now I'm thinking about a different type of biomolecular system. Maybe something like this, where we're using sequestration feedback to do some sort of interesting biological behavior. And I refer to this as a non-canonical system architecture. Canonical system architecture because the architecture of the system itself is fundamentally incompatible with classical approximation approaches like Kaylis-Menton or Gilfunction or things like that. And I think the symbiote of the future is moving in to designing in architectures that look like this. And so we need the mathematical theory to also catch up and allow the tractable analysis of these sorts of systems. Even if you're not interested in these types of fancy architectures, even if you're just thinking about like a single regulated gene, About, like, a single regulated gene, you know, if you take the cell outside of the nice, well-controlled laboratory context and put it into the environment, which is what I'm interested in. For example, if it goes into stationary phase, the physiological state of the cell is going to change dynamically. And you could definitely, you know, it's no longer guaranteed that your system, even though it's a standard system, is in that well-behamed canonical approximation regime. And so we need to be able to do holistic analysis over the entire state space of the system. The entire state space of the system in order to account for both of these use cases, which I think is the future of synthetic biology. So, if we need to do holistic analysis, why don't we just do the exact solution all the time? It looked messy, but we can probably work with it. But I'm going to convince you, it's really intractable to do at any scale. So, let's increase the complexity of the system just slightly. Add one more pair of binding reactions. You can still calculate the exact solution for how the complex C. Solution for how the complex TS varies as a function of total enzyme and total substrate. And it looks like this. And you know, it's not going to work. And this is just a super simple system, right? And in general, if you have r pairs of reversible binding reactions, to get the exact solution, you need to solve a degree r plus one polynomial. And so a closed-front solution isn't going to exist because polynomials don't have those over how they have. And even numerically solving this is really difficult, has exponential complexity. So this is not the way to go. But so, this is not the way to go. And so, you might say, okay, all of these problems seem to be coming because you're looking at total enzyme and total substrate. Why are you doing that? Maybe we should just not do that. But, you know, once again, I'm going to try and convince you that the totals really are the right way to think about biomolecular system dynamics. So consider this really simple system here that I showed you on the previous slide. Two binding reactions, where you have a catalysis reaction, where this CES complex goes irreversibly to a CES. Goes irreversibly to a CEP and then it unbinds to the enzyme on the product. Really standard enzyme kinetics kind of system. You can think about decomposing this system into two components. The binding network, which consists of just the reversible binding reactions, and the catalysis network, which is just all the catalysis reactions. And when you make the quasi-steady state assumption, which is a fundamental assumption related to the separation of time scales, we can take this to be generally true. Scales, we can take this to be generally true for biomolecular systems. What's really happening is that the binding network goes to equilibrium and it creates some value of the CES complex that you're interested in, catalytic species. And that complex goes and sets the flux of the catalysis reactions, which then update the totals, and the totals feed back into the binding network, cause it to re-equilibrate, generate a new value of CES, and you go through this loop. So bimolecular system behavior. Loop. So, biomolecular system behavior involves going through this loop of this two-layer architecture between the binding network and the catalysis network. And the way they talk to each other is really through the totals. So the totals are the thing that we need to understand. And when we do things like write r instead of r tote, for example, when we're doing things like the hill function, really we're making an explicit assumption about the system when we mean the r tote, but we say it can be approximated by the r. Now this frame. Now, this framing is really nice because it lets us understand that if we can understand the functional relationship between the catalytic species concentrations, you see us feeding downwards, and the totals, and of course the system parameters, the case. If we can understand this function f, we will understand everything holistically about the system. So this is what we want to know. The problem is, in the previous slide, I just showed you, it's impossible to calculate exactly for systems of even moderate complexity. For systems of even moderate complexity. So, how are we going to solve this problem? That was the question that initiated this project. And the approach that we're going to take is to instead of trying to go directly to this function, we're going to do another function that gives the useful information that would have been provided. And that is the reaction order. So if you go through this original simple one-binding system, the reaction order is simply the log derivative, as shown here, with respect to the totals and the dissociation constant, k. And the dissociation constant k. And you can calculate this out analytically for the system, and you get these nice rational function forms for the log derivative. And if you notice in particular, these first two entries, which are the log derivative, which is checked by the two totals, these are bounded. As E and S change arbitrarily, they will always be bounded between 0 and 1. In fact, the entire thing falls within this really nice triangle in reaction motor space. And just to emphasize, right, I can take literally Size, right? I can take literally any value of E, S, and C, the system space, as long as they're positive, and they're going to fall somewhere inside the triangle. So this is really promising because it suggests, okay, this reaction order polyhedra is a tractable way to represent the holistic behavior of the system. No Michaelis-Menton approximations here. We let anything happen and we can capture it in this triangle. Second point, reaction order is biologically meaningful. So let's push the system into a So let's push the system into a regime. Suppose we push it into the McKay-Lesment regime. So that corresponds to this top edge of the triangle here. And the arrow is showing increasing values of estote, as you see in the graph on the left. So the exact solution I show on the solid line, Kaylis-Menton, is this wavy transparent line, and the log derivative is the dashed line. And so you can see the log derivative is capturing the important insights in the transition of increasing pests. So it starts with the system being. With the system being sensitive to substrate concentration, which so the logarithm is near one. And then as it saturates out and becomes insensitive, the reaction order goes down to mirror zero. And so you can see it's capturing the system dynamics that we care about. Are we sensitive to the variable? Are we not sensitive to the variable? At the right locations in concentration space. And it can do this no matter where you are. So if you push instead to a different regime, so this is the tight binding regime, you can see the Michaelis-Metzen approximation is no longer. The Michaelis-Meton approximation is no longer a good approximation. But the reaction order is still capturing the important dynamical switch that's happening in the exact solution, going from linear sensitivity and then a sharp transition down to zero sensitivity. So our argument is, if you use the reaction order, you can understand all the key things you needed to know about the dynamics, and you don't have to make any assumptions about the space space. So this is potentially a very promising way to think about these systems. To think about these systems. So now you might ask: okay, is the reaction order hard to calculate? Like, you know, this is a really nice-looking functional form, but is that just because the system is so simple? And we have derived a procedure where you can calculate the reaction order really easily from just the system architecture. So to walk you through that, oh, sorry, this looks like crap. But if you specify, let's take a simple binding network. You might think of this as really simple gene regulation where you have a regulator binding through the substrate. Bind makes it complex. Substraight, makes a complex, and that complex binds to a chain to make a complex that then goes active. So, in that case, all you have to do is write down the stoichiometric matrix. Any chemical undergraduate can do this. Then you write down the conservation laws. Once again, any undergraduate can do this. And then you're done. You just plug those into this formula right here. And so this was derived as a function of the implicit function theorem, essentially. But basically, what you're doing, we're going to do, and apologies for the change in notation. We're using lowercase t subsubscript to represent total. T subsubscript to represent total now. All you have to do is just create this matrix where you diagonalize the vector of the totals and the vectors of the species concentrations, and then multiply them together by the conservation law, put it on top of stoichiometry, invert the whole thing, and you're done. You get exactly the reaction or a matrix that you need. So this just, you can always do this. The solution will always be closed form in principle. I know matrix inversion can be a little hairy, but at least computationally, it's a lot easier than a polynomial solution. It's a lot easier than a polynomial solution, which lets you do things like sample the entire state space really easily. So here's literally everything that can happen with all species ranging from 10 to the minus 6 to 10 to the 6 uniformly. And you can see this really beautiful polyhedral shape coming out for the reaction or how the active species, CGRS, changes with respect to total gene, total regulator, and total signal. Okay? And you can get this, and we're currently finalizing. Can get this, and we're currently finalizing a procedure where you can do even better, where you can directly get the vertices and edges analytically just from the system structure. So, not only can you do the sampling, you can also get the geometric skeleton of this polyhedron directly from the architecture. So, we're just finalizing final proofs to make sure it's true in general. For all the cases we've looked at, it's interesting. So, here, this procedure implies mass action, right? Yes, that's right. Yes, that's right. So all the binding net networks and things I'm thinking about in your seminar section. I I was curious, okay. I guess that in general, let's say if I have some sort of arbitrary network to one extent, it is stickable. I guess in theory that procedure can be applied as well as write down that equation as well. So the binding networks we assume as action because the binding is very explicitly tied to the physicality of the system. The physicality of the system. So, those are always going to be mass action. Catalysis networks can be whatever you want. So, all the stuff I showed you to calculate the reaction order polyhedra only depends on the binding network. You can put any catalysis system on top of that polyhedra, and that will correspond to different trajectories moving through the polyhedron. But because the polyhedron tells you everything that could possibly happen, you will never be outside of the polyhedron, regardless of what you do with different palaces. I guess let me raise that. I guess uh let me raise my question. I was guess that uh maybe I'm misunderstanding that, but the procedure appears to be applicable as long as you can write down the reaction kinetics. That's right. Because you can define only output you care about and taking the partial derivative with respect to the components. Yeah, in general, yeah, so in general the reaction order is a nice way of looking at things in general. But we have, our contribution here is to notice that if we explicitly look at mass action scale binding Explicitly look at mass action style binding networks looping in this way with a catalysis framework, then you get these really nice properties about geometric polyhedra that are constrained and things like that. But in general, I encourage the reaction order its use widely, even outside of this type of thing. The binding network could be all transcription factors binding to all possible transcription factor binding sites. That's right. It can also be ribosomes binding to all the message RNAs. That's right. And RNA polymerase binding to all the motors. Yes. So you have basically the So, you have basically a resource allocation network. Yes, yes, you can get as big as you want in principle with the binding network. And so, whatever resolution you want to be working with your models at, this framework is in principle compatible with it. Now, when you get to really, really high dimension, visualizing that polyhedron can be challenging, and I think that's one of the challenges of doing this. But certainly, the mathematics, there's nothing special about scaling them. Yeah, thanks for the questions. So, now that we've shown you how we Questions. So now that we've shown you how we can calculate this, it looks like I have maybe 10 more minutes, I'm just going to show you two case studies about the power of doing this. So first case study is the demand rule. So, you know, really classic problem in systems biology. If you have an inducible activator, where the activator gets activated by the substrate, or an inhibited repressor, they have the same steady-state logic, and that if you have low signal, you have low expression, high signal, high expression. And so Michael Savagello has a very classic answer for this, Michael DeMan. Classic answer for this fight with the man rule, which I'm sure many of us are familiar with. I won't belabor it. But the essential idea is that Michael Savajaw's argument rested on when the thing breaks, something bad happens, which is why you want to use a particular architecture. And we call this a negative selection explanation. It's not about like, oh, why would I choose one architecture over the other? Oh, it's because it has some unique property. No, it's because it doesn't do something that would be bad, right? And there have been many other. And there have been many augmentations to demand theory over time, right? But they're all into the same negative selection mindset. They operate on evolutionary time scales and they represent fitness effects associated with bad things happening. And one question we had is, is there any evidence for a positive selection argument for choosing one architecture or the other? Is it possible that, oh, it turns out the activator can just do something that the repressor cannot do to close them? And that's something that, to our knowledge, And that's something that, to our knowledge, hasn't been shown before. And so we created a really simple model of a single gene regulated by transcription in this way, just through this binding network here. And depending on which species you take to be the active species, you change what type of architecture you're modeling. So if your active species is the unbound gene, you're modeling a repressor. If it's GRS, you're modeling an RSC-style activator where you need the regulator explicitly bound. Need the regulator explicitly bound to the signal in order to turn on. For a binding modulated activator, you just need the regulator to be there, whether or not the signal is there. And we have just one more constraint that we need to add in, which is that, oops, sorry, we need to put a constraint on the case just to make sure that when we add signal, expression goes up. Otherwise, it can go in the opposite direction and it doesn't really make sense to think of it as a switch. So when you do this, you can then go and calculate out the reaction order polyhedra for everything. Order of polyhedra for everything. And you can see they look very different from each other. So this is the numerical sampling result, sampling the whole space of possibilities. And this is also the vertex edge solution that I hinted at before, giving you the skeleton of the polyhedron. And so you can see just right away that these three different architectures behave fundamentally different from each other. Just to highlight some insights, we can see first of all that the repressor is able to be ultra-sensitive to the signal. Ultra-sensitive to the signal. So this means that the reaction order response to the total signal can get infinitely large, whereas for the two activator architectures, they're strictly bounded at one. It's impossible for them to be ultrasensitive to the signal, while the repressor can do that. So that's an interesting thing. The activators, though, can do something unique. They are able to be in a regime where they are robust to the total gene concentration, the gene copy number, while being sensitive to the signal at the same time. And the repressor is important. And the repressor, it's impossible for it to do that. In fact, it can never be robust to the Gopi number. So, already we have a unique property of the repressor, a unique property of the activator, and the action-modulated activator specifically has a very interesting regime where its reaction-order response to the regulator can be negative, which means that the activator can act like a repressor in this particular regime. And so, that's quite interesting, and it's a little bit, you know, for ERS-C, that's actually. For ARS C, that's actually known to occur. We do know that when ARC binds to an open gene, it represses it a little bit more in the absence of a radical. So that was kind of an interesting coincidence there. Not sure if the mechanism is the same. So we can see all three architectures have unique functional properties that the others cannot access no matter where they are in state space. And this was really exciting. Demand rule has been around for at least 50 years. And so we asked, why had this not been noticed before? And if you go and make Before, and if you go and make Michaelis-Menthen-style assumptions, like we typically do when we do analysis, like we assume the signal is supposed to be free, right? We just write free signal instead of total signal. The regulator is mostly in its um not the DNA form because we assume there's not much DNA relative to the regulator. If you make these assumptions, this is what the polyhydra look like: they collapse down. And so all of that interesting functional behavior just disappears. And if you, you know, because the repression. And if you, you know, because the repressor is supposed to be repressing, if you take the absolute value of the reaction order to regulator, it just drives the point home that really they are indistinguishable from each other in these regimes. So it's because we did this holistic analysis that let us look outside of these canonical Michaelis-Menden-style regimes that we were able to see these unique behaviors that these super simple systems can exhibit. And so, one last case study. So, that everything I showed you was just happened to do with. Everything I showed you was just happening to do with the binding network, and it didn't really specify catalysis. But you can also specify catalysis and look at catalytic systems. So, we take the repressilator as an example. I'm sure we're all familiar with repressilator, three repressants that repress each other in a cycle. You can frame it in a binding catalysis network, where here we have the binding reaction showing a monomer regulator becoming a dimer regulator, and that dimer binding to the gene to form an inactive complex. And the free gene concentrations feed into the catalysis networks. Feed into the catalysis networks. When you make an mRNA, mRNA makes another total, R, and that feeds back in. Okay, so this is not using the Hill function. If there were the Hill function, then, like you see here, this term here would be replaced with this Hill-like term, but instead we're just assuming straight max action from the concentration of unbound gene at rate KTX. And so if you look at the entire polyhedron, the skeleton is shown in orange. This is everything that can happen. You see an ultrasound regime is here. An ultrasensitive condition is here, but if you make the Hill function assumption, you're restricted here. Okay, so you can't be ultrasensitive anymore, you just bounce it around. So, when we solve the system, in the Hill regime, you see classic repressed later oscillations. These are Hill-type oscillations, and you can see that it's just moving around along this line segment in reaction order space. And this is a different plot showing all three reaction orders for the three different species, and you can see it makes a nice little triangle where it does the line segment in each dimension. Where it does the line segment in each dimension. But what if now we move outside of the Hill function machine? Well, then we see actually a new type of oscillation, which we call ultrasensitive oscillations, where it's quite striking if you look on the reaction order graph, that it goes and loops around into the ultrasensitive space, comes back, and then loops back, and goes and bounces around like that. And if you look at the time course of the reaction orders, you can see it's very fast, the time that it spends in the ultrasensitive area. It just kind of spikes up. It just kind of spikes up in the transition periods associated with the peaks and the troughs. So that's really exciting because the repressilator has been around for almost a quarter century now, and this seems to be a new type of oscillation that it can do just because we pushed it into a different part of state space that is not captured by the Hill function. And just to drive the point home, we thought, okay, well, maybe this can challenge conventional dogma about the repressilator of these fundamental circuits. For example, right, it's standard. Example, right? It's standard knowledge that without cooperativity, you don't get oscillations in the repressment. You need to have n greater than 2. And people have done studies where they've shown non-cooperative oscillations. If you do things like have a DCas9-based rescillator or do fancy things with engineering the transcription factors, you can go into a tight binding machine where you can actually get oscillations. But that requires extra bows and basis on the system. And I know Eduardo Sontag has a paper where if you look at a particular stochastic regime, Where, if you look at a particular stochastic regime called slope-promoter kinetics, then you can get non-cooperative oscillation-like behavior. But fundamentally, in the deterministic simple repress later model, there's been no evidence that you can get cooperative oscillations without cooperativity. And so if we formulate our model again, removing the dimerization, so now it's just a monomer regulator binding to the gene, and we even got rid of the mRNA dynamics because we know those can help with oscillations to make a really bare-bones system. Really bare-bone system. And when we do that, we see oscillations. And so this is just three monomeric repressors repressing each other in a repressor later cycle, and you get oscillations in the absence of cooperativity. So this is really exciting because, you know, the textbooks say this shouldn't be possible. And it's true if you model the system as a Hill function. You can just know there's a single stable steady state, and that's it. But if you don't use the Hill function, push outside the regime and actually make this more informative. A regime and actually make this more informed by an analysis-based approach, you can see oscillatory behavior even in these regimes. So, we're really excited about this because it suggests that these decades-old systems are revealing exciting new insights just because we're looking outside of the conventional state space. And so, you know, if that's true for these simple systems, imagine what we will learn in more complex systems when we start taking this type of approach. So, just to summarize, you know, we have this binding catalysis framework that we have a two-layer architecture. That we have a two-layer architecture fundamental to biomolecular reaction systems, where the binding network regulates the catalysis network and that updates the binding. And if you use reaction order analysis, then you can tractively do holistic analysis for these binding analysis systems. And by doing so, we can get previously overlooked behaviors in just simple, easy, canonical systems. And so, what is next for this? You know, like you mentioned, if you have a really, really, really high-dimensional binding network, you can't make a plot. Dimensional binding network, you can't make a plot. And so, what do you do with that? I think that's a challenge that we're thinking about right now. And finally, you know, all of this so far we used it to gain insights into system behavior. But as synthetic biologists, we really want to use this as a design tool. So how can we use this to say, okay, I'm going to take this, design a circuit, and it's going to go into an environment where the conditions can change in ways that I do not know or can predict. Therefore, I need to understand the whole space. Can I do things like constrain down? Can I do things like constrain down the polyhedra so that regardless of what happens in state space, I'm still in the operating regime that I want to be? That would be a great future, I think, for doing design of synthetic biology. I think there's a promising path towards that through this reaction model analysis. So just to wrap up, so really need to thank our advisors. When we started this project, we were all trainees in various different groups, and we're really thankful to our advisors for letting us. Really thankful to our advisors for letting us pursue this project independently amongst ourselves. Particularly, I want to thank Gustavo for sponsoring Fung's visit to ETH so I can meet with Danielle and connect with him and start that process going. So we're working on wrapping up the preprint. All the results are done. We're just doing final typesetting and getting everything pretty. But if you're really excited about this and want an advanced copy, just email me. I'm happy to email you something. But expect to see something on BioRxive in the next couple weeks about this. So thank you very much for. So thank you very much for your time. Thanks, John, for a great talk. I think we'll keep moving forward, so I'm on a tight spot here a little bit behind spectrum. I couldn't hear. Is it possible to ask a question? Sure. So, a quick question. Yeah. And this refers to a beautiful talk. I think this relates to your second case study. Yeah. And I was wondering. Study. Yeah. And I was wondering if there's a way to use the reaction order polyhedron. And I think the answer is yes. To understand zero order ultrasound.
