And then another interest I have more broadly, but also with respect to accelerometry and other wearables type data, is trying to figure out what sort of summary measures matter and dimension reduction, how to do this across different populations, what's meaningful in terms of a health outcome. And so that's something I won't talk as much about in this talk, but that I'm really interested in in some varying contexts. In fact, I just found out today that we have this really cool study where we're trying to look at exposure. Cool study where we're trying to look at exposures and trying to figure out what happens in the house, and we're going to probably get to do a paired cat human study that I'm very excited about. Almost fell through because we couldn't measure cat BMI, but apparently that's been worked out thanks to our friends at North Carolina State. So anyway, I get distracted easily and I want to thank, before I start, my main collaborator in this has been Kelly Evanson at UNC. So everything I learned about this, I learned from Kelly. And if it seems like I learned it wrong, it's probably all me. Like, I learned it wrong, it's probably all me. So, but I have a lot of students who've worked on this and other collaborators on a couple of the projects. So, with that, what I decided to do is to kind of focus a little bit on how I got into this topic and how maybe the data are collected and what kind of options we have. And so, in the studies I've worked with, which are largely epidemiologic studies that Kelly and others have run, we've had two different types of physical activity data. We've had self-reported activity. We've had self-reported activity and objectively measured activity, and they're getting at slightly different things. I wanted to take a little bit of time to talk about them because it is sort of appealing to think about ways we can use one to learn more about the other and vice versa. And so, self-reported activity can come about in a variety of ways. It could have a time activity diary or a questionnaire you fill out that says, you know, okay, usually I do spin classes three days a week, etc. In addition, people are often asked to be in these diaries and in this. Often asked to be in these diaries and in the studies we have to estimate how long I did it. Okay, so my spin class was 45 minutes and what the perceived intensity of the class was. Okay, it was vigorous. And then also, however, we can estimate intensity based on objective measures from lab studies. So we could say, for example, a spin workout should be X intensity across all people. So you can ask me how hard I thought it was, and then there's also a compendium that'll let you know. And there's also a compendium that'll let you know for every activity you want to look up, typically how hard that should be. Okay, so we can get two sort of measures of intensity of the activity. Now, the problem with self-report is that it's hard to get people to tell us these things. Often the data are not very good quality. If my mom filled out a questionnaire, her two mile per hour walk on the treadmill, without a doubt, would be characterized as vigorous. Maybe it is for my mom, okay? A little more vigorous than it would be for me, for sure. Would be for me for sure. Even complete data can be hard to analyze. And so we had a study, the pregnancy, infection, and nutrition study, where we measured activity both objectively and also through a questionnaire. We were interested in multiple domains of activity. Household activity, child care activity, transportation activity. And what we saw when we added everything up is that often people were active more than 24 hours a day. So for example, some things are really hard to characterize. I spent all day doing laundry. Day doing laundry. Okay, my husband would make fun of me for saying that, but if you've ever done laundry all day, you know what I mean, right? It can take forever. The active time is not that great, but a woman on the questionnaire often would report, I spent eight hours doing laundry, okay? I spent 24 hours taking care of my kids, okay? So sometimes these measures are pretty hard to get. It's a little hard to understand, well, what's active time where I'm actually playing basketball with my kids outside versus, you know, I'm just here making sure, you know, nothing. Here, making sure nothing traumatic happens. So, the self-report can be subject to a variety of errors and just complications in how to record the data and interpret it. Whoops, this might go back. Now, we're here to talk about measures from devices. And so here's an accelerometer. This was the configuration that was used in the studies that I'll talk about today. The accelerometer I'll talk about records acceleration on three axes, so vertical, anterior, posterior, and medial-lateral. Posterior and medial lateral every 15 seconds. Okay, and so these can be set to get recordings of different frequencies. And then typically, what people do is convert these three accelerations to a single number. Okay, so for example, in this study, they used the sum of squares, the square root of that. And then often in epidemiologic studies, the counts are further processed to get some sort of compositional data, often over a period of a week or a day. Week or a day. So, what percentage of your time are you spending in sedentary activities? What percentage of the time in moderate activity? And this is based on lab-based calibration studies in general. One other thing to think about when we're looking at physical activity data, and these are really important for missing data, or bouts. So bouts are important, right? So if we think about my vigorous activity, it's probably all coming from my spin class, okay? Maybe running for the bus if I was late. But so about often this has something. So about often has some definition, something like 10 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous activity. Maybe you could have one interruption of a minute or two in there, but that would be a typical definition of about in a study. And so that would be how I'm getting most of my vigorous activity, okay, in bouts, not necessarily with on-the-job activity or things like that. All right, one day I'm going to learn at the bottom button. So here's a typical daily count tracing. This was not a study I was involved with, but This was not a study I was involved with, but it's pretty cool because it gives you an idea of what the data look like. In this study, they were matched. The participants were matched to a camera. Did anybody work on this study? Didn't think to look at the full author list. All right. And so you can see these are these counts coming off the accelerometer. And you can see in the morning we had a big spike. And if you look at the camera, the participant was playing tennis. Okay. Later in the day, it's a little hard to tell what was going on. It was this non-where time. It turns out the person was driving through. Turns out the person was driving during that time. So, a pretty cool study, and gives you an idea sometimes of what these tracings look like and then how hard it can be to analyze them. One thing that we had, an issue we had in one of the studies, was very difficult for us to tell if the monitor was being worn or not in certain populations. So, now here's the issue with objectively measured activity. You know, the accelerometer, while it's not hideously ugly, is not always convenient. Okay, so even though a participant might be told to wear it during all Participant might be told to wear it during all waking hours, often except when they're bathing or showering or swimming. Though some accelerometers now are waterproof or water resistance, compliance is an issue. So people often don't put it on first thing when they wake up, if they're having their coffee or their orange juice. They generally don't wear it while they're swimming. If you haven't seen either of these movies, I highly recommend them. And so there's often an algorithm used to determine whether somebody's wearing a device. And one common definition. And one common definition would be 90 minutes with no acceleration measures. And you could have, you know, some non-zero data if the time period before and the time period after also show no acceleration. So again, maybe you moved it, you know, over here or something that otherwise weren't wearing it. Again, this is, you know, different studies vary a little bit in how they define this. So this is how this was done. More non-compliers, just to tell you, it's not always pretty to wear something on your belt, although it looks like Tiffany might be. Although it looks like Tiffany might be, you know, striking out on her own and she could have one on the other side. And often in studies, people are told to wear these when they're sleeping, but it's not necessarily the most comfortable thing if you roll over and you land on a square device. So compliance is definitely an issue with these. So just to give you an example of what we saw in our pregnancy infection nutrition study, pregnant women were asked to wear the accelerometer except when they were sleeping, bathing, or swimming for a whole week. Okay? For a whole week. Okay? Now, the average wear time in the study was under 13 hours a day. So I'm pretty confident that for those other, you know, slightly over 11 hours, they weren't all spent in sleep or despite how wonderful it is to be in a swimming pool when you're pregnant, probably people weren't swimming quite that long. Okay, so we did have some compliance issues. If you look at the graph on the right, and there's a similar graph in a paper, a recent paper that Paper, recent paper that John was working on. If we, the dark line corresponds to weekdays, and the horizontal line is 70% of women wearing the accelerometer. Okay, so basically between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. weekdays, we had 70% of the women wearing an accelerometer at any one time. It doesn't mean that 70% of the women in this study wore it continuously from 9 to 9. It was just at any of those times, we had 70% wearing it. We had 70% wearing it, and it was less on the weekend. That's the light line that you can't see here. 10:45 to 9 p.m., basically. 70% of the women were wearing the accelerometer. So you can see, you know, it takes a while to get up, to remember to put it on, and they were terribly compliant in the study. The other study we have worked on is in addition to the Women's Health Initiative study. This is an older population, okay, and the women were told to wear the accelerometer also when they were sleeping. Also, when they were sleeping. So, the only times they weren't to be wearing it was when they were bathing or when they were swimming. But the vast majority of women did have some non-wear time over and above what you would expect for being in the pool or taking the bath. The median was 12.6% of the seven-day period in non-wear time. And very few days were completely missing. So, in general, the women were wearing the accelerometers most days. I will tell you, in this population, and a lot of the analyses. And a lot of the analyses, age was dichotomized, and age was dichotomized at 80. So, this is an elderly population, and at times it was very difficult to determine whether a woman was just sitting still or if she did not have the accelerometer on. So, that was a challenge, a particular challenge in the study. So I'm going to talk a little bit about some standard ways, and maybe they're not so standard. People handle wear time. And so, one concept is to figure out if a woman is or a participant is. A woman is or a participant is adherent or not. Okay, and so with Kelly, oftentimes I'm working on studies where people are told to wear the accelerometer for a week. And what she likes to characterize as adherent is if you're wearing the accelerometer at least 10 hours on at least four days. Okay, so one definition of a complete case analysis would be to take only the day, the adherent days from adherent participants. So you had to wear it 10 hours on at least four days. Wear it 10 hours on at least four days to even get into the sample, the complete case sample. And then they took the adherent days. Often, what happens in that case is there's some sort of adjustment for wear time that's carried out. So you might adjust for wear time in a model or you might scale the data so that you're scaling everybody to a 10-hour day. Okay, so there are different ways people handle the different amounts of time the accelerometers worn. Now, obviously, this is problematic. It assumes adherent and non-adherent participants in days are comparable. Non-apparent participants in days are comparable. We know the monophys not being worn when people are swimming, for example. So we're sort of sometimes hoping there's not a lot of swimming going on, depending on the population. The other common thing I've seen a lot is available case analysis where all the observed data are used and just the day is scaled to 10 hour days or to 24 hour days, okay, appropriately. That can be really challenging, especially when we're thinking about nights and people have to do some sort of ad hoc fix-ups there. Bad hot fix-ups there. And again, it makes strong assumptions about what the activity would have been during a non-wear time. So we started thinking about in our studies ways to do imputation. And someone who had worked on the study before me, Diane Catellier, had done some work using EM algorithms to impute data. Challenges include thinking about the scale on which we're doing the imputation. So oftentimes, especially for students working on this data for their dissertation, they're already getting summary data. So they're maybe already getting average minutes of seven. Already getting average minutes of sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous activity. And so, if they go and try to impute the data, they might do so, ignoring the fact that these are compositional data. So, if I'm not in vigorous, moderate, or light activity, then I must be sedentary. So, the imputations could not be consistent with the fact that the data are compositional. Sometimes, when people do imputation based on these summary measures, things don't add up. For example, vigorous bowels. Things don't add up, for example, vigorous bouts and vigorous minutes of activity might be inconsistent. So it'd be nice to have an imputation method so that all these derived variables are consistently defined. If we look at the data on the original scale, the data are really high-dimensional, okay? So we're getting three accelerations every 15 seconds for a week, and so that can be challenging for people to deal with as well. At either level, though, at least in the populations I've studied, the data are very highly skewed. The data are zero inflated. We have a lot of sedentary. Zero inflated, we have a lot of sedentary time, and there's not necessarily an obvious mapping of these data to some well-known parametric distribution. Okay, so that makes things challenging. The good and the bad news in this study, or these studies, is we have data that are correlated with individuals. We've got seven days of data, and we do want to preserve belts in our analysis. So, other challenges to imputation, we need to think about incorporating covariates that may tell us something about the missing data, the time. About the missing data, the time of day. So, if the data are missing at 2 a.m., I might be able to make some pretty good assumptions about the activity level. There are other characteristics of importance, age, body mass index in the WHI study, physical functioning level, activity levels prior to and after, the missing data interval, and then potentially the availability of self-reported data. So, could we figure out, for example, the monitor was off because she was swimming? Okay, something like this. Okay, something like this. Now, we also have in our Penn study, we had the self-reported data about general levels of activity, but they didn't map all that strongly to the objective measurements. So, if we looked at self-reported intensity, so I walked, you know, I did my 45-minute spin class and it was really vigorous. Okay, does that mean I'm almost done or I'm done? Okay, I'll keep going. So if we looked at what I said, how hard. So if we looked at what I said, how hard I thought it was, okay, the spearman correlations were really low, so negative to 0.25 or so. If we looked at compendium values, so this is how hard a spinning workout should be, our correlations with the accelerometer are a little bit higher, which makes a lot of sense, right? Because the accelerometer is kind of sort of telling us what is also an objective measure. So we were in a resource-limited setting. How did we handle our missing data? We had a couple things we Data. We had a couple things we wanted to think about. We wanted to be able to impute raw data. We wanted to be able to take into account data from our own individuals, so using self-data as opposed to data from somebody else. But the data were so missing. We had so much missings that we couldn't only rely on data from that individual to do the imputation. We wanted to preserve bouts, and we couldn't even begin to think very well about a model that would fit the data. So what we did is we used, oops, sorry, can you see my new obsession? Oops, sorry, now you see my new obsession. Hot deck imputation. So, hot deck imputation was nice in that we could do it on whatever scale we wanted to do it. We could prioritize amputation from a self-donor as opposed to another donor. We can impute bouts of any duration we wanted. And I don't have to come up with a model for something that has a really complicated distribution. If you haven't gotten sucked into this game, has anybody played this game? Oh, wingspan. Wingspan. So if you I get somebody gave it to me for Christmas and said that she gave it to me because she heard her friends had this huge argument playing it and she knew we were competitive, so she wanted to see if we survived. And it was a close thing actually the first time we played this game. But anyway, it's a bird-oriented card game and hot deck imputation is basically let's think that we have missing data on the herring gull, which of course is one of the best birds around. And here are some other water birds. I would like to impute data for my missing herring gull. Impute data from my missing herring gull using similar birds, maybe the Franklin's gull or the ring-billed gull prioritized over less similar birds. And that's all hot deck imputation does. I create a donor pool of people like the pool who have missing data, and then I'm going to randomly sample from that donor pool to fill in the missing time periods. So I'm using actual observed data from someone else to plug in for the data from 6 a.m. to 6.45 a.m. on me that we're missing. Some of those donors will be me on other days. Those donors will be me on other days of the week, and some of those donors will be other people like me. And so, part of the challenge is defining what's like me. And so, in this study, it was things like age and physical function. So, we did a little simulation study where we took compliers from our study and generated data that were missing at random mimicking patterns in the study. We looked at bias and coverage in an association measure between a one-hour a day increase in physical activity and good cholesterol. Activity and good cholesterol. Okay, so good cholesterol is something that should be responsive to physical activity. And so we used hot decimputation here. And the scale is on, this is the log scale, so that's why these numbers are so small. So you can see the association in the compliers, okay, which we're calling true complete data. So you can see an hour a day increase in sedentary time did bad things to my HDL, okay. And if we look down at the bottom, And if we look down at the bottom, if an hour-a-day increase in moderate to vigorous physical activity was associated with good things with respect to my HDL. And the dotted line here is just if I look at a daytime wear time, and the dashed line is what happens when I look at 24-hour day wear time, okay, which are going to be different because an increase of an hour is a different scale, essentially, on both of those. So when we did that, we saw that amputation worked better than That imputation worked better than some of the other standard measures, but particularly with respect, of course, to confidence interval width. Okay, which is sort of what we might expect. So a few things that I'm really interested in with respect to the missing data problem, we had a hard time figuring out what the optimal weighting would be. We didn't really get into that in terms of dealing with sparse observations from me. So maybe I had only four compliant days, and I don't want to impute. Days and I don't want to impute, you know, in a multiple imputation the same day every single time. So, when should I rely on me versus what kind of weight should I give to people like me? How do I characterize uncertainty better? Modeling approaches, preserving bouts were important. This allowed us to do that, but sometimes we couldn't, if I had a whole day of missing data, I might not have another day from me that had 100% complete data. So, how I handled that, and we just imputed in sort of lots of time. Imputed in sort of lots of time to try to handle that. How we handle non-ignorable missing data, we know the women were taking off the monitors to swim. Okay, but other settings, maybe she's going dancing, something like that, doesn't want to have that bothering her. And then the other thing we're thinking about is how easy this is to use for grad students in epidemiology and others. So those are things that are interesting to me on the missing data side of things. And then also, as I said previously, I'm really interested in. I'm really interested in dimension reduction in general and equivalence of classes with respect to outcomes. So, for example, maybe two people have the same level of activity. One of them is a weekend warrior and doing everything on Saturday and Sunday, and the other one's doing a little bit every single morning. You know, how we summarize activity across women with respect to what's equivalent for health. So, with that, I think I've gone over some stuff. I'm happy to take questions now or at the break. I mean, quick question. What about the people who are in between the weekend words and the daily routine, which would be the people who like exercise one day, rest the next day? Do you take that periodicity into consideration as you're looking at days, or was it not really an issue? We presume that sometimes, but maybe it's not really an issue. Yeah, so in this, so I haven't, so this is something that I'm looking at actually in a different context with respect to, for example, Ray and I talked about. For example, Ray and I talked about this diet exposures and things like that. So I haven't gone into a lot of detail looking at that with physical activity data, but it's something I'm really interested, I mean, personally, really interested in, right? Should I really be taking off or should I just push myself? You know, the recommendations are fairly vague in terms, you know, they don't really address that too much. I don't know what your thoughts are. Well, I mean, and actually we could talk more about ballots since ballots are now no longer a thing. No longer a thing. And for those who don't know, the physical activity guidelines that were just re-updated, removed about criterion in the recommendations. So it has huge implications for measurement. And really, I'd say the shift is more toward total volume, which would suggest warrior routine, as long as the volume is equivalent, they're pretty similar. So that's kind of. Let's see here. One thing I worry about, I guess, is also, and this isn't a question, it's just a comment, is the validity of estimates of, say, total activity or med hours per week or minutes and vigorous activity from these methods. And so this is a plea that these are very interesting statistical issues, but also that we make sure that we don't ignore validity. We don't ignore validity. Yeah, and in fact, in the one big thing I swept totally under the rug for the WHI study was that they re-estimate, you know, they recalculated, basically did their own compendium for activity levels to get the med equivalence in the older, or not the med equivalence, but to get what's vigorous, what's moderate in these older adults. And that was a big part of the NIH funding that went into that study. I was just trying to come up with that. Yeah, no, that's interesting. And I wonder, like, how much measurement, if you haven't, if you say that somebody spent an hour in MPPA, what's the measurement? MVPA, what's the measurement error around that estimate? And I don't think we know the answer to that question. I remember I was in Boston, I gave a talk about axometry, and somebody came to me and said, well, we need a clinical trial. We used axometers, and we realized that the data was unusable because of missing data. I think you are touching probably on one of the most important things in activity. And a lot of our methods are based on no missing. And a lot of our methods are based on no missing data. It may be a good idea for a group to get together to think about what are the issues, what types of missingness do you see in accelerometry? Because there are different types of missingness that could occur. And some are due to device, some are due to. And when would we think it would be a good idea to impute? And when should we start? And when should we stand off and just say, you know what, this is just not high quality enough for us to touch? Which goes more toward, because we don't know. I mean, I don't know right now what to do. With the NHANES data, for example, it's more clear because a lot, thousands of people worked on it, and there is more. But in general, for a new study, I don't think that if you have an investigator who looks at the data, I don't think that they know. Investigator who looks at the data, I don't think they know whether or not the data are high quality. Yeah, I think the other thing that worries me sometimes with these studies is like effects of the wear time in the first day. So I went to APHA and brought my son one year and he went through the expo and collected as like I had to stop him from the bling. But one of the things he collected was a pedometer. And the first day he was so good and he wanted to walk everywhere and he wanted to walk all around Boston and get in lots of steps. And it was really striking how. And it was really striking how the impression it had on him. And then the second day I look at him.
