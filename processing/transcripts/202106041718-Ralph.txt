Five minutes talk plus five minutes question. Yeah. Okay, thank you, Thomas. I hope everyone can see my screen. And thank you. Thank you to the organizers. This has been a really nice workshop. And this two-time thing, I haven't been able to go to the evening ones, but the morning ones have all been really interesting. Have all been really interesting. So I'm going to talk about weak values, Bohmian trajectories, and relativity. So some of you will have heard an earlier version of this talk, but I'll just sort of encourage you by saying that the end has changed and is much more interesting now. So if we restrict ourselves to one universe, there's only really two interpretations. There's only really two interpretations where particles can be said to have real trajectories: that's transactional and Bohmian. And they have their devotees. But recently, there's been more interest in the Bohmian interpretation because of the fact that it's been realized that the Bohmian trajectories can be measured, in a sense, using a technique involving weak measurements. Involving weak measurements. So, this was done in the non-relativistic regime, and we are interested in what happens if you apply this to relativistic particles. So, here's my overview. I'll talk about briefly about the Bohmian interpretation and then about weak value measurements and how this enables you to define a weak value velocity. And then I'll go on to talk about how we applied this in the quantum optics formalism. And that's basically where previous talks have got to and what went wrong there. But now we've fixed it. And the final part of the talk will talk about a relativistic definition of the velocity, which then can be applied to photon trajectories. Okay, so. Okay, so the Bohmian interpretation is basically just rewriting the Schrodinger equation in such a way that you can identify a quantum potential which guides, which can be thought of as guiding real particles along particular trajectories. And the interpretation then is that the density of the trajectories Of the trajectories gives you the probability that you would extract from psi squared. And what's more, you can define the velocity of the particles at any particular point. So this is what I'll refer to as the Bohmian velocity. So this was introduced in 1952. And like I say, there's various devotees of it, but there's a bit more interest. There's a bit more interest lately because of this idea of using weak values to measure these trajectories. So let me talk a little bit about weak values and how they apply. So a weak value is where you consider making many weak measurements on an ensemble of identical systems prepared in some state psi i. State psi i, but then you post-select on finding those particles in some final state psi f. And then the weak value, well, the average of those measurements is the weak value. And mathematically, it's given here. So, for example, you could prepare some arbitrary state psi i and then measure momentum. Measure momentum. So then A here would be momentum. And then post-select on a particular position. So a position, psi F would be a well-localized position. So then you would determine the average value of momentum for these particles found at a particular position. So in 2007, Howard Wiseman Howard Wiseman pointed out that you could define a weak value velocity in this way. And so, this is the definition he used. But basically, it's what I said before. You're finding the momentum at a particular position by doing this average over many weak measurements. And then the amazing thing that he observed was that the weak velocity. That the weak velocity corresponded to the Bohmian velocity. So, if we naively, this is his words, interpret the resulting weak velocity field as the velocity field of particles following deterministic paths, then what we obtain is the Bohmian trajectories of the particles. So, this was done for slowly moving. Slowly moving massive particles in Howard's paper. But then it was applied in quantum optics to measure the transverse trajectories of photons. So this experiment, which was done in Ephraim Steinberg's group in Toronto, they launched single photons, split them into two paths. Into two paths and then using fiber, and then they come out of the fiber and they diffract as they propagate. And what we're looking at is how they diffract over each other and plotting the trajectories in that way. So they had some nice tricks for doing the weak measurement, which I won't go into. But the outcome were pictures like were pictures like this. So we see that they get these trajectories and what happens is that the trajectories bend and avoid the nulls and bunch up at the nodes. And so we interpret the reason we're more likely to find a photon here, say, is because Because the trajectories bunch up there, whilst we don't find it where they don't bunch. So I'm going to be plotting things as on space-time diagrams. So the equivalent here looks like this. So this is the thing to be comparing with. Okay, so as I said, Howard's theory was about massive slow-moving particles, but the experiment was in... But the experiment was in quantum optics. So we wanted to make this connection a bit more rigorous. So we want to set up Howard's system, or rather set up a quantum optical system and then apply Howard's rule to it and see what happens. So this is the model we came up with. So, here we're basically considering a photon described by a wave function like this. So, there's just a single photon. And by picking the relative sizes of the Kz component of the wave number or the Kx, we could change directions. So, in particular, if we pick Kz. So in particular, if we pick Kz big, then we have a continuous wave field with a Gaussian transverse mode. On the other hand, if we pick Kx large, then it's propagating predominantly in the X direction, and now it's a plane wave Gaussian pulse. And we can And we can, just by adjusting the size of K, Z, and K, we can go for an in-between mode as well. Okay, so now we want to look at the position in the X direction. So we introduce a detector here. And this detector doesn't care which direction the photons are coming from. It just clicks if they arrive at a particular position. If they arrive at a particular position. So that allows us to consider superpositions in which the photon can be in a superposition of coming from either direction. So we're going to work in the quantum optics approximation. So that's where the average frequency is much larger than the variance in the frequency. Frequency. And that allows us to define approximate position states and, therefore, position operators in this way. Then we can consider the evolution of the state as well, and then that allows us to model weak measurements at a particular transverse position. Particular transverse position, x position, and a particular time. Okay, so then this is Howard's formula. So applying that to this quantum optics model, we get a result like this for the weak value velocity. So we're going to work like in the experiment, basically the Basically, they were measuring the transverse velocity, and that's just as the beams diffracted. So, there was a very small transverse, small velocity in the x direction, most of the velocity is in the z direction. So, we can make this approximation here, which is basically the paraxial approximation. So, in this paraxial limit, we get pictures like this. So, here So, here we just see a single beam and we see it diffracting. Then, we can consider a superposition. So, here the photon is the probability of the photon coming from the left is higher than the right. Here they're equal. And here, it's more probable the photon is coming from. Sorry, I got that around the wrong way. From the right now. So, what you see similar to the experiment, you get these bunching of the trajectories where the colouring behind is telling you what quantum mechanics predicts for the probabilities. And you see that it corresponds. The trajectories bunch up in the nodes and they spread out in the nulls or the anti-nodes. Or the anti-nodes. Okay, so it works. Very nice. So then what we wanted to do is: okay, we've got this quantum optical model. So now let's consider a head-on collision between photons. So now we're making the Kx much larger than Kz and it doesn't work. So this is where we're up to in the So, this is where we're up to in the previously. And you can understand why it doesn't work because, as I said, we were making a mapping in the experiment between this massive particle theory of Howard Wiseman's, where the particles were moving at non-relativistic velocities. And you can see the propraxial limit of the photons as they slowly move into each other. Move into each other is equivalent to a one plus one massive theory where we can identify this is the rest mass and this is the kinetic energy. So this is the non-relativistic limit of the energy. And under these conditions, the continuity equation is satisfied. And this is the thing that guarantees that the density of trajectories corresponds to the probability of finding. Corresponds to the probability of finding the particle. However, when we tip our beam over, we are now moving into the relativistic limit. So we're now effectively modeling particles traveling at relativistic speeds, super relativistic speeds. And under those conditions, it turns out that continuity is no longer satisfied. So the theory doesn't work. So how to go? So, how to go beyond this? So, the problem is that Howard's definition of the weak value velocity is not relativistically invariant. So, we need to find something that is. So, we considered this situation. So, considered defining our velocity as the momentum divided by the energy. So, in the non-relativistic case, So, in the non-relativistic case, basically what Howard's equation was doing was just looking at the momentum, the non-relativistic momentum for a fixed energy, basically the rest mass. But if you want to go to the relativistic situation, then you have to bring in the relativistic momentum and the relativistic definition of energy. And then from this, you still extract. And then from this, you still extract the velocity. So, that this suggests what we should do is define our weak value velocity as weak value measurement of momentum divided by a weak value measurement of energy, all done at the same space-time point. And then that will extract, oops, that'll extract the velocity at that point. At that point. So I've written it as k here because we're thinking about quantum optics. So this is the k vector in the direction we're interested in, in the x direction, and then the energy. And so these are the definitions. Okay, so this seems like a nice candidate. So let's see what happens if we do that. So you can show that, given this definition, that the Definition that the velocity can be written out in terms of the wave function in this weird-looking form here. But what you find is that that actually corresponds to the Klein-Gordon current divided by the Klein-Gordon density. And this is very nice. First of all, rho and J form the time and Form the time and space components of a four vector. So they're going to transform in the right relativistic way. What's more, rho and j obey this condition here. And if you then notice that j equals rho v, then putting it in here is you obtain the continuity equation. And so you find that continuity. Find that continuity is guaranteed to be obeyed for all velocities, so relativistic or non-relativistic. Okay, so that looks very nice. So what sort of trajectories do you get if you do this? Well, first of all, let's make sure that the paraxial limit still works. So you can show analytically that this new equation reduces to the paraxial one in the correct. To the paraxial one in the correct limit. You can also plot trajectories where you make the kz component much larger than the kx one, and you get the same trajectories. Okay, but now what we're interested in is going to this ultra-relativistic scenario. So you can think of this as where we split up a single photon and send it in different directions and then have a head-on climate. And then have a head-on collision. And so, in the interference region, you're going to see standing waves. That's what you're expecting. And this is what you get. So you see that indeed, again, the trajectories bunch in the right way, such that they're bunched in regions of high probability, given by the colouring behind the trajectories. Behind the trajectories, and they avoid the regions where there's a low probability of finding the photons. But because it looks kind of weird, we see that all of the photon trajectories at some point come to a halt and then turn around and head back in the opposite direction. We also see that there are regions. Also, see that there are regions in which the photons travel faster than the speed of light. So they travel both faster and slower than the speed of light along these trajectories. Nevertheless, as I said, rho and j form a four vector. So therefore, if your Lorentz boost the trajectories, then they transform. Then they transform in this way, and it's easy to show that that implies that the new velocity field obeys the Lorentz velocity addition law under this transformation. So they're very weird trajectories, but they obey relativity. So now it's been It's been, I mean, I guess it's been known for a long time, back to Bohm, I guess, that if you if you, well, okay. So the trajectories can't cross if you have an interference region like this. And so it was obvious right from the start that if you were considering photons and the photons You were considering photons, then the photons would have to come to a halt at some point. And that seems to have been one of the deciding issues for Bohm, deciding that you shouldn't apply this to photons, because how can a photon stop? But if you think from a relativistic point of view, it's not so surprising that photons can stop. If we just look at our definition here again. Here again, have five minutes by the way. Okay. What P on E is giving us here is actually the coordinate velocity of the particles. So if we're in the lab frame, then that corresponds to the velocity of the particles in the lab frame. But if we are in a relativistic metric, a general relativistic metric, then this would give the coordinate velocity. Then this would give the coordinate velocity of the photons. And we know that in general relativity, the coordinate velocity of the photons can indeed stop. Think of photons propagating very near the horizon of a black hole as described by the Schwarzschild coordinates. Or even if you use rain coordinates, then you will get that the velocity. You will get that the velocity, the coordinate velocity, is greater than c as it goes through the horizon inside the black hole. So, there is this generalization in if you're thinking about general relativistic metrics, then it is possible for the particles for photons to stop or move at superluminal velocities. So, So we can describe what's going on using a metric. So consider the Alka-Bieri metric. So that looks like this in one plus one. And it's got this velocity here, Vs, which depends on position. So So, Alcabieri used it to show that you could have superluminal travel by making Vs greater than one. But here, but you can also, if you make Vs equal to one and use the minus sign there, then you can get your photons to stop as well. So basically, you can tune the velocity of your photons in this metric by In this metric, by how you choose this Vs here. So if you choose Vs in this way as a function of J on rho, then you find the velocity in this metric will be given by J on rho. And so the particles, so we can describe how the particles move in the interference region by assuming. By assuming that they are moving in this metric. And of course, it's general relativity, and so Lorenz boosts will behave in the way we saw that these things do. So we think this is kind of intriguing. Okay, so I think I'm just about out of time. So I will conclude now. So, firstly, I've shown you. Firstly, I've shown you that there's an operational definition of the Bohmian trajectories, which works for single photon quantum optics and indeed for massive particles right up to the super relativistic limit. I've shown you that there's an intriguing interpretation in terms of a Bohmian metric. So basically, in the non-relative... Basically, in the non-relativistic case, we have a Bohmian potential. And so, what we're arguing here is that, well, that generalizes to a Bohmian metric. So, but there's lots of open questions. First of all, I've just been talking about the behavior of a single particle. So, an interesting question is: what happens if we consider multiple particles? I also emphasize that we are working. Also, emphasize that we are working in the quantum optics approximation. So, when we talk about quantum field theory, you know, and Unruh effect and Hawking radiation and things like that, we are explicitly going outside the quantum optics approximation. So, it would be interesting to see what happens there. So, I'll just finish by acknowledging the other people who've worked on this project. So, the lead. On this project. So, the lead author is Joshua Fu, who's a PhD student at UQ. Earlier work was done on this project by Estelle Asmodel, who was a previous PhD student. And there's been strong input from Austin Lund, who is my colleague at UQ. And so I will finish there and say thanks and see if there's any questions. See if there's any questions. Great, thank you. Yeah, if we could all thank Timothy. Okay, yeah, as there aren't any raised hands yet, I'll take the opportunity to ask one of my questions. So I don't know a huge amount about bone mechanics, but under the impression that it wasn't consistent with special relativity. And here you've kind of presented the version which does seem to be. So I'm wondering: yeah, is it true then? Yeah, is it true then that Bohmian mechanics is not consistent with like kind of a special relativity, or am I mistaken here? Well, that's the so the standard form of Bohmian mechanics is the one I presented as being equivalent to Howard Wiseman's weak value velocity. So the trajectory is there. So basically the problem is that you need a quadratic. A quadratic Hamiltonian, which works in the paraxial approximation, but when you go beyond that, it doesn't work. So we believe what we're showing here is how to generalize to relativistic particles that do obey special relativity. And so I'm just a quick follow-up. And so you think this will generalize to multiple particles then, not just a single particle? Well, we hope so. Thanks. I mean, we haven't done it, so we don't know what's going to happen. Okay, thanks. Yeah, I mean, there has been, so the weak, so the non-relativistic case has been applied to a bell pair and you get very interesting things happening there. So, that would be probably out the first thing we would do would be look at the relativistic limit of. At the relativistic limit of entangled particles, a pair of entangled particles. Okay, thanks. Yeah, so we have some questions. So, yeah, Alex, if you're going to go through it. Tim, thanks for that talk. I'm looking forward to your answer to the first question in the discussion session. But I did have, I had a question. So, as I understand the Bohmian mechanics, in the non-relativistic regime, the predictions are the same as the standard for. Predictions are the same as the standard formulation, but I'm wondering when, in your generalization to the relativistic case, did you have any choices that you could make that like might give you like alternative foil theories that you could like rule out if you were to measure these trajectories and like see them? I guess that's kind of the question. Yeah, we haven't looked at that yet. I mean, that's an interesting thing. An interesting thing. Well, okay, so we tried, maybe I can put it this way: we tried a few, a number of things, and basically, the litmus test is continuity satisfied. Otherwise, your trajectories are not mapping onto the standard predictions of quantum mechanics. And so, yeah, that was what. Yeah, that was what ruled out other possibilities we tried. So that was really okay, cool. Thank you. Plus, we wanted it to be relativistically invariant. Yeah, so yeah, we have time for definitely for one more question. So, Lucien, if you want to go for it. Hi, I enjoyed that. A long time ago, I spent a lot of time studying the Diproid Bohm model, and I haven't. The De Broy Bohm model, and I haven't, but I haven't looked at it in recent years. So I seem to remember you can derive that formula for the velocity that you showed, the guidance equation, if you assume that the velocity is a single-valued function of position. You assume you get the continuity equation, and you assume some natural sort of Natural sort of symmetry properties. So, in one dimension, for example, you want to be sure that the flux is not whooshing from the left to the right. It's somehow, that there's, you know, you could always add on some term that makes the particles whoosh from the left to the right to a greater extent than they need to. So, there's some sort of Galilean variance or maybe. Like Galilean invariance, or maybe Lorentz invariance properties. So then, in the case where you use the weak value instead, it looks like from the way it's defined, it is necessarily a single-valued function of the position. Is that right? Yes, because basically I mean Basically, I mean, you can think of measuring it in an experiment, at least in under certain just functionally, it is a single-valued position. Yes. Yes. Because, like, in Newtonian physics, for example, the velocity is not a single-valued function of position because it depends on, you know, the velocity of a certain position depends on the initial velocity as well. So it depends on other things. So that's kind of a Here. So that's kind of a strange feature about the DeProy-Bohm model. So, yeah, maybe I should clarify. I mean, here what we do, what you do is you start with a particular trajectory. You assume that you have some classical probability distribution of Of starting points for your photons. For your position. Position and time where they're starting. And then you use this velocity field that you've measured to track the trajectories. And yeah, it's a feature of the Bohmian model that the trajectories never cross. So that's why we get this weird thing that if you have an interface, Why you get this weird thing that if you have an interference between particles coming from two directions, then you get you know they bend. The reason they never cross is because the velocity is single-valued function of position. Whereas if this was a Newton situation, then you'd have to specify initial positions and inertial velocities. And then it would be possible to have particles crossing because it wouldn't. Because then it wouldn't be a single-valued function of position alone, I think, is the difference. So, first of all, I'm wondering to what extent it is just inevitable that the weak value, once you have some weak value thing that satisfies the continuity equation, then necessarily you get the Bohm model pretty much. Yeah. Um, yeah, I'm uh maybe in retrospect it's inevitable. I'm I'm I'm not sure that that well the fact that you know it wasn't it wasn't noticed until you know a good 20 years after weak values were introduced, suggests that it's not totally obvious. Certainly it's not obvious, but it was somehow inevitable nevertheless. Somehow inevitable, nevertheless. Yes, I think I'd agree with that. Yeah. And then, so that's that's one thing I was trying to understand. What you're doing. Then the other thing is, so in Broy Bohm's 52 paper, I think the second of the two papers he wrote in 52, he does talk about quantum field theory, but he talks about, but he doesn't give a particle ontology for that. He gives instead a field ontology. Field ontology, which is quite different from what you're suggesting. And I guess, I mean, there have been particle ontologies proposed by various people, but the original thing was a field ontology. It seemed very natural the way he presented it in his 1952 paper. Yeah, so I don't recall what was said there, but I have read follow-up papers in which up papers in which in which that's sort of the killer argument is that they is that they show that you know because of this sort of feature obviously the photons are going to have to stop and then they just say oh but photons can't stop yeah and so so that motivates uh going the other direction so i guess what we were thinking was okay they did the experiment with optics right and it works very nicely so Right, and it works very nicely. So, was that just a coincidence that you can map the transverse velocity of photons onto non-relativistic massive particles, or does it suggest that you can actually extend the theory to relativistic particles and, in particular, photons? And so, that was what. That was our motivation to see if that's possible. And this is what came out. Okay, very interesting. Thank you. Yeah, we've gone over the question time, so I think I should hand the reins over to Rob for the discussion session. Yeah, shall we thank Timothy again?
