And with that, I will give you. Register. And with that, I will give you to Jessica Stryker talking about promotion and remotion, an ocean of notions. All right, thanks so much. We are very happy to welcome you to this online workshop. So I'm really, really excited that there are so many of you here to watch this talk so early in the morning. We were kind of disappointed that our long-awaited workshop at Banff had to be postponed, but it seems to be working out fairly well now that we are able to include a broader variety. That we are able to include a broader variety of participants in this workshop. So, my aim here is to give a widely accessible semi-expository talk designed to give you a perspective on the development in dynamical algebraic combinatorics while also getting to a few new results. So, what is dynamical algebraic combinatorics? It's the study of combinatorial objects from the perspective of dynamics, and in particular, objects and actions for which the dynamics is especially nice. the dynamics is especially nice. So these often correspond to cases in which the enumeration is especially nice, which are often in objects that have some relation to algebra. But proofs in this area may or may not involve algebra, so there's lots of room both for people who understand the algebraic side of things and for people who like to play around and search for beautiful true things. So in this talk we're going to introduce dynamical algebraic combinatorics by investigating the promotion action. By investigating the pro-motion action on Tableau, or generalizations of Tableau, and the row motion action on order ideals, or generalizations of order ideals. And we're going to look at this in four increasingly general realms. But if something goes horribly wrong and we don't see the rest of the talk for some reason or another, this is the whole point. There's a correspondence between promotion and row motion in lots of different areas. And if you know a notion, Know a notion of promotion or a notion of row motion that I don't discuss in this talk. My belief is that there should be a corresponding notion on the other side. So that's something that would be lots of fun to search for. All right, so let's begin by defining these two actions in the realms in which they first came up. Okay, so before I even say anything about what these actions are, I want to let you know that both promotion and row motion are bijection. Motion are bijections on their respective sets. So that each of these actions partition their domain into orbits. Another word that will come up is orbit structure, which is the number of orbits of each size. And then also the order, which would be the least common multiple of all the orbit sizes. Okay, so promotion on standard Yug Tableau was defined by Schutz and Verget using Jeta Takan. We're not going to talk about Jeta Takan at all in this talk. We're going to use the This talk, we're going to use the alternate definition involving Bender-Knuth involutions. So, let's hopefully this works. I'm going to switch over to Sage and show you a little animation of promotion on this standard Young Tableau. So, a standard Young Tableau is a filling of a partition shape with the numbers one up through however many boxes there are, so that the rows and columns are increasing and each number is used exactly once. And here's promotion. We're going to look at one and two, and then two and three. One and two, and then two and three, three and four, etc. And for each pair of numbers, we're going to ask ourselves: is it possible to swap these two numbers and still satisfy the definition of our tableau? Okay, so you can kind of see it ranging through all those numbers and applying those involutions as we go along, and our result is a new standard Young Tableau. Okay, now let's talk about row motion on order ideals of posets. On order ideals of posets. Row motion was studied by Duchet, Brouwer and Schriver, Cameron and Fonderflass before I became involved in this. And here's the definition, the first definition that we'll see. And so here I just got a random post. I asked Sage for a random postet on eight elements. And what happens? So first I should tell you what an order ideal is. An order ideal is just the blue elements on this picture. And it's a downward closed subset of the And it's a downward closed subset of the elements of your postet. And romotion says, let's find the minimal elements that are not in my order ideal. So those are colored yellow right here. And we're going to let those generate a new order ideal. So we're just going to take everything beneath the yellow elements. So we do that and we end up with this new order ideal. So that's row motion, but the little animation I made here actually does this over and over. So it's kind of fun to watch for a little bit. And over, so it's kind of fun to watch for a little bit. So you find the minimal elements and you let them generate a new order ideal, and eventually you're going to get back around to where you started, since this is a bijective action on a finite set. All right, so we'll just let that one run. And oh yeah, so I guess now that we saw sort of the general idea of both of these actions, let's go to realm one. And I'm going to zoom out and hopefully let's. To zoom out and hopefully land on the right spot and have everything load. All right, here we go. All right, so round one, I'm going to tell you the type A story only. The story is true for other root postets as well, but I don't have time to go there. So let's just concentrate on promotion on 2 by n standard Young Tableau. So there's one right there. And then this is going to correspond to row motion on order ideals of the type a n minus one positive. Of the type a n minus one positive root poset. So if you know what that is, great. If you don't, it just looks like a triangle as I've shown here. So let's start by discussing the tableau. Dennis White showed that promotion on this tableau. Oh, actually, I have two more animations. Never mind. So let's go back to the animations and just look at promotion on 2xN tableau real quickly. So you can see that the two numbers will swap anytime they're in different rows and not direct. In different rows and not directly in the same column. And then here's the row motion action on that order ideal, and then it keeps going. All right, so Dennis White showed that promotion on 2xN tableau corresponds to non-crossing matching rotation on a non-crossing matching with two endpoints around the outside. So that was a really nice reason why promotion. So that was a really nice reason why promotion on these tableaux is of order 2n because you're actually rotating something with 2n points around the outside. Okay, then on the row motion side, Pyanushev conjectured that the order of row motion was 2n, and Armstrong, Stump, and Thomas found a bijection, a uniform bijection between non-nesting and non-crossing partitions, which proved that conjecture and gave a nice cyclic sieving phenomenon. And gave a nice cyclic sieving phenomenon. So let's go back over here to our picture. And here is, well, so I guess I want to comment on Armstrong, Stump, and Thomas's bijection, that it was a really lovely bijection and it was uniform over different coxeter types, but it's not the bijection that I taught my children this summer in lieu of the outreach activity I usually do with high schoolers that got canceled like everything else this year. Anyway, the Like everything else this year. Anyway, the bijection that everybody knows between these tableau and these order ideals, okay, right, so the bijection that you know is up steps in the DIC path correspond to things on the top row and down steps correspond to things on the bottom row. So we go up one, two, three, four, five, and we go down six, seven, eight is up, nine, ten, eleven is down. 11 is down, 12 is up, 13, 14 is down, 15 up, 15 is up, and 16 is down. Okay, so I want to try to construct a bijection that uses this nice easy bijection. Okay, so that's what we're going to end up being able to do. Okay, so here, that bijection I just showed you is this arrow right here. We already discussed how to do row motion, so we end up getting over here and the And the thing that's true is this is not, if you start trying to do that same bijection with these two by n tableau, this is not the order ideal that you get. Okay, so in order to construct this bijection such that pro motion matches up exactly with row motion, it's pretty difficult. And that's why Armstrong's Jump and Thomas's result was so impressive is because this bijection is not that easy to write down, but it is. But it is, I mean, comparatively, it's not simple. All right, so we'll come back to that. Here's realm 1B. Again, it's type A only. The story is true for other minuscule posets as well. So if you have two disjoint standard Young Tableau rows of lengths A and B, you can correspond that with order ideals in the A by B poset with the same map actually. So here steps one, two, and three go up. So here steps one, two, and three go up, then four, five goes down, six, seven goes up, and eight goes down. Okay, so it's the same bijection. So here on the row motion side, Brouwer and Schreiber showed that the order of row motion is A plus B, and Fonderflas refined this by showing the length of any orbit is A plus B divided by D for some D dividing both A and B. And in particular, D can't be A plus B, so there are no orbits of size one, which will show up in a later. One, which will show up in a later talk this week as well. So Stanley found a bijection between promotion on these tableau, or thought of as linear extensions of two chains, and order ideals in this poset. And he showed that in promotion and evacuation. So what we want to do here is kind of unify these two realms and show, well, unify them in the sense that we're talking about two row standard young tableau. Standard young tableau, and we want to add a couple of steps inside the bijection that each one is fairly simple to explain. And so, this step right here is Cameron and Fonderflass's definition or interpretation of row motion in terms of the toggle group. And this step right here is joint work with Nathan Williams in our paper Promotion and Row Motion. And then this step right here between the two-row tableau and toggle promotion, this is the easy bijection I showed you already. Motion. This is the easy bijection I showed you already, the one that we all know. And one quick word about this two-row standard Young Tableau. I think I saw Kurta's screen here. He had an undergrad student, I think in 2013, that I believe it was her thesis that generalized to all two-row standard Young Tableau instead of just the two that I've shown you. So there's an interpretation in terms of row motion on order. In terms of row motion on order ideals for all two row standard Tableau. All right, so let's show each of these arrows one after the other. So let's talk about Cameron and Fonderflass's toggle group interpretation of row motion. So I showed you before about how row motion acts as sort of a convex closure operation, where we look for the minimal elements and we let them generate a new order ideal. Cameron and Fenderflass said we can also look at this. Said we can also look at this as toggling our poset from top to bottom basically in the reverse order of the linear extension. Okay, so I'll show you that as well. So I think that's the next one. Okay, so what is a toggle? A toggle just tries to change something from in the order ideal to not in the order ideal or vice versa whenever it's possible. So an order ideal in a postset, we already said, was a downward closed subset of postset elements. Closed subset of post-set elements. And so, what row motion is going to do is march from the top to the bottom and change things wherever it's possible to change them while still obeying the rules of being an order ideal. Okay, so we marched from top to bottom. Oh, and we're starting over again. And that is equivalent to our previous definition of row motion. Okay, so that was Cameron von der Fross. And so finally, I need to fill in this. So finally I need to fill in this arrow down here at the bottom, namely that toggle promotion, which is in this instance toggling left to right in the post set, is conjugate in the toggle group to toggle row motion, which was toggling from top to bottom. So in realm one, oh, and I'll show you, I'll show you in just a, well, I can show you now. So toggling from left to right looks like this. We'll march through the post set from left to left. We'll march through the postet from left to right, changing things wherever possible. And so we're not going to get the same outcome as we did when we toggled from top to bottom, but we are going to overall have the same orbit structure, which is what we get by the fact that these are conjugate elements in a group. Okay, so that's almost done. It takes a little longer. All right, so that's toggling left to right. So you put all these arrows together. So, you put all these arrows together, and we get that row motion and pro-motion have the same orbit structure. And then, also in realms 1A and 1B, we get an equivalence to a rotation. So that's going to yield a nice order and cyclic sibling results and things of that sort. So, let's finish up, go back to realm 1A and draw a different picture. So, on the top, this is the same, the rotation and the promotion, but on the bottom, this is sort of a different picture. This is toggle promotion, so toggling from left to right, and then From left to right. And then this arrow right here, we are able to fill in. And that's just the easy bijection from order ideals to 2 by n standard Yang Tableau. So that's how that result applies to Realm 1A. And then Realm 1B, here's the picture. So toggle promotion, again, toggling from left to right, this time on the rectangular postet, is actually going to give us a cyclic shift in this binary word constructed as just zeros and ones. As just zeros and ones, one for an upstep in the path and zero for a downstep in the path. So since this is equivalent, toggle promotion is equivalent to a cyclic shift, we are able to figure out what the order of row motion is on this A plus A by B postset. All right, so that was realm one. And now we're going to leave realm one. We're going to leave the realm of standard Tableau and move to the realm of. To the realm of increasing Tableau. If my thing will zoom, there we go. Okay, so this is joint work with Dilks and Pachenik. And our main result in this realm is that something called K-promotion on A by B increasing tableau with a certain bound on the entries is in equivariant bijection with row motion on order ideals of the product of three chains. Okay, we saw in the previous realm the product of two chains. We saw in the previous realm the product of two chains, so one natural next step of things to study would be taking the product of three chains, which looks like this box postet down below. So, oh, I need to tell you, I have these arrows. Sorry, I hope you don't mind the arrows. Arrows are trying to help me keep track of where to go. So, I need to make sure to tell you what K promotion is. So, K promotion, oh, and first what an increasing tableau is. So, an increasing tableau still has the Still has the conditions that the rows and columns need to strictly increase, but no longer do we need to have exactly one of each number. Okay, so Thomas and Young defined K Jeta Takan, which Pachenek then used to define K promotion, just by, you know, the same way you normally would in the Jeta Takan definition. And again, here, I'm going to use an alternate definition involving Bender-Knuth involutions, which we proved was equivalent to the Jeta Takhan definition. To the Jehovah Takan definition in that same paper with Dilks and Pachanik. Okay, so I'll go over here to the animations. So here is promotion by Kay Benderknuth involution. Sometimes it looks just like before, but here something sort of weird happened. So I guess I'll wait till it comes back around to tell you what that means. But basically, we're going to get ready to pause it. So the two and the three swap, and then right here. Three swap, and then right here we have a three and these two fours. And this three and these fours are kind of stuck, the ones in that L shape up there. But this four down here is free to turn into a three, so it does. Okay, similarly right here, these fours and fives are stuck. We can't turn a four into a five or a five into a four, so nothing happens. But here, everything is free, and so it can change. Then that one changes down there. So basically, just change an I to an I plus one or an I plus one to an I. plus one or an I plus one to an I whenever possible. And while we're over here in SAGE, I'll just show you this one. We're going to concentrate for the moment on rectangular increasing tableau, though our bijection does end up working for increasing tableau of any shape. All right, so that's K promotion on this tiny increasing tableau. Okay, so what we were able to show is that each of those K bender-Knuth involutions. Each of those K-bender-Knuth involutions on the increasing tableau corresponds to toggling the product of three chains from really from the back to the front. So we end up toggling by hyperplanes as we move through this product of chains. And note that row motion would have been toggling from top to bottom, so it would have been toggling by hyperplanes in that direction. What we were able to prove is that is conjugate to toggling from back to front. Conjugate to toggling from back to front, which matches up exactly to K-promotion. Okay, so let's talk a little bit about some previous results for this. So Cameron and Fonderflash showed that when C equals 2, so the size of one of your chains is 2, then the order of row motion is A plus B plus 1. And Pachenik showed this over on the K-promotion side on the increasing top low as well. And actually, As well. And actually, we have an alternative proof of this from promotion and row motion. We had a bijection to, oops, I guess it's down low here. We had a bijection to something that rotates with order A plus B plus one. So some certain non-crossing partitions from these order ideals. And I don't have all the steps there, but that was another proof of that result. So in three ways, we know that when C equals 2, we know what the order is. is. For C greater than 2, the story is a little bit more complicated. We don't necessarily get a nice order, but we do see some structure, which we called the resonance phenomenon, which I'm not really going to take the time to talk about. But I did want to mention one more thing, is that order ideals in the product of three chains by a very slight bijection, namely taking the circles and turning them into blocks. Blocks, those order ideals are actually plane partitions. And a plane partition you can look at from three different directions. So you can kind of see the numbers on any one of these faces by a mild transformation can turn into increasing tableau. So you end up having three different increasing tableau that correspond to each other. So we were able to use that symmetry to get some other nice results on the order of k-promotion and the order of rho-motion on products of three chains. Chains. All right, now we go to realm three, and there's only four realms, so we're making it there. It took me less time to scroll when I was less nervous. All right, so round three was joint work with Dilks and Vorland. And it's starting to look a little bit more complicated, but that's sort of good news because we can start applying the Good news because we can start applying this to more general things. So, first, I'll scroll over here and tell you that the motivation was that an increasing tableau is really just an increasing labeling of a postet that's partition shaped. So, similarly to what Stanley studied in promotion and evacuation, he studied, he generalized, well, he studied a generalized promotion, which was really the same promotion on linear extensions of any post set, not just partition-shaped postsets. So, we wanted to do the same thing. So, we wanted to do the same thing for increasing Tableau. So, an increasing Tableau is an increasing labeling of a partition-shaped postset. So, we're just going to label the post-set elements in a strictly increasing manner. So, now we want to, instead of just using a partition-shaped postset, we want to use any post-set. So, we're going to take a look at this Pentagon post set here, and we're going to define something we call increasing labeling promotion, which is very similar to the increasing promotion. Very similar to the increasing Tableau promotion, the K promotion. And we're actually going to make this even more general in that we're going to be able to say which numbers we're allowing in each spot for our increasing labeling. And so those two pieces of information together will help us construct this weird-looking poset we call the gamma poset, such that the order ideals on the gamma poset are in bijection with increasing labelings on the original poset, subject Original poset subject to the restriction function. Okay, and even better than that, pro-motion on the increasing labelings will correspond to row motion on the order ideals. Okay, so here I will show you how the toggles work. So down here in this situation, we're making it a little simpler. We're going to say our restriction function is just a global bound of six. And so that ends up making this gamma poset here on the right, which I'm not going to describe its exact. Which I'm not going to describe its exact construction, but you can sort of see here there are chains of elements corresponding to all the different possible numbers that could be in an increasing labeling in those spots. Okay, and so let's look at the increasing labeling on the left. We're going to have Bender-Knuth involutions, very similar to what we had for increasing tableau. So the one and the two don't change. Then we look at twos and threes. Well, that two can definitely change into a three, so it does. Now we look at threes and fours. Now we look at threes and fours. The three and four on the right are stuck, but the four on the left can change into a three. So it does. And then fours and fives, and fives and sixes. Okay, now I'm going to go back, sorry, and we'll look at toggling on the gamma postet. And the order in which we want to toggle is not the row motion order top to bottom, as usual. It is actually an order of the second coordinate on these. On these post-ad elements that are labeled by a letter and a number. So we'll toggle the one first, and then the two, and then the three, all the way up to the five. Okay, and so those toggles exactly correspond to the generalized Bender-Knuth involution. All right, and then finally, we can get all the way to row motion in the case that this order is something called a column toggle order, which I'm not going to take time to describe, but it's Not going to take time to describe, but it's not so difficult in the nice situations, it ends up being true. So, such as when our restriction function is intervals or a global bound. So, in those cases, row motion and increasing labeling promotion have the same orbit structure. Okay, so that's when this arrow right here is true. Okay, so here. So here's a particular example. Oh yeah, so what I, one thing that I wanted to say is like in this situation where these restrictions are weird, right, and they're not intervals, this isn't going to be able to, we're not going to be able to get all the way to row motion here. So here, we just have this first arrow that toggle promotion on these order ideals corresponds to increasing labeling promotion on the smaller postet, but it doesn't, it's not actually conjugate to row motion. Not actually conjugate to row motion. Okay, but in the nicer situations, it is. And the condition that we need is really just that the second coordinate in this map is only one away from anything that it covers. So up here, that doesn't work because this four is right next to a six. Okay, so if we look at this slightly easier example, we do get something we've seen before. Okay, so suppose we take as our post. Okay, so suppose we take as our poset p just a chain, and but we'll look at different restrictions. So the restriction function here is that element i on this chain is between i and 2 times i. Well, from our construction of the gamma poset, we end up getting this lovely triangular shape that we've seen before as the type A root poset. And in fact, promotion on the increasing labelings over there corresponds to toggling. Over there corresponds to toggling from left to right because that second coordinate is in increasing order on the right. So I guess that's the end of realm four. In this realm, or that's the end of realm three. In this realm, we kind of have a big, well, we have a hammer that's looking for a nail, right? We have a really big way to construct a new post set based on. To construct a new post set based on any post set. And so we'd like to find some applications. I think we still would like to find some more applications for this. But in this case, we do get something that we've seen before and kind of a neat little result. And we'll use this to get to a result about Flag Tableau in Realm 4. Okay, so let's head over to Realm 4. And this one has a lot of notation in it. This one has a lot of notation in it, but hopefully the pictures will be helpful. So Realm 4 is current joint work with Bernstein and Vorland, and it will be on the archive soon. And so here's what we're able to do. So just like before, we have a postet with some restrictions, and we're going to look at increasing labelings on the postet. So this is a restriction function on the postet. But instead of just working on that postet, now Poset. Now we're going to take the Cartesian product of that poset with a chain and we're going to look at p-strict labelings, which is something we just came up with. We called this p-strict labelings in analogy with column strict tableau. So we're going to look at labelings of p cross L that are strict on each copy of P and weakly increasing on as it goes along each chain L. Along each chain L. Okay, and not only are we going to look at the full p cross L, we're going to look at a convex subposet of p cross L, which just means we can take some elements off the bottom and take some elements off the top. Now that might seem like a weird thing to do, but it turns out we need to be able to do this if we want to include things like, for example, skew semi-standard Young Tableau, right? So for a skew tableau, you take some things off the top and some things off the bottom to get your skew shape. So that's kind of what we were Your skew shape. So that's kind of what we were modeling this after. Okay, so we look at P strict labelings of a convex subpost out of P cross L, subject to the restrictions. These restrictions are true on each copy of P. And what we're able to do is find a bijection between that and something we're calling B bounded gamma P R hat partitions. So yeah, the notation starts getting really terrible, but really, all we're doing is we're constructing some. All we're doing is we're constructing some other postet, and we might end up with some blue labels in certain spots. So, the blue numbers in here are fixed, those are never going to change. And the things that are not blue are going to be labeled in an increasing manner. Okay, so over here now, we're going to, instead of calling this an increasing labeling, we're going to start calling it a p partition. But here, our p is gamma pr hat. So, anyway, we're going to. So anyway, we're going to label numbers on here subject to these blue numbers being fixed. So here, these numbers in between the zero below, that's blue, and the three above, that's blue. Those need to be numbers between zero and three. Oh, and I guess they're not, I misspoke, they're not strictly increasing labelings. They're weakly increasing, which is why we started calling them p partitions. All right, so the idea is that p strict Peace-rick promotion over here, which I will show you an example of that eventually, and piecewise linear toggle promotion over here are going to be in correspondence with each other. And then in certain cases, we'll get all the way to piecewise linear row motion. Okay, and I will tell you what piecewise linear row motion is before the end of this talk. And it is a concept that will come up in subsequent talks. Concept that will come up in subsequent talks. Okay, but let's finish out this picture and then I'll show you some specific examples which will be more understandable. The idea here is that if we do P-strict promotion that's analogous to semi-standard Young Tableau promotion, only now we're on this like crazy weird shape, that's going to correspond to toggling in the order of the second coordinate, just like what we had before. Okay, so. Okay, so let's go up here and say something about when we can get to row motion. So we can get all the way to row motion in the cases when our poset is what we're calling column adjacent, and that includes most of the situations we care about. So when our restriction function is intervals or when we just have a global bound instead of these weird sets in our restriction functions. Okay, so for example, skew, semi-standard, young tableau of any shapes are going Young tableau of any shape are going to be included in this. So we have a bijection between promotion on skew semi-standard young tableau, and that's an action that many people who study tableau know about. We'll have a bijection between that and piecewise linear row motion on some weird postet we construct. Okay, and in specific situations, that weird postet that we construct, we can actually say what it's going to be. Be. Oh, there we go. All right, so for example, one thing that's covered under this bijection is regular semi-standard Young tableau of rectangle shape with entries at most Q. So those tableau, if they are N by L, standard Young, semi-standard tableau, under promotion, those are going to be in bijection with P partitions of an N by Q minus. An n by q minus n shape with labels at most L under piecewise linear row motion. Okay, so here's a picture, and I even put what n, l, and q are here because it's kind of hard to keep track of that. Notice these numbers right here are blue, so they're fixed. And then we're going to do piecewise linear toggles in the middle, which I still will tell you what those are. But first, I wanted to say this bijection. But first, I wanted to say this bijection right here was noted previously. It was noted by Hopkins. I saw it in a talk of Gabe Frieden at FIPSAC in Vancouver. I think so. This is something that's been around for a while. And really, it's just the semi-standard Young Tableau to Gelfand Settlin pattern bijection up to a convention. Okay, so the way this works is here's the top of the Gelfon Settlin pattern, this three. And we're doing, if you know this bijection, we're kind of doing this bijection. If you know this bijection, we're kind of doing this bijection, the dual bijection. So we are saying, let's look at everything with sevens in it, that's of shape three, and then sevens and sixes is of shape two, five, etc. Okay, so we're just turning this tableau into a Gaufan-Settlin pattern, but then looking at it as a p-partition. Okay, so the order, so this bijection shows that the order of piecewise linear row motion here is q. motion here is Q because it corresponds to the order of semi-standard young tableau, which is known to be Q. Okay, so this was proved for birational row motion by Grinberg and Roby with a more direct proof by Musiker and Roby. So this part right here. And this exhibits the cyclic sieving phenomenon as a corollary of Rhodes's result for cyclic sieving on the tableau. Okay. Okay, and then we can move to some other types of tableau that are a little less well known. And then I'll finally show you an example of the toggles that we're talking about. Okay, so let's consider flagged semi-standard tableau with entries at most Q and flag 2, 4, 6, etc. Okay, we've seen this already in that example of that chain that corresponded with the type A. That corresponded with the type A root post set. Okay, so rectangular, semi-standard tableau. Oh, I don't think I ever said what semi-standard was. It just means less than or equal to as you go across rows and strictly less than as you go down columns. And so that's what we were emulating with the P-strict labelings. So these by our bijection are in bijection with, well, I tried to stay away from this notation, but this is the type A root post set. Is the type A root post set of type A N. So P partitions with the P, the post set being this triangular post set, with labels at most L under piecewise linear row motion. Okay, so flag tableau. Grinberg and Roby showed the order of birational row motion, which is more general than piecewise linear, is 2 times n plus 1. So that means by our bijection, the order of promotion in these weird flags. Of promotion in these weird flag tableaux is also 2 times n plus 1. And I don't believe these are flag tableau that anybody's ever really looked at before. And I don't know how I would have known just by looking at this that this flag would have produced a nice order of promotion. Okay, so Jim Prop conjectured cyclic sieving here, and Hopkins generalized it to coincidental types, the conjecture. So that tells us we have a conjectured. That tells us we have a conjectured cyclic sieving for these flagged Tableau as well. Now, I don't know how to solve the cyclic, and I keep saying cyclic sieving because it's kind of not worth defining if you don't know what it is. But there's a lovely talk by Vic Reiner that we advertised in the email to participants. So you're welcome to go take a look at that if you wonder, you know, what is she talking about here. So I don't know how to solve either of these CSPs, but maybe somebody does, and then they'll have solved. Maybe somebody does, and then they'll have solved too. Okay, so here I want to finally show you how the Bender-Knuth involutions work and how the piecewise linear toggles work. And then we'll finish with just one more application. Okay, so on the left, let's look at this as a flagged tableau. And here, remember, the top row has to be less than or equal to two, the middle row is less than or equal to four, the bottom row is less than or equal to six. And then the involutions work. And then the involutions work similar to what they were before. Here, we disregard anything that's fixed, so the one in the two and the one in the two, and then here this two just turns into a one. Here, we have two twos and one three in a row, and none of them are fixed. So we turn that into one two and two threes. So these are the original involutions of Bender and Knuth on semi-standard Young Tableau. Here, everything can change. Here, you would think. Here, you would think, so we disregard the four and the five. You would think that the four would turn into a five, but it doesn't because we have that flag condition that said the second row is bounded above by four. So don't change something into a number that it's not allowed to be changed into. And then finally, the five and the six are stuck and nothing changes. So I'll go back to the beginning of this. And now let's look at the right and see what happens. And so I'm going to define. And see what happens. And so I'm going to define piecewise linear toggles, but we're just going to toggle from left to right again. And we're imagining that these numbers on that post set are bounded below by zero and bounded above by three. Yeah. So this one right here, we look above it, there's a one and below it there's a zero. So we flip it to being a zero. This one right here has a three above it and the biggest thing below it is zero. So it's one is one away from zero. So now we want to. One is one away from zero, so now we want to make it one away from three. So we change it into a two here. The three up there is going to change into a two because it's bounded above by three and below by two. And the zero actually turned into a two as well. And then I don't think anything else is going to change. And I drew these dick paths on here to kind of show you. This is like a bunch of dick paths squished together, which people have looked at before as well. All right, so that was the example of piecewise linear toggling, and you'll see that again in this conference. Then finally, we have one more conjecture, really. Let's look at flag tableau of staircase shape with a linear progression in the upper bounds. So L plus 1, L plus 2, L plus 3. So here L is 3. Our bijection shows that these flag tableau, flagged semi-standard tableau are in bijection with rectangular pieces. With rectangular p-partitions with labels at most n, so that's these fours up here, and that are bounded below in each diagonal by which diagonal it is. So 0, 1, 2, 3 are each the bounds for these diagonals on the bottom. And so these flag tableau have been studied before. A result of Sabalo, Slabe, and Stump on multi-cluster complexes, along with a bijection of Serrano and Stump, yields Of Seranonstump yields that the order of flagged promotion here is n plus 1 plus 2l. So that tells us the order of piecewise linear romotion over here is the same. And then Serrato and Stump conjectured a cyclic sieving phenomenon for these staircase flag tableau that I think has not been solved yet. So this gives us a new way to at least look at that cyclic sieving conjecture, even though it didn't give us a way to solve it just yet. Solve it just yet. All right, and with that, I realize I didn't even make a thank you slide. So maybe I'll just zoom out and you can kind of see the landscape that we've covered in this talk. And I promise you, I will figure out a way to print this out to a PDF and put it on the slides thing eventually. But I thank you so much for your attention. Let us have a round of applause for Jessica. We had some questions in the chat. I'm trying to go back into the chat to view them. Well, I'll ask the most recent one from Theo de Vropoulos, which is about the whole toggle group. Actually, Jessica, you could probably read that. Do you see that there? Have to turn up the. Yep, the whole toggle group is either the symmetric or the alternating group. That's true. Yeah, I don't really know anything interesting about the toggle group structure beyond. About the toggle group structure beyond that statement. So, I mean, your question about nice subgroups in the toggle group is certainly one that somebody ought to look at, or maybe somebody knows something about, but that somebody is not me at the moment. Well, I'll jump in and say there's a lot of mysteries surrounding the birational and piecewise linear versions of the toggle group. That's true. And there was an earlier question from Jaisong-O. Uh, from Jae Song-O about evacuation and how that fits into this picture. Oh, yeah, so that's something that I think a lot of us have thought about and talked about, but I don't know if any of us have like written it down anywhere yet. But that might be coming in a talk later this week, right? And Sam might be talking about that, yes? At least row evacuation. So, yes, there's evacuation that does fit in with things. Oh, I can think of something to say. I can think of something to say. In this most recent paper, where we are defining P-strict promotion on P-strict labelings, we also do a little bit of looking at P-strict evacuation. It's not quite as nice as in the regular case, but there are a few things that we can still say. So yeah, so there will be a word on that in this upcoming paper. Great. If there are more questions, you can unmute yourself or you can ask them in the chat. We do have like three more minutes if people want. More minutes if people want. I think to answer Theo's question a little bit is in the case where the toggle group is the alternating group, for n bigger than or equal to 5, then there aren't any nice subgroups. Just from underground, from abstract algebra, right, whether no. And what about those two elements, the toggle that makes the raw motion and the toggle that makes the pro motion? Are they the hedge group? Do they commute? Do they generate anything nice? Do they generate anything nice? Yeah, that I don't know. That's part of what we're talking about here, right? The toggle, the composition of toggles that gives you row motion gives you this orbit structure that we're investigating in all of these different cases, right? So for nice postets, it ends up being nice. For not nice postets, it's kind of crazy and you can't say anything about it. I'd say, even for nice postets, though, if you combine row. Nice postets, though. If you combine romotion and promotion and try and see what they generate, they'll generate a pretty big group. I don't know if anyone's looked at that, you know, proprietary like that, but it would be, you know, I'd guess it's pretty close to the full symmetric group if you do that. Jessica, do you know anything about when these toggles commute with each other in these different situations you have? Oh, the Well, I mean, I think we can. So, in all of these situations, we were getting over to like either just regular old toggles on a distributive lattice or piecewise linear toggles. So, yeah, once you translate them over into the toggles we've already studied, you can just look at the postet and see when they commute. But back over there on the tableau-like objects, I'd say it's probably less clear to see when they. Clear to see when they commute, or at least it's less clear to me. Oh, and Sam Hopkins has a good comment about how if you really want a dihedral action, then there's a different operator you can use to get a nice dihedral action on these objects. Well, if there are no questions, it's 1145. Why don't we thank the speaker again?
