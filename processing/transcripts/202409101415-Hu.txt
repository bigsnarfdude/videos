So, I have been a poster in UC Berkeley under a co-work with Nini. So, most of my work is actually close to the appliance mathematica. So, today we will introduce a new method called the screening galaxy hydrofork. This is actually to especially to do the hybrid function electrical calculation for complex metallic systems. For complex metallic system with the mini-viatoma on the exascala sunway supercomputer. So, because the professor already gave most talk about the meaning of atom for the AVD charge calculation, here maybe we will rally promote the DVT to the hydrophobic part. This is actually what we do. Okay, this is our my outline. Maybe include the My outline maybe includes the motivating and the state of the art, and also roughly introduce the DG DFT and the DGI focus method. And the third part we will show our performance and some result. So this may be other guys very familiar with this, but for our goal actually is very easy. So because we know most of most of the supervisors already sh show that content mechanics. Show that content mechanism contains the word, but my goal actually is to show with the half of the HPC, HPC means the high performance computation on the leadership super computer, how light system can oscillate in the cont so this is the sum of the application includes the post-motor electro and also the added material and the biomed and And by maximum and catalyst, and also you can do some strong e-correlate system. But I think this is some background. I think of this. So this slide actually is very important for me because this is some large scale abilities or electron calculation. In principle, we have three ways. So the first is the coordinate scaling method. Actually, this is very famous in This is very famous in the chemistry. Okay. So they have this method, and the top of this method is done by FHIM. This is, they can do 500k at the pure FDI method. Another method is the machine learning football method. This is very famous in this year, in recent years, especially for 2012. Deep MD, they can do almost the OS binium atma at this level. This year, maybe they were ready to include 10 billion atom. So these two methods actually, both of these methods actually depend on the neocentric principle in the physical. It works very well in the molecule, separate or insulator. But for some complex metallic systems, For some complex method system, actually, it's not very good. A lot of methods actually is some universal method. Okay. But the universal method actually, the only advantage is that it's universal, but the hidden side or his complexity is very high. Always, maybe it's COVID. You use some algorithm, you can use to the quadratic. Okay, here, actually, for material sense, the most famous code is the VAT. But the VAT maybe. Okay, but the last one maybe now only you can, I think after law, only one paper, you can simulate into maybe 10,000 atma up to law. So actually, my work actually is dependent on the DGDFT. But actually in 2023 or 24, we already implemented 40k atma in on the loss. We used maybe 100,000. Uh, 100,000 uh CPU codes at this level, and this uh and in 2022, we pushed this to uh uh 2.5 million item, but all of this only focuses on DFT. That means we still use the local function. Okay, here are some stars. The star means that means that they are select or selected in the golden bear press. This is the top. The top reward in the HPC. That means you can use the leadership supercomputer and use the software to simulate some real science problem. It's okay. Okay, this actually most of GAD already showed. So actually for the content DFT, this is generalized quantity DFT. That means we include the pure DFT. Include the pure DFT. We also, sometimes we need to include the hydrofocurrent. Okay. All this thing is local. You can reduce it to maybe quick scanning. But for even you include the hydrofocur, maybe in URL 1PN24. So our goal actually is very easy: how to make solve the generalized connectivity more accuracy, more large, and more fast. And also the order should be like this. First of all, we need to make it more. Re like this first of all, we need to make it more accurate. Okay, accuracy actually normally we have to uh we focus on the high-round function, we can hybrid or W hybrid or the random set and IPA. But a lot of a lot of problem actually is the composite baset. This is also my work focused on how to realize some new accuracy baset to do to solve this equation. Notice it's very easy. You can use most aggression to Use most aggressive to reduce the order, okay. Fast, okay. What we do actually is to apply the high-performance computing on the supercomputer. Okay, we need to focus that even for one note is also you can you can make it very fast. Okay, this is the main accuracy we can that's been for the quantia dmt most the most accuracy uh in is come from the uh exchange correlation function LDADGA. function, LDA, GDA, meta GDA, and also hybrid or W hybrid. This is also the scanning. So in this work, we will focus on the hybrid first. Okay, this we first give a summary to the light scale hybrid calculation of the law. So here is the order code. We can do the nice. Can do the nice scale hybrid calculation include CP2K, FDIMs, HOMOS, APAC, and one tab. Okay. Or in the PWDP and Digital Hydrofog is divided by our group. We can show all the this is low name any you can use the machine learning or different basis is okay. Okay, actually the largest system is the first implemented this this paper also is done by me about 2070 is a 2000 Is 2000 about 4,000 atom, but we need maybe 8,000 cores, CPU cores. Okay, this is the state of R up to Lao. Okay, but this is used actually using the pure plane. We only use some low-rank optimizing to reduce code SES step to reduce the colour the score to end to three. That means CTR can only simulate maybe a free thousand. Okay. 3,000. Okay, uh, actually, for next year, so we suddenly remove it to maybe 4,000. But for D charge fork, we can push it for the high barrier calculation to 2.5 milli item. And also a lot of is also near scanning. That means for the focal part, we can reduce the scalar to the curve scanning to the near scanning. And it also works for the meta system. For the meta system, we test graphy and then listen sonial on metal, also some rough couple graphic disposed on the silicon interface. Okay, first because actually what I do I focus on the BCL. This is a some our slides to compare plane wave and automac opto and also this is a new method on new basic. This new method, a new base set, we call it adaptive local function. So, actually, because most of my work is beginning from the Plan wave, Planwave actually is a very easy base set. It's periodical and along local, and also a circular complete base. But it better use that for each electron or each orbiter, it's very expensive. So, sometimes maybe for each electron, maybe you need 1000. Basically, for some complex system, maybe you need 10. For some complex system, maybe even tensor. Atomic actually, his main advantage is that it's local. Okay, it's easy to implement in the linear scanning method on the automatic. And a lot of that base set is very small. You can maybe use a few, maybe less than 100 base set. You can present one orbital. Okay. So that means for polynomial, that means because in all your matrix data, You in all your matrix is this that means for the lowest DFG calculation, uh, your scanning is a crypto scanning, but for atomic option because your matrix motor matrix is Hampton, it's easy to implement any scanning. Okay. Real performanum wave is also hydrosynthetic absolute. You can use the largest supercomputer. You only have simulation, that's the 10,000 atom. But for atomic operating, atomic option is easy to simulation, especially for needle scaling. simulation especially for needle scaling you can use the uh one mini item okay this is some uh software planoid vasso compressor apit the p labd is supported by our group and this is most of the atomic optor include the gaussian and the sto also the uh nl optor okay uh one actually i will i i need to impart that for plane wave for plane wave code so all the plane wave has a very So all the plume wave has a very special feature. That means all the plume wave code, no matter you use what method, all the results should be exactly the same. That means exactly the same. But actually, because our group also developed the atomic algorithm, I found that even for the same bit set, such as Gaussian and Pi 7, you can make the accuracy, the area belong to maybe N2 like T4. It's very hard. But the Plan wave. At the plane wave, you need to maybe make an ether less than then to lack 10. Okay. But the DG David, just a new basis recorded the adapted local UB set. Somehow he combined both advantage, Blanewave and Atomic Auto. For example, he's local. He's also a circular. Also, it's a complete basis. But different Blane wave, he includes the chemical insight into the basic. So you can make the So, you can make the a lot of honey that it basically said actually sometimes I will show below, maybe you can smaller than the atomic orbital. For some cases, you can very for each orbital for each, you can use only two bases. It's okay, because if you use the one basis set, maybe it's already become the value function. And also, he is also because it's located, you can easily implement any method here. But his bus is different to the atomic orbital. To the atomic orbital. We call it the block spot we will show below. So, based on this, it's easy to implement a million atoms of calculation. And we develop a new method called discrete Gaussian dunction theory called DG DFT. I will introduce how this method works in the pure DFT, also the hybrid calculation part. Hybrid calculation part. Okay, first we introduced the DG method. Actually, the DG method is equal to the very famous method in mathematical. But we lost this method actually is never used in physical and chemistry. Okay. Because actually, all this actually for long model of equation includes. Uh, equation includes Dirac equation, Schrödinger equation, uh, and also Hamato and Jacobi, and the NS equation, also, and EF equation already solved by this method. Okay, but all this work is done by applying mathematical. That means it's only focus on a very small field. Uh, this method, and so our, my work is based on the uh 2012 in. Uh, is better than in and without okay. So, a bit and this better. So, this is actually a very powerful method that can solve all the PVE equation, okay. But uh, actually, this is a very small slide what we mean this can gather. Actually, it's very easy. Okay, first, he the federal element method and his piece-wide polynomial. A lot of the main features is a local formula. What I mean? Okay, this will show a picture. Okay, we have a red line. This is the quadratic polymer system. We can use a linear polymer to fitting it. This is continuous. The best regard of continual regards. Another method, we can cut this system with four parts, and you can optimize each part. You can also get the near polynomial position. In a polynomial predation, we in print we already can see this resolution much better than this one. Okay, so this is very easy to implement in the code. Okay, just in the basic idea of the DG. Actually, this work is an advantage. Okay, you can use it as PVE. The goal actually is the DG at the beginning, maybe 30 years ago. Beginning, maybe 30 years ago, to implement to propose this method is for the parallel computing. Okay. But actually, we are the first one to show. Yeah, this method can do parallel computing. But this method also have a disadvantage. They have two. First, because you optimized each of this PDE in the local part, that means in the boundary part, it's In the boundary part, it's discontinued. That doesn't mean just all the spaces you can discontinue. And another thing, because you have less constraints, that means freedom is very large. That means for sequential calculation, this method is not efficient. Okay. But this method also just means for more degree of the freedom, we can use the HPGs to solve this method. If your basis set is. But if your basic set is a discontinuum boundary, you can use the integration by part. Okay. Of course, this means still, most of the techniques are still under development. Okay. Above actually is roughly show what we did, but for DGDFT, what we have to actually is different. Actually, the idea of DGDFT is actually very similar to the completion of a term. The linear computation of a thermal optor on reload for this for the LCL, we use the atom bar so wave function as the base set. For polymer wave, actually, we use the e-cigarette grid point. We have wave function. Okay. DG actually, actually, what we do is use the partition part. That means we have a sub-domain part. That means to get the basis set. So the idea for example part, this is a 2D system. We partition in. This is there, we party into maybe 16 subdomains. We call it an L-med for each local domain, for example, this L-B10, we also have maybe a system and we call it an extended element, to solve a neat larger system. Okay, because this system you can include the chemical environment and solve this local conjunction equation on each extended element to get the conjunction orbital. The content of and then after getting auto in this user element, we can use eigenfunction with the local environment. That means we can actually directly cut other part only to save. Save inside this element, we will get a base set only exists in this element. This is our new base set. And another part I hear is exactly the same. Pattern here is exactly the same with the local base set, no any, you know, no anything new. Okay, after Git met, we can um we can make a we can pitch the global domain with the method. Okay, this is the dft part, this is uh uh but we will introduce some new part that means we need to deal with the boundary phase and some parity part for detail. This is the first paper of the DG method to solve the connection DFT. The clinical DFT. This is the DFT director law, the first proposal on 2012. And after each year, maybe we have some story. Now, actually, we will show how to, because before this method only to solve the pure local DMP. Now we will show how to pure the long-local hydrofocure part. Okay, this is. Okay, this is how the adaptive beta looks like. This is the photography nine remote. We cut the system with five parts. This is the second subdomain. We put the M and two. The first three, no edge based looks like. And this is the density. This is a 2D system. It's the same. Okay. You can show this optor because he is a solar in each of the subdomain. Different subdomains have. Subdomain. Different substance have low over is a circular. The main idea of this method is actually we can get the Hamiltonian or density is looks like this. Okay, this is small system, only include maybe 188 elements. Actually, the main advantage of this piece is that we can make it homogeneous and also the data bases, which looks like. Dental benches, which looks like a block, three blocks, diagonal system. Okay, it's very similar to Taliban, actually. I mean, the only difference we have been said. A lot of advantage is that all of our this dense small matrix is the same. That means it's easy for us to do the parallelization. I need to focus on that. We show this system actually, this small element is very small here. But actually, we can do for this for this system, we can do. Do for each for this system, we can do maybe 10,000 mini atom in this more blue one. Okay, that's just me. That's why we can do various systems. That means there's a million atom very easy. Okay, there are some details. Okay, maybe because they have one thing that no matter what she said, we are. We are giving actually, you can use the 1D partition 2D or 3D, but okay. Here are some detail to deal with and deal with how to do some overlapping here. Here is the summary on most difference for this new adaptive local base that this plan wave actually is very easy because you are getting this Hamptonia. But for atomic gut, you are spat Hamptonia. And for the LB function, you can get a Function, you can get a blocked tri-di-diangular sparse matrix. This is the main feature. Another thing is that for each small part, we have the same set. That means our memory access is very cheap than the plane wave and this atomic optor. Okay, since here is the follow-up chart of DG DFT. Actually, compared to my lower ma DF sheet, Definitely the only thing that we need to generate ARB on each SF iteration that means our base is adapted with the density of the wave function. The other part actually is the same compared with normal divided. Now, here, because our Hamiltonian is very special, so here we have some special method such as the PESI. Also, because our method Because our method our is also um so in all the necessary method you can use here such as anybody. Okay, another thing because our basic is complete basis, completely the uh the force or the following actually is also very easy. Okay, this some detail how do uh how we do the parallelization. That means the idea actually because in each subdomain, okay, so you can maybe use one particle and Can maybe use one processor. And a lot of things, we have so many sub-trains. The only actually needs to ask is the memory. If your memory is lab, you can do very system. That'd be for the very simple design. Parallel design, you can use it to do one million processor. Each processor, actually, you can use OpenMP to get more computer source. Okay, this is the DDFT we do about 2002. We do about 2000 chat. 2012, we can get maybe 50 line parallel efficiency. Roughly we can get 2.5 million atom. And also we are maybe 2000 faster than the set of R. Settle R training is done by DFAVE. Okay. And at that time, they maybe can do electron, maybe 10 to 10 to 5. To 10 to 5, now we can do 10 to 7. Also, our speed up is very high. But this work actually is still only focused on DFT part. Okay, the next, we want to transform to the hydrophobic part. Hydrophobic part actually, we will to the force center integral. Okay, this part actually is more difficult than the DFT part, especially no matter in the atomic orbit or the plane wave. We'll show this our method. way we'll show this our method actually uh for calculating the uh the forcent integral actually is very easy okay there are some uh some uh other um background so how this is a standard uh exactly change head fork so it's uh n to four okay this is uh and what we use the uh thermograph four center electron integral and uh in principle okay uh in the if you want to i want to uh in the if you want to i want to uh exact the forcing integral is also very expensive okay and also the other integral is uh in the global domain okay here is the over overview of some method how to compute the uh focusing change okay this is that integral screen inside and this method is using automatic over and also there are some some other method is close to the i method you also use uh use the there are so many methods and it's There are so many methods. Recently, there have some special methods that loss depends on the localization called the low-long percentage, such as the ACE and SDF or something other. Okay, this method you can directly use the namelow or other difference method because they do not depend on the localization and project. Okay, but in DJI fork, we still want to integrate. If we want to do the integral in the global domain, doesn't mean we have to do any advantage. But here we introduce approximation. We will use the translation Coulomb operator and hydrofocure potential. What does that mean? That means some paper very short. That means we only can get the added customer about maybe 8 or 10 AU. 10 extra. Actually, we can. 10x1 actually we can use the very approximation to cast the cooling infusion. This actually is widely used in the solid CCN calculation. We will introduce this approximation in our method. Okay. What I mean is that when I solve a potential here, our first part we will get a transition only on the extended element. This is our approximation here. Uh, approximation here. We would have to do this approximation and also combining with the advantage of the ARB baset, we can easily scan in this method to other end. Okay, this is some very basic idea how we do. Okay, this is the real graph system. This is the M3. This is the opposite pair. That means when we do four-center integral, we have three other problems. Three other products that means is overtail. But in DGDF and in DG part, because it basically only looks on each element, this there looks like this. This is very different plane wave and automatic orbital. Okay, in this part, we will do the coolant interaction because we do a chunking here. Let me finally, we got the four-center integral is still blocked. Blocker tried that diagonal similar to the DFT hyperfolio on the ARB basis. That means for the work matrix, also for the DFT part, his pattern is the same. Okay, other part is exactly the same with the lower DFT. And also, this calculation actually is really scanning. Okay, just some this family what we do. Okay, that's some. Some detail. We also, because of actually, after we do this, we found a major thing that mostly placed father come from how we get the because when we do hydrofog, we need to actually do a very large system on the subdomain. Okay, for example, a subdomain includes maybe one subdomination. I sub there include maybe one thousand atom. That means when you do hybrid cocktailing, it's also very expensive. Here, but this method actually is the standard planet method. We already did and done before. It's very easy. Okay, here is the new part. What we do the actually is very similar to the DZ DFP part. The only problem, the only effective part that we need to generate generation the That we need to generate in the hydrofoc orbital in each SF distribution on the subdomain. Other parts are exactly the same, okay? But we need to show that because our BS is a complete set, company BSL. So you had to fork pattern, the low contributes to the total force. Okay, here is some idea how we do. It actually is exactly the same with the lower mode dft part. Okay. Okay, here are some other detail we need to do the gauge alignment part for the because when we generate the general s and the ARB is orbital, they have a gauge gauge issue here. We will do some new method how to make the gauge the same. This is the two level palette of the digital fork. Actually, it is related the same with the lower DFT calculation part. Path, there's some uh, yeah, uh, now because the first thing we need to check the accuracy, how what uh this is the accuracy part of the DGDFT when we compare with the two uh two software why is every for the plane wave okay okay yeah a lot of uh a lot a lot is from the atomic observer we can find both ways but uh this is the accuracy uh for the But this is the accuracy for the total energy. We can find they can get the same of the accuracy of plane wave. This is for the lithium solar 250 system. This is a metallic system. We also check the atomic force and also the fallen part. It's all the same. Another part we also check the hydrophobic part. This is for the silicon system. Can system we can find for the for the truncation is maybe two or ten to one we can get a very high accuracy for the allergy we can get a ten to electric five and for the horse we can get a ten to electric force this is hydrofocal part we also do some two system one is the phosphorus okay is the same we compare the all the accuracy okay include the total energy and the hydrofoc energy and also as gap also the force actually only kind of on the to look at the force only kind of on the to look and for we already can get very high accuracy we also check the system of the uh on the uh graphic the same okay that means our method a lot it might not depend on what the system you are using okay this is some example the light system is the lithium sodium okay 2.5 milli atmos this is a fairly just actually uh we can uh even for the small system we can get maybe uh We can get maybe 17 faster than the current state of the PWAP. We can get 60 parallel features about 400,000 MPI tasks. Okay, each task, each MPI task, we use the 46 codes. That means we can easily get the 1 million, maybe 10 million codes here. Cost here, okay. Uh, and finally, we can get the hybrid calculation up to sorry, there are some type here: 2.5. We also, uh, this is the weak stream, we can show all these time, even for a very large system, we can for the maybe uh too many electrons, we can construct the fork space only only in the 20 second. Okay, there are some applications I think is very easy. I think it's very easy. Okay. Here are my talk. Thank you.
