It has a beautiful structure which I will try to explain to you. Okay, as with every model, I'll have to set the stage. I have to talk about what is the configuration space, what are the key notations, what is the Hamiltonian, what is the reference measure, what is the metastable regime, and so that's what. Regime. And so that's what I'm going to set up. And we're going to begin by taking the plane and carving out of the plane a torus. And for now, the torus, well, the torus is finite. We assume that this is large enough. And what large enough means depends on what I will be talking about later. So a large torus, which we give it periodic boundary conditions in order to make Conditions in order to make it nicer. And the set of configurations that we're going to consider is the set of all finite collections of points that you place in this torus. So here a point configuration is a configuration of points in the torus that is finite and of course. And n of gamma counts how many points there are. So that's the cardinality of this point set. And I'm using the symbol gamma rather than the omega because I want to mark that this is really a very different configuration space than what we have been talking about before. And we're going to imagine drawing disks of radius one around the center of the The center of these points. So, what I get is that I get disks, unit disks in the plane whose center are captured by this finite configuration. And that is our configuration space. The number of this can be any finite integer starting with zero. So, the box can also be empty. And that is the set of possible configurations. So, that is Configuration. So that is the first thing. And then we're going to build our Gibbs measure. There is going to be a reference process. And the reference process simply will be here, the Poisson point process with intensity one. And so that is the process where you throw in with intensity one points into your torus and you get a random point set. And that is our reference process. So that is what the disks. Process. So that is what the disks would be doing if there would be no interaction at all. And then we're going to introduce an interaction Hamiltonian. We're going to say, well, what energy do we assign to a specific configuration gamma? And what we do in the Widen-Rounds model is you take the union of all the unit disks centered at the points in this point configuration and take the volume of that. Take the volume of that, and you subtract from that the sum of the volumes of all the unit disks. Now, B is a unit disc, so this volume here is pi. And so, what the Hamiltonian is, it is equal to minus the total overlap between the disks. So, this is the volume of the union minus the sum of the volumes, and so the difference is minus the total overlap. Difference is minus the total overlap of the disks. And so this Hamiltonian makes the model attractive. The more I make the disks overlap themselves, the lower the energy becomes. So this Hamiltonian favors disks lying on top of each other. Now, a perfect lying on top of each other of all the disks is very Other of all the disks is very unlikely because the reference measure is a Poisson point process, and so it happens with probability one that the centers would all be lying on top of each other. So these disks are always a little bit spread out. And the closer they want to come to each other, the less likely that is for the possible point process to happen, but the more likely it is because of the Hamiltonian liking. Liking overlap. And so then there is the usual Gibbs factor, there is the inverse temperature in front of it. There is one more ingredient in here is that we are not fixing the number of disks. We allow the number of disks to be random, any non-negative integer. And we're going to weigh the presence of a disk. To weigh the presence of a disk with another parameter Z, which is called the chemical activity. So, when you want to bring in a disk, you have to pay a price Z. And that's why this Hamiltonian is called the grand canonical Gibbs measure, because it doesn't fix the number of disks. There's an interaction between the disks, there's a reference measure, and there is a chemical activity. The Z parameter is a way. Parameter is a way of controlling the density, the typical density of the disks in this Gibbs measure. And then, as always, there's a normalizing partition function that turns this into a Gibbs process. So, this is the Widham-Raunsen model as it was introduced by these two gentlemen. And it describes an equilibrium distribution of disks. And it turns out that this system has. That this system has a phase transition depending on the values of zeta and beta, which I will come back to in a second. So this defines our model and puts this into place. And what we were now going to do is going to introduce a dynamic. So we're going to add to the classical Widham-Raunsen model a dynamics, and we'll do it in And we'll do it in such a way that this grand canonical Gibbs measure is the reversible equilibrium of our dynamics. And we're going to do something that is very close to the heat path, to the metropolis dynamics that we did in the previous two lectures, but only slightly differently. I will come to that in a second. I'd like to point out that if the Taurus would have been the infinite plane, then we know. Infinite plane, then we know that there is a phase transition along a certain curve, namely Z is equal to beta times e to the minus pi beta. The pi is just the volume of a, or just the surface of a single disk. And it is known that there is a, if you draw this curve, that starting from a certain value beta critical, there is a phase transition curve in this. There is a phase transition curve in this plane, and it means that if you put your value Z above that plane, you crank up the intensity of the disk so much that they will tend to sort of form a liquid. And if you are below this line, they will be much less dense and they will form what you might be calling a vapor. And there's a line in this plane given by this. Line in this plane given by this formula, except that it starts at beta critical, where this phase transition occurs. And the proof of this was given only a few years after the Winnembrown supermodel was introduced in Ruel and Lebrowitz and Galavotti. And then some 25 years later, Chase and Kotetsky revisited this, proved many more things. Proved many more things, also made a connection with the FK model. So, in this way, the model really entered square into the world of statistical physics, and many interesting questions have been dealt with since then. Now, we are going to always sit close to a phase transition when we want to do metastability. And what we're going to do is we are going to play Do is we are going to place ourselves slightly above this curve, but start the system off in a situation where it is sort of vapor-like. And then we're going to ask ourselves, well, how long is it going to take before starting from a vapor state in a setting where the parameters really want to be, want the system to be in a liquid state, how long is it going to take until? It's going to take until these disks sort of rain into this torus and turn from a vapor into a liquid. And I have to be much more precise about what that exactly means, but that's what we're going to do. And in fact, we're going to sit just above this line and we're going to go down to the right. So it's going to be some kind of low temperature and, as you will see, high density. High density limit because the combination of that curve will force you to be in that regime. But we will get there as we go along. So, this is still the equilibrium setting, and there is no closed form expression known for this critical value, not even good estimates. So, already here you see that finding this critical value is not a trivial thing in the continuum. Now, I'd like to mention that the Widem-Rawlinson model also has a different interpretation. So, I said the Hamiltonian is minus the total overlap of the disk. So, you could say, well, why is that? I mean, isn't that a bit peculiar? So, what does that mean? Well, it's a perfectly nice interaction, Hamiltonia, but it has an interesting. Hamiltonia, but it has an interesting other interpretation: namely, you could start out with the same torus, throw in blue and red disks that have radius one half, and have a situation where you say, I'm going to have a hard core repulsion between the two species and no interaction within a species. Within a species. So if I would say blues may overlap, no, no effect on the Hamiltonian. Reds may overlap, no effect on the Hamiltonian, but there's a hardcore repulsion. Blue and red can never overlap. So a hardcore gas with no attractive interaction, but only hardcore repulsion. And if you then would draw a ball of radius one around these red balls of radius one half, Balls of radius one-half, then the hardcore repulsion says the centers of the blue points cannot go into these spheres. And we would call this the halo of this really, really red disk. And it so happens that if you look at the right picture, you close your, you put on a pair of glasses that only sees red disks, the blown-up red disks, and it doesn't see the blue discs, and you integrate out. And you integrate out over the blue disks because you don't see them, then you exactly get the rhythm-rounds and Hamiltonian because the more the red ones overlap, the more space there is for the blue ones to move around in. And so those configurations will be favored because of entropy. And so there's an exercise that we wrote down that you could see that indeed this hardcore simple two-species model is. Two species model is an equivalent model for the Wynham-Rawlinson model. So there are two ways to actually look at the model. I wanted to mention this. We're not going to use this picture anymore. We'll immediately work with the Willem-Rawlinson model as it was originally introduced. Okay, so far I've only been talking about the Acaribium. About the equilibrium with the Murausen model as it was introduced. And now, what we want to do is to add a dynamics. We'd like to have a continuous time Markov process on this state space of all these centers and unit disks around them. And we're going to consider a very simple Markov process that allows disks to be born and to be born. Discs to be born and to die, and nothing else. So a discs either enters or leaves, but when it is in the box, it's not moving around. It would be great to also look at a model where the disks would be moving around, but we are not capable of dealing with that extra complication. So it's very simple. You look at this disk, you see disks disappearing randomly, you see them being. Randomly, you see them being born, and we are observing what that picture is doing. And we're going to use a metropolis type of dynamics. In fact, we're going to again say you accept when a particle wants to enter at the position x in a current configuration gamma. We're going to see what is the energy if I would have added that. If I would have added that particle minus the energy that it had before I added that particle, I'm not going to take the positive part now, but simply the difference. And that's why this is called not metropolis dynamics, but heat path dynamics. And I'm going to accept that birth of a particle at rate e to the minus beta, very similar as we did before. I'm going to, however, put a z in front of this rate because every particle Because every particle comes with a chemical potential Z. So we want to place that there as well. And we're going to say, well, particles can die at rate one, and they do so independent of where they are, independent of whether there are the particles or not. So the death of particles is a very simple thing. It's the birth that is more difficult, and that when More difficult, and that when you want to enter a particle, you have to see what effect that has on the birth. And this difference is always non-negative, so it's hard to add a particle because it has to conquer new territory. And that means that the overlap is less, and that's why it's difficult to bring in particles. For instance, throwing in the very first particle is already. Throwing in the very first particle is already a hard thing to do because you immediately create a volume that is the volume of a disk. So the first particle has only a rate z e to the minus beta pi to enter. And if beta would be big, that's not easy to do. Okay, so that is our dynamics. And here's the generator. There's a birth and there's also a death when particles are being removed. And this is the usual notation. Usual notation for generators. And what is very important to realize is that this dynamics, as it is chosen here, does have the Widham-Raunusen grand canonical Gibbs measure as its reversible equilibrium. So if this is the way in which particles die or can be born, you will indeed have an equilibrium that is the Widen Raulet. That is the rhythm-rounder model. Okay, now remember that we want to talk about something that involves condensation. And so the way we're going to model this is as follows: I'm going to consider two very special configurations, namely an empty box, and this will symbolize. Will symbolize the configuration where there is no particle inside the torus, the torus is entirely empty, and a black box which will denote any configuration such that the disks completely cover the torus. And we want to think as mathematicians of this as a vapor and this as a liquid. And And that's a fair thing to do because really it describes something that has a really very low density and something that has a high density. Now we're going to start the dynamics in the empty set. So we're going to, in mathematical terms, we're going to prepare the system in a vapor state. We're then going to take a parameter kappa. Take a parameter kappa between zero, between one and infinity times the critical curve. So that was the picture that I said before here. We're going to sit somewhere above this curve. So even though we start in a very vapor-like state, the system in equilibrium would like to be in a liquid state. And then I'm going to I'm going to ask how long does it take for the system to actually fill the box? And when it has done that, you say, well, I went from a gas state to a liquid state. I have condensated. And we're asking how long does that take? And we're going to fix kappa, any number between one and infinity. We're going to sit a factor kappa above. A factor kappa above this critical curve, and then we're going to let beta to infinity, and that will be the metastable regime that we're dealing with. So, we make a very specific choice of what parameters we want to take. And as you will see, this is a low temperature, high intensity limit. And I'll show that in a second. So, our question will be: in that limit, how long does it take? That limit, how long does it take to go from an empty to a full box? And that's our mathematical caricature of condensation. Now, for the particular choice that we're making here, where you say my Z is kappa times Z C, and I recall that Z C was known in the Widow-Rauncosim model. It's beta times e to the minus pi beta, pi being the. Being the surface of a single disk. If I substitute this into the grand canonical Gibbs measure, I see that the Gibbs measure keeps its reference measure, which is the Poisson process. The Z to the power the number of particles will become kappa beta to the number of particles in the disk in the torus. And the volume here, so if I take that factor out, what actually is left then from the Hamiltonian combined with the nth power of this term is that really what you get is the volume of the halo of this configuration. And let me go back to this picture here. You have a bunch of points, you have unit disks. A bunch of points, you have unit disks around it, they overlap, and the halo of this configuration, which we call H of gamma, is just the set that is being covered by the disks. And the volume of the halo, V gamma, is the volume of the covered set by the disks. So, in the end, in the particular metastable regime that we're looking at, Meta-stable regime that we're looking at, we find that our grand canonical measure is given by this, where this is the volume of the halo of the disk configuration. This counts the number of disks. And since beta will be coming very large, we're really talking about a very high density regime where many disks in the in the in the In the torus will be favored, and that has to do with the fact that really the system wants to condense. So, we're favoring condensation, but we're still starting from something that has a very low density. And I'm about to go to the break. The Dirichlet form, which plays a very important role, as you Important role, as you've seen before, because of the Dirichlet principle and the Thomson principle, can be written out as follows. There's a test function. I don't call it a phi, but an f, again, to mark that we're living in a different world. There's an integral with respect to the Poisson reference measure. There's an integral over where a next particle can land, and then there are these factors. And then there are these factors here coming from this term here in the Gibbs measure. It so happens that you have to evaluate this at gamma plus the extra particle that you add at x. And then there's the square of the difference of your test function. So here is a very explicit Dirislet form over all point configurations, an extra particle, the volume of the halo that you have. Volume of the halo that you have, the number of particles in the halo that you have, some parameters, and this is the quantity that you have to work with. And this is a high-dimensional integral that we will have to understand in order to make our way to a description of the metastable behavior. Because, as you know, minimizing the Dirichlet form will give you the capacity, and the capacity is the key to understand. Capacity is the key to understanding the metastable cross over time. So that is the setting that we're dealing with. And here again, I'm very, very quickly throwing old formulas at you where you say the capacity is just obtained by minimizing your Dirichlet form subject to the right boundary conditions on where you want to start and where you want to end up with. With and the mean metastable crossover time is given by a formula that essentially only involves the capacity. And here is something very trivial, which is this is some constant because if there's no disk around, there's no cardinality, there's no halo, and this is just something very trivial. So it's all about the capacity, and it's all about understanding this very. Understanding this variation of formula, and that's what we are going to do. So I'm going to stop here and after the break, I will tell you what the heuristics is that we expect to happen and then what the three main theorems are. And I'll tell you a little bit about what their background is. You a little bit about what their background is and having a little bit of an outlook on the future. So let's have a break here, Ed. Okay, thanks, Frank. So there was a many discussion going on about whether or not beta C is the critical value for percolation, that is infinitely many disks, as opposed to a complete phase transition. And no, it is not. I mean, it's much more complicated because there's. It's much more complicated because there's really interaction between the disks going on. It's not just the threshold for percolation because the disks interact. Right. Okay, are there questions for Frank before we go to a real break, which we will? Yes. So in the phase diagram that you had, is it clear that? So you have this uh picture of uh the critical Z thing being unimodal. Is this easy to understand? Uh well this is a liquid and vapor on one side of yeah well actually it can be understood more easily if you go back to this double picture where you say there would be a chemical activity for the blue and the red. Activity for the blue and the red, and then the phase transition occurs when those two chemical activities are the same. And then, once you go from this picture where the phase transition is just a line where the two chemical activities are the same, because there's no beta here, because the only interaction is hardcore repulsion. If you then go to this picture here where you integrate out, you see that equality between the chemical potentials boils down to exactly Boils down to exactly this formula here. So, the computation behind that is not easy and it's not difficult at all. It's very straightforward. The only thing that is difficult is that the phase transition really only happens above a certain critical value, and we have no closed form for that value. There are some bounds, rough bounds. De Reudre has some bounds on that, but it's not. Some balance on that, but it's not really no explicit form yet. So Kemlin asks, he says it's a stupid question, but he wants to know how we interpret the birth and death of a particle from physics. That's again, no, that's a very good question. And it's again related to what I was talking about when I was talking about. Talking about when I was talking about Kawasaki dynamics, you may think of your torus as really living in a big reservoir. And this reservoir has other particles around, and these particles may move into your box, which is in this case a torus, or move out of it. So the birth and death is something that reflects the presence of a reservoir. Of course, a true reservoir is different. Is different. I mean, the distorus has periodic boundary conditions. We did that for mathematical reasons. And then you would say, well, a particle would sort of migrate into it. So particles are start to move. Whereas in your model, we're not making the particles move. We do that because we don't know how to deal for now with the model with the motion. So birth and death is a way of mimicking the presence of a reservoir. The presence of a reservoir. And if you want to condensate, these disks have to come from somewhere to really do the condensation. So, this is a way of modeling the reservoir, but the reservoir is sort of gone. It's replaced by parameters and we've made it even a periodic boundary condition just to make life nicer for mathematical reasons. So, a good mathematical Mathematical, an honest to good mathematical way of modeling the effect of a reservoir. Ifardat is asking whether it's obvious that the partition function is well defined. That is not a problem because we're in a finite set. This Hamiltonian, if you add more and more parts. If you add more and more particles, it's going to really make it small. So, indeed, if you sum over all possible values of gamma and you start to integrate, this is indeed a finite thing. In fact, this partition sum can be computed in closed form, and it doesn't suffer from any of the problems that would not exist. But that's because we're dealing with a finite. But that's because we're dealing with the finite volume, which people were forgetting in the chat. Yeah. Okay. Okay, maybe we'll take a real break, give Frank a chance to stretch, and the rest of us as well. We'll come back in three to four minutes. Thanks. Very good.     There's a question from Omer about the two-color model, whether or not you include overlaps there, or whether there's just the one parameter. In the two-color model, the only so that's a model where there's no attraction between the discs, there's only hardcore repulsion between the red and the blue. So that's a really hardcore gas with no attraction. And if you then close your eyes and you don't see, close, let's say, your right eye. See, close, let's say, your right eye, and you don't look at one of the species. What you see that the other species is doing is exactly the Willem-Raunuson model, where there's an effective interaction coming from the fact that you integrate out over the other type, over the other species. And it exactly produces the Widen-Raunus model. Okay, there's an ongoing discussion, but actually there's a rather nice exercise there on Poisson thinning where you can derive one model from the other and it proceeds rather cleanly and quite nicely. Okay, Frank, why don't you start the second part of your course, of your talk today, final part of the course? Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. So, I want to talk about three theorems and, you know, working our way up to these theorems, we should first step back one second and say, what should we be expecting to happen? So, we're having a system of particles. They have a tendency to stick together. There's this attractive interaction because the more they overlap, the lower the energy is. So, I should. So, I should expect that these particles are going to form some kind of droplet. Well, okay, let's see what that means. Now, inside this droplet, particles are distributed according to a Poisson process because whenever you throw a particle inside a halo, I'm not changing the halo. And so, a particle falling on Falling on top of already existing particles is not going to pay any energetic cost. And I know that the chemical activity is kappa beta. So that's a large number because kappa is a fixed number between one and infinity. And beta is going to be large. So I'm going to see a droplet that is very dense inside. Many particles are sort of overlapping. Now, near the perimeter of the droplet. The perimeter of the droplet, particles stick out, and they are born at the rate that depends on how much they would stick out if they are being born. Because if you stick out, you're going to increase the halo. That's going to be difficult to do. So particles will try to sort of conquer what is around the critical droplet, but they will have a hard time doing that. At the same time, particles At the same time, particles are raining in at a high rate, kappa beta. So they are sort of bombarding this droplet and trying to make it grow. And it turns out that if the droplet has a radius r, roughly, well, there is no such thing as a perfectly round droplet as of overlapping this, but let's, you know, for the sake of argument, do that. Then it will turn out that if r is small, this droplet. R is small, this droplet has a tendency to shrink, and if r is large, it has a tendency to grow. And how much it likes to grow or not depends on the curvature of the droplet. So the flatter a droplet is, the easier it is to grow, because if you stick out and you're very flat, you're not sticking out so much. On the other hand, if your droplet is very curved, That is very curved when you try to stick out a unit disc, it's going to have more surface sticking out. And there's a balance between at what curvature this droplet of roughly radius r has a tendency to grow or to shrink. And we will see that there is a very neat threshold value in this critical regime where that crossover is taking place. Is taking place. And that's kind of the rough thing that you're saying. Well, we're looking for some kind of high density, more or less circular droplet, and let's see whether that is true or not. And in fact, I'm now going to come to the three main theorems that we prove for this model. And they are theorems that are Are theorems that are very much of a metastability flavor? Like, and in order to do that, I need to talk about a parameter R, and this is supposed to mean something like a perfect disks of radius R, even though in our model, it's not possible to put unit disk on top of each other so that you get a perfect round disk. But nevertheless, this will be a good approximate argument. Nevertheless, this will be a good approximate argument. And there will be a function of R that is given by the volume minus kappa times the volume of the same ball with one radius less. And the one here comes from the fact that we are talking about unit disks. And if you plot that, it has a shape that is parabolic like this. It achieves a maximum at the value at the radius that is kappa over kappa minus one. And remember that kappa is a number between one and infinity. So this is a number larger than one and less than infinity. And it and this thing, basically, this is the energy, well, I would say the free energy of a configuration. Of a configuration that would, where the unit disk would form something close to a ball of radius r, a disk of radius r. And you see, there's a certain threshold where there's the highest value. And if we start with an empty box, we are sort of saying there's no particle. When I throw in my first particle, which sooner or later has to happen, I have a radius one. And so this is sort of And so, this is sort of the meta stable state. And again, if your droplet is very, very big and starts to basically cover your entire torus, that means that you're going to go down in energy somewhere around here. And this picture is very reminiscent of the barriers that we saw were appearing in the Kawasaki dynamics and barriers that were appearing in the Glauber dynamics on random graphs. Howdynamics on random graphs. And again, here, this is the sort of the energy of a droplet of size R. Now, with these simple notations, we can state first in the picture what actually the critical droplet will be. What will happen is that you draw a disk of radius RC kappa, so that's this. RC kappa, so that's this explicit radius. And you're trying to throw inside this disk something like kappa beta particles, so order beta particles. And what will happen is that the boundary of this collection of unit disks is not going to be a perfect disk, it's going to be a disk. Perfect disk, it's going to be a little bit bumpy near the boundary. And it is that bumpiness that describes the full set of critical droplets that actually form the barrier for the nucleation. And it turns out, and that this requires a much deeper analysis, is that of the beta particles that are inside the box, approximately Inside the box, approximately beta to the one-third particles are sticking out of the boundary, and all the rest is not seeing the boundary at all. They form a kind of reservoir that is there, and it is the boundaries on the part, the particles on the boundary, which are much less and turn out to be of order beta to the one-third, where the action is that tries to grow the droplet, push it out. Grow the droplet, push it outside, but they're also dying, and there's other particles coming in and trying to push this particle outside. And so, what is happening is that as long as you have created something that is smaller than this critical disk, your tendency would be to all disappear again and go back to the vapor state. You try, and it's very hard to do many times unsuccessfully to create some. Times unsuccessfully to create something like this, and once you've managed to create this, then the disk is going to grow and go over the hill. And again, you see here that this critical, the real critical droplet is not simple at all. It's not a perfect disk. It's something that is very bumpy. And this bumpiness represents an interesting geometry that you have to really deal with in order to get your hands. To get your hands on the metastable crossover time. And in fact, in an early paper, in a physics paper by Stillinger and Weeks, they were trying to describe something like this, and they were ignoring all sorts of terms and said, well, what should be happening near the boundary is something that you might think of as some kind of wave, a random wave, and they were calling this capillary waves. And in essence, this isn't. And in essence, this is an attempt to understand surface tension. So, what we are trying to do here is really building a rigorous mathematical theory for surface tension, what is happening at the interface between an empty region and a full region. So, here is the first theorem. It is a refinement of what could be Refinement of what could be called an Arrhenius formula. And it turns out that in order to go from empty to full, you must create this critical droplet. And the time for you to do that will have two terms. There is a term of order beta. Beta goes to infinity. And there's a certain volume term here. And this is computable. It turns out to be a very simple thing. It's simply the simply the the value here at the top of this um of this uh this parabola and then there is a correction which turns out to be beta to the one-third times something and this term is a surface free energy so this term arises because there the the critical droplet is not a perfect A perfect disk. It is a bumpy disk. And the bumpiness, there are about beta to the one-third particles near the boundary. And this bumpiness gives rise to this correction term. So you could think of this as a kind of just like we were talking before, there's a pre-factor in front of an exponential term. Well, now the prefactor is a bit more serious. It's e to the beta to the one-third, so it's big. To the beta to the one-third, so it's big, and we have managed to show that this term is also computable. It is as a function of kappa, here it is, a very explicit form, times a certain constant. And this constant here is a whole world in itself. In order for us to compute this constant, we have to do lots of Lots of work. There's mesoscopic and microscopic problems, and it's going into the nitty-gritty of what is happening near the boundary. If a particle sticks out, well, by how much is it sticking out of all the other particles? So, what is the effect on the halo? And that depends on all the other particles around it. And so, we have to come to grips. To come to grips with what that is, we even have to come to grips with the fact that you say there are some conditions on the center of this particle for it to be able to stick out of the other particles at all. Otherwise, it's not a boundary particle. So there's a whole beautiful and deep and exciting story behind this constant, which I'm sort of smuggling under the rug here. And the main Struggling under the rug here. And the main message is: there is a volume contribution and there is a surface contribution. And they come with different powers of beta. The power beta to the one-third is interesting here. And there are explicit forms for these functions as a function of kappa. Frank, Siemak, there was a discussion that started with the question with Semaka. It started with the question with Semak about the power one-third. Is there a way to understand that at some intuitive level? Yeah, and it has to do at the end. I will come to discuss what this would do in higher dimensions. If I go to higher dimensions, it will change. And the beta to the one-third is really a two-dimensional exponent here. And it has a lot to do with when I stick out, how much does that cost? When I stick out, how much does that cost? How much is there then that I eat away from the boundary? But the total boundary is fixed. So it comes out of a certain balance, which is not very simple to explain, but I will show later that this one-third would change if you go to other dimensions. So it is specific for the two-dimensional setting. It's also specific for the fact that we're dealing with disks. Specific for the fact that we're dealing with disks. Okay, now you can plot these functions as a function of kappa, and you see that if kappa gets very large, you're beginning to become very super saturated. So the time is all going to get shorter because the more supersaturated it is, the quicker you're driven through this critical droplet. But the main message is there's a volume term and a surface term. Volume term and a surface term. The volume term is simple, and the surface term is very, very deep and very interesting. And it led us to many interesting things living in the background. Well, there's a second theorem. Here's an exponential law. I mentioned before, I didn't show this for the other models, but the exponential law is a very universal law. You have to prove it, it's not for free. It's not for free, but this says if beta goes to infinity, the true crossover time divided by its mean is just going to be exponentially distributed. And the reason is, again, very simple. You try to grow a droplet, you fail. You go back to the empty box. You try again. And the time that you finally go over is exponentially distributed because you have to try many. You have to try many, many times before you succeed. So, the gas is very quickly trying to invade this torus, but it's not succeeding until it has created a sufficiently large droplet on which the rest of the particles can rain on and fill the box. So, very much what you see in condensation phenomenon. And the third theorem is also interesting. I didn't write a theorem. I didn't write a theorem like this in the other two cases, but it's also true. Theorem three says: as you go from the empty to the full box, you must move through this critical droplet. So this critical droplet is not just any funny way of condensating, it is the way to condensate. And the way it is formulated, it says you take a ball. You take a ball of a radius a little less or a little more than this RC, and you look at the set of all configurations where the halo is completely contained in the slightly bigger ball and completely contains the slightly smaller ball. And this theorem says if you are on your way from empty to full, so if you know that you have left empty and you will never come back. Left empty and you will never come back, then with probability tending to one, you must hit this set before you have achieved your full condensation. So this critical droplet really is your gateway to the nucleation. There is no, yeah, of course, you could fill your box by you know, by row by row, but that is not going to happen. That's too unlikely. And in fact, we can make And in fact, we can make this little perturbation of the sphere very small. It can go to zero as long as it doesn't go to zero, like one over square root of beta. And so we have a very precise description of what you must go through when you want to condensate. So these three theorems together tell you how long does it take. Tell you how long does it take. The law is exponential. And here is your critical droplet. You must go through it. It's the most difficult thing to do, but it's the easiest among all the difficult things to do. So that's what the description really is. Okay, I'm going to finish in maybe five or ten minutes. As I said, it's As I said, the proof behind this is a beautiful and long story. In fact, the four of us are currently, and many years have been referring to it as a beautiful nightmare. There are wonderful mathematical things coming our way, variational principles, isoparametric inequalities, some very classical ones, some more recent ones. In order to understand the leading order term, we need volume. Term, we need volume large deviations, we need surface moderate deviations in order to understand the fluctuations of this boundary. And basically, what we need to do is to take our Dirichlet form, integrate out over all the particles that are inside. We are then left with a high-dimensional integral of particles on the boundary. We need to understand. The boundary, we need to understand their distribution, and there are lots of constraints. If a particle is not positioned well, it will not be a boundary particle at all. So, there are constraints that we have to deal with. There's interactions, because where we put the boundary particles will determine what the weight is in our Dirichlet form. And we need microscopic descriptions, we need mesoscopic. Descriptions, we need mesoscopic descriptions, we need all sorts of approximations, coarse graining techniques, capacity estimates. It's a beautiful story, but a story that is a very long ride. And so there really is no way in which I could give you a quick fix on this. But along the way, we encounter many things. Sometimes we see. Many things sometimes we say jokingly to each other: it seems like you need half of mathematics to actually deal with this. And more is being added all the time. And it's a beautiful story, but we need a lot of courage to actually finish it. So it's very foundational stuff that is going on. Okay, I'd like to throw two more slides at you to. To say, well, okay, this was a story about unit disks in R2. What's happening when I want to go to D-dimensions? I mean, Siamak already posed the question, where does the beta to the one-third come from? Now, I'm going to state a formula here, which is for the moment nothing more than a conjecture. We have no idea really how to prove this yet, but we How to prove this yet, but we believe that what will happen if you go to D-dimensions and you would be using D-dimensional unit balls rather than unit disks in two dimensions, that your crossover time would again have a term that is of order beta with a function that is again, well, there was something like pi kappa over kappa minus one, but the kappa is replaced by By a kappa hat that is a power of kappa. It's the kappa to the power 1 over d minus 1. So if d is 2, kappa hat is equal to kappa, and we get the old formula back, and a is pi. And a here would be something simply related to the volume of the unit ball. And I didn't even bother to write that down. And we believe that there would be a correction term that would be beta to the power d minus 1. Okay. power d minus one okay sorry this should be divided by d plus one i'm sorry about that and if d is equal to two then that will be giving you the one-third and there will be a surface term which apart from some constant which is probably very deep will take a very simple form as a function of kappa again first in terms of kappa hat and if you And if you take the case d is equal to 2, then this will kappa hat becomes kappa, this becomes 1, this becomes kappa to the minus 1/3, and you get back the formula as we saw it before. So this is what we believe is the case, but there is a dream that one day we will be able to prove this, and with Yogesh, we have started to think about that, and maybe this part is still doable. Part is still doable because it's the leading order term. And here the challenges would be much bigger. But it's nice to see that the scaling in beta and in kappa is going to really be dimension dependent. And we have even asked with Jogish, and we're at the beginning of starting to brainstorm about this, what would happen if you would replace your unit disks in the plane, for instance, by a nice By a nice convex, compact set. Maybe this set would require some symmetries, maybe not. Can you first of all prove that there is still a phase transition? Yes, in many cases you can. And what would then be the scaling? And it turns out that, again, only conjectural at this level that the scaling with beta and kappa, so the various powers that come up. The various powers that come up will depend on the shape of the set that you're taking. So, if you say I take a ball and then I take an ellipse, nothing much is going to change. But suppose you go and make it a square, something that is not smooth at the boundary, maybe a triangle, then it seems that all these powers of beta and kappa are going to change. So, if you qualitatively change the time. Qualitatively change the type of set, then you in general may and will affect the powers of beta and kappa. And this is a story that we're sort of trying to understand at this moment very roughly. And there is some hope that in the long run, we will be able to repeat some of the things that we have done so much in detail for the plan. Much in detail for the planar case. So, I conclude by saying at least for the unit disk planar case, we have obtained a detailed description of metastability for a very particular particle system in the continuum, the Wyndham-Raunus model, and a very particular dynamics, birth and death, and no motion. And we see that there is a volume contribution and there's a There is a volume contribution and there's a surface contribution. And especially the surface contribution has a great depth. There's a deep geometry story behind what the critical droplet looks like. And it's quite a long climb to do. But along the way, there's beautiful mathematical tools that come along the way. And I think it is worth the challenge to really try. To really try and pinpoint down metastability in a continuum interacting particle system. So, thank you very much for your attention. Well, thanks a lot, Frank. It was another wonderful lecture. So, Sarah is going to allow us to unmute ourselves. And so, the first item of business is to thank
