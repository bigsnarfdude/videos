collaboration with of course a few students and a bunch of other people Sanjay Amorgania is really kind of the main junior driver in between Nicola and my groups so it's really since Frank already gave the introduction I don't want to donate but the point is that I But the point is that understanding dynamics of systems is kind of important because in order to understand it, we need to understand eigenstates of interacting systems. And understanding eigenstates of interacting systems rather than ground states is very complicated. And it's complicated theoretically, numerically, and experimentally. And that's why really kind of progress in this field is actually done. Done by principles and conjectures. They come through our understanding. So finding something exact in dynamics is hard and hence important. And also, of course, what brings it to be timely is that there's the beginning of a lot of you know people say it can be done in cold atoms and that usually used to be a joke, but in this case it's really not a joke. There's time crystal and many biologicalization experiments. Crystal and many biologization experiments, sometimes with vague conclusions that are coming out of many groups, but there's likely to be much more action on this soon. So now this doesn't work. Okay. There is this. Let's see. Okay, well this might be a very short talk. Does anybody know how to does anybody know how to do this? I think draw the switching wind off and off. Pretty sure it didn't run a battery. I'm pretty sure it is. Can you press escape? I think you're just selecting somehow textured. The problem is the escape doesn't work. It's probably like, you know, some of this, yeah, you think like it works now. Some of this technology that we. Some of this technology that we've got here. That's really good. Okay, so basically, what we're gonna, what I want to talk about when this starts working is a set of exact solutions for eigenstates in the middle of the spectrum. And I don't want to identify my keyboard. No. Okay. And I think this crash. Um you see it's basically like it wants to identify the Canadians want to identify something and it's uh and I don't want to. So let's see. Okay, this is what I'm going to talk about and let's see if this okay this is okay. This works. So Frank already talked about this. Basically there's a principle that guides kind of our understanding of excited states and that's called the And that's called the Godisti or the ETH hypothesis. But for the purpose of this talk, basically, I'm going to focus a lot on the predictions of this hypothesis for the von Leumann entropy. And also this hypothesis, for example, and I'll show some examples. So you start with a simple state, with a simple initial state, such as low entanglement state, a product state, or some other state. And you kind of time evolve it, the entropy, its entropy grows linearly. Entropy, its entropy grows linearly with time. And the prediction of the eigenstate organization hypothesis, four states in the middle of the spectrum, so somewhere sitting here, is that the entropy has a volume law. And as Frank said, strong Eth say that all the eigenstates at finite energy density satisfy the ETH. And now there's only basically, there's only two known examples. Basically, there's only two known examples so far of how EKH can be broken. One of them is manybody localization, and the other one is integrable systems. And Hamiltonians without the extensive number of conserved quantities are thought to satisfy strong Eth. And here, integrable systems and many body localized systems, I will look at them as kind of being similar with the fact that many body localized systems are thought to be kind of stable integrable in the sense that you move away a little bit in parameter space and they A little bit in parameter space, and they remain kind of integral. So it's basically really kind of the same story, a violation of ETH in these two systems. So the question is, is there a third way to violate ETH? And is there a paradigm of ergodicity breaking beyond this interferometability and many body localization? And of course, this kind of like going into the papers that appeared after. Papers that appeared after this ATLT example, they've linked it to these so-called scars, which are basically trajectories that are non-chaotic in classical billiard balls, etc. Okay, so how do we find another way of breaking Eth? Well, this problem is not easy. First of all, why isn't it easy? Because we don't have the quantitative skills to solve for eigenstates in the middle of the spectrum. Spectrum. And so far, you know, there's no model that has exactly solvable eigenstates in the middle of the spectrum that's not integrable, right, or MBL integrable. So hence, the results for these states in the middle of the spectrum, like the eigenstate normalization hypothesis, are basically smart conjectures supported by large-scale numerical calculations. But I want to basically tell you that, well, this is now all news. That, well, this is now old news, but two years ago we found basically the first set of exact eigenstates that basically interpolate between the ground state and the excited states in a non-integrable system. And we didn't know about these SCARS experiments, but a couple of months later, and very much independently, these were actually called the SCARS that Sergey Naban and Papich basically said to model these experiments in ripper atoms. Okay. For atoms. Okay, so this is the first part of the talk: the spin 1AKLT. And this is where this kind of the model where we found this case, sort of by putting around and looking through the model, but I'll present it in a different way. So the one-dimensional EKLT model is a sum of projectors, non-commuting projectors, so it's not a stabilizer code. And it's a nearest neighbor projector in a spin-1 model that basically Projecture in a spin one model that basically projects onto the spin two state of two adescent spin one. And it gives the zero and one states of the two adescent summed spins zero energy and gives this some energy, which we'll call one. And you can write in a familiar form like this is the s dot s term and a biquadratic s dot s square term. Now of course this model is Now, of course, this model is known as kind of a famous model. It basically proves the halting gap. For most models, you know, you weren't able to prove a lower bound for the halting, for the gap, but really, AKLT and the people on the paper basically proved that there is a gap and it's bounded from below for this model. And it's got a ground-state prototype SPT wave function. It's basically the kind of generic. Special example of matrix product state wave functions. So, the ground state has a lot of properties that are very interesting. So, let's find out what the ground state is. Well, of course, everybody knows what the ground state is. And it's best written in this Schringer-Boson type degrees of freedom, where basically I take a spin one on each side and decompose it into a symmetrized two spin one halves here. And then between spin one half, between two spin one halves, Between spin one halves, between two spin one halves, which symmetrize form to spin one, I form a singlet between two ads and sites. And if I form a singlet, you can then see that the spin one between two adescent sites cannot be in the spin two configuration because I have just one spin one half left. So these have form a singlet, this has spin one half left, two spin one half can only be zero and one. And hence, this means that the projector I defined before to be part of the Hamiltonian, the Hamiltonian sum of these. Part of the Hamiltonian, the Hamiltonian sum of these nearest neighbor projectors gives exactly zero on any configuration that has a singlet between these two spin one-halves. And irrespective of whether this is up-down or whether this is up-down, if there's a spin one-half here, this is zero. And this is the most important thing that you have to remember for all the proofs of this first part to work. Okay, and of course, on the spin two configuration, it gives exactly the spin to configuration, and this is the projector. So then it's very clear to see. Clear to see with a little bit of positivity that the ground state is really just a dimerized chain of these singlets. So this, you know, who's been on half form a singlet, synergizing with this other guy who has formed a singlet with the next, etc. And it's a state of energy zero. And of course, this model, you also know its highest excited state, which is the ground state of minus the Hamiltonian. And this is the fully ferromagnetic state with all spins up. So this is the most fundamental thing that you. So, this is the most fundamental thing that you have to remember. So, because the ground state is known, people think this model is special and integrable. It's not. Here is the level statistics of the energy level separated by quantum numbers in some quantum number sector of this model. And they clearly show level repulsion basically perfectly. Wigner-Dyson-level statistics. And the model is not integral, even though the ground state can be written exactly. The ground state can be written exactly. There's many models like this, for example, how they pseudo-potentials in two dimensions. There are ground state, which is a fraction of quantum Holocaust and zero energy, but they're not integrable. Many other ones, Shastri-Suttlement, Mutunda Gauss, etc. Sorry? The eigens, the Schuyler Gauss? Yeah, so it's it has Wigner-Eigen level statistics in some, you know, in that case the major tilments are real, I guess, so real ensemble. It's a real ensemble. But I'm not, Nicola has probably more comments about the statistics. I don't know exactly, but they do have, they show basically the same, not interval. Thank you. Okay, so now what you do is, you know, you just kind of ask, are there any other states besides the ground state that can be found? So, how are you going to find this? Well, the easiest way to find something special is to look at it. And what you do. To look at it. And what you do is you basically find the spectrum for some sizes of the Hamiltonian and look at the spectrum. And if you're autistic enough, what you find is that you've got several states that kind of scream at you. And these several states look in energy like this. So this is for 16 sites, but the moral of the story is that these energies do not vary as you increase or decrease the number. Vary as you increase or decrease the number of sites. Of course, if you go to two sites, you might not have some of these energies because the spectrum is small. But for this size of the system, you have around 3 to the 16, roughly with some quantum number of sectors, 3 to the 16 states, and a 3 to the 16 by 3 to the 16 matrix will be very hard pressed to find eigenvalues that are integer. But yet in this model, you do find eigenvalues that are integer with machine precision, and that's the first thing that's basically. First thing that's basically striking, and you know, how really along with Nicolau, we now look at all the models that, you know, first thing that we do on all the models that have, that we want to find something interesting in. The second thing that we found in this is that if you look at, you know, you ask, well, how many states really have sparse entanglement spectrum? And by sparse, I mean not Schmidt values that are close to really Schmidt values that are close to zero, but really exactly zero. And you give a definition, 10%, whatever, of the full space, or 5% of the full Hilbert space. You look at those states. And then you find matching that these states that have this type of integer energies have also very sparse syntactic spectrum. And then you've got something. Okay, so then these states, notice, are very close to the ground. Notice are very close to the ground state, and this state I'm going to call it the Arova state because this state was found before us. It's a state, it's basically a single mode approximation state. Really? Just a compound. Very good. It's a single mode approximation state, and it's functional for us. And these are, I'm not going to write their expression, but we have exact expressions for every state written in this table for all these energies. For all these energies. But the states that I want you to look at is the states in red, which are low-lying states, but they can see that they immediately form a tower of states which interpolates between the ground state energy and the fair magnetic high-state energy. And these are the states that I want you to look at. So before you go on, do you know the distribution or you know you have three to the 16 many states? These are very few. Very few. This is a spin two state, so it's got five states by spin symmetry. Five states by spin symmetry. This is spin four states, so it's got nine states. So then basically, it's like it's a linear. But I'll get to the second part of my talk where I'll give you an exponential number of them, like Professor Pullman did. But these are indeed this first example is just a small size of the hyperspace. But the beauty of proving something doesn't work is you only need one example. That's math, not physics. What? I never thought that I would hear from you. This is not me doing math. Okay, so let's see how we find these states. Okay, so I claim that the first state and the kind of we claim that the first Kind of the claim that the first statement, the prototype for it, is you take a spin one operator at site n and you square it and you hit the ground state with it. And what this does is, of course, it's a local operator, and it basically just does, you know, it can't, you know, the ground state was this singlet. It breaks up these two singlets and makes it spin to localized excitation here. Okay? And everything else is featureless ground state background. Okay? Okay, now you take the Hamiltonian, you hit this state with it, and you find that remarkably the Hamiltonian has scattering only in two configurations. Why? This is very easy, because remember, every projector, the Hamiltonian is a sum of projectors, every projector that acts on the ground state configuration, which has a singlet will give you zero. So the only way it can give you non-zero is the projector acts here, and the projector acts here. So there's two states, two scattering terms. Okay? And moreover, these scattering terms are just. These scattering terms are just a translation of one another. So you get this. If you get to the I KLT Hamiltonian here, this part will give you this term, and acting it on this part will give you this term. Everything else will be zero. Scattering equation, very simple. And now you notice that since I have the same, the Hamiltonian is h times this is equal to this plus this plus this, okay? But these two are translated by one side, so if I form a pi-momentum combination, they'll cancel. momentum combination they'll cancel. Okay so that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to take, we're going to take, so that's what we did, we took a pi-momentum combination of this operator, this cancels the scattering term, and you remain with a diagonal term of energy 2. I'm going to call this operator P. It's not a projector. This operator P is a momentum pi combination of a spin 2 Magnon. Okay? Now it turns out that's the first state of energy 2. It turns out that's the first state of energy 2. And you take this operator, you take it to the nth power, that's a state of n spin 2 magnons. And this is an eigenstate also, the Hamiltonian, remarkably, of energy 2n, spin 2n, for all even L. Okay? So which of these is a is one of these is a a robust state? No, none of these are aeroba states. A robust state was is a is a momentum pi combination of two different speed with some other coefficients. Two difference between some other coefficients. It's not, yeah, none of these are the aerobust states, yeah. So we started looking at it because we knew that this aeroba state exists, and we were like, oh, well, maybe some other state exists. And immediately, once you look at the spectrum, it becomes painfully clear that there's all these states which are eigenstates. Okay, so now you have an exact expression for these eigenstates, and you ask, what are the implications for the th? Well, I'm not going to bore you with the details, but because you have all these tower states, These all these tower states at constant energy difference between them, you can write them down as the exact matrix product state with a small bond dimension. Turns out the bond dimension is 2 times n plus 1. And then you can find a bound immediately for some, for if you have finite density of magnons, you can find the exact expression. If you have infinite density of magnons, so n over l goes to constant when l goes to infinity, you can find a bound. When L goes to infinity, you can find the bound is 2, it's log of 2n plus 1, and hence the entanglement entropy is log L defined the ETH prediction, which is S. By the way, since these eigenstates are kind of separated by energy 2, 4, etc., you might ask if this operator that creates the state has a combination has a spectrum generated algebra equation with a Hamiltonian. It doesn't. With a Hamiltonian. It doesn't, because if it did, all the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, every state would be at energy 2. They're not. So we call it this restricted spectrum generating algebra that satisfies this only when you apply this to the ground state. So this is true if I don't have the ground state, and if I put any other state, there is not true. Okay, so first thing is this defies kind of the GTH prediction, is the log L, and it's very easily seen, it's kind of a plot of the diagram. Plot of the dynamic entropy versus energy. You can see kind of you know ground state, and then you can see the CTH prediction, which is satisfied by most states in this model. And you can see our, let's call them scar states, adopting a language that was invented about a couple of months after the publication of this paper. So these are the scar states which have low entanglement and you know they show up at And they show up at even energy and a superposition of these special eigenstates. Of course, if I take just the equal superposition, it will never thermalize, et cetera. Of course, being that they're eigenstates. Now, so, so far what did I show you? I showed you that you can have models where you can find a very small number of exact eigenstates in the spectrum. These are you know polynomial number of them in a spectrum that's exponential in length, that are exact, that violate, that have logarithm assumptions. Violated have logarithm and sub-volume entanglement entropy. But now I want to show you that, and this was actually also pointed out by Frank Stock, that basically you can find models where there's not only one set of Eigen states, there's an exponential one, and the situation becomes much richer. Go ahead. Because an epsilon perturbation away from the An epsilon perturbation away from the AKT limit, they will immediately also show a volume law? Well, so of course you know you're asking me a question we cannot answer. Because we can answer it only numerically, and in our paper we did numerically, we did, you know, while you of course are going to find some volume law, it might be that you find the same volume law as the PXP model, the Serbian Papich and Apanin, whose scarce data. Abanen, whose scars dates are not exact, so they certainly have a volume law, but the coefficient is not the one given by ETH. But of course, as you know very well, it's a question that we cannot answer exactly, so because for obvious reasons, because the states are not exact anymore. I think you are supposed to tell us why they are not MDL and integral, right? In order to say this is a new mechanism. I told you that they're not integrable, the model is not integrable. The model is not integrable. But how about MBL? Well. There's no disorder here. The model is perfectly translation invariant. So that would add MBL? I mean... I don't know. I mean, usually localization implies, you know, in MBL, you have to add a bit disorder, otherwise... Really? I thought the whole MBL is not supposed to be related to disorder. Well, otherwise you're just holding an interactive system. I mean, but yeah, so MBL is the. But yeah, so NPL is the statement that localization is stable with interactions. So localization, as Anderson, localization has this sort of. So it's certainly a translation invariant model. This one. Every state would be equal as right. It's only a small number of states. Yeah, it's... Yeah, okay, so that's also right. But this model is clearly. AKLT is not an MBL model. But yeah, as Donbick said, it would be localized. Every state would be localized in an MBL model. Here's just a small model. Localized in an MDL model. Here's just a small number of them. Thank you. Very good. Any more questions? Okay. So, this is the experiment that was basically performed. I'm not going to, because I don't know a lot about the experiment, so I'm not going to go through it. But basically, what was found later was that this model, which looks very simple, but it's actually non-integrable. But it's actually non-integrable. It basically kills every configuration with two adiescent spin-ups. So it basically just has a hopping between spin-down configuration on which these two projectors are one, flips the spin in the middle from up to down, and this is the model, basically. This model has a special set of Eigen states, approximate, not exact, approximate. Exact, approximate, that basically show anomalous dynamics. So, if you start, if you initialize a charge density wave configuration like this, you're going to find revivals basically. If you look at, if you initialize it and do the time evolution, you're going to find that its overlap with other states of the system goes up and down as a function of time. So, basically, these states are kind of like the scar states. Of, like, the scar states, there's a lot. There's, I'll show you how many of them there are here. For example, you can see this plot, like, you think of this plot as the intangible entropy plot that I showed you for the AKLT. It's just that the AKLT state has, you know, the semi-circle law. This part was much, much nicer than in this model. But you can think of this as, you know, this plot, this plot, with these things being the scars states. So these are, these. These are these initial charge density configurations basically time evolved and have some overlap with some other charge density configurations. But basically, in this PXP model, there's also a set of scars. They're approximate. They're also separated by the same energy. And it was shown that basically are also kind of composed of momentum pi quasi-particle. So that's very similar. Momentum pi quasi-particle, so that's very similar to the ACLT. So it bears the question whether there's a larger principle behind it. So because we're at a fracton conference, I thought I'd put in some fracton slides. So this type of breaking up of the Hilbert space into the set of states which have low entanglement entropy and some other states which don't is basically reminiscent in systems with. In systems with slow dynamics, such as fractons. For most of the systems, Hamiltonians are stabilizer, codes here, they're not. And basically, I, you know, kind of have to hurry up, but I want to show you that there is a new ETH principle that's actually valid in each of these fractured Hilbert spaces that I'm going to talk about now. So, the easiest way to talk about something is to give an example. Something is to give an example. And remarkably, this example kind of keeps coming back. It's a very rich limit of a very well-known system, the quantum Hall effect. So you take a quantum Hall effect in two dimensions, you take its Hamiltonian, and you make one cycle on a torus, and you make one cycle of a torus very, very thin. And we're going to call this the thin torus limit of the quantum Hall effect. And in this thin torus limit, these are the orbitals. And you notice that momentum eigenstates in the y direction are actually very low. The y direction are actually very localized exponentially in the x direction. Okay? So if you do this and take the, you know, some pseudo-potential Hamiltonian or some Coulomb interaction, whatever, it doesn't matter, and you go into this limit, you are going to find a Hamiltonian that's two-body. And this Hamiltonian has, these are the momentum eigenstates in the y-direction that are also localized in the x-direction. And it's a two-body Hamiltonian charge conserving. And the matrix elements vanish unless The matrix elements vanish unless J1 plus J2 is equal to J3 plus J4, which is basically center of mass conservation. And if you go to the thin torus limit, so if you make one limit very small, what you're going to get is some classical terms, which are actually the largest, but we're going to neglect them because they're classical. And then you get this pair hopping part, which is what we're going to get, and then something exponential in 1 over L squared. So this pair hopping part is very interesting. Why? It's a 1D Hamiltonian, which has no Drude peak and no Latin Druid equipment behavior. There's no Druid peak and no Latin Drude behavior because it's immediately it satisfies center of mass. Well, it preserves the center of mass, so it can't have any cruelty. And this is really the reason why we started initially looking at this Hamiltonian. But then it turns out it's related to all this behavior of Kruhlov's sub-space fracture. So now I want to show you that this is not just, you know, as an experimentalist, which I'm sure there's many in the room, you'd be hard-pressed to take the quantum hole limit. You'd be hard pressed to take the quantum whole limit at n equals to zero, but you can get this Hamiltonian as a limit of Frank's block many by localization paper. And you can kind of take, where is it? This is dead. So you can basically take a large electric field with a hopping term with any interaction. In the limit of the large electric field, this Hamiltonian arises immediately with nearest neighbor hopping. Does anybody? neighborhopping. Does anybody have another is the criteria just you want to compactify it by smaller than magnetic length, so then in this direction the low bandals won't overlap. That's right. That's right. I'm not sure. I'm not neo. Yes, I don't want to disappoint you. More break it. Thanks. Okay. Okay, so thank you. Okay, so now, so I'm just going to talk about this Hamiltonian and exemplify everything, because it has an amazingly rich structure, this Hamiltonian. Even though it's very simple, what it does is it takes two particles from two orbitals and moves them to the next orbital, center of mass preserving, right? This is all that it does. So now I'm going to show you that the Hilbert space of this Hamiltonian fractures into several, what we'll kind of Several, what we'll kind of call Krillov subspaces, and this Krilov subspaces, not several, but an infinite number, and these Krillov subspaces can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional, infinite-dimensional, integrable, non-integrable. Okay? Integrable and non-integrable being defined only for the infinite-dimensional ones. So infinite being meaning exponential. When I say large, I mean exponential. Okay, so how are we going to define the Kruilov subspace of the Hilbert space? Of the Hilbert space and the Hamiltonian. We're going to find it by two things: by a state R, initial state R, and this state is usually going to be a simple state, a low entanglement state, such as a product state. In most of our cases, it's going to be product states. It's not entirely clear what kulo subspaces mean when the state is not low entanglement. Initially, it's not low entanglement, because that would be kind of like any ground state would be its own Klov subspace. An eigenstate would be its own Kloss subspace. So the Klov substrate is defined by a state. So the Kriller substrate is defined by a state and an operator which in this case we take to be the Hamiltonian. But you can take other operators. In the AKLT case is this operator. But in this case we take it to be the Hamiltonian, this Hamiltonian. And the Krudov subspace is the span of hitting this initial state that you chose, which is R, by the Hamiltonian. You can think of it as a time evolution. Now, normally, if you pick some very generic model, Very generic model, once you pick the state that's not an eigenstate and you hit it with a Hamiltonian, you're going to create the full Hilbert space of the problem. But in these systems, you don't. Despending on what state you pick here, if you act with a Hamiltonian, this space closes before you reach the full Hilbert space. And we're going to analyze the direct sum of these, well, the Hamiltonian Hilbert spaces. And Donian Hilbert space is the direct sum of these Krillov subspaces. And we're going to analyze these Krillov subspaces and show that different subspaces show vastly different properties. And this has overlapped, especially in the X-ray model with what Frank showed. Okay, so the Hamiltonian action is this. So we're going to define spins and fractons. And the spins are the ones occupied by one charge. The ones occupied by one charge in two sides. So, this is a mapping that's very convenient for filling one half, but it actually works for every filling. And I'm not going to particularize on very simple, on very, not some fillings, really. Okay, and the factons, there's two types of them, positive and negative, and when you add them together, they form a dipole. And this is two sites occupied by two charges, two sides not occupied by any charge. Okay, and you can see that this action gives you something nice in Nice in the scattering matrix elements. So, for example, spins and dipoles can move, can move freely. So, spins, what you can do is you take this and you move it. This is just the action of the Hamiltonian. So, spin up down moves into spin down up. It's just the action of the Hamiltonian. And this is the XY Hamiltonian. That's why I want a spin configuration. This Hamiltonian acts like the XY Hamiltonian. And then the dipoles can actually move freely when in the correct spin background. So, if this spin was up. So if this spin was up, it couldn't move, but if this spin is down, the dipole can just doesn't care about the spin, moves. And if this spin is up, this dipole also moves, but if this spin was down, it wouldn't move, etc. But then fractons, these guys, can only move via dipole emission. So these are all the scattering matrix elements. Everything else is zero, by the way. Good to give you time. Thank you. Very good. So these fractals can move via dipole emissions. So these fractals can move via dipole emission. And you can see that if I have, you know, down plus up, I can move this here, but I generate a dipole. Okay, so this is all you need to know in order to be able to understand the structure of the Kurdov subspaces in the Samilton. So for example, let's start with something easy. There are one-dimensional Kruhov subspaces, which means every state in this space is like a state of the Hamiltonian. And that's very easy. There are states which have, for example, plus. Know, for example, plus pluses or 1111 charges because the Hamiltonian is zero on these, right? I can't take two and move it here because here I would have a two, etc. So these are eigenstates, they're product states, they're eigenstates. We call them one-dimensional Kruhlov subspaces. There's exponentially many of these, as Frank showed. There's basically, this is a spin one-half, well, this is a spin-fermionic model. Frank had a spin one model, but there's a mapping between these bases here. Okay, so there's exponentially many frozen confusion. So, there's exponentially many frozen configurations that exist here, and they're really given by the center of mass and dipole moment symmetry. Now, you can find finite-dimensional subspaces by, for example, embedding in such a configuration, which the Hamiltonian is zero, embedding spin up and down. If I embed spin up and down, then my Hamiltonian doesn't act on this guy, doesn't act on this guy, but acts on spin up and down. So I can move it, so if I hit the Hamiltonian, I hit psi 1 with the Hamiltonian, I get Psi 2. Hence the Kruhov subspace of Psi 1, Psi 2, of course, I can form. Of psi 1, psi 2. Of course, I can form eigenstates easily. These are just simple examples. So I have one-dimensional Koudo subspace, two-dimensional Kurdo subspace. Now let's go larger. Now, there are infinite, there's many of them, there's an infinite number, actually, not just one, of infinite-dimensional integrable subspaces. So let me give you the easiest one. If I start with a Kriloff, if I formed a Krilov subspace starting from this product state, which is just spin up, down, down, down, down, down, down, Okay, which is just spin up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down. You take the Hamiltonian on this. I've told you that spin up down moves into spin down up. So the Hamiltonian on this state is just the XY model. And this is obviously integrable. And, you know, you hit the state with Hamiltonian. You don't form the full Hilbert space because you don't form any of the fracton states, for example, or any of the typo states. But it's an integrable subspace. Now, you can find another integrable subspace. You can find another integrable subspace, for example, by embedding in this spin up, down, spin up, down, embedding a dipole. If you embed a dipole, you can go through the, it's very simple, through the Hamiltonian action, and find out that embedding a dipole is actually like adding another spin-up. Okay? So this is an XY model of number of sites minus 2, but I add a spin up for every dipole, plus 1, so then number of sites minus. Plus one, so then number of sites minus one. So there's many integrable subspaces, starting from like spin configurations. For example, if I make two dipoles, but put in between them a number of spins that contains at least one spin up, that's an integrable subspace. The actual diamond-communion is the XX model, XY model with n minus two sides, etc. There's an infinite number of them. Moreover, there are non-integrable Kurdov subspaces, one of them being this one. One of them being this one, there's an infinite number of them. One of them being this one. You take a fracton, you separate it so that here you at least have one spin up and one spin down in this plus minus, and you separate it from another fracton minus. This turns out it's a non-integrable Kirinov subspace, as exemplified by the level statistics and by the fact that it satisfies diagonal ETH. But it satisfies diagonal ETH, so this is an expectation value. So this is an expectation value of a local operator that basically you subtract this moose function that Frank was talking about. And the deviation has to be 1 versus the square root of the Hilbert space dimension. And which Hilbert space dimension gives you where the Eth is satisfied. And the deviation from the smooth value is actually 1 over the square root of the Krilov subspace dimension. So only the dimension of this Krilov subspace. So the ETH is satisfied within. The ETH is satisfied within this Krilov subspace, within this non-integrable Krilov subspace, not in the full Hilbert space. Okay? Just as the last but one slide, as fitting one-third, this model, this stairhoping model, actually maps exactly into the PXP model that Abani, Serbin, and Fapic found for these cars. And well, one of its colour subspaces maps the Subspaces maps exactly into the PXP model. So basically, this is kind of the end of my slide. My talk. What I've showed you is that there are models where you have the breaking of the Hilbert space into integrable Kurdov subspaces, non-integrable Kirlov subspaces, these are all infinite-dimensional, and then finite-dimensional Kurdov subspaces. And then if you want to find whether ETH is available in this Krilov subspace, whether the Ethiopian available is available Subspace whether the ETH works, you will not take the full Hilbert space, it will not work in the full Hilbert space, but it will work into every Krillov subspace that's non-integrable. And one surprise, this is really my last slide, one surprising consequence of these Krillov restricted ETH is that some of them have memory, for example, where the charge is. So if I start with a fracton here in an otherwise background of spins, actually, if I evolve this state, it will Actually, if I evolve this state, it will still have its time of infinite time or infinite temperature and late time evolution will satisfy the Eth, but this state will still have memory. Normally, it shouldn't have memory of where this fracton started, but it still has memory, of course, satisfying Eth, but it still has memory of where this fracton was. So there's interesting things happening in these restricted Krilov non-integrable subspaces. So this is a message I wanted to leave. Subspaces. So, this is a message I wanted to leave. So, thank you. Hey, a lot of questions. So, for the Hamiltonian as a whole, so not restricting to its integral block, do you always get when you're Dyson-level statistics, or does it depend on the dimension of the integrable subspaces? Yes, that's a good question. So, for the Hamiltonian as a whole, if you have this huge, so for this Hamiltonian, for the AKLT, you get always in the dark symbol. That's because like the number of states. That I think. But that's because the number of states that's basically non-ETH is very small. But for this guy, for example, if I was to do a filling one-half, where you have a lot of integrable subspace, if you were to do, and basically, so it's not like there's an exponentially larger number of integrable than non-integrable, or vice versa. So you wouldn't get, you'd get something semi between Wigner-Dyson and Poisson in some subspaces. It would be kind of clear that. Subspaces. It would be kind of clear that there's something that you haven't figured out. But within each of these integral subspaces, non-integral subspaces is figurative. That's very good. But if you would look at the statistics at the Hamiltonian as it's all, it would always be Poisson because it would have the block structure. If you look at if you do level spacing statistics for the whole Hamiltonian, not including these blocks, then you would always get Poisson. For the full Hamiltonian? The full Hamiltonian. No, I mean, like, for example, depends which Hamiltonian you're talking about. If I do it for the AKLT Hamiltonian, which has a small, which has more crude of subspaces, I mean, this one depends on this one depends on how many non-integrable subspaces your symmetry sector has, because you have to put it per symmetry sector. So if you have only one integrable subspace, then and an exponentially large number of non-integrable subspaces, then you'd see this in the Dyson, but yeah, if you have a, if they're somehow comparable, you would. Somehow comparable, you would shift what was on. Very good, thanks. Could you remind me what the conditions for Ri? So that's so that's so so so so so the conditions for our i is to choose them smart. That's the conditions for our i. So so the one condition for our i that you know so so this Krilovs this restricted Krilov subspace is very new, so we don't really know what the what the full conditions are, right? Know what the full conditions are, right? We know that if you choose some RIs, you can have this complete breakdown of the Hilbert space. Now, it would make sense that the RI would have to be low entanglement, because otherwise, I could put the RI to be an eigenstate. And then my Kurdo subspace is just that state. But that would have a large entanglement. So, all the states that we've chosen to make this break are basically product states. All of them. So, it would Uh so so it would so basically a low entanglement state would be the the um the one condition, but you know, I don't know what the generic in in general it's not very easy to find so you know Nicola and I are trying to find this curve subspace for other Hamiltonians not very easy to find them right and we don't know if it's actually useful for them from a from a solvability standpoint but but it's not easy to find them because you have to you have to find you have to zoom You have to zoom in and find the state. Maybe I'm asking the same question again. But now, is this block structure dependent of a choice of initial state? Because if I look at this Hamiltonian like this, I mean, I would say, well, you have blocks, it's reducible somehow, you have quantum numbers. You don't have quantum numbers. Exactly. You don't have quantum numbers. It's very important. That's very important. You don't have quantum numbers of local operators. So you have quantum numbers. Local operators. So you have quantum numbers of what Frank mentioned, but those are string operators. Okay? So, so, and, but, but you don't have quantum numbers. So, for example, one of these spaces is, you know, there's really just three quantum numbers here, dipole, SZ, and number of particles. So, here, some of these can be in the same quantum number sector and, you know, group quantum numbers, should I call them? I think, yes, you should be very. Should I call them? I think, yes, you should be very careful. Let's call them group one. If you have h.an operator, and this operator is really local, not local, or some of local operators, like spin or not string operators. Or in other words, it doesn't have, so let's say it doesn't have a huge non-velope. So it's not just an eigenstate. It's not this. So if I have this, then some of This, then most of you know these can be in the same quantum number sectors. It's just a kinematic problem that you're not, that once you're in this Hilbert space, your Hamiltonian matrix elements stay within here because I built my space from an state and hit a Hamiltonian with it, and I find out that it closes. But they're not quantum numbers of any local or sums of local characters. They're statistically local in the sense that Frank was saying. So, you know, they're string operators. Saying so, you know, the string operators, but if you take their expectation values, the expectation values are local. Oh, a couple questions here. I want to ask a quite important question. So, NKLC model is essentially slightly simpler version of the NLC Lafayette state. So, everything that you have learned about NKLC, can you say anything new about eigenstates or spectrum polar? Yeah, so we tried that. So that's so that's so so I think we tried that two years ago, something, or three years ago, look at it. So that's clearly a very good question. So with the AKLT, you can write it down as the nearest neighbor. So it's a Lawflink form. It just doesn't have all the as you very well know. It just doesn't have all the so so the question is whether you can find the same structure in the in the in the um pseudo-potential Hamiltonians. Two potential Hamiltonians. And the answer is so far we didn't find. We didn't find any of these, but we didn't look. I think we looked for like a week. I don't know, something like this. So we didn't look as hard as we could have looked. But yes, it's you know, there are some eigenstates that are integer energy in terms of the pseudo-potentials, but they seem to die away as you. but they seem to die away as you increase the number of particles. Which, you know, could be that they show up at, you know, there's some states in the AKLT which show up only for six times n, the number of sites, which I didn't show, for six times n. So if that happens in two dimensions, you're screwed because you don't have the next size. So you see it. But for the, yeah, but there's some. So if there are those states, we don't know. That's a very good question that we have to analyze. Okay, let's thank all the speakers this morning. I want to pick that graph. So not yet that uh we have data. But not until we No, no, no, I want to know what time we have to watch. And I thought you were the first speaker. No, no, I guess. The first is, I think, half past half past four. I think half past almost one. Probably what the number is in our official. I don't know if they see it. It's not that I don't trust you guys, but one third. Well, I think GMP for some people. But this one is a lot at least some of the I can stay in the high schools. I think we need to come to the whole idea of this. So this one is.  What I'm saying is to check the target code. Nothing changed a socket. Only wants your state of plastic, or maybe two, but not all of them. Maybe that, I don't know. But it definitely pushed you to the excitement model. But this for this building accordingly supported different and this for the pay so I'm guessing there are a lot of supports similar to it just somehow with a screwdriver signal. Yeah well the penalty is not a good thing. If the energy is somehow screwed on the It was not a collision of the states. Eventually, the LTV 47% of the state is a very simple thing. Well, I think now we know that basically it's a summation of the total sum that's given. We all start with minus two. So we know it's a frustration. These are things. Now we have to sit in the side to Gal that's gauge. So that's two springs. I'm assuming that's a very important thing. You can reproduce that cell by other combinations. There are things I mentioned before. It's like a track. It's a straight line. Yeah. So even more is there still a gap. Well, that gap can be lifted somehow. Oh, maybe that's the issue. So it's not the gap is not. So means.
