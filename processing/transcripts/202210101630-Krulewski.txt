Thanks. Well, our last talk for the day is by Cameron Kurluski from MIT. She's going to speak about anomaly constraints and spontaneous symmetry broken phases. All right. Take it away, Cameron. All right, great. Thank you so much. Thanks for the opportunity to speak. And I just want to give a shout out. I'm speaking today, but this is joint work with Arun, Sanath, Leon, Natalia, and Ryan, whose name's Ron. Natalia and Ryan, whose names are on this slide. So, I'm going to talk about anomaly constraints and spontaneous symmetry broken phases along exact sequence from Smith homomorphisms. And I should say I'll try to keep an eye on the chat, but please feel free to like interrupt with questions at any point. Let me see if I can advance. Yes, okay. So, as an overview, the first thing I want to talk about are Smith homomorphisms. These are maps between bordism groups that Maps between borders and groups that change dimension and tangential structure. And I'll say sort of what those are and outline definitions, et cetera. And the physical question that I want to explore with that is that these homomorphisms or these Smith maps induce maps on topological field theories corresponding to a physical process of spontaneous symmetry breaking. And I guess we learned about this mainly from a paper of Hassan, Komorgatsky, and Thorngren and kind of expanded from there. Kind of expanded from there. So, what we do is we study the maps of spectra inducing these Smith homomorphisms and we interpret the physics of the corresponding long exact sequence we get there. So, that's sort of the overview. Outline is first, I'll talk about Smith homomorphisms and some of their mathematical properties and probably spend most of the time discussing them. And second, I want to talk about the physics applications to anomaly matching for field theories. Anomaly matching for field theories. Okay. So I'll start it off talking about Smith homomorphisms. So for the first idea of what they are, I'm going to fix a dimension D, and I'll fix a stable tangential structure for which the data I'll use to encode that is a map eta from some X, a map to BO. And I'm also going to fix some twisting data, rho, which is a mapped from X to B O K. From x to be okay. And so, just for an example, right away, we could take for our tangential structure to be B spin cross BZ2. We could take this math eta to just be trivial on the BZ2 component so that it factors through B spin and then includes into BO. So this is a choice we can make. And this twisting data, we could choose the sine representation of Z2, which is a one-dimensional representation. So given this. So, given this data, a Smith homomorphism is a map on Bordism groups. So, the map I'll write is SM for Smith, and it's going to change tangential structure from eta to eta minus rho, where rho is the twisting data, and it's going to change dimension from d to d minus k, where k is like the dimension of this twisting data. And so, just to kind of remind the definition of the Bordism group and to make clear what minus Group and to make clear what my notation is, I think it might be a little bit non-standard. I'm going to write omega superscript eta sub d of x to be the group of borders classes of closed d manifolds with x comma eta structure. So by x comma eta structure, I mean that the iso classes in this group consist of closed D manifolds with lifts of their tangential structure, well, with lifts of their tangent. But with lifts of their tangent bundle through X that factor through eta. So the lift is omega. And this is sort of our first picture of a Smith homomorphism is. And I haven't given you the precise definition yet, but this is the first idea. So I want to go to examples right away. So sort of the classical example or maybe one of the first examples you might come. of the first examples you might come across is a Smith isomorphism which was studied maybe by P.A. Smith and others. So in this example you can take S to be any structure. You cross S with BZ2 and you take twisting data given by the sine representation sigma. And this will drop dimension by one. So as a more specific case of this classical example and again the case that was on the previous slide. That was on the previous slide, which I'll refer to going forward as the Z2 example. I could take tangential structure where I take X to be B spin cross BZ2. I could take my twisting data to be the sine representation, where again, this is one dimensional, so k equals one. And I can get a map on Border Zone groups that drops dimension by one, and that changes tangential structure from eta to eta minus sigma. And so the thing. And so, the thing about this map is, I can also recognize it in perhaps a more familiar way. I could rewrite this as spin cross C2 bordism mapping to pin minus bordism in dimension D minus one. And I will say a little bit more about how I can make that identification in a minute, but this is just maybe a slightly more familiar way to write the source and target of this Smith homomorphism. Of this Smith homomorphism. And continuing on the theme of this example, I can kind of iterate this process. So if I started with the target of the first map, with this eta minus sigma structure, I could repeat the process and I could produce another Smith homomorphism by using the twisting data sigma a second time to land in the Bordism group of eta minus 2 sigma. And now my dimension, I drop it by 1 from d minus 1 to d. By one from d minus one to d minus two. So I produce another Smith map in this way. And again, I can recognize these tangential structures as something maybe a little, maybe a little more familiar. So I can recognize it as a map on pin minus bordism to spin cross C4 over Z2 bordism, which I guess you might also see written as spin superscript C over 2 bordism, maybe you could see in physics literature at least. Good see in physics literature, at least. And it turns out I can continue iterating this process. I can continue taking the sign representation as my twisting data, and I can get four different symmetry types, spin cross C2, pin minus, spin cross C4 over Z2, and pin plus. And then if I continue the process from there, I'll go back to spin cross C2 bordism, and so on. So it actually forms a four-periodic family if I continue to iterate this process and I want to return. Process. And I want to return sort of to this question later: like, why does it form a periodic family? But this will be some of the running examples I want to use going forward. And there's one other main example I want to talk about. I'll refer to it as the U1 example, going to be sort of similar. I'll take a tangential structure to be a product of B spin with B U1. For my twisting data, I'll take rho to be the tautological. Take rho to be the tautological bundle over Bu1, which I'll write as gamma. And this is a complex line bundle, but its real dimension is 2. So we'll have k equals 2. And we'll get a Smith map that drops the dimension by 2 and changes the tangential structure by this twisting data gamma. And I can again recognize this in a more familiar way as spin bordism to spin C bordism in dimensions two lower. And so And so, like the classical example, these C2 example and U1 example have been studied in the literature. And there are also other interesting examples that I won't talk about today, but I want to take these as running examples going forward. And the first thing I want to talk about, oh yes, one more thing I should say is that this U1 example also forms a periodic family. So if I iterate this process, if I So, if I iterate this process, if I take gamma a second time, I'll get from spin to spin C back to spin. It'll actually form a two-periodic family. Okay, so the first thing I want to say about these Smith homomorphisms is I want to say, how do we identify these tangential structures? How do I see that when I twist by sigma, I get from spin cross C2 to pin minus? So I'll just say a word about that. So the idea is that I'll sort of use. So, the idea is that I'll sort of use some shearing theorems. These different structures that I have, pin plus and minus and spin cross C4 over Z2, can be realized as twisted spin structures. So twisted by indeed the sign representation. So one example that I'll kind of give an idea for, but not give a full proof, is that, for example, pin plus structures are equivalent to BZ2, 3 sigma twisted spin structures. And just to unpack a little bit, And just to unpack a little bit about what that means. So, recall, like a pin plus structure on some vector bundle E is a trivialization of W2. But equivalently, you can show by sort of looking at the Stiefel-Whitney classes using the Whitney-Summ formula, using two out of three properties for orientations and this kind of thing. You can show that this pin plus structure is equivalent to a spin structure on E plus three times the determinant line button. times the determinant line bundle of E. So a spin structure there would be a trivialization of W2 and W1. So on the other hand, a BZ2 comma three sigma twisted spin structure on E is the data on E, a vector bundle over some manifold M. This is the data of a map from M, the base manifold to BZ2, and a spin structure on E plus the pullback of 3 sigma under that map. Three sigma under that map. And so I'm not going to give the full proof for why this twisted spin structure is the same thing as a pin plus structure, but you can hopefully start to get the idea of how it could be the same. And the argument involves like, again, using Whitney sum, using the two out of three property for orientations, and just showing that the data ends up being the same. Okay, so that's the that's just saying a bit about how we get from spin cross C2 to. About how we get from spin cross C2 to pin plus. Well, I guess I described how to get from pin plus to spin cross C2, but in either case, the other examples here, pin minus and spin cross C4 over C2, are similarly twisted spin structures. And that's why I can rewrite these Bordesm groups in this other way. So, meanwhile, for the U1 example, the two symmetry groups I have are spin and spin C. spin and spin C. And the claim is that I have a similar result at a spin comma gamma, where gamma is the tautological bundle over V1. This is equivalent to a spin C structure. Yeah, so that's sort of identifying these tangential structures. The next thing I want to do is, you know, raise some questions about Smith homomorphisms. So when we were, I remember learning about these, some questions kind of came. Learning about these, some questions kind of came up: like, What is the general construction for these maps? I haven't told you the precise definition yet. And a question you could ask is: When are these Smith homomorphisms isomorphisms? Like, in the classical case, it was always a Smith isomorphism. But in the examples I discussed, they're not always isomorphisms. But you could also ask, like, when are they injective and surjective and this kind of thing? So, I'll try to address that. And I'll also try to address why do they often form these periodic. Why do they often form these periodic families? So they don't always, but in the cases I've talked about, we had this four-periodic family and we had this two-periodic family. I want to say a bit about why that is. So the first thing I should do is talk about the construction a bit more explicitly. So let me fix a dimension D. Let me fix the tangential structure eta from X to B O and fix this twisting data rho from X to B. twisting data rho from x to be okay. So the twisting data is of dimension k. The Smith homomorphism I get in this case is from bordism of manifolds with x eta structure, dimension D to bordism of manifolds with eta minus rho structure, dimension D minus k. So I'll tell you what we do precisely. So given an element of the source, so a closed manifold D with a lift of its stable tangential structure. Structure. I'm going to take this twisting data row, and I'm going to take the vector bundle that's associated to that. I'll write V for that vector bundle over X. I can note that if I take a generic section of this vector bundle V, it'll be transverse to the zero section, which I'll write as S naught. And so because these sections are transverse, I can Are transverse, I can define a submanifold, this manifold n in the target, by pullback. Or equivalently, n is the intersection of m sub s, which is when I'm writing for the image of this generic section in V with M sub S naught, so the image of the zero section in B. And so the thing that remains to say is what's the tangential structure on N? Why does it have eta minus rho structure? Well, the first thing I could do is. Well, the first thing I could do is I could just look at the inclusion of n into m and look at this lift of m's tangent bundle. But that'll tell me sort of just the tangential structure that comes from the restriction of the tangent bundle of m to n. So I need to do a little more work to show you that n has the correct tangential structure. So let's do that now. So on the right-hand side, I've kind of drawn a sort of degenerate picture where this Picture where this manifold M is just one-dimensional. So the black lines are the image of the zero section and the image of the generic section. So in this case, N is just a point and V is this vector bundle that I'm realizing MS and MS not as sections of. So maybe this picture isn't super helpful, but maybe it's a little bit helpful. So the claim is that stably the tangent bundle of n is congruent. Tangent bundle of n is congruent to the tangent bundle of m restricted minus the restricted n. So if this is the case, then this manifold n indeed has this eta minus rho structure since we can identify its tangent bundle with tm minus v, where m has this eta structure and v is this twisting data, comes from the twisting data rho. So to prove that, I'll first use just transversality. I said that the generic and zero section I said that the generic and zero sections were transverse, so I know that the tangent bundles, the least restricted over n, will surject onto this vector bundle V. And by construction, I also have an exact sequence of vector bundles where I look at the tangent bundle to the zero section. I can include that to the tangent bundle of the vector v restricted over that section. And then what I'm left with is sort of the vertical part, the vertical part of that bundle coming from V. So I have this exact. Coming from V. So I have this exact sequence. And what I can do with this exact sequence is just to kind of intersect with the tangent bundle of m sub s, the image of this generic section. And then by definition of n, the first term in this exact sequence will give me the tangent bundle of n. The second term will just restrict the tangent bundle of b to the tangent bundle of ms. And the last term I'll be left with is v again. And so I have this exact So I have this exact sequence. Therefore, stably I can subtract V from both sides and I can realize I can show the claim and realize that N has the proper kind of tangential structure. Okay, and on the bottom right, I just have a picture sort of of where we can write the tangential structure for n as this omega prime. Okay. So I've just described the map on Bordism groups. I said what we do with a Bordism class of manifold M, we take it to this N, that's the intersection of these two sections. But if I want to understand what's going on a bit more deeply, I could also look at the map of spectra inducing this map of four-discongroups. So, why should I expect it to be induced by a map of spectra? Well, I have. Of spectra, well, I have Pontriag and Tom. It tells me that if I have eta, a stable tangential structure, and I have minus eta its inverse, which is sort of a normal structure, then there's an isomorphism of groups from the ordism groups with x eta structure to the homotopy groups of the Mats and Schoman spectrum, which I'll write as X superscript minus eta. Okay, so specifically, I claim the Smith homework. Claim the Smith homomorphisms that we discuss are induced by maps of spectra from the Madsen-Tilman spectra of manifolds with data structure to the Madsen-Tillman spectrum x minus eight equals rho. And let me tell you specifically what that map is. So just for convenience, instead of minus eta, I'll take an actual bundle mu. It doesn't have to be an actual bundle. It can certainly be a virtual bundle. An actual bundle. It can certainly be a virtual bundle, but for convenience, I'll take it to be an actual bundle for a moment. So I can define a map of vector bundles from mu to mu plus rho just by taking the zero section of rho. So mapping like v to v comma zero. This will induce a map on the sphere bundles over x, and it will induce a map on Tom spaces. And so if I And so, if I did this with a virtual bundle instead of an actual bundle, and I used the construction of mass and tillman spectra, I would get a map as described in this proposition here, this map of spectra. Okay, so let's see. I actually cannot see the okay, I just had to move something on my screen. So, yeah, I want to note that just Note that just to be clear, like we have this shift in dimension d minus k on the Borgism groups, and I can realize that if I wanted to normalize the dimension of rho by subtracting a trivial k-dimensional bundle and putting a suspension out front to make it look a little more clear why I have that dimension shift, I could do that. So that's just a minor point. Okay. So let's go back to these running examples. Let's go back to these running examples. So, for this Z2 case, I claim that this map from spin curl Z2 to pin minus is going to be induced by the following map of spectra. So, the Mattson-Thillman spectrum MT spin smashed with VZ2. I have this map of spectra to MT spin to the smashed with the Tom spectrum of VZ2 with the sine representation as my vector bundle there. And if I want to, I can use these. want to, I can use these, I can normalize the dimension of sigma, subtracting one and putting a suspension out front, and then I can use a shearing theorem to recognize this as mt pin minus. So the Madsen-Tillman spectrum for pin minus structure. Meanwhile, for the other running example, this U1 case, I had this map from spin boardism to spin C boardism. This is induced by a map of spectra from MT spin smash BU1. Spin smash Bu1, which MT spin smash the Tom spectrum of gamma over Bu1. And I can again recognize this as two-fold suspension of MT spin C. So these are two example maps of spectra that will induce these Smith homomorphisms that we've been considering. Okay, so I'm going to check off the general construction for these maps. I've now told you. General construction for these maps. I've now told you what the definition is. And next, I want to address: okay, when are these isomorphisms? When are they injective and surjective? This kind of thing. So to answer that question, it's useful that we have this map of spectra. So understanding the map of spectra that induces these Smith homomorphisms allows us to write down a cofiber sequence. Write down a cofiber sequence. And given a cofiber sequence of spectra, we can take homotopy groups. We can get a long exact sequence where every third map is like a Smith homomorphism. And sort of looking at the groups there, we'll be able to deduce, assuming we know the homotopy groups and the relevant range, we'll be able to deduce often whether the map is an isomorphism or not. So that's the idea. And so let me tell you how we compute what the co-fiber is. The cofiber is. So let me start with just the cofiber sequence on pointed spaces, so of Tom spaces, and then we'll deduce the map on spectra from that. So one more piece of notation is I'll set P to be the projection of the sphere bundle of rho. So rho was this twisting data over X, and I take a sphere bundle and I write the projection map P. The claim is there's a co-fiber sequence of pointed spaces where this map is the Where this map is the Smith map between Tom spaces from μ to μ plus ρ, where rho is the twisting data. The cofiber of that map is the suspension of the Tom space of the pullback of mu over the sphere bundle of rho. So that's the proposition. Let me now outline a little bit of a proof of that. So we can start. We can start by observing that there's a pushout square where we look at the sphere bundles of mu and the sphere bundle of rho, and sphere bundle of mu plus rho. And on the top left, we have the product over x of these two sphere bundles. And the reason we want to start with this Bushout square is we're interested in computing this co-fiber of the Smith map and we map and you and to do that it'll be helpful to understand the cofiber of this bottom row but because it's a pushout square the cofiber of the bottom row is the same as the cofiber of the top row and it'll turn out that we can understand the cofiber of the top row so to understand the cofiber of the top row we can identify using the definition of a sphere bundle we can identify the product of these sphere bundles over x Product of these sphere bundles over x as the sphere bundle of the pullback of mu over the sphere bundle of rho. And if we look at the norm one elements there, by definition, this will agree. So if we know that, we can then compute the cofiber of the top row. So now this top row looks like a sphere bundle of p star mu living over this base space S of rho. S of rho, which I can view as sort of the disk bundle of that p star mu. And so I should be able to recognize that cofiber as the Tom space of P star mu. So once I have that, I can take that cofiber sequence. I'm going to now write that on the bottom, sorry, on the left-hand side of this diagram. So I have a map. So, I have a map from the sphere bundle of μ on the left-hand side to the sphere bundle of μ plus ρ. And then the cofiber of that, I've argued on the previous slide, is the Tom space of this pullback bundle, P star mu. So that's the left part of this diagram. And now each row and each column in this diagram, I'm going to design it so that they are cofiber sequences. So, for example, the top row is going to be. example the top row is going to be s of mu to the disk bundle of mu which retracts onto x and the cofiber of that is this tom space of mu similarly in the second row i get a cofiber sequence leading to the tom space of mu plus row and the map on the right there labeled smith is the map i'm trying to compute the cofiber of so on the bottom is bottom right is that cofiber of smith but now so this middle But now, so this middle map is just a map identifying x with itself. The cofiber of that's just a point. I argued on the previous slide that this bottom left space is this Tom space of this pullback bundle. So if I look now just at the bottom row of this diagram, I can deduce that this cofiber I wanted to compute is just going to be a suspension of the bottom left space. So a suspension of this pullback, of the Tom space of this pullback bundle. So, the two diagrams I just talked about are just showing this proposition that I have this cofiber sequence of pointed spaces. Okay, so this allows me to then identify the cofiber of the Smith map on tons spaces with the suspension of P star of mu. Okay, so if I then upgrade that from a map of pointed spaces, I check compatibility with all of my structure maps and use, you know, some, if I use the construction of Matts and Schillman spectra, I can realize a cofiber sequence on the level of spectra. So I've sort of moved over, I could have written x mu to x mu plus rho to the suspension of this time. To the suspension of this Tom spectrum piece tar μ, but I've just decided to write that on the left-hand side, and I still have a cofiber sequence. So I've argued the proposition, and I'm sort of waving my hands a bit to say that as a corollary, I have this cofiber sequence of spectra, where this map SM is the map I'm interested in. So let me go back to our running examples. Back to our running examples. So these four maps on this slide now correspond to these Z2 examples. So the Smith maps, I have four different kinds of those because it's four periodic. So for the first one, I have a map from MT spin smash VZ2. The target of that was the suspension of MT pin minus. So I claim that the fiber of that map is MT spin. Spin and it actually holds true that for all four of these cases the fiber is going to be empty spin and this is because when I this sphere bundle of rho so in this Z2 case the sphere bundle of sigma the sine representation is going to be contractible so when I compute this pullback over the sphere bundle I won't get something I won't get something super interesting I'll just again get them Super interesting, I'll just again get the Matson-Tillman spectrum of spin coming from the tangential structure. And it's true also for the U1 case that the fiber will be empty spin. This is again because my twisting data gamma, if I compute the sphere bundle of that, it will again be contractible. And when I compute this, the fiber, the only interesting part of the fiber is coming from Ada and I'll Coming from Ada, and I'll be left with a copy of MTSpin. So, for both of the running examples, the fiber is empty spin. I want to take a moment to recognize that the fiber is not always going to be empty spin. You could get something a little more interesting. So, I could think about the C2 family, and instead of taking twisting data just to be sigma, I could take twisting data two times sigma. And if I do that, And if I do that, then I can compute that I'll get a Smith map from pin minus to pin plus. It'll shift dimension by two, and the fiber of that is going to be MT spin smashed with the suspension spectrum of RP2 desuspended ones. And this is studied, for example, by Kirby and Taylor. Okay, so in the running examples, the fiber is empty spin. Here's an example where it's not empty spin, but Example where it's not empty spin, but why did I want to do this? Yeah, so the reason I wanted to do this is now that I understand the cofiber sequences, if you give me some structures and ask me, is this Smith homomorphism an isomorphism or not? I could compute what the cofiber is. I could write down a long exact sequence on homotopy and get a long exact sequence. And get a long exact sequence. And assuming that I know the homotopy groups of the spaces for the spectra that we're talking about, I could then deduce whether these Smith maps were isomorphisms or not. And so I'm going to check off that bullet point. And hopefully, if I have time later, I will give an example of a long exact sequence where we can see that happening. So the last question I sort of want to address about these. sort of want to address about these Smith maps is why do they often form periodic families? The two running examples were this C2 four periodic family and this U1 two periodic family. I want to say why we have these repeating structures. So yeah again here's those two examples. So I've just said them and one way to understand why we get this periodic families is to look at This periodic families is to look at the map of spectra inducing the homomorphisms. So I claim that these periodic families occur when we have an identification of the mass and filmmaker spectrum x eta minus n rho, so some number n copies of the twisting data rho. If I have an identification of that with just a suspension of the Mass and Tilman spectrum, so where K is the dimension of rho. Is the dimension of rho and n is just the number of copies of rho I've taken. So, for example, for z2, n is 4, for u1, n is 2. So that's a claim, and let me give you sort of the reason why that's true. So, in these specific examples that I've been looking at, they're all products with the spin for our tangential structures. So, I want to take x to the b spin cross. X to B B spin cross some other space, which physically I could think of as like an internal symmetry group. And I want to take my tangential structure eta to just be B spin, to be factoring through B spin. And I want to take my twisting data rho to only be non-trivial on this X naught component and not do anything to the B spin component. So let me just specify the setup a little bit for this. Set up a little bit for this. So now I'm just going to invoke a fact, which comes from like the theory of R orientations or maybe some ideas from ABGHR. But I'm just going to keep it as a fact for now. So the fact is, if I consider my twisting data rho, so this map that's omega non-trivial and x0, it's k-dimensional. So I'm happy to be okay. The claim is I have an isomorphism over M spin. I have an isomorphism over m spin with the spectrum x naught with n times n times rho, so that Tom spectrum smashed with m spin is identified with an n k fold suspension of x naught smash m spin if and only if n rho has a spin structure. So let me apply this fact to these two examples. So, for the first example, I expect n to be 4. So, why is this true? For any real vector bundle E, you have that 2E is always oriented. You can show this by checking the Stiefold Widthy classes. And you have that 4E is always spin. So that's great, because if we take E to just be this vector bundle associated to the sine representation, we have that four times four copies of it will be spin. Four copies of it will be spin, and applying the fact allows us to see that m spin smash bz2 for sigma just sort of untwists as a four-fold suspension of m spin smash bz2. And so this means if we iterate the process, if we take four copies of sigma, we'll get back what we started with, m spin smash bz2, and we'll just be off by four in our dimension. So, for U1, we expect it to be two periodic. And it's true in this case that for any complex vector bundle E, E is always oriented and 2E is always spin. So once we take two copies of our twisting data, in this case, I called it gamma, we will get back to our original structure of spin. So admitting this fact, So, admitting this fact, I can now explain why these two examples will be periodic, and there are other examples of periodic families. Okay, but with that said, those are most of the questions I wanted to address about these SMF maps. And I'm happy to answer some questions about that if anyone. Like, answer some questions about that if anyone has any. But the next thing I'll talk about is some of these physics applications. Okay. So. Okay. Yeah. Go on. Is there a question? No, there were no questions here. Okay. Great. Then I will. Okay. Yeah. Feel free to interrupt for any questions or corrections or anything. And questions or corrections or anything. But I'll now talk about the physics, sort of the physics applications of these ideas. So the first thing I want to talk about is how I can get an induced map of invertible topological field theories from this Smith construction. So just recall, I'll take a G-dimensional topological field theory to be a symmetric monoidal functor from this Fordism category. From this Bordism category, and I'll take x, eta as my tangential structures, and it'll map to some target category C. And if it factors through like the Picard group weight of C, it'll be invertible. But for the purposes now, I'm going to fix the target category to be IZ, the Anderson dual of the sphere spectrum. And the reason I'll do that is because I want to invoke some results of free. Some results of Friedan Hopkins, which build off of work of many people, including GMTW and Wynn, etc. I want to use that the Anderson dual of the sphere is a good choice of target category. So the Anzatz I take from Freed and Hopkins' work is that there's a bijection between isomorphism classes of certain kinds of invertible field theories. Of invertible field theories with an appropriate symmetry type and maps from the Madsen-Tillman spectrum x minus eta to a d plus one fold suspension of the Anderson dual of the sphere spectrum. And another way I can write that as like Iz cohomology in degree d plus one of x minus eta. And I'm definitely sweeping a lot of details under the rug in sort of giving this onsats. There's some details about like what appropriate symmetry types one should take and the Symmetry types one should take and the few different variations on this Anzatz, and depending on what kinds of field theories you plug in. But for the purposes of what I want to say here, I want to just apply this onsatz. So I'm going to claim that what I'm interested in are these induced maps on IZ cohomology. So I'm going to take a lot of this for granted and then tell you how I want to use it. And then tell you how I want to use it. So I discussed in the first part that there are these Smith maps of spectra. So let's consider one from x minus eta to x minus eta plus rho. I claim that this will induce a map on the on the geometric realization of these wordism categories. So I need to, there are some details here for I need There are some details here for I need to take the geometricalization because it's not quite well defined until I do so. But admitting that, what I want to do on the physics side is relate two different theories. So let me put them both up here. So I want to relate two theories. One is going to be called a defect theory. That'll be in dimension D minus K. The other is going to be a bulk theory. The other is going to be a bulk theory that'll be in dimension D. And so the Smith map, this induced Smith map, is going to map between these two things. So for the defect theory, this is going to be associated to some invertible topological field theory F from the Borderism category of manifolds with X eta minus rho structure to IZ. And if I want to produce from If I want to produce from this Smith map, this map induced by the Smith map, another field theory, I can compose. So I take this functor that defines my defect field theory, F, and I compose with this induced Smith this map induced from the Smith map, and I can get what I'm calling a bulk theory in dimension D. So So, I can now sort of go between these two different theories using this Smith map. And why do I want to do this physically? So, if I take this Anzatz, that here's how I describe my invertible field theories. What I'm really studying is sort of some anomalies of a field theory. So, I won't say too much about the Too much about the physics here, but I just want to use that an anomaly of some d-dimensional anomalous field theory. Maybe I want to study this anomalous field theory. This anomaly is a d plus one dimensional, in our case, invertible topological field theory. And so it won't necessarily always be of that precise type, but that's what we'll assume for our purposes. And we're just going to use that anomalies are useful invariants of field theories. So I claim that this is a useful thing to do because they tell us interesting things about field theories. So their invariants, for example, let's conjecture they're invariant under like renormalization group flow, which is something you would study physically. And so it's useful to have something that's invariant under that process. And so I sort of outlined on the I sort of outlined on the previous slide that this Smith map on spectra induces a map on IZ cohomology. And that induced map is supposed to tell me something about matching anomalies of field theories. So just to use the specific words, where the anomalies we're matching are called Tuft anomalies. And the process for considering the physics process that we claim corresponds to this induced Smith map is Induced Smith map is called spontaneous symmetry breaking. And I might, if I have time, I might get to say what that means in a concrete example. But physically, the takeaway is that I have a map of spectra related to these Smith homomorphisms. I claim that from that, I can get a map between field theories, specifically between anomaly field theories, and that this tells me something interesting about the physics. So, let me go into that into a little more detail, like what the precise hypothesis is. So, I'll start with what we started from the beginning. I'll start with a tangential structure eta from x to vo. And I'll start with one field theory. I'll call this the bulk field theory. So, this is the d-dimensional one. This will have x, eta structure, and it'll have some associated anomaly. Have some associated anomaly field theory, and this class is going to live in this cohomology group IZ D plus 1 of the Mass and Schultz spectrum X minus eta. So now I'm going to perform some process on this field theory. What I'm going to do, I'm going to take a k-dimensional symmetry breaking order parameter. I'll call this phi, but this is encoding, it's transforming in the representation rho, which is our twisting data. Which is our twisting data from before. And I'm going to have some physical assumptions on what's going on. So, one of the assumptions is that the infrared limit of the theory is gaps, and this is sort of to make sure that we end up with theories that we can indeed study as topological field theories. But I won't say much about that. So, the claim is: I start off with this bulk field theory. I start off with this bulk field theory. I fix this eta, this rho, and this x. I fix all of that data that I need for a Smith homomorphism. And then I perform some physics process. So I'll call it vaguely a twisted boundary condition construction. The claim is that construction can produce a defect with excitations localized where this order parameter is set to zero. So mathematically, like setting that parameter to zero is taking this. Setting that parameter to zero is taking the zero section and intersecting it with the generic section from the beginning, which is how we defined what the Smith homomorphism is doing. But that's sort of the physics words attached to it. And the claim is you can produce this defect field theory by this physics process. And it also has some anomaly class. It has some invariant associated to it, which is living k dimensions lower and is living in a with a tangential structure twisted by rho. With a tangential structure twisted by rho. So the claim is this induced map from the Smith map is corresponds to this physics process. That is, the induced map from the Smith map will match the anomalies in the sense that the original anomaly is this induced map applied to beta, this the anomaly of the defect field theory. So there's sort of a lot of details on this. So, there's sort of a lot of details on this slide, but the main idea is that the induced map from the Smith map matches and describes some physical process that we would like to understand. So this is our hypothesis. And yeah, this is inspired by a lot of other work, including the Kassan Komorgowski and Thorn Gren that I mentioned earlier. But this is what we're kind of trying. What we're kind of trying to test with a few examples. So let me talk about one concrete application that relates to one of the running examples. So this application I'm going to call anomaly matching. And we're going to go back to this running example of this U1 Smith map. So this came from a map of spectra M spin smash B U1 and it mapped to a suspension of M spin C. Just to recall. See. Just to recall. I claim that by the construction I described earlier, this will provide a map of field theories and a map on their anomalies. From IC cohomology, I need to shift, I need to take the dimension plus one, then I subtract two for the dimension of this order parameter, then I land, so it's map from IZD minus one of M spin C to IZ D plus one of M spin smash B U. D plus one of them spin smash B U one. So that's like my map of field theories that I'm studying associated to the Smith map. And by the process sort of I described before, I can compute the cofiber of this map of spectra. And I said before this cofiber is just a copy of M spin or M T spin. So now I can write down. Now, I can write down after looking at the induced map on field theories a long exact sequence, where the third sort of term of the long exact sequence is the IZ cohomology of M spin. So in this case, here's the long exact sequence for this U1 example. So I've written just in low degrees from like minus one to five, and on the top, I have IZ cohomology of spin C mapping to IZ cohomology. Mapping to IZ cohomology of M spin B U1. So that first map will be this induced Smith, this map induced from the Smith map. And the last part, the last group is this co-fiber. And so assuming I can compute or I can look up in the literature all of these groups and write them down and as I have written down here, I can kind of guess which maps, I can figure out which maps are going to be. I can figure out which maps are going to be isomorphisms and exactly what the maps have to be in order to fit into a long exact sequence. And so this will tell me when I expect my anomalies to match by isomorphisms or when I expect there to maybe be an obstruction to that. So, for example, I could focus on a certain dimension here. So I could look at dimensions. So I could look at dimension, a map of a two-dimensional, so a one plus one dimensional field theory. Then I increase, I add another one to look at the anomaly. So I have IZ3 mapping to IZ5. So my hypothesis would be, oh, the bulk theory, this three plus one dimensional theory, should have its anomaly match this one plus one dimensional defect field theory. So that corresponds to this isolation. To this isomorphism on the bottom here from Z2 to Z2. And I have a slide here kind of talking about the physics process there. I think I'm just going to gloss through this slide for the moment, but the takeaway is that I have a three plus one dimensional bulk theory. Plus one-dimensional bulk theory. This slide is talking about the physics process I perform. Let me kind of go quickly through this and not tell you about the details and say that the takeaway is we can compute these anomalies and observe that they match. So when I look at the bottom map of this. Of this long exact sequence, I expect an isomorphism. And I claim that when I go through this physical process, I indeed see that the anomalies match. So yeah, I think let me give you one other example instead of going through that really deeply right away. Let me go through an example. Let me go through an example where the anomaly doesn't exactly match, but where we have an obstruction. So, let me introduce one new Smith map. So, if I take similarly to before, if I take a tangential structure B spin times now B S U n minus one, so this is a new example, and I take rho to be the total. And I take rho to be the tautological bundle over BsUN minus 1. I can get a Smith map, mapping from M spin smash B S U N minus 1 to M spin smash B S U N. I can compute in the same way described before what the cofiber of that map should be. I can compute that it should be m spin smash B S U n minus one. And then I can write down a long exact sequence of field theories and it might tell Of field theories, and it might tell me something. So, physically, what it will tell me is that if I have some theory with this SUN symmetry, and I could ask a question, can I perform this physics process and produce a gap theory by breaking the SUN symmetry down to SUN minus one using some order parameter transforming in this representation? In this representation, according to the tautological bundle, so the charge one representation of SU n minus one. So that's a concrete physical question I can ask. And I can answer it using this approach by looking at this map of field theories. So because this cofiber of the map of field theories is going to be living in IZ cohomology, sorry. I-Z cohomology, sorry, that the IZ cohomology of the cofiber is in general going to be non-trivial. I'll see if I write out that long exact sequence, I won't always get an isomorphism. When n is greater than two, I will not get an isomorphism. So, from this example, I want to say we can answer the specific physical question by noting that we can compute. We can compute the long exact sequence of field theories. We can see that some of these groups in between the Smith maps are non-trivial, and we'll see that we won't always get isomorphisms. So in this case, I might say, oh, the anomalies don't quite match. There's some obstruction to there being an isomorphism. Okay. And now let me just again. That's sort of the last example I wanted to discuss. And if there's interest, I can go back to that previous U1 example and tell you more about the physics process. Let me just briefly say that this is part of like ongoing work with Arun DeBry, Sanath, Developer Carr, Leon Liu, Natalia, Jakarta Talaj, and Ryan Thorngren. And we'll have some forthcoming work where we're looking at the Smith map, its co-fiber, and all. Smith map, its cofiber, and also this connecting map in lung sac sequence. And we'll look at some other physics applications like QCD, DQCP, and some other models. And yeah, that's all I want to say. So if there are any questions or any interest in that previous U1 example, please go ahead and ask. And thank you so much for listening. Thank you, Cameron. Are there any questions? Yeah, Daniel? Do I need to press something else? Okay. Hi. So the example you gave is supposed to be a free fermion field theory, right? The U1. And so what I don't understand here is if Here is if you take three fermionic spt phases, they're supposed to be classified, say, by the K-theory of a torus. And usually you don't have any tangential structure, right? So where are you getting the, I mean, or how are you, or what, let me say something further. So, and usually the treatment of defects is creating a sphere around. Creating a sphere around that defect and then looking at bundles which twist over that sphere across the torus. But here, somehow you're saying that instead you put some twisted boundary conditions and that's how you get this tangential structure. Yes. So I guess to address the second part of your question, I expect that, yeah, I apologize, I didn't. That I apologize, it didn't go into detail about this twisted boundary condition construction. Maybe I could say that, but I think that should agree with exactly what you said about like looking at that sphere bundle. As for the first part of the question, sort of looking at K-theory. So for this example, we could also study it using K-theory and sort of Theory and sort of that's related to this, of course, related to like this tenfold way, K-theory describing free fermions. But I can also interpret that in terms of these I can also interpret that using sort of work of Freed Hopkins and others in this other perspective that I described on isa cohomology. So, for example, what I have in mind for relating the case. In mind for relating the K-theory story to this Isaac homology story is sort of the section of Fried and Hopkins' work where they talk about this free to interacting map. So they produce a map from K-theory to Isaac homology, landing in appropriate symmetry type. And that for each interacting map uses sort of the data of the Tiabat-Shapiro orientation. Piero orientation. And so they have a way to produce a map from any of those 10 symmetry types, according to like the tenfold way for free fermions. They have a way to produce a map from that to their perspective with Iza cohomology. So I agree we can definitely use K-theory to describe this, and I'm just using the other perspective because I want to talk about the. Want to talk about these borders and groups. So, is that okay? Or I can say more? Well, I mean, usually, as far as I know, that step is sort of not very clear in their work. They sort of say that there's this map, but I don't think it's been shown to work explicitly. Anyhow, I have more questions, but I'll let somebody else ask. Just for remark, it works. Just for just for remark, it works in all 10 cases in the classification of topological superconductor and insulators. I don't think so. Are there any other questions either here or on Zoom? Or I'll let Danielle ask his next question. Question. Does anybody on Zoom want to comment anything else? Not right now. I guess you can ask. Yeah. So could you sort of use your example to say how you construct from the twisted boundary conditions, how you construct this vector bundle? Sure. So let me run through the slide I skipped then. So that slide is talking about matching this, just this bottom map in 3 plus 1D to 1 plus 1D. In that example, I'll start with the data associated to that 3 plus 1D bulk theory. Maybe I, you know, physically I think about the Lagrangian associated to it, which will initially be a fermion psi, so that has. Fermion ψ, so that has this spin symmetry, and I'll additionally impose this chiral U1 symmetry acting only on the left-handed part of that fermion. And that'll be my starting data. And the way that I pursue the spontaneous symmetry breaking process is to add something like a mass term or a Yukawa term with this phi, this symmetry breaking order parameter, that transforms in the charge one representation. transforms in the charge one representation of u1 so corresponding to the twisting data which is the tautological bundle so i add that into my lagrangian with a another dynamical term i'll do like the i guess the the usual thing you do in this example is i want to choose some potential like this some raro potential and look at the look at the low energy Look at the low energy excitations there. So condensing this order parameter phi to zero, because I didn't quite write that on this slide. But the twisted boundary condition that I impose is that if I'm working in 3 plus 1d, my coordinates are x naught, x1, x2, x3. The twisted boundary condition I'll impose is that the last two coordinates x2 and x3, which I'll write in polar as r. Which I'll write in polar as R as R theta. The condition is that the form I take for R theta is it's some rapid, it's some function phi naught of R, so purely radial. And I guess I didn't write it on the slide, but that function should go up very sharply. And then it'll twist once, so it'll go, it'll have sort of winding number one as I go around that corresponds to this e to the. Around that corresponds to this e to the i theta phase I have here. And if I impose that on my order parameter and I condense that order parameter to zero and sort of solve for the theory I get when I condense that to zero and I solve the Dirac equation to derive the theory on the defect. I'll find that it's localized to the only place where the UN symmetry is preserved, which is like sort of the top of the Is preserved, which is like sort of the top of the sombrero. So we're x2, x3, and 0. So the only two dimensions I have that are free are like x0, x1. I derive this one plus 1d theory on the defect. I claim that that is the one plus 1d lower dimensional theory. And so I don't know if that necessarily answered your question, but that is the concrete form of the twisted boundary condition I have in mind. Well, I mean, it answered part of it, but I was just wanting to. Answered part of it, but I was just wanting to see how you constructed the map, sort of the map on field theories, or yeah, I mean, the map on B spin cross BU1. Okay, yeah. I don't have slides prepared on that, but yeah, that's at least computing it rationally. We have thought about that a good bit. And yeah, it's probably too much for me to get into. Yeah, it's probably too much for me to get into right now, but yeah, thanks so much for the question. I hope that was partially answered. No, no, thank you so much for your answers. Great, thanks. Are there any other questions? Any questions from the Zoom audience? Well, if there are no more questions, let's thank Cameron again.
