Okay, I think we should get underway. So, welcome to Wednesday's talks. And we are going to kick off with Margaret Billu at IST Austria. And she's going to be telling us about Zeta statistics. Over to you, Margaret. Thank you, Tim. Thank you very much. Thank you for the invitation. So, today I'm going to try to give To give a connection between geometry and arithmetic, since this is the theme of the workshop, using data functions. So this is joint work with Sean Howe and Ronald Das. And what I will mean by data functions here is, well, when x is a variety over fq, it's going to be It's going to be the usual theta function of x over fq, namely this kind of generating function of the point counts of x over all successive extensions of fq. So it's a generating function up to logarithmic derivative. If you take a logarithmic derivative, you get a generating function. Take a logarithmic derivative, you get a generating function. And so, our claim in this work is that zeta functions are very useful while trying to understand connections between arithmetic and motivic statistics. When we mean motivic here, it's in terms of when working in the Grothendieck ring of varieties. That's why I'm going to start by introducing the Grothendieck ring of varieties. So, here it is. So here it is. So it's defined over a base field. K is a field and it's denoted in this way, k0 for k. And the way I define it is that I start by taking the free abelian group on isomorphism classes of varieties over k. And I take the quotient by the so-called cotton-paste relations. The cotton-paste relations means that whenever I Phase relations means that whenever I have x a variety over k and z a closed subscheme and u the open complement of z, then I want to be able to cut up x into the sum of z and u. And in this talk, I'm actually going to need a bit modified. A bit modified growth and decreen of varieties. So it's not very important for the understanding of the talk. It's just so that the things that I state are correct. Namely, we are mostly going to be working over a finite field here. And over a finite field, there's an annoying thing called purely inseparable extensions. And so we want to get rid of those essentially. So what we do in here is that we identify In here is that we identify x with y whenever there exists f from x to y radical subjective. So when I mean radical subjective just means that it's bijective and induces Purely inseparable extensions over residue fields extensions of residue fields rather okay so it's again it's not very important for us for understanding of this talk it's just that we essentially it's the right it's the right ring to consider whenever you the right ring to consider whenever you whenever the base field k is finite it doesn't make a difference at all when it's infinite if it's if it's sorry if it's characteristic zero okay so for the moment I defined the group in the group of varieties but it also has a product namely well whenever I want to take the product of two classes I denote classes with square brackets I just take the class of the product I just take the class of the product. So, this has a unit element, which is the class of the point. And besides the class of the point, there's another special element, which is L, which is annotation for the class of the affine line. And this element L, we usually like to invert it. There are many natural settings where it's better that it should be invertible. It's better that it should be invertible. So we actually often work in the localized growth indic, which is I just take the growth indicing and I invert L. And this is actually a non-trivial operation. So it is known thanks to work of Borisov that L is a zero device in the growth indices. So we actually kill some elements by inverting L. And the last thing we need is a topology. So the topology So, the topology in a grotendic ring, and more specifically in a localized growth in the ring, there's a natural way of defining it using dimensions of varieties. So, things are going to be large if they have a very positive dimension and going to be small if they have very negative dimension. So, this is quantified using the dimensional filtration. So, the filtration is given by field D Mk is the subgroup of Mk. Of mk generated by elements of the form, I take a class of variety and multiply it by some power of the affine line, such that the dimension of the variety minus n minus the exponent of the affine line is minus d, is bounded by minus d. Is bounded by minus d. So this gives me a decreasing and an exhaustive filtration on the localized growth in the MK. And I can consider the completion with respect to this filtration, which will be denoted by mk hat. Okay, so this. Okay, so this is all I wanted to say about the Gruthen Dick ring as is. And now I want to be able to, so this is rather an algebra geometric object, but now I want to explain how we can make connections with number theory. So this will be done using the counting measure. So it's defined when the base field is finite, and it's defined in the following way. So if I have So, if I have the growth in the ring of varieties over FQ, then I can take a variety in here and just send it to its number of points over FQ. So this gives me a ring morphism from the group in the ring of varieties to Z, to the ring Z. And in fact, it's also defined on the And in fact, it's also defined on the localized growth in Dick ring. So if I invert L here, I just will have rational or more generally real values. And so what's the connection with number theory? Well, in number theory, many statements can be given in terms of point counts of Terms of point counts of certain varieties. So if I have such a statement in terms of point counts of varieties, then there's a natural way of just lifting it to a statement involving in the group nick ring of varieties. So instead of involving point counts, it's going to involve the classes of the actual underlying varieties. So I will get in this way some statement of more geometric nature. And the question is, of course, what is the is of course what is the what is the connection with uh the original number theoretic statement they started with and today i want to more specifically uh address convergence statements so the specific question that i want to speak about today is the following let an be a sequence of elements in the localized group indic and i want to compare the two following types of statements the first thing is that while my sequence The first thing is that, well, my sequence, I can always take point counts. And so, what happens if my sequence, the sequence of the point counts, they are real numbers, so it's a real sequence. What happens if this converges to some limit, which in this case will be just some real number? So, that's the first type of statement. The second type of statement is the motivic analog. So, the lift to the grutnik ring of that. Lift to the group in the ring of that statement, namely, what happens if the actual sequence converges to a limit for the dimensional topology in the growth endocrine. And the limit then is an element of the completed growth endocrine. Okay, so the first impression, of course, is that, yeah, well, Course is that, yeah, well, so if I take this thing and I specialize with via the counting measure, I should be able to deduce this thing. But it's actually not as easy as that. So the big problem in here is that the counting measure is not continuous with respect to the dimensional topology. So this means that if I have a convergence in the dimensional topology in here, I cannot deduce from it a convergence of A convergence of point counts in here. Just to give you an argument for an example of why it's not continuous, let's say we take Q to the 2n, L to the minus N. So if we look at this in terms of the dimensional topology, then you see that the dimension gets more and more negative. So this definitely goes to zero in the dimensional topology. Now, if I take point counts, then Point counts, then what do I get? Well, the point count of this is just q to the n. So it actually goes to infinity. Okay, so you see that the fact of being able to add powers of q, which is something very specific to finite fields, just completely messes up the continuity. Okay. Okay, and so the aim of this talk is to try to give an answer to: okay, we cannot just deduce one from two in general, but what can we say? How can we still compare these two statements? Is there a statement, is a natural statement that would imply both? So, this is what the point of this talk is. But before I turn to that, I just want to give you an example of exciting. Of exciting theorems in number theory and in algebraic geometry that actually where we actually have something of this type. So these are what we call Bettini-type theorems. So I just wrote them up to save some time. So let me give you the setting. I take X inside a projective space of dimension N, a smooth projective variety. So on the So, on the projective space, I can consider the global sections of the bundle O of D. So, this is just the degree D homogeneous polynomials of degree n plus 1, with n plus 1 variables, sorry. And whenever I have such a polynomial, it defines a hypersurface in Pn, and I can look at when the intersection of that hypersurface with X is transverse. So, U D here is the. So, U D here is the open subset of hypersurfaces intersecting X transversely. And so, the general question, the general vague question, is: what is the probability that such a hypersurface actually intersects X transversely? What is the kind of the density of U D inside this space? There are different approaches to that problem. There are different ways of answering this vague question. The first one is due to Bjorn Punen from 2000. Bjorn Punen from 2004. So that's a very well-known and very cool paper. So he answered the point counting version of that. So just what's the actual density in terms of the number if we are over a finite field? Okay, so he just took the number of hypersurfaces that are in the tech X transversely divided by the total numbers of hypersurfaces, and he showed that. And he showed that when the degree goes to infinity, this has a limit, and this limit is this nice-looking special value of the deta function of x. Now there's a motivic analog to this result, which came a few years later, and which is due to Ravi Bakil and Melanie Wood. So this is a result in the growth and decreen of varieties, and doesn't, as long as we use this modified growth and decrease, it doesn't. The growth and decreen, it doesn't assume anything on the base field. And so, what they proved is in terms of motivic densities. So, we take the class of UD in the Gruthindic ring of varieties, and we divide it by the class of the total space. So, why can we do that? Well, this is just a vector space. Okay, so in a localized growth indicator, this actually does make sense. This is just u d times L to the minus. L to the minus the dimension of that vector space. Okay, and they showed that this has a limit in the dimensional topology, and this limit actually looks very similar to the limit that we got in Putin's theorem. So instead of essentially, it's the same thing, but with replacing the usual zeta function, but what is called Kapranov's zeta function and replacing Q by L. Kapranov. Replacing Q by L. Kapranov's zeta function is the motivic analog of the usual zeta function. So, just very quickly, it's the generating series of the classes of the symmetric powers of X. And in the case where the base field is finite, Where the base field is finite, it actually specializes to the usual zeta function. Sorry, and then x here is x to the, I take the symmetric, it's the symmetric n-symmetric power. So I take x to the n and the n-symmetric group acts by permutation on the coordinates, and I take the quotient. Is the Vekil-Wood theorem just for finite fields, or is it general? There's no assumption on the. it's a there's no assumption on the on the on the on the field as long as long as you in for finite fields you have to work in the modified group in the ring as i uh the one i um defined earlier but it it's it's it's true regardless of the base field okay so these are two uh very compellingly uh similar looking results and so of course we want to know what what's the connection what's the link is there something that we can Connection, what's the link? Is there something that we can? Is one of the two, does one of the two imply the other? It's tempting, of course, to say that at least so when k is finite, that we should be able to deduce Punen's theorem from Bacchan and Boss's theorem. But it doesn't look obvious because of the issue with the non-continuity of the counting measure that I just told you. So, question: How can we compare these two results when the base field is finite? Finite. Yeah. And yeah, so that's that was just kind of the motivating example for actually looking at this. And I'm going to use it to illustrate our theory. Okay, so from now on, the base field is finite, some FQ. And so to solve this issue, the slogan is pass. Is passed to data functions. So, what do we mean by that? There are already some data functions in the picture here, but what I'm saying is that we can reformulate things in terms of convergence of the data functions of the varieties UD in here. So, what I mean by this, therefore, is applying what we call the data measure. Data measure, so it's a map. A map from the localized growth indic ring, which just whenever I have a variety x, it just well, well, it's a very natural thing to consider. I just want to send every x to its data function. So, where does it take its values? The data function is always rational, so we usually take as As a codomain, just a set of rational functions with complex coefficients that take the value one and zero. And so I define it over, so just as an example, for example, the affine line, the class of the affine line, where does it go? Well, it goes to one minus one over one minus qt, right? And more generally, if I take the And more generally, if I take the affine space of dimension n, then it goes to 1 minus q to the nt. And when I say that it's a measure, a mutidic measure, I mean that it's actually a ring morphism whenever we put the, when we put the right ring structure on R1. So what's the right ring structure? There are several ways of defining it. If you're familiar with which ring structures, then that... Witch ring structures, then that's essentially it. I like this other way of thinking about it because it's going to be useful later. So whenever you have a rational, whenever you have a rational function, you can also think of it in terms of its divisor. So here I write rational function. So I write it in this a little bit weird way. So the a's that appear here. So, the a's that appear here are the inverses of the zeros and poles of my function. And the exponents here, I add a minus sign everywhere. And so what do I send this function to? I send it to just some kind of variant of the divide of that function, namely this formal sum in the group. Group ring of C star. So this is not exactly the divisor of F, it's rather the minus the divisor of F to the T inverse. So why do we do this weird renormalization of the divisor? Just because so you see that L here goes to, through the data measure, goes to one over one minus Qt. And it's useful just to understand. just to understand what's going on is just to see where one over one minus qt inverse one over one minus qt goes well it's it goes by by definition exactly to just the class of the the complex number q so the the whole point of this uh this weird convention is just that l goes to q via this identification so in a sense the determination So, in a sense, the data measure is some kind of generalization of the counting measure that we saw earlier. So, instead of just keeping in mind the point count, we keep in mind all of the successive point counts packaged inside the data function. And in here, well, this is a ring by definition, and so we just take the corresponding ring structure. So, addition of functions is usual multiplication of functions, and for multiplying, when we multiply. Multiplying, when we multiply two functions, we essentially multiply the a's in here. So, for example, you see that the powers of l when we took l to the power n, we just took the nth power of the q in here. Okay, so pass to the, so we have this data measure, and now we're going to define different topologies on this ring that are going to. That are going to make zeta functions converge in different ways. And we're going to explain the connection with the thing that we considered, the problem that we considered earlier. So we have several natural ways of making data functions converge. First of all, the data functions, well, in the end, they're just power series. So we can make them converge in terms of their coefficients. So for this, we take R1 and we take it. And we take its for every function, we just take its power series expansion at zero. So this takes its values in just these power series. And this thing, I just consider it as complex sequences with product topology. So, why is this relevant for what we said? Why is this relevant for what we said? Well, if we go back to Punin's theorem, so here Punin's theorem is about point counter fq, but we could very well apply it over all successions, all extensions of fq at the same time, right? So we actually get an infinite number of Punin's theorems, and so because it's a convergence of point counts, we can actually reformulate it as It as the convergence of the zeta function of /d in the coefficient topology. So that's the connection with Punen's theorem. So now, so that's the first topology. The second topology, I call it the weight topology. So here we come back to the fact that zeta functions are rational functions. So we can also, instead of looking at their coefficients in some power series expansion, Efficients in some power series expansion, we can also look at their zeros and poles and see that they kind of converge in some way. So, therefore, it's easier to define this in terms of this divisor point of view. And it's going to be a topology that's given by a norm. So it's this infinite norm that I wrote here. And I'm going to define it as the soup of the A's with non-zero multiplicity, Ka. Multiplicity ka. So if you remember well, the a's here are the inverses of the zeros and poles. So here I'm essentially look a function will be small for this norm if it doesn't have any zeros and poles in a big disk around zero. Okay, so what's the connection? And the connection with why does we call it the weight apology? Well, because for detail functions, the size of the zeros and poles are controlled by. Size of the zeros and poles are controlled by the theory of phase of the linear. So, what's the connection with our setting here? So, now we look at Vacuin-Wood's theorem. Vaculin-Wood's theorem is a statement about dimension. So, it's about controlling the dimension of this thing. So, Vackelin-Wood's theorem can actually be reformulated as the convergence of the zeta function of u d in the weight topology. In the weight topology, again, by the whale conjectures, etc. Okay, so we now can reformulate both these theorems in terms of just convergence of data functions of UD, suitably renormalized by the dimension of that total space here, in two different but pretty natural topologies. Now that we have that, it's pretty easy to convince yourself that these two To convince yourself that these two theorems are completely incompatible, just because the two topologies that we are looking at, the coefficient topology and the weight topology, you can convince yourself pretty easily that they're completely incompatible. There's no way of comparing results, convergence results in these two topologies. Okay, so these two are completely incompatible. You can also see this when looking at You can also see this when looking at the completions of these topologies. So the completion of R1 for the coefficient topology, well, it's just this thing, just all of the power series. So when you complete with respect to the coefficient topology, you lose the rationality, but you still have functions. They are just power series. You don't have any notion of zeros and poles anymore. You just don't have any notion of divisor anymore, but you still have a function. On the other hand, if you take the completion with respect to the weight topology, Weight topology, then what you will get is some kind of space of discretely supported divisors. So they are not necessarily finitely supported anymore, but discretely supported. But in general, such a divisor will not have an interpretation in terms of a function. So in here, we get a space of functions without divisors. In here, we get a space of divisors without functions. So by comparing the completions, we can So, by comparing the completions, we also have a way of seeing that these topologies are really different. So, now our point is that we want to define a third topology on the space R1, and that this topology refines both a coefficient topology and the weight topology, and that it's kind of in the right spot so that its definition is natural in a way. Is natural in a way that the completion that we get with respect to this topology actually has both features. So the things on the completion will be both functions and will have some well-defined notion of divisor. This topology we call the Hadamard topology. You will see, I will try to explain why. It's also defined with respect to, it's also a topology defined by a norm. It will also use rather the Use rather the divisor notation. But here, instead of just taking into account sizes of zeros and poles, we also take into account the multiplicity. So the Hadamard norm is this thing. So the smaller the zero, the closer this zero is. The zero, the closer this zero is to a zero or a pole is to well, zero, the more we want some control on its multiplicity. And so we can convince ourselves that this actually refines the above two topologies. And why is it a natural topology to consider? It's because of the interpretation of its completion. So let me explain. Of its completion, so let me explain a little bit. So, what is the completion of R1 for the Heidelmann? Well, first of all, because of the way it's defined, it is also a space of some formal devices. So, it's a space of devices like this, which are discretely supported, and such that, well, this thing, the norm, is actually this thing here, which is the power series in this case, is finite. This is one. Finite. This is one way of interpreting it. Okay. But I have another way of reinterpreting it. So if I start with a divisor in here, then because of something called Hadamard factorization, Hadamard's factorization theorem, it actually makes sense to consider. To consider the following function, so I just have a divisor, so I just want to produce the function that it should be the divisor of if there were such a function. So for the negative k i I will have holes for the positive ones. And we'll have, sorry, these are zeros, these are poles. And the Hadamard factorization theorem says that this is the exact right condition for these two products to converge. And so what I get is that I have an identification of the space of discretely supported devices that I wrote down here as a space of. A space of quotients of f and g entire functions of genus zero. Okay, so they are not rational functions anymore because I have potentially infinitely many terms in my divisor, but they are entire functions of genus zero and which take the value one at zero. Value one and zero. So I have both an interpretation in terms of dividers and an interpretation in terms of functions. So this is why we think that this topology is a pretty natural one to consider and this is why we call it the Hadamard topology, because of this Hadamard Hadamard factorization theorem. So this thing here, we call it the ring of Hadamard functions. And our theory, our general guess is the following principle. So we also sometimes call it the meta-conjecture because it's very vague. So if I give myself a sequence of elements in the localized, the Grothendieck ring over a finite field Fq. Growth in the ring over a finite field Fq, which is natural in the sense that it comes from some geometric problem like these Bettini-type problems that we talk about. It's an important assumption because you can actually construct ad hoc, very ad hoc country examples to this principle otherwise. So you need some geometric origin for the sequence. So if you give yourself a sequence of classes in the group in the current Of classes in the group ring, in the groupnick ring of varieties, that is in some sense natural, and such that the sequence of the corresponding zeta functions converges to some Hadamard function, both in the coefficient and in the weight topology. So both in the first and the second topology that I defined, then it should also converge in the Hadamard topology. So with convergence. So, convergence in the coefficient topology and in the weight topology shouldn't occur independently of, they should actually, whenever they occur, they actually come from some hidden convergence in the Hadamard topology. So this is our way of kind of unifying point counting results, which are the coefficient topology convergence results, and dimensional topology results, which are the weight topology results. So, in the context of our Battini type. Context of our Bettini type problems, if we go back to Bettini, our meta conjecture in the case when we try to apply it to the specific case where the sequence here is the sequence of these spaces UD divided by the spaces gamma PNOD translates in the following way. Translates in the following way. So, if x is a smooth projective variety inside pn and u d again is the space of hypersurfaces of degree d intersecting x transversely, the sequence of data functions of u d renormalized in this manner should converge in the hadama topology. What's the limit? So, I've been pretty silent about limits, but the idea is that, so it's this week. Is that so it's this weird-looking thing. So, what do we do? We first take Capranov's zeta function, okay? Then we apply, so Capranov Zeta function, remember, is this generating series of symmetric powers of x, and we apply the zeta measure to all of the coefficients of that Caprano-zeta function. So now we get a deta function, but with deta function with coefficients that are also deter functions, okay. And then we evaluate it, but so what do we it? It's now a So, what do we? It's now a power series with coefficients in R1, and we evaluate it at this thing, which what is this? It's the detail function of L to the minus dimension of x minus 1. So it's a detail function with detail function coefficients evaluated at a zeta function. And I don't have enough time to go into details of why this is well defined, but you can believe me that this is well defined and this is the right limit. Me that this is well defined, and this is the right limit, and so this thing here is actually a Hadamard function. Okay, so unfortunately, we cannot prove this conjecture except in like when x is p1. But so my co-authors, Sean and Toronto, are working maybe on a topological approach to the problem. We hope to get more to say about this. to get to get more to say about this so uh we still do have evidence for our uh for our principle here we have um verified it in several in several contexts or at least proven had an art convergence in several contexts so i just want to uh illustrate uh just talk about one context where we uh have a have a result and this is uh about uh pattern avoiding zero cycles so before i uh give the geometric problem i want to just The geometric problem, I want to just start with an arithmetic motivation for that problem just so that you see where this comes from and why this is interesting for the more, especially for the more arithmetically minded among you like myself. So the motivation from number theory is the following. So when you have an m tuple of integers a1 up to a n, you say that they are relatively n prime if they are not the If they are not divisible by some common nth power. Okay, so equivalently, their GCD is nth power free. So there's a natural question that you can ask yourself given if I fix myself m, so the size of the tuple, and then fix myself n, so the power that I want to avoid, what is the proportion of m tuples that are relatively n prime among Relatively n prime among the integers up to a certain bound. And so it's a folklore theorem in number theory that this proportion, when the bound d goes to infinity, exists and equals to this funny looking special value of the Riemann data function. In particular, one fun thing is that the limit actually only depends on the product mn. So this is why you have this coincidence that you have this coincidence that when you well so the proportion of square free integers is is six over pi squared and the proportion of pairs of integers that are relatively prime is also six over pi squared just because one would one times two is two times one okay so that's the number theoretic motivation and so now the geometric problem is the following so I give myself x So I give myself x, a quasi-projective variety over a field k. Here it's not, for the moment, it's not like just for the definition, it's not important that the field be finite. And I look at the following space. So I integers here, I'm going to be replaced by zero cycles, by effective zero cycles, and so primeness, relative primeness, will just be replaced by these zero cycles having points in common. Cycles having points in common of a certain multiplicity. Okay, so this space Xn, so n just gives me the multiplicities that I want to avoid, and d1 dm gives myself the sizes of the effective zero cycles. So it's a space of m tuples of zero cycles, C1 up to Cm, such that whenever I have a point x, well, it has a multiplicity in each of the zero cycles. Has a multiplicity in each of the zero cycles, and I don't want all of these multiplicities to be simultaneously all at least n. So, this is the same as wanting to avoid nth powers. So as an example of what spaces this contains, so for example, x2d, so if m equals 1, so I just have one zero cycle, and I want to avoid multiplicity two. Well, this is exactly the configuration space of the distinct points of x. Distinct points alpha x. And so our theorem is the following. When I look at the proportion of x of the space of zero cycles inside the total space here, and I specialize by the detail measure, I have convergence. I have convergence in the Hadama topology to again this zeta specialization of Capranov's zeta function. So this plays the role of the zeta function in here. And you see that I have again just the dependence on the product m times n. So just a few remarks on this. So I'm cheating a little bit when I say that it's Hadamard topology convergence result. Actually, what we proved is Actually, what we proved is that this holds so that the zeta measure here can be replaced by any other motivic measure with values in a normed ring, which satisfies some natural conditions. These conditions being essentially that, so that, for example, this is actually invertible after because if I remove this, this element in the Griffinic ring in general is not invertible. Griffinic ring in general is not invertible. So this, and so that we can evaluate actually here. Okay, so that's the first remark. The second remark is that, so what was our original motivation for looking at this question? Well, because there's a very nice paper by Benson Farb, Jesse Wools, and then Melanie Wood that studies these spaces here. So it proves much. Spaces here. So it proves much more than what we can prove with our methods, because it computes a whole spectral sequence that computes the homology of these spaces in a very detailed way. But they did ask for a motivic lift of some of their results, and this actually provides the motivic lift they were asking for. And I mean, such a spaces, I think, essentially the configuration spaces were also studied in. were also studied in the same paper of Ravi Vakil and Melanie Wood that contained this vacillin wood result from earlier on. And so how did we prove this just quickly? So how convergence in general is hard to establish? So this is one thing that we've learned to live with just because it's about controlling the sizes. The sizes of the zeros and poles and their multiplicities of the multiplicities of the poles, the zeros of the zeta function. And this is related to controlling the Betty numbers in our sequence of varieties. So this is related to difficult questions like homological stability, representation stability, and it also involves some, usually, if you like. some usually if you like the most systematic approach will be uh to also uh use some some boundings of stable uh of unstable cohomology so these are all these are all difficult questions so whenever you want to uh prove hadama convergence by brute force usually it's it's difficult and it involves some um some in some some some topology that's why we cannot do the bertini type things that uh i talked about earlier uh but here we were lucky because actually we we Lucky because actually, we realized, and that's why also we managed to do this for many other matrix measures, in the sense that we figured out that there was just a pretty simple generating function argument that could do this. So we just wrote down the generating function for the spaces that we are looking for. We divided by the generating function for these big spaces that they live in. And we realized that this was actually exactly just by Just by looking at what the coefficients were, we realized that this was actually just exactly the Capranov's Zeta function, some variant of Kapranov's zeta function. And so by using some generating function tricks, we could recover the result from here. And so you see that the special value here comes from evaluating this thing at some power of L. Yeah, so yeah, that's all I have to say about this argument. So, just very quickly about other evidence that we have. So, another thing that we worked on is the motivic battery of Manning conjecture. So, I won't go into details as to what it is. There's going to be a talk, I think, tomorrow by Emmanuel Perr about the Mutidic Battery of Manning conjecture in particular. So, what we did. Um, so what we uh what we did is um actually proving um generalizing some results of Bourkey on the botivic battery of mine conjecture for split toy varieties. So Bourky had results in that were true only in the Gruthindic ring of child motifs and using actually some things related to these these zero cycle spaces I've just talked about, we managed to lift results to the growth indicator of varieties. In particular, we have a huge In particular, we have a unified approach to the battery of mining conjecture in the motility case and in the point counting case in this four-split toric varieties. And we also did using techniques a little bit similar to these spaces of zero cycles, we also have some results with labeled configuration spaces. So yeah, that's that's. So yeah, that's all we have for the moment. Thank you very much. Thanks very much, Margaret. Does anyone have any questions or comments? I have a question. So first of all, for battery, this multiple battery of manning conjecture for spritoric variety. So your approach, I think you are just. your approach i think you are generalizing the book is approach but uh so i think i believe that this approach is more close to closer to like cockstring approach is that correct like a cock yeah yeah so but um so the you actually don't really see this in what we did because essentially the whole cockstring part of gorky's argument um goes um works uh works in the griffinik ring of varieties and it's when he starts looking at convergence issues of the high multivic high data functions that he has problems Multivic high detail functions that he has problems when in the growth nickring of varieties. So, yeah, we can actually kind of take Rookie's paper at like page 30 and do things after that. So, is there any chance of a kind of batch of harmonic canners approach to prove such a statement? I would love to know that. Also, I have one more question. This is not related to your talk directly, but I think in your paper, I read your paper, and then in your paper, I think you have a statement like if you have some kind of homological services, like a bound of homology, like extra band, then you have actually convergence in this topology, like Adamat topology. I think you have a settlement, and then you are certainly a variety is smooth. I think CK and variety. Is smooth, I think. CK some varieties, smooth varieties. Is that correct? I think this is. Um, yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't remember the exact statement. Uh, I don't know if smooth probably no, and I saw that again, smoothness is necessary because of one calendarity or something. That probably is something like that, yeah. I see, I see. I don't remember the exact, uh, yeah, I remember, I, I, yeah, I mean, I know that uh, we have this thing with stable cohomology and uh and bounds. Uh and bounds and unstable cohomology. But yeah, I think there's probably you probably need some smoothness assumption. I don't remember. All right. Thank you very much. Great talk. Any further questions? I just want to double check. Borky's results are for all Tauric varieties, right? Not just the split ones. So the point counting, he did a very, very, for the point counting version, he did a very, he has an analysis for. He has an analysis for all variety, all toric varieties, but the Mutivic paper is specifically for split toric varieties. Okay, thank you. So this conjecture about convergence in the Hadamard topology for spaces of smooth hypersurfaces, you mentioned P1, but can you do it for curves of higher genus in productive space? No, so contrary to what we No, so contrary to what we probably we claimed in the like prior versions of our paper, so Sean thought he had an argument and actually we think it doesn't doesn't work. So that's one of our like first objectives right now to just do it for curves. Yeah. And then so when you say that this convergence in the weight topology reformulates topology reformulates the like the result of a kila wood about convergence in the uh in the in the um dimension filtration like what exactly do you mean by that because like i mean you don't mean it's logically equivalent right like um so we um what do we what do we well no i i don't think well because uh of course like I don't think, well, because of course, like it's when specialized, I guess what we mean is that when you take the back end with result and you specialize and you apply the data measure, you should get convergence. Yeah, the strongest statement about point count that follows from that result is a convergence point. That makes sense. Cool, thanks. Are there any more questions? Well, if not, let's thank Margaret once again. And there was a small change in the schedule, meaning that we have an extended break now until the next talk, which will be, I guess, in just under an hour, an hour and eight minutes. I'm going to post the Cather Town. The Gathertown stuff in the link in the chat in case you want to go there and hang out. But otherwise, we'll be back on Zoom in an hour and eight minutes. Her for Isabel Bot. Point. Thanks. See you then.
