So, we're going to resume with the second talk of today. It's a pleasure to have Jaime Santos Rodriguez from Bonn, and he's going to speak about isometries of curved metric measure spaces. Thank you, Jaime. Well, first of all, thank you very much to the organizers for inviting me to. Organizers for inviting me to give this talk. And well, today, as Jesus said, I'm going to talk about isometries of curved metric measure spaces. And well, from the previous talks of Fabio and Daniele, we already had a lot of discussion about things like optimal transport and bus substance. Things like optimal transport and Baselstein spaces and Richie curvature. And well, the idea of this talk will be to focus on symmetries of spaces that satisfy certain curvature bounds. The plan of the talk is first I will recall some things about the optimal transport and Baselstein spaces and of rich curvature, especially those structural things that I will need. And finally, And finally, I will really talk about isometries both on metric measure spaces and on the Basserstein space over a metric measure space. So let's begin with the background. And as Fabio mentioned yesterday, when one has a complete and separable metric space, given two probability measures, one Given two probability measures, one can talk about the Munch-Kantarovich optimal transport problem, which consists in minimizing this functional, where one takes a measure pi and computes the integral of the square of the distance. And we ask pi to be an admissible plan that is a measure on the probability measure on the product of x with itself, such that it has marginals mu and new. Mu and new. The important thing to remember here is that the set of admissible plans is always non-empty. There's always the product measure, and that solutions to this problem always exist, and they are called optimal transports. Using the Munch-Kantorovich problem, we can look at Look at the set of probability measures with finite second moments, that is, probability measures such that the integral of the square of the distance from a fixed point x0 is finite. And when we look at this set, we can actually define a distance between two probability measures of finite second moments using the solutions to the Munch-Kantorovich problem. To the Munch-Kantorovich problem. And well, the resulting space equipped with this distance will be called the Basserstein space, the L2 Basserstein space. This space has nice properties that are shared with the Bayes space, such that it is complete and separable. It is compact if and only if X is compact. However, we look However, we lose if X is unbounded, then the Basserstein space will not be locally compact. We also have an isometric embedding of X into the Basserstein space by taking each point to the Dirac delta at that point. And finally, with respect to sectional curvature, if our space has a negative sectional curvature, then sectional curvature, then the L2 Baselstein space will also be non-negatively curved in the sense of Alexander spaces. One important property that we will need is that the Baselstein space is a geodesic space when the base space is geodesic. By geodesic, I mean curves from zero to one to our space such that the space such that the distance between gamma s and gamma t equals the absolute value of the difference between s and t multiplied by the distance between gamma zero and gamma one. The space of geodesics will be denoted by this, ge of x. And well a geodesic space is one where for every two points one can always find a geodesic in this sense. I will also need I will also need these evaluation maps, which just take a geodesic and evaluate it at time t. And well, we have a theorem of Ambrosio and Gilli that if X is a geodesic space, then the Washerstein space is also geodesic. And furthermore, we have that if a curve is a geodesic in the Wasarstein space, then it's the same as having a measure at. same as having the measure eta now supported on the space of geodesics such that when I do the push forward with the endpoint map I obtain an optimal transport between eta zero and eta one and the geotechnical seq can be seen as the push forward by the evaluation maps. So this tells us that the mass moves along geodesics of my space. Of my space. Well, quickly, let me give a couple examples of this. If we take two points, x, p and q, there's only one admissible plan, the product measure, and say we have geodesics between p and q, say gamma and sigma. One possible Baselstein geodesic could be just taking the curve that moves along. The curve that moves along the curve Dirac deltas at the points of the curve gamma. So we get the mass moves along Dirac deltas, but we could also, in the presence of a different geodesic, be a bit more creative and split mass, giving, say, one half along gamma and the other half along sigma. So there appear more geodesics. There appear more geodesics between direct deltas, for example, than those given by the original space. Okay, move on. And that's all I needed for Masterstein spaces. Now I can recall notions of synthetic Ricci curvature. We will focus on metric measure spaces during this talk, such that they are complete. This talk such that they are complete, separable, and geodesic, and will be called a reference measure, will be non-negative, finite on bounded sets, and of full support. The typical example to keep in mind is a Riemannian manifold with the distance induced by the Riemannian metric and the volume with some weight. As Fabio mentioned yesterday, in order to get away from the main method Mentioned yesterday, in order to talk about lower each curvature bounds, it is useful to define certain functionals. We take a probability measure mu and we define its relative entropy in this way. We integrate rho log rho with respect to a reference measure where rho is the Radon-Nicodem derivative and this And this is defined where this is locally integrable, is integrable. Otherwise, we set it as plus infinity. And we will look at the subset of measures with a finite entropy. And well, this is a good thing to consider given that Storm and von Ranesse noticed that low-rich curvature bounds in Riemannian manifolds are characterized by Are characterized by convexity properties of the entropy. And clearly, this definition doesn't rely on the Bay space being smooth. So you can define it on a more general setting. Now let me talk about what do we mean by convexity. Well, take a function s from xd to minus. from xd to minus plus infinity and some number n we define this auxiliary function u n of x which is the exponential of minus one over n times s and we define a functional to be k n convex for some k real number and as before if and only if for every two points x 0 and x 1 in the X0 and X1 in the finitness domain of S, there exists some geodesic gamma connecting them and such that for all t we have this inequality. For this sigma, k and one over t are called the distortion coefficients. I won't give them explicitly, but let me just say that But let me just say that in the case of k being equal to zero, they simplify to just one minus t and t. So you recover a more usual sense of convexity. Using this, Erebar, Kuwada and Sturm defined that a metric measure space will satisfy the entropic curvature dimension condition. entropic curvature dimension condition, C D E Kn for some values of K and N, if and only if the entropy functional is Kn convex. This is not the original definition of curvature dimension condition given by Lotton Billini, since they use a different entropy functional and a slightly different notion of convexity. But later on in the talk, it will be useful to use this definition and I will mention its relation with other notions a bit later. But first, let's review some examples and then some properties. Well, Riemannian manifolds satisfy the CDEKN condition. EKN condition. So Alexandria spaces, as proven by Petrunin, and there's a stability under measured Gromov-Hausorf limits. And one can also multiply by a density in the sense that if I start with the C D E K n space and some function that is K prime n prime convex, then the space then the space xd the exponential of minus b times m will be a cde k plus k prime n plus m n prime space. So you can give other densities in order to modify these bounds. As for structural properties of these spaces, we have that the n plays the role That the n plays the role of being an upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of x, that the reference measure is locally doubling, meaning that we can control the volume of a ball of radius 2r with the measure of a ball of radius r times a constant. So there is some relation between the measure and the distance. The measure and the distance. And finally, that our space XDM is proper, so, in particular, it will be locally compact. And this will be especially useful when I talk about the isometry group. Now, one of the things that one would like to do with the synthetic notions of curvature is to have a is to have non-smooth analogs of Riemannian manifolds. And we would like to generalize classical results to this new setting. For example, the splitting theorem. So in a remaining manifold with non-negative rich curvature that contains a line, then M is isometric to a product of N times R for some manifold N of non-negative rich curvature. With the definition as given until now, this result is not true because, for example, we have spaces like R2 with this norm and the Lebesgue measure, and clearly it has a lot of branching geodesics, and clearly it has lines, but it is not isometric to say R2 with the usual distance. Usual distance. So you need to impose more. And for this, Ambrosio, Gigli, and Savare impose an additional assumption in order to obtain a more Riemannian behavior. Given a function f in L2, they define the Tiger energy, just by saying, okay, take a sequence of Lipschitz functions that converge. That converge to f in L2. We can compute the energy for these Lipschitz functions. Then you take the limin of the limit, and then you just take the infimum over all possible sequences. So you obtain an energy for F and you say that, okay, a metric measure space is infinitesimally Hilbertian if the Hilbertian, if the Tiger energy is a quadratic form. And when one imposes this, you get rid of pathological behavior that you might not want, such as, for example, films or geometries and spaces with lots of branching geodesics. And it will turn out that we can then give the definition of remaining core. Then give the definition of Riemannian curvature, the Riemannian curvature dimension condition. That is, we ask for both things, that the metric measure space is both C D E Kn and infinitesimally Hilbertian. We still have Riemannian and Alexandro spaces. We still have stability of R C D star Kn spaces. And under the assumption of infinitesimally hilarion, the conditions of entropic Conditions of entropic C D and of C D star are equivalent. And this was proved by Herbard, Cuwada, and Sturma. So from now on, I will only talk about C D star K and spaces. Okay, and now let me just mention the two structural properties that I will need for talking about geodesics. We're talking about geodesics. The first one is the essential non-branching by Jigli Rahalan Shturma, saying that if I have an RCDK, RCD star K in space, then for every two measures such that one of them, mu, is absolutely continuous with respect to the reference measure, there is a unique optimal transport that it is induced by a map. That is, there exists some T that pushes forward. Some t that pushes forward mu to nu, and such that the optimal transport pi has this expression. We also have that the measure eta supported on the geodesics of X is concentrated on a set of non-branching geodesics, and that the geodesic in the Baselstein space is unique, and for all intermediate measures between zero. Measures between zero and one, we still remain absolutely continuous. These will play a role at the very end of the talk, but I will recall them when I discuss the results. The second structural properties, which Daniele mentioned, is that of tangent spaces. Let's recall that. Let's recall that a space Y, a pointed space Y D Y N Y is a tangent of my metric measure space at a point P if there exists sequence that diverges such that the rescaling of X converges in the pointed Roman Hauser topology to this Y. And well, okay, in Riemannian manifolds, regardless of the base point. Regardless of the base point, I always get a Euclidean space for general metric spaces. When one chooses the base point, you can get different things as illustrated in this drawing. Say if we start pointing at P, then I obtain the same space. If it's from Q, I would get like R2, say, and if it's R. And if it's R, then I would get the line. And well, the important thing about RCD spaces first is the Euclidean tangents by Mondino Neighbor, where they find that almost every X has a unique Euclidean tangent, but that the dimension might change from one point to the other, moving in the range. The other moving in the range of one and the integer part of n. And later it was improved by Bruet and Semola, showing that there actually exists a particular n called the essential dimension, such that almost every point in X has a unique Euclidean tangent of that dimension. So these are the only two structural things that I will need that essential numbers. That essential non-branching, and that the tangents are for almost every point Euclidean. So now, with this, I can really talk about isometries. Let's discuss automorphisms of RCD KL spaces. As mentioned by Fernando, one classical question in geometry is to determine when a group of mean when a group of automorphisms that preserve a given structure is a Lie group. In the case of RCD star cane spaces, we have two structures, the metric and the measure. So maybe the group of transformation that's more natural to look at would be to take isometries that also fix the reference measure. The surprising thing is that The surprising thing is that actually you only need to look at the isometry group. You can ignore what happens to the measure. But I will mention later what can be said about isometries acting on the reference measure. And the result obtained in collaboration with Luis Guijaro and that was obtained by Gerardo Sosa independently. By Gerardo Sosa independently, is that for an RCD star Kn space, the isometry group is actually a Lie group. Previous results were obtained for non-collapsing Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Riemannian manifolds by Chiger and Colding, and for Alexandro spaces, the result was proved by Fukaya and Yamaguchi. So let me give a bit of the Let me give a bit of the strategy used to obtain this. First of all, we give the isometry group the compact open topology. And since RCD spaces are locally compact, then the isometry group is also locally compact. And now that we know this, we can use a theorem of Gleason and Jamabe that characterizes Lie groups. And it says that if G is a locally compact topological group, and we suppose that it is not a Lie group, then for every neighborhood of the identity element in G, we can always find a non-trivial compact subgroup of G contained in U. And for example, if we take the whole Hawaiian earring, which is just taking Taking circles of smaller and smaller radius and gluing them at some point, particular point, then we get that the isometric group cannot be a Lie group. So this is one example. And for the strategy of the proof, we will use this result. And we proceed by contradiction. We proceed by contradiction. So, if it's not a Lie group, we can obtain a sequence of small compact non-trivial subgroups, gamma n. And we use a theorem of Fukaya and Yamaguchi that says that if you have a sequence of locally compact metric spaces pointed, and you have groups, compact groups, gamma, acting by isometric. Groups, gamma, acting by isometries on them, and you assume that these spaces converge to some other space Y in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense, then one can always find a closed group of isometries of Y, of the limit, let's call G, such that the convergence is actually equivariant. And now the idea to prove the theorem is that we can use that almost every point has a unique Euclidean tangent. So we take y to be Rn, and we can use these small subgroups and find that the limit group given by Fuka and Jamaguchi would actually be small. So the trick here. So the trick here is to choose carefully the base point and we can choose it thanks to the essential non-branching and we choose it in a way that we can be sure that the limit group is non-trivial because the theorem of Fukushima and Jamaguchi doesn't really tell you if the group is trivial or not. Is trivial or not, and we also play a bit with the rescaling in order to obtain that it is actually small. And when we have a small subgroup acting on Rn, we get the contradiction. Here, let me point out that we only really use the essential non-branching and the almost everywhere uniqueness of were uniqueness of the tangents. So the proof could be applied to a more general setting without really assuming curvature. You just need some information on the tangents and on the optimal transport. With this, we also obtained bounds on the dimension of the isometric group. The dimension of the isometric group, we obtain that the dimension of the isometric group is of x is bounded from above by the integer part of n times the integer part of n plus 1 over 2, where n is the upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of x and we just is the proof of so. Is the proof also the same as your proof? All of the proofs actually in either Alexandrov or the non-collapsing also use the tangents structure. It's basically the same strategy using that, okay, I know that the limit space already has the isometric group being Li. So you just play around with constructing this small limit group. limit group so it's basically the same strategy strategy i apply it a little bit differently for finding the base point but the overall the uh it's sort of the same and well once we found the the bounds we also obtained that when the isometry group has dimension actually n times n plus one over two Times n plus 1 over 2, then it must be isometric to one of these four spaces: either the Euclidean space, the round sphere, the projective space, or the hyperbolic space. And the idea is just showing that the action must be transitive and then finding that it is actually a manifold, and then using the R. The R condition to force it to actually be a Riemannian manifold. Okay. But now let's go back and think, okay, what happens to the group of measure-preserving isometries, which was the more natural group to work with? Well, it turns out that if this group G also preserves the measure, Also preserves the measure, it is closed and it is then also a Lie group. And if we further assume that it is compact, Galas-Garcia, Kell, Mondino, and Sosa obtained this theorem that if I take G, a compact subgroup of measure-preserving isometries, then the quotient space is also RCD star kn. And let me just give a brief. And let me just give a brief sketch of the proof of this. And the idea is this. Okay, you take some measure mu tilde that is in the quotient space such that it looks like this. It is rho times m star, which is just rho, the push forward by q, the quotient map of the original m. Then you can define this map. You take This map. You take this measure mu tilde and then you send it to pro precomposed with Q as the density. Where this space PQ of G will consist of those measures that are G invariant and that are absolutely continuous with respect to M. And the idea is that this space Is that this space has nice properties, which are the following? It is actually isometric to the space P2 of the quotient space and that the entropies behave nicely. They are the same. So using these two things, you can then get that, okay, then clearly the entropy with respect The entropy with respect to the quotient measure is also k-n convex. The thing here is that if we remove the assumption on g preserving the measure, then we don't longer know very easily how the entropies on the quotient and on the original space behave with respect to one another. So maybe an open question that people could try is finding whether if I take a compact group of isometries and I don't care about what happens to the measure, if I still retain curvature bounds on the quotient, whether or not this is true. Because so far there's no counterexample or anything. Or anything. So maybe this is something people could try. Okay, but how does the isometry group act on measures? Well, a natural action would be the following. Take G and isometry, mu, some measure, and then you can just send it to the push forward. And what we notice that in the particular case. notice that in the particular case of Baserstein spaces this action will actually be by isometries and it is also very easy to see that if I take g an isometry then if I look at g in this way of x d m to x d g push forward of m then this is an isomorphism of metric measure spaces so one gets that okay One gets that, okay, XDM is an RCD space if and only if this one is also an RCD space, right? Okay, why do I care about this simple observation? Well, because Kell found the following. If I have a metric space Xd and there are two measures, M1 and M2, that make it R C D star Kn. Star Kn then M1 and M2 must be mutually absolutely continuous. So as a corollary of the previous observation, we get that G push forward of M is actually phi of G of M. That is, there is some density depending on G. Okay, so the isometry. The isometry actually preserves some things. And I found that pretty useful because then one can use this idea to do the following. If I take an RCD space and G a compact subgroup only of isometries, then I can always find a G invariant measure Mg. A gene variant measure Mg that will be equivalent to M. That is, Mg and M will be mutually absolutely continuous and such that now X D Mg is still an R C D star Kn space. The idea to prove this result is use that the push forwards of the reference measure. Of the reference measure will have will look like this. And then one constructs the measure mg in such a way that the entropy with respect to mg will look like the integral of these different entropies using the hard measure of g. So the idea is: okay, I need this functional to be kn convex and I Convex, and I define it by using it as a mean of kn convex functionals. Of course, one needs to be really careful with things like definiteness domain and things like that, but the basic idea is that you just take a mean of kn convex functionals and you still obtain a kn convex functional. And by equivalent, we mean all very mutually different functions. Yeah. And well, now that this is done, let me now go to the final part of the talk, which is discussing the isometries of the Bassofstein space. Okay, let's take P between 1 and infinity, and we can define the L P Baserstein distance for measures with For measures with finite p-moments, just like in the L2 case, taking the solution to the Monch-Kantorovich problem, but for different exponent. And as I mentioned before, the action by taking push forwards will be an isometric action. So the question here is that, okay, the geometry of X and of the Baselstein space are closely related. Closely related. So, in terms of isometries, one could wonder: okay, this is a metric space. Is it possible for it to be more symmetric than the Bay space? Or are symmetries of X determining all the symmetries of the Baselstrain space? That is, I would like to know if given phi If given phi an isometry of the Basselstein space, if there exists some isometry G now of the Bayes space, such that phi of mu equals the push forward of mu by G for all measures. Okay, I would like to know if all isometries have this form or if you can find some other things. This question is not new. It was first posed by Klagner for the Euclidean case and for the exponent p equals 2. And he actually finds that there are isometries of the L2 Baselstein space over Rn that don't come from Rn. That is, he finds isometries phi that are not the identity. That are not the identity, but such that they fix every Dirac delta. And furthermore, what is really more interesting here is that in the special case of R, there are actually isometries that are set to pull away mass from infinity. The idea is that when you look at these special isometries acting on measure Acting on measures that have two atoms. Then, if you keep applying them, then one of the atoms goes to plus infinity or minus infinity. You keep applying the isometric phi. And this is a really strange thing that can happen. Other works for the case p equals one, which shouldn't really surprise us. That is. Really surprises that is exotic because L1 transport is not doesn't behave as nicely as the case of p equals two, for example. And in this case, Ger, Titkos, and Viroztek found isometries in the case of the L1 Basselstein space over the interval 0, 1. Interval 0, 1 that are told to be mass splitting. That is, they find isometries that don't always send Dirac deltas to Dirac deltas. They find some maps G from P1 of the interval to P1 of the interval, such that, say, in the case of Dirac deltas, a Dirac delta dt goes to T times the Dirac delta at zero plus one minus T the Dirac delta at one. Delta at one. So it really splits the mass and sends it in this way. So the idea is that, okay, seeing these two things, perhaps one would study compact spaces and one could maybe hope for rigidity, that is that the isometric groups are the same, but for an exponent for p strictly greater than one. Strictly greater than one, because already, in a very, very nice setting, this is not true. And well, the first step is to do the following. If I take a map, it is clear that the push forward of Dirac delta is always a Dirac delta. So the first thing one would like to look at is what happens to Happens to the embedded image of X, that is the space of Dirac deltas, on the Robus sine isometries. And the result obtained is the following. If I take a metric measure space that is compact, geodesic, but non-branching, equipped with a measure M that is qualitatively non-degenerate and with good transport behavior. This for some exponent P. For some exponent p between one and infinity. This condition only tells us that the optimal transport behaves nicely. You just think about non-branching RCD star came spaces or Riemannian manifolds. The idea is that you ask that for any measure, the geodesic between any two measures such that one of them is absolutely. One of them is absolutely continuous with respect to M is unique. It remains absolutely continuous in the interior, and pretty much that's it. And when under these assumptions, we obtain that any isometry phi must send Dirac deltas to Dirac deltas. And okay, let me. And okay, let me give a sketch of the ideas of the proof of this. So first, yeah, examples of spaces that satisfy this sort of obscure condition are RCD starrettlean spaces and Riemann manifolds. Okay, so for the sketch of the proof. sketch of the proof. Take mu absolutely continuous with respect to m. Then for any two other measures, nu 0 and μ 1 and some t between 0 and 1, then when I look at the p power of the Basel sign distance between m and the convex combination of these two, then this is strictly less than t times the p power of the distance to nu zero plus to nu zero plus one minus t the p power of the distance to nu one and this follows from the properties of having that the transport must be given by a map and that it is unique and from this once you prove this you get that the archmax that is measures that realize the maximum of this functional which i'm using Which I'm using, I'm in a compact space, then these must be actually Dirac deltas whenever I take mu to be absolutely continuous in here. Okay, so once I have this, then notice the following. If I take some other measure nu, absolutely continuous, that is not fixed by an isometry phi of the Basars. Of the Basel sine space, which must exist, otherwise, it is the identity, then one can do the following. Okay, take the geodesic between nu and phi minus one of nu. Then intermediate measures mu are absolutely continuous. I apply a phi to the geodesic, which sends it to another geodesic. Now that, say, starts at that say starts at phi of nu and ends at phi at b nu and i take that okay the intermediate measure must be phi of nu then again since this one is absolutely continuous then this forces that this one is also absolutely continuous so i know that there are measures that keep being absolutely continuous under basterstein isometries And I use them in this way. Okay, I take mu absolutely continuous, such that it is not fixed by phi, and that phi of mu is still absolutely continuous. And it's clear that the argmax under phi is the argmax of now this functional starting of phi of mu. So from this, I get that, okay, there exists. I get that, okay, there exists some point that the such that the Dirac delta at x under phi is again a Dirac delta at some other point, Y. And from here, let me further assume that, okay, in the case that X is a Riemannian manifold, then one can finish the proof quite quickly because one can do the following. Following. Okay, for almost every point P, once I have this point X that actually is sent to Adriac Delta, I can always extend the geodesic a little bit. So the situation looks like this. I apply again phi, and then I obtain a new geodesic, now with an intermediate point that is a Dirac delta. And in here, one uses that. And in here, one uses that geodesics in the Basserstine space cannot branch if the base space is also non-branching. And this one forces that phi of delta P and phi of delta Q to also be Dirac deltas. And since we are in our remaining manifold, then one can do this for almost every point and one obtains. point and one obtains the result. Okay, but what about the rigidity? Well in the rigidity we needed to assume further information about the geometry of the base space. We obtained that if we assume M to be a closed Riemannian manifold of strictly positive sectional curvature. sectional curvature, then the L2 Baselstein space over M is isometrically rigid, then the isometric groups are the same, but I need to assume a strictly positive sectional curvature. Basically, the idea is that under this assumption, then the Wasserstein space is again an Alexander space and you can use that information. And the second one is that if you receive Is that if you restrict yourself to compact ranked one symmetric spaces, the so-called crosses, then for any P strictly greater than one, then the isometric groups of M and the L P Baselstein space coincide. The idea here is that there are a lot of geometric properties of these spaces. These are the round sphere and the prediction. The round sphere and the projective real projective plane and so on. And in this case, one can really use all the geometric information to conclude this thing. Sorry, what's the difference between the two conclusions? One is just the two and the other. Yeah, the first one only works for two, because then you have that in this case, it's actually an Alexander space. And here from the geometry. From the geometry of the base space, you can get more information, but only in these particular cases. And then you have it for all exponents. And well, I think I won't say more about the proof, but I think this is a good place to stop. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you, Jaime, for the very beautiful talk. Are there any questions within the audience or at the Zoom? Yeah. All right, so for the case of smooth manifolds, there's this very beautiful result by Banyaga that says that for That says that for volume-preserving diffeomorphism groups, determine a compact smooth manifold up to diffeomorphism. And my question is whether you think this would hold for RCD KN spaces. So really would one expect for the group of measure-preserving isometries to determine an RCD KN space up to, say, measure-preserving isometry? And I'm asking this because some of the techniques needed. Techniques needed for Banyaga's proof involve exactly having that the isometry group is Li for Riemannian manifolds and working at the level of the diffimorphism group with its Li structure. So thanks. Well, the thing here is that first, what would one use instead of the diffeomorphism group for RCD? Measure preserving. So, the question would be: you have two ICDKN spaces with isomorphic measure-preserving isometry groups. Does that imply that those two ICDKN spaces are measure-preserving isometric? No, I mean, I don't think so. I would need to think about it with more. Think about it with more more slowly. Yeah, but I don't even maybe, maybe not. I would need to look at them. Maybe in some cases it would be clearer for complex companies. Okay. So I guess, as always, one would first look at, I know, a non-collapsed case and maybe try from there. There, but I honestly don't know how one would do that. Maybe look at the smooth proof and see what one could use, but I'm not even sure how much of the smooth structure is actually used there. So yeah, I would need to give it a look. Any further questions for Jaime? Questions for Jaime? Yeah, can I ask a question? So, thanks, Jaime, for the very nice talk, Itandrea. Just a question about, say, the framework where your last theorem applies. So, you say P equal to 2 R C D. So, does it hold also for maybe for essential non-branching C D or you really need the R C D for simplicity or that you mentioned R C D star? Or if you referred to. You refer to this one, yeah, exactly. Yeah, okay. The thing here is that, okay, you only really need the measure to satisfy this qualitatively non-degenerate and the good transport behavior in order for the proof to work. And I just put like okay, examples of this of spaces that satisfy this are RCD and Riemannian manifolds, but it holds in. But it holds in what I think good generality because this doesn't really imply a curvature bound in any sense. It's more having a nice behavior of the optimal transport and knowing that geodesics behave nicely. I mean, the thing that changes in the proof is this last thing. In order to obtain this, you need to work a lot more. This, you need to work a lot more because you cannot do this. You can be very unlucky and find that this Dirac Delta is never in the interior of other geodesics in Bayes Bay. So you could be very, very unlucky. But still, you can try to do some things and then get the result, but it's a lot more complicated. I see. Yeah, thank you. I see. Yeah, thank you. Just wanted to mention that maybe I know if you know this paper is quite recent by Cavalletti, McCann, and other three authors, where I think maybe also essentially non-branching for every P could be true. Say your assumption could be true also for C D essential branching for every P. And maybe you could have a look at no, you know, this paper is a Could have a look at no, this paper is of last year or so by Cavaliki, Mecca, and others. Maybe you can put it in the chat if it's useful. Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, I will take a look at that paper. Maybe it helps. Okay, great. Any further questions? Well, maybe just a question continuing from Andrea's question. So do So, do you really need non-branching, or is essence non-branching enough as Andreas? At least for the proof I managed to get, yeah, you really need the non-branching in order to really obtain enough Dirac deltas that are sent to Dirac deltas in order to conclude. I really need that thing. Maybe there's another way to obtain the same result, but. Obtain the same result, but at least that's the one I could manage to get. Okay. Okay. Any more questions for Jaime? A quick question. So what happens for non-non-negative curvature? Do you know? Is it non-rigid? I don't know. The thing is that. I don't know. The thing is that I don't know. My proof doesn't really relies on the strict curvature bound. But yeah, I would need to try that maybe with some other information. But in order to get rigidity, then I don't know for non-negative curvature. Possibly one could get it still in the L2. Still in the L2 Baselstrain space? I honestly don't know, even on manifolds. Okay, thank you. Okay. Okay, so if there are no more questions, so let's thank Jaime again.
