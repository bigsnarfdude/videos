Thank you, Pong. Good morning to everybody. First, I would like to thank the organizer for inviting me to give a talk in this workshop. My talk is based on a joint work with Fabrizio Mealdi from University of Florence and Paul Deend from UC Berkeley. In this work, we propose to use the principal certification framework within the potential outcome projects alignment. Potential outcome process to causal inference to assess causal effects on survival outcomes in the presence of treatment switching. That is for subjects enrolled in clinical trials where some patients are allowed to switch from the control arm to the treatment arm. Generally, treatment switching is an intercurian event. That is, it occurs. That is, it occurs after treatment assignment and thus it may break randomization. It commonly occurs in clinical trials designed to assess the effect of the treatment on the incidence of a disease, and complications arise because switching is often a prognostic-related choice. For instance, for some patients, a sudden worsening of the disease may The disease may force physicians to allow the switch. Recently, the analysis of clinical trials with intercurrence events like treatment switching has attracted the attention of the medicine agencies also thanks to the publication of the ICH addendum, which provides guideline on estimate and sensitivity analysis in clinical Sensitivity analysis in clinical trials with intercurrent events. In principle, there might be various types of switching possibilities, but here we focus on clinical trials with one-sided switching behaviors. That is, clinical trials where treated patients don't switch to the control harm, but control patients are allowed to. Patients are allowed to switch to the treatment harm if their physical condition gets worse than certain tolerant levels. In particular, our research was motivated by the Concorde clinical trial, a randomized control experiment aimed to assess causal effects of immediate versus deferred treatment with Zadubidine on time to disease. On time to disease progression of death for patients with asymptomatic HIV infection. According to the trial protocol, patients in the control arm should not start taking xadiludine before they progress to AIDS-related complex or AIDS. However, physicians However, physicians are judged unethical to keep patients to stay in the control group if their physical condition worsens considerably. And thus, some patients in the deferring arm were allowed to switch to the active treatment starting inside the vidin before the onset of symptoms of HIV or HIV. Of HIV or AIDS on the basis of persistently low CD4 cell counts or other evidence of disease progression. Unfortunately, we don't have access to the real data set due to privacy constraints, but we have a synthetic data set which closely mimics the concurrent trial. Even if the synthetic data set does not include Data set does not include any pretreatment variable. The synthetic data set comprises 1000 patients. ALF patients are randomly assigned to immediate Zaiduvidine and ALF patients are randomly assigned to deferred Zaiduvidin. After randomization for treated patients, we observe the Observe the survival time, their survival time under treatment, which might be censored as shown in this figure. For controlled passions, we may observe different data. Specifically, for controlled patients who died during the follow-up period, we observe they We observe the survival time under control. For controlled patients who switch to the active treatment during the follow-up, we observe the switching time under control and the residual survival time after switching, which again might be censored for some of them. For controlled patients who neither switch nor die during the past, Which do not die during the follow-up period, we observe the censoring time under control. More formally, let's denote the treatment actually assigned, with Z equal to one for immediate Zubutin and equal to zero for the fair Zubidin. Moreover, let YOPS and SOPS denote the survival. Denotes the survival time and the switching time that will be observed under the actual treatment assignment without censoring. In practice, both the survival time and the switching time are subject to censoring. The concord trial lasts three years with stature entry over the first one year and half. And half, and thus the censoring time range from one year and half and three years. For each passion, we then turn the sensory time, that is the minimum between the survival time and the sensory time under the treatment at a site. Now, in the presence of one The presence of one-sided switch in behavior, treated passions don't switch to the control R. And thus, the switching time for the treated function is undefined. And we set it equal to S-bar, which is a non-real value. For control bash. For control passion, we observe the censored switching time, which may be censored for two reasons. It might be censored just because the switching time is longer than the censoring time, or because the passions do not switch to the So the treatment are no matter how long the follow-up is. And thus, for this type of patients, the switching time is again undefined and equal to S-bar. In the presence of treatment switching, Switching and intention-to-treat analysis is usually conducted. The intention to treat analysis essentially compares groups for by randomization irrespective of the treatment after received and thus entirely ignoring information on the switching of behavior under control. In studies where the outcome of primary interest is a survival outcome, a simple estimate of the intention to trio effect can be obtained by comparing the Kaplan-Meyer estimates of the survival curve by a treatment assignment. And for the synthetic data, we have. For the synthetic data we have, we find that assignment to immediate treatment with the ugadine increases survival time, even if the differences between the two cures is really small, it's quite small. Now, an intentional data analysis provides valid estimates. Valid estimates of the effect of the assignment, but it does not provide information on the effect of the treatment. And if focus is on assessing causal fact of the treatment, we cannot ignore the information on the switching behavior. However, we cannot adjust for the switching behavior. Of behavior by simply conditioning on its observed value because this reaching behavior is a post-treatment variable which may be affected by treatment assignment. In the literature, various approaches to deal with the problem of treatment switching have been proposed. Most of these approaches Is approaches approaches focus on evaluating causal effect for the whole population, aiming at reconstructing for each unit the outcome that unit would have had if that unit had not switched. And the ICH addendum refers to this type of analysis as Of analysis as an analysis that uses an hypothetical strategy. Some author proposed to view clinical trials with treatments reaching as longitudinal causal studies with a time-varying treatment and propose to conduct inference under sequential injurability assumptions. Sequential injurability assumption, which, however, for clinical trial or treatment, switching may be untenable given that the switching behavior is a post-treatment variable, as I said before. Here we propose to redefine the problem of treatment switching using a principle stratification. principle of stratification, which is also recognized in the ICH addendum as a strategy to deal with intercurate events. In this framework, causal estimate of interest are principal causal effects, that is, causal effects for latent subpopulation of units, the principal strata, defined by the switching behavior and The switching behavior under the control treatment in case of one-sided switching behavior. Because principal strata comprise subjects who have regimes with respect to their switching theater, a principal certification analysis allows us to characterize, investigate. Rise, investigate treatment-effective heterogeneity with respect to the switching time without assuming the durability of the switching time. The key insight underlying our approach is that treatment switching can be viewed as a general form of non-compliance. And from this perspective, non-switchers, that is, the sub-population of Russians who Of Gaussians who will not switch from the control army to the treatment arm if assigned to control are a specific type of compliance because they are exposed to treatment and control according to the protocol. And thus, this population of units may provide information on the causal effect of treatment. Of treatment. Clearly, the presence of treatments which complicates inference, and we propose to deal with inferential issues using Bayesian approach, which allow us to properly take into account that switching happens in continuous time, generating a continual principle strata. Switching time is not defined for a unit who never switches in a particular experiment. In a particular experiment, and both survival time, the primary outcome of interest, and switching time are subject to such rigor. In order to formalize this concept, I first introduce some notation mainly in the context of our motivating study. We define causal effects using a potential outcome under the stable unit. Outcome under the stable unit treatment assumption. So for each patient, we postulate that there exists two potential outcomes for the survival time, which are the value of the survival time under assigned to treatment and under assigned to control. The survival time might be right sensory and And because our study starts and ends a specific catender time, the sensoring time essentially depends on the unit entry, which is staggered over time. Therefore, the sensoring time under a given treatment assignment represents the duration of TDL end till the end of the study under that treatment assignment. Here it is reasonable to assume that the censoring time is not affected by the treatment and thus we can avoid to work with. Avoid to work with potential outcome for a sensor time. In our study, the treatment switching is present. The switching status, as I said, the post-treatment variable, and thus we need to introduce potential outcome for this variable. Now, Now, in the presence of one-sided switching behavior, again, treated patients cannot switch to the control arm. And thus, the switching time under treatment is undefined. And we set it equal to the S-bar. Control partial. Controlled patients may or may not switch to the active treatment. Patients who will never switch from the control arm to the treatment arm, if assigned to control, are here. Are here referred to as never switches and never switches or no switches, and for them the switching time under control is equal to S-bar. Subject who would switch to the treatment arm if assigned to control at a given point in time. Time are named switchers, and for them, the switching time under control is a well-defined real value, and clearly, their switching time might be censored. It was another constraint also, in the sense that the switching time under control should be. Should be shorter than the survival time under control. That is, the patients can switch to the treatment arm only before their survival time under control. Technically, the switching time is censored by that with sensory event the Uh survival time under control, the main endpoint under control. So the switching, the potential outcomes for the switching time under control completely define the switching in the presence of one-sided one-sided treatment switch. And this variable is a semi-continuous variable with a binary component that classifies units into no switches and switches and a continuous component that classifies switchers according to the switching time. And this group of units are our basic principles. Our basic principle strata. Clearly, we could also consider coercion strata. For instance, we consider the set of all switches. Causal effects within principal strata are called principal causal effects. And here we focus on average and distributional principle. And distributional principal causal effects. Now, for no switches or never switches, principal causal effects can be interpreted as the effect of the treatment. Because for no switches, treatment received coincides with treatment aside. For switchers, we We focus on conditional distribution of causal fact given a survival time under treatment longer than the switching time. This challenge is due to the fact that for switches, unconditional distribution of principal causal effects are negative or at most zero. Or at most zero for survival time shorter than the switching time due to the natural constraint I introduced before. However, if we are willing to assume monotonicity of the survival time with respect to treatment assigned conditional and unconditional distribution of causal effects coincide. Unfortunately, we don't serve generally the principle of streetum which a unit belongs to for different reasons under treatment and under control. In the treatment arm, no switching is observed and the switching status under control is missed. Under control is missing. Therefore, treated patients may be both no-switcher or switchers at some point in time. And thus, the treatment group consists of an infinite mixture of principal straita. For some patients in the control group, we observe the switching status. Switching status. In particular, control persons who die under control without switching are clearly not switchers due to the natural constraint I said before. Control persons who switch to the Switch to the active treatment before the end of the study are switchers with an observed switching time. For some of them, we also observe the survival time. For others, the survival time will be censored. Then we have a group of control passions another. Patients who neither switch to the active treatment nor died during the follow-up period. And again, this group of patients may comprise both no switchers and switchers at some point in time longer, greater than the sensory time. And again, this group comprises an infinite mixture of print. Infinite mixture of principles data. Inference on the principle causal effect is here particularly complicated. We propose a framework which rely on the assumption that the treatment of style methods. Treatment style metal is ignorable, an assumption that holds by the incompletely randomized experiment as our motivating study. And we also assume inurability of the sensor mechanism, implying that the sensoring time is independent of potential outcome and if as the potential And if edible coveries. Under this assumption, we propose to draw inference on principle causal effect using a flexible parametric Bayesian approach, which principle does not require full identification, even if partially identifying parameter. Identifying parameter may be weakly identified in the sense that the posterior distribution may have substantial region of flatness. An appealing advantage of the Bayesian approach is that it allows us to deal with all computation we have, that means in data, functional dense and sensory, simultaneously in a natural way. In a natural way, and he inferences here directly interpretable in probabilistic terms. So, under exchangeability, randomization, durability, and sensory, Bayesian principle stratification, conditional on the empirical distribution of the covariates, require to specify two sets of models. A model for the principle. A model for the principal strato for the switching principal stratum membership, this is for the switching status, and a model for the joint distribution of the potential survival outcome that here we factorize into the distribution of the survival time under control, given the switching, the switching status and covariates, and the survival time under control. And the survival time under treatment, given the survival time under control, the switching status and covariance. We propose a two-part model for the switching behavior, specifying a logistic regression model for the probability of being switchers and a viable model for the time to switching. For the time to switching for switches, we use vibel and location shift bible distribution for the survival time given the switch status and cover it. Now, it's worth adding that the location shift parameterization for the survival time under control reflect. Control reflects the natural constraint that requires that white zero is greater than or equal to S0, this reaching time. The specialization of the model for Y1, for the survival time under treatment, requires some discussion. Some discussion. First, the location shift parametrization describe through the kappa parameter the dependence between this two survival group two potential survival outcome given the switching status echo variance. Now because Now, because we cannot observe both potential survival times for any units, the data provide no lead information on this parameter. And thus, we propose to treat the Treat that parameter as a sensitivity parameter by varying it between zero and one, where zero represents a scenario where the two potential survival time are conditionally different and cap pi equal to one represents a scenario where the monotonistic assumption of the survival time with respect to the Arrival time with respect to the titan force. The model of Y1 for switchers depends on the switching time through the parameter lambda one. So lambda one describes the condition. Lambda 1 describes the conditional association between the survival time under treatment and the switching time given white zero, the survival time under control. Again, because the switching status is never observed for treated units, the observed data provide no information on this parameter. And we propose to deal with this. And we propose to deal with these identificability issues, imposing prior equality of the parameter lambda one and lambda zero, so that we have only one parameter lambda that describes the association between the survival time under control and the switching switching time for switchers. Time for switchers and the survival time under treatment and the switching time for switching for switchers. And because we f0 and y0 are jointly observed for some controlled portions, we have some information on this parameter. However, given the The characteristic of these two parameters, which are not non-parametrical identifiables, we conduct various sensitivity check in the data analysis. Specifically, we conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to the prior specification for lambda and we investigate the sensitivity of the causal. Of the causal conclusion with respect to kappa by looking at how the posterior distribution of the causal parameter change by value kappa between zero and one. Bison inference is conducting under the assumption that parameters are a priori independent and using proper but weakly informative prior distribution except for lambda. Except for lambda kappa. For lambda, we use more and less informative, sorry, more and less informative normal prior distribution and an improper uniform prior distribution. Kappa is fixed at a predetermined value between zero and one. The posterior distribution. The posterior distribution of the causal estimal interests are derived using an MCMC algorithm with a data argumentation step to impute at each iteration the missing switch and status for each unit. And in case kappa is greater than zero, our algorithm also involves a data dogation step to impute the The survival time under control for the treated limits. So we apply this framework to analyze the synthetic concord clinical data, where remember, no information covariate is able. Here, I mainly focus on results derived under the assumption that capital. Under the assumption that kappa is equal to zero, that is that the two potential survival time are conditionally independent given the switching status. For no switchers, we find evidence that receiving ZButin immediately versus subsequently after the onset of IHBC. So, HIFB symptoms increases survival time. The posterior medium of the average causal effect for no switchers is positive and the 95% posterior credible interval only covers positive value. Distributional causal effects for no switchers. For no switchers are always positive with relative narrow confidence, sorry, credible interval, which includes only positive value for survival time greater than 0.35, that is about four months, at least up to two years and up. Years and alpha. Then the posterior predominant interval become white. Remember that these results for non-switches for which treatment received coincide with treatment sign can be interpreted as causal effect of the treatment. Of the treatment of receiving XID within immediately versus subsequently. The interpretation of the results for switchers is more complicated. Switchers are patients who will start taking Zadimudin before the fair time definitely. Every time defined by the protocol. And thus, for them, principal causal effects are essential intention to treat effects. We find that average causal effect for switchers are small and statistical measureable irrespective of the switching time. And this result can be interpreted as evidence that force. Evidence that for switchers, starting Zadibudin before the onset of HIV syndrome is beneficial. In the sense that for them, the survival time that would have happened under initial time to immediate the dividing is approximately. Within is approximately the same as the survival time under initial assumption, the further treatment of economic. Conditional distribution of causal effect are always positive and show a trend increase. Even if they appear to be highly heterogeneous, we Highly heterogeneous with respect to the switching time. In general, the later the switching time, the smaller the effects are. The results is reasonable from a scientific perspective. If passions switch later because Switch later because their C D for cell count remains sufficiently higher for a longer time period, then it is reasonable to assume that early switches comprise weaker passions for which spending even a short time spell under the control arm might be very harmful. Might be very harmful. And thus, under this mechanism, distributional causal effect for Harley switcher will be greater than for Reuters switcher. Moreover, it also worked not that distribution conditional distribution of causal effect for switches who For switches who switch at the time gridded them to here are statistically negligible. Again, the results can be interpreted as evidence that for switchers, switching is beneficial in the sense I explained before. Their potential survival. Their potential survival time under initial assignment to treatment and under initial assignment to drug are approximately the same. These results appear to be robust with respect to prior specification for lambda, but show some sensitivity with respect to the assumption on the association. Assumption on the association between the two, the conditional association between the two potential survival time described by the parameter kappa. We also investigate the influence of our parametric assumption using posterior predictive value, which show no evidence against the model. So, the main limit of our application study is that it does not contain any information on covariance. And covariance may be valuable for various reasons. First, condition on First, conditioning on covariates usually makes structural and parametric assumptions more credible. And covariates may help inference leading to more precise results, more precise inference. Moreover, in principle stratification analysis, relevant information could be obtained looking at the distribution of the covert within each. Of the covera within each principal stream. And the ability to characterize Latin group of passions with respect to their background characteristics may provide useful insight on which group of patients the treatment is more effective and that. And thus may help explain the heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to the switching status. Moreover, this information may help physicians to recommend the patients with treatment she said. In this work, we focus on the analysis of clinical trials with one-sided switching behavior under the assumption that the sensory mechanism is ignorable. This framework can be easily adapted for the analysis of more general trials with the C. Clinical trial with a similar structure, such as clinical trial weight treatment discontinuation, where patients under treatment are allowed to stop taking the active treatment due, for example, to adverse events. Alessandro, you have two minutes. Fine, just two words. Thanks. And we We believe that a valuable topic for future research is to extend our framework to deal with the problem of treatment switching in the presence of a non-ignorable sensoring mechanism, which may arise when sensoring is due to other events like Other events like loss at follow-up or dropout. Thank you for.
