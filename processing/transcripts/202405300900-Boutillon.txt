Yes, so I hope you can hear me and see my screen. So, today I would like to talk to you about the Fisher-Kipp equation for a population structured in space and in phenotype. And the starting point of my talk point of my talk would be the Fischer-KPP equation, which I will see from a population dynamics point of view. So here I imagine that u of tx is a density of individuals at time t and position x. And these individuals will move according to some broaden and they will reproduce, die and compete with each other. So this is the Fischer-KPP equation and as you can see here the reaction term R of X depends on the spatial position X. This means that the environment is heterogeneous and I will furthermore assume that it is periodic. So for example, if I start from a compactly supported initial condition and if I wait a bit, I will see some periodic profile appear. Profile appear, and there will be places where I will have lots of people, so places that are more favorable, so where R is large, and places where there will be fewer people, which are places where the environment is not favourable. This is the starting point, and to the Fischer-TPP equation, I will add a new variable, theta. A new variable theta. So instead of having u of tx, I will have u depending on tx and theta. So the individuals will have, will be characterized by the position and by some variable theta, which I will call the phenotype. So theta is a continuous phenotype, belongs to RP, and so it can be very large. And now the equation changes. I add a mutation term for, which is a Laplacian in the direction theta. And the demographic changes a bit. Now the fitness, so the reaction term depends on the position and also on the phenotype, which means that you might imagine that some places of the You might imagine that some places of the environment will be more adapted to some phenotypes, and other places will be more adapted to other phenotypes. And so, if you want to survive, you will have to evolve to be adapted to be not too inadapted to some places where you're at. And also, there is the competition term, which is here minus rho, and rho is the total population. And rho is the total population at time t in position x. So, from a modeling point of view, this means that if you're at some position, you will be in competition with all the people that are at the same place as you, regardless of their phenotypes. And from a mathematical point of view, it makes the equation non-local. You lose the maximum principle. The maximum principle. So it's a bit harder to study than the usual local fish occupied equation. This kind of equation appeared for the first time in the works of Prévaux and Champagne and Méliart. And they had a slightly different mutation term. Instead of having a Laplacian, they had some convolution kernel. This means from the point of view of modeling that they had rare and large mutations. So they had in one unit of time, they had a few generations. And in our case, we have Laplacian, so the mutation go like a bone in motion. So this means that we have lots of very small mutations. Very small mutations, so which means that in one unit of time we have lots of generations, so we are looking at large time scales. And now the goal of my talk and of our work with Luca is to study the persistence of the population. So, does the population survive or does it get extinct? By survival, I mean By survival, I mean how does the supremum of war evolve? Does it go to zero or does it have a lower bound? And the main tool that I will use is the principal eigenvalue of the linear operator. Okay, so before going to the Before going to the part of the principal eigenvalue, I will show you a precise setting to perhaps understand a few questions. I will imagine that U is a population of pathogens living on a landscape of fields Ci. So here I have a one-dimensional landscape with fields C1, C2, C3, and it's periodic. So C1, C2, C3 again. C1, C2, C3 again, etc. And on each field, you will have an optimal phenotype OI, which means that, for example, if you were on the field C1, your phenotype, so the phenotype of the pathogen should better be close to the optimal phenotype O1. And if you are on FIDC2, your phenotype should be close to the optimal phenotype O2. Type of two. So, this is the Fischer geometric model, which tells you that there is an optimal phenotype, and as you get further from this optimal phenotype, then your fitness decreases. This is what is told here. So, R of X theta depends on which field X is, and it depends decreasingly on the distance. From the optimal phenotype corresponding to X. And Chi tells you how to decrease. So you want to kill the pathogen and we will ask a few questions. What should we understand? How should we understand the problem? The idea is that the closer the optimal, the more homogeneous your understanding. The more homogeneous your environment is, and so the more favorable the environment should be. So, persistence should be easier when the optima are closer one to another. So, a third question that one might ask is: What are the configurations that maximize the ability of persistence? And we will see that those configurations. And we will see that those configurations are precisely the one where all the OI coincide. The second question is how to minimize the ability of persistence. And in fact, we will see that there is no minimizer because when the OI will go to infinity, you can still decrease your ability of persistence. And a last question is to compare to configurations. So if you have configurations. So if you have O1OK and O1 hat OK such that O1 hat is closer to all the other optima, is it true that persistence is easier for the configuration with O1 hat than for the configuration with O1? We should expect it to be true, but it is not obvious and we cannot give a full answer to this question. Okay, so now I will talk about the connection between the persistence and the principal eigenvalue. And first, I will work in a bounded phenotype space. So this will be more convenient to talk about a principal eigenvalue. So I assume that the phenotype theta belongs to some set which is bounded and smooth. And I add an Neumann boundary condition on the boundary on this set. On the boundary on this set. And in this setting, since the environment is periodic in one direction and the phenotype space is bounded, I can apply the Kron-Bootman theorem to tell that there is a periodic principal eigenfunction phi and a principal eigenvalue lambda. So this means that there is a lambda and a positive. A lambda and a positive phi satisfying this equation, delta plus r applied to phi is equal to lambda phi. And the delta plus r here is the linear operator corresponding to the equation. Why are we interested in phi and lambda? That's because, in fact, if I rewrite the equation close to extinction, so where the Distinction. So, where the sweep of row is small, I get precisely this. So, it's the same equation, it's like the Fischer-Kippipe equation, but we forgot, we removed the competition term. So, since I am close to extinction, the competition solution should be small, so I can consider only the linear part of the equation. And now that I have this approximation, I can approximation i can imagine that i start from uh the from the principal eigenvalue from a multiple of the principal eigenvalue and then i can solve explicitly the equation so dt is equal approximately to lambda u and so u of t is equal to e to the lambda t times the initial condition so this tells you that when lambda is negative you have extinction of your population and when lambda is Your population, and when lambda is positive, you have persistence of your population. So, obviously, it's not true. You we've made several approximations. So, first, we've assumed that we've only been working with super small, but when supro is large, you can say that U is large at least at some point, and thanks to parabolic HANA inequality. Thanks to parabolic Ranach inequality, it will be large in a neighborhood, and so you'll be able to make a uniform lower bound on U and prove persistence. Also, a second approximation that we made is that we started from a multiple of the principal eigenfunction, but by comparing with large multiples of the principal eigenfunction or with a small multiple of or with a small multiple of an approximation of the principal eigenfunction, we are able to conclude for a general compactly supported U0. Okay, so this was for the bounded phenotype space. And now we would like, in fact, to work in a case where theta belongs to Rp. So it's unbounded. And now we cannot apply the Quan-Ruchmann theorem to get existence and uniqueness of Existence and uniqueness of phi and lambda. So we will have to use other tools. And in fact, there is already an available tool, which is the generalized principal eigenvalue. In fact, you let lambda be the infimum of all the lambda primes such that there is a phi, a positive phi, which is almost a principal. Almost a principal eigenfunction corresponding to lambda prime. And with this definition of lambda, you get a real number and there is a principal eigenfunction associated to it. There is a phi positive which satisfies the eigenfunction relation. So you're happy with it, but of course you lose some nice properties since you're in an unbounded domain. In an unbounded domain, you will lose some nice properties of the bonded domain. So, for example, you might have several independent eigenfunctions phi, positive phi that satisfy the relation. Also, for all lambda prime at least equal to lambda, there is a principal eigenfunction corresponding to this lambda prime. So, you need to be careful by be careful by considering indeed the infimum of all the lambda prime in your tool and the most annoying part is the following is that phi might go to plus infinity as pheta goes to plus infinity so it's a bit more complicated for example to prove the global extension when lambda is negative but But it might happen. So now, in the following, I will avoid this case to happen. Okay, so let me move on to the last part. It is about the optimization of the ability of persistence. So I remember our model. So we have Our model. So, we have a population of pathogen living on a landscape of fields, and on each field, there is an optimal phenotype. The fitness of the pathogen decreases as its phenotype gets further from the optimal phenotype. And you want to kill the pathogen, and this is why you would like to optimize lambda to minimize it or maximize it. So, if you minimize it, you will kill it, and if you maximize it, you will favor it. You have your lambda, which is the generalized principal eigenvalue. There is a principal eigenfunction associated to lambda. And the problem is that phi might go to plus infinity as theta goes to plus infinity. And this you want to avoid. So, there is a theorem which. The theorem, which was proved by Berystecki and Rossi in 2015. So, this is only a version of the result. So, first, we note that lambda is at least equal to the infimum of chi. So, why it is so? It is because lambda is a pinter eigenvalue corresponding to delta plus r, and r is always at least equal to the uniform of chi. So, you have lambda which is equal to the length of the lambda You have lambda, which is equator that at least equal to the infinite of k. But it turns out that if you have a strict inequality, then phi decays exponentially at plus infinity. So, for example, if chi is constant, then lambda is equal to this constant, and so you don't have a stokes inequality, and if chi is constant, then five. If chi is constant, then phi will be constant too, and so it doesn't decay to infinity. So this is a counter-example to this result. But if you have a strict inequality, you're happy. But this criterion for strict inequality is a bit implicit. And so we found a few sufficient conditions to ensure that you have a strict inequality. So first of all, Inequality. So, first of all, if the infimum of k is minus infinity, there is nothing to do. If θ belongs to a one-dimensional or a two-dimensional space, then you can show that you have a structure inequality using the fact that chi is structurally decreasing, and this will be a UV type result. And finally, the last point tells you that if Last point tells you that if chi of r is much larger than the infimum of chi when r is small, then you satisfy the Stokes inequality. So the results I will show you after are only valid with the assumption that phi decays has a phytagotoclix infinity. And we have And we have a few conditions to imagine when and how it should occur. So, I recall the questions that I have asked before. First, is there a configuration that maximizes or minimizes the ability of persistence? And are there if we have two configurations such that we can compare the distances between the optima, can we compare the two configurations? Can we compare the two configurations? So we have our main tool is the following result. So if I have a curve gamma, which is C1 and which such that its derivative does not vanish, and such that this property arises. So the distance from gamma s to From gamma s to each of the optima is strictly decreasing, then the associated principal eigenvalue, so the eigenvalue replacing O1 gamma of S is increasing. So this means that if O1 gets continuously closer to each of the other OIs, then you make persistence easier. Here. So let me show you, explain this result in an example. So here you have two configurations, one on the left and one on the right, with five optima each. And here they are a bit different because there is a blue cross and a green cross on the left and on the right. And for example, the blue cross on the left. The blue cross on the left, you can bring it continuously closer to each of the four black crosses and you fall on the green cross. This means that you are able to compare these two configurations. The configuration on the right is easier for the pathogen than the configuration on the left. So here On the left. So here each cross corresponds to the maximum of the field, the optimal phenotype on a field. So here we are able to compare. On the other hand, if the green cross is in the middle of the black crosses, then you will get stuck. So if you try to bring continuously the blue cross to the green cross, then you will get stuck. Then you will get stuck because here, once you're here, and if you want to get closer to the green cross, you will have to get further from the black cross at the bottom. So you cannot respect the conditions of the field. So this result allows one to compare two configurations in some cases, but still it is a bit restrictive. Of course, here A bit restrictive. Of course, here we would like to say that the configuration on the right is easier for the pathogen than configuration on the left, but we are unable to say it. So with this result at hand, we can answer to the first two questions. The first question is there a configuration that maximizes the ability of persistence? Yes, because you can bring Yes, because you can bring one by one each optimum to a single point. So the ability of persistence is maximum when all the points coincide, so when the environment is completely homogeneous. Second, is there a configuration that minimizes the ability of persistence? Yes, too. No, sorry, no. Because Because if you have a configuration, you will be able to apply this theorem the other way around. So you will take a point and you will be able to bring it further from each of the other optima and then make the persistence harder for the Python view. And finally, the third question: are we able to compare two configurations such that we can compare the Such that we can compare the distances between the optima. Then, if we have two or three optima, we can conclude. But in general, for more than for four optima or more, we are unable to conclude. For example, here we have five optima and we cannot conclude. Okay, so these were our main results, but a few But a few questions remain open. So what happens if the principal eigenvalue is equal to zero? We should expect to have extinction as in the local case, but we don't know. We can also ask questions about the spreading properties of the equation. So are there stationary states, pulsating traveling waves? Do we have convergence to a pulsating traveling waves? And is the population persist? Is there a spreading speed? Is there a spreading speed? So, in the case of a bounded domain, I could show that, yes, there is a spreading speed, and it depends on the linear operator only. And we have a Friedling-Gattner formula for this kind of equation. And there are also other questions about the model. So, could we give a full answer to the question of comparing two? To the question of comparing two configurations and other two interesting questions from the modeling point of view: what is the effect of adding a new field? So on the one hand, we add heterogeneity. On the other hand, the new field that we add could help as a step to mutate between two very different fields. And finally, what is the effect of the shapes of the field Ci? So here Field CI. So here we've only been able to play with the period of the environment. So as the period goes to zero or to infinity, we can give somewhat explicit formula for lambda. So thank you for your attention. Okay, yes, thanks to the speaker. Any questions or comments? Yeah, please. The non-local equations similar to this one may have stable periodic solutions. So possibly also expect that one of your questions, whether the solution converges to an equilibrium or a single question. Yes, maybe this can be replaced by convergence to a periodic solution in some situations. Yes, we expect that we converge to a stationary solution. Do you expect that it does converge to a steady state rather than a periodic solution? Sorry. So the question. So the question, so you are saying that you expect that you have convergence to a steady stream. So why does not it converge to a periodic solution, for example? What's the intuition why it shouldn't converge to periodic solution? Why do you expect that the solution converges? Expect that the solution converges to some steady state instead of periodic solutions. Yes, so it will be periodic in space, but it will be steady in time. So I don't understand. So is it possible for the periodic solution to appear in the time periodic time periodic period? So in the home-guarded interstate. Oh my god, you decided. Anyway, let's pass the question. So I saw maybe some questions from online. So anyone want to ask? Any questions from online audience? It's Luca here. So Luca here. So, so, in fact, we don't know if maybe if it converges to a steady state. We conjecture, but it's not even a conjecture. So we expect, but we don't know. It could be a periodic in time indeed. So for us, persistence means just away from being away from zero, like positive infimum, but we don't. But we don't know if it's a steady state or a periodic solution or something else. We don't know. Thank you. Okay, I think because of time, so let's thank Dr. Poti again.
