I think is the title, and the usual stuff. Now, a quote here from Tukey, which not a lot of people seem to notice, but he says, stationary and Gaussian is what he defines as over-utopian. Not utopian, over-utopian. And I've got class notes of. And I've got class notes of his, you know, printed ones that he made up, which have that in it. So it's clear. The other one is on the bottom of the first page here. It's a warning. It says, do not hold your breath when you look for an example of a stationary process or a stationary time series. That's not to say there aren't any. That's not to say there aren't any, but they're mighty rare. So let's see now if I can get down to the next page. I think that's yeah. So this is a little bit of history and background. Then going down, I'm going to talk about spectrogram and the web spectrogram. Web spectrogram. A web spectrum is pretty well known. That's if you use a multi-taper spectrogram, that works well. But you do have to kind of tune it to the application. It's something you can't use blindly. And then the ROEV spectrum, which I think is most of it, a little bit about background. Background and so on, some examples and kind of reducing, taming it a bit. So let's see, hit the right key. Okay, well, this one you've seen more or less before. Non-stationary process here at the top. You know, time one direction, frequency the other. Frequency, the other. And it would be very boring if it's stationary. So the usual spectral representation. Then the Voev spectrum here is the expected value of dx of F1, DX conjugate of F2. It works better if you rotate. Works better if you rotate coordinates and get the end by 45 or minus 45 degrees, really. And you can also get other forms of it. It's got, of course, a correlation, which doesn't seem to be terribly useful. At least I've never seen one that's too useful. Where's the right button? Okay, so this is a spectrogram. This is some of Frank's DY data. It was discovered nominally in 1946, which probably meant it was discovered a year or a few years earlier and classified. And it works nicely with tuning. It works nicely with tuning. This is a seismic, just one element, and just the north element of the PY array 2014 data. And it's 10 days here. The data blocks are 144,000 samples each. That's an hour of data. That's an hour of data, and I did the calculations right. And it's 10 days of data across here. And you can certainly see the kind of wave spectrum and down at low frequencies. Yeah, there's a lot of things changing. And then the little red lines under. Little red lines under it mark high tides. This is at Pinion Flash, and these are out at the coast. So I better not spend too much time. So that works really nicely for a lot of things. Okay, then spectrogram, well, it's simple. You know, it needs some tuning. Occasionally, it's too simple, maybe frequently, for scientific work. Well, time frequency. There are also forms like instead of just XY conjugate, it's XY without the conjugate that occurs in oceanography. And so let's see. Yeah, so you have to watch what you're doing, but multi-taper spectrograms actually work pretty well. So for a lot of things. Now, all I have to do is hit the right key here. No. I see what I've done. I'm over. I'm over okay. Well, web spectrum. Well, it's derived from in quotes first principles. But there's an awful lot of expected values in the derivation. And if you stop and think about it, when you're talking about non-stationary processes, what exactly does an expected value mean? An expected value mean? You know, we nothing much on Earth is stationary, but a lot of the periods that we're talking about are rather long. You know, if you look at, say, precession, yeah, it'll come back to where it is again in 10,000 years or 20,000 years, more like 20. And then you throw in obliquity, and that's a 40,000-year period. 40,000-year period. So, a lot of these things, you know, it's not entirely clear in practice what an expected value of a non-stationary process means. So let's assume someone else has solved that problem. Worst, how do you compute it? It was originally published just after World War II. World War II and actually some of it just at the start of World War II when someone said he'd been locked up during the war and it only came out later. But then it wasn't really used. The only people I knew that used it were in the Navy and they were using it on propeller agents so they could, you know, And so they could, you know, kind of periodic with one rotation of the propeller. So they could mark that and kind of do an ensemble average that way. But let's see, we've got two frequencies, so it's not quite as intuitive as the ordinary spectrum. And you've got various forms of it, time time, time frequency. Freak time time, time frequency, frequency time or frequency frequency, and works better, I could say, if you rotate by 45 degrees. And the problem was earlier where you're dealing with a non-stationary process, if you did, say, ensemble averaging, except for a few really well-controlled cases, how did you find? How did you find an approximation to an expected value? So that's a problem. So I think the next one is, no, well, this is the usual spectrum of the spectral representation of the basic convolution with sine x over x is Stupian sequences. And we'll have to go back here again. Back here again. And of course, in fact, it's almost simpler. You can take now the eigencofficients and average yk, yk conjugate or just yk of f1 and yk of f2, which occurs in a lot of oceanography. If a wave or a wake sheds one side, you get one of them and it goes to the other side. Of them goes to the other side, you get the other. So, there are lots of real examples. So, the other thing is to look at coherence between F1 and F2, and which is not ideal. I'm not sure what is the ideal one, but that seems to work reasonably well. So, here's a couple of examples of a spectrogram. Examples of a spectrogram. This is some of Rudy Shield's data. It's a quasi-stellar object, Q0957, which is normally described as a black hole having lunch. Fortunately, it's not a close neighbor. It's a long way away. Long way away. Backley envelope, almost literally, I think it was a paper napkin at lunch at Bell Labs, said this thing is radiating roughly a solar mass per day. So you don't want it as a neighbor. This is, and there are two images. It's gravitationally lensed. The nice thing about it is it's bright. It's about, well, relatively bright. It's 17th or magnitude, give or take, 16th and 17th. And there are two images of it that are bent around the galaxy. And so you've got something like 16 and a half magnitude QSO. QSO and the galaxy, if I remember correctly, is about 22nd magnitude. So the galaxy is a lot closer and a lot fainter. So this thing you don't want for a near neighbor. And this is the spectrum of the A image. The B one looks pretty similar. And this is cross spectrum between A and B. And of course, the spectrum is along the diagonal. The spectrum is along the diagonal, which in just one image is one. But then there are these other pieces which are approximately a cycle per day or per year apart, but it's slightly curved. And that seems to, now, don't take this too seriously. The data is 80% missing. Obviously, the data is 80% missing. So there's an awful lot of interpolation to make any sense of it. But it does tell you things, and you can see some offsets here in the cross-spectrum. Okay, so the way of some kind of fixes. Some kind of fixes to rotate the spectra by minus 45 degrees, and so you've got frequency and differential frequency as variables. And replace the spectrum at F1 and F2 with the MSC at F and delta F. The reason for that is the MSC, of course, is between zero and one. Between zero and one. And so you can, it's a lot easier to plot than something you have to use a log scale. Or if you use the real cross spectrum, of course, it's complex valued, which is even more complication. So go back over here. So this is a data from Marseille in France from just ordinary. From just ordinary daily temperature. So you can see the annual cycle and the fit with three sinusoids. And then you can take it and average over 365 and a quarter day and get a reasonable approximation and look at the daily variance, which should be here. And first thing that you see is it's non-stationary. Is it's non-stationary? Well, of course, everyone knows its climate's non-stationary or at least cyclostationary. And so it's basically low variance in the summer, high variance in the winter, and doing different things in between. Let me see if I can hit the right button. Now, if we do a Now, if we do a spectrogram on that one, this is, and this is one of the problems with the low spectrum, is it's a pain in the neck to plot because it takes, we've got a lot of pixels here. If you put many more pixels, A, you have problems, and B, I won't be able to see what I'm plotting because the scale will get so fine. The scale will get so fine, so you have to magnify it some ways. But not very much exciting on this one. But I was interested in some of the comments on solar rotation that I've seen. And so this is taking horizontal sums. I should go back. I should go back a page. So I'm going to take and pick an offset frequency going up. I should show it this way. So from zero, we'll offset and or down depending. And it's not symmetric. And then average going across ordinary frequency. So offset and Offset and so at this is minus one cycle per solar rotation, zero, which has been suppressed because everything's coherent with itself. And then at a plus one equal for solar rotation, so that's 400 and some nanohertz. And some nanohertz. You see, you get fairly high peaks, and we'll clean this up a little. And then if you go back and look exactly at the one cycle per solar rotation frequency, you get, so we're down here about 20 to 40, so halfway down, you get MSC of MSC of above 70% here, a couple of sidebands, which I don't understand, probably just solar modes. And so this is a fixed offset of 20, you know, cycle per 27 days. And these peaks are at about double, 24 days and double. Days and double. So, some mode that's interior in the sun, because the standard theory says the core of the sun rotates faster because the solar wind takes solar or angular momentum from the outside. And so that's, you know, but the thing there is, you know, I know approximately what solar rotation speed is, so I can look. Can look now if we go a little different. This is barometric pressure at Black Forest Observatory, and it's been pre-whitened, just an AR1. This is 19,000 samples, time bandwidth of six, 10 tapers. And first thing you notice is it's way too variable. But way too variable on most of the range. So this is from 100 to 500 microhertz. So go back. Got to do this better. So if we go in and look at 400 microhertz here, you get a mode that's at about 20 standard deviations above back. Standard deviations above background. A couple other modes here, which just don't show up. But this should be P02. So, you know, solar low order P mode. But it's got two splitting side lobes on it, so which don't seem to be at any obvious frequency that I don't understand. So So there's something, I don't know if anyone understands them. So there's something odd going on in here. So, but you know, 400 microhertz that's getting into P mode, maybe end of G mode band. It's a bit of a puzzle. Bit of a puzzle. So let's go to a lower frequency band. So here's 70 to 80 microhertz. Well, it doesn't have a very big range. It's two and a bit for a range. So at normal frequencies, nothing terribly exciting happening. And So, you might actually be tempted to say, oh, this is just sampling variation with a white spectrum, just noise. But if you look at a OF spectrum, so again, frequency, frequency offset. Now, I've got to explain this one because I've hopelessly cheated. I took and thrown away. thrown away all the spectrum except for points where the squared coherence is in blue here is above the 99% significance level and in red it's above the 99.9 percent significance level so like say the problem with these OS spectrum is you've got n data points you get n squared You get n squared at least points in the spectrum, and it's like I showed before with the Marseille data, a lot of the spectra are just kind of grass. So you get, you know, you can suppress things at, you know, down to the 90% level or so. It means we've got to think of something better because it's odd. But if you It's odd, but if you look at this, it appears, and it's no more than that, it's just an appearance that going along this little line I marked in, you're seeing a bunch of peaks showing up, which are offset. And certainly going across zero, they appear to have a little offset, and you can see it in lots of places. So if you understand where that's coming from, tell me and we'll both know. So it's still a mystery. But we can do again the horizontal sums, because you do notice that these tend to, these are frequency in multiples of solar rotation on the right. And if we And if we look at the sum, so this is just an average of MSC, that's not very exciting. But if you take the count the number of points, this was above the 90% point, I think, yeah, above 99% point. So you expect about nine, which is shown in this little red line across here. Across here. And you're seeing, you know, 50 some on maximum. Now, these are odd because they're not quite symmetric. If you notice, these ones that are split by solar rotation are running downhill at lower frequency and the same in the upper instead of being symmetrically down on one, up on the other. So that's slightly odd. So that's slightly odd. I'm not sure again why. That's something to be thought about. There are a lot of other peaks. This red dotted line here is 0.5 cycle per day. So not much in the bottom end. There is a quasi-two-day mode that shows up in a lot of these things. So it's probably that, and you can see it here a little more clearly at the upper ended half. And then, of course, if you go out to plus or minus a cycle per day, you can see the cycle per day rather strongly. But then, you know, everything gets so squashed you can't see it. So, problem with See it. So, problem with large data sets is I typically expect to get a couple hundred pages of plots from a single run. So it's always a problem. So what this is is, well, this is definitely work in progress. What's the best level? What's the best detection method? Detection method, all good questions. What's the best time bandwidth? Well, I've been playing with time series since the 1965, seriously. So it's now been 40 years since the 86 or 82 paper. Now this Now, this MT spectrum makes this VOEV estimate kind of useful. It's still a lot of work to figure out what's the best way to do it. I'm not going to make any strong recommendations because they seem to vary pretty much with every different example you try. Different example, you try. If you go to space physics data, you get more things to worry about. You don't have Earth rotation, of course, unless you're really close. So things to work at. It's something you can't do at all with the periodogram, as far as I know. And so, expect, like as I say, a couple of hundred pages from a fairly simple data set. This is only six months of data, and this one, barometric pressure, what could be simpler. And so, and pretty much any data set that people normally waste that I had on my computer, but I've tried this on. Computer, but I've tried this on, you always see offset coherences. So I don't think there are very many stationary processes around that don't have aspects of either Earth rotation or solar rotation or both. And so here's some you can read for yourself if you're feeling bored. And here's another page of that. One of these was fairly used, and it's quoted, I've heard that done, is, you know, most great scientists have one idea in their working lives, except for Lord Raleigh, who had two. And I expect you can probably throw in Maxwell for three or four and Newton for a few and Einstein for a few. For a few, and Einstein, for a couple. But you know, any good maxim, you don't want to make it too long and complicated. And let's see. Where did I hit the wrong button? So these are other, some lessons. So I guess any questions or have I talked too long? Too long, I think you were basically perfect. Oh, all right, so you can read these for uh one in here that's interesting is this one for Martin Wilkes, who says, a hallmark of good science is that it always has models and theory and never believes them. So, you know, use those for starting points, what you know about it. Points, what you know about it, but don't believe you know everything, so it's a good thing to keep in mind. You do experiments to be surprised. So, any questions?
