Is leading this discussion, and he wants to aim on the predictions that we get from physics. So, Jorg, please start, and then maybe people like Tudor can help the discussion. Yeah, okay, so I want to somehow introduce an idea, a circle of possible topics we can discuss, but of course, as Topics we can discuss, but of course, as usual, there should be a lot of freedom in where the discussion goes, depending on the interests and the contributions of the participants. So yeah, I've sort of prepared here this slide and another one sort of just to get started. I hope, well, I want to basically give the audience a certain picture. Audience: a certain picture that maybe everybody is on the same page, roughly, and has, even if some aspects may not be so familiar, has some idea what this is about. And then I hope that this helps stimulating the discussion. So, yeah, a few minutes maybe I can spend on explaining what is here on the picture and in this table to set the. Table to set the stage, and then, just for the sake of inspiration, I have in a very schematic form a few questions on the slide, and then I hope the discussion will unfold more freely. I mean, I have some questions I could ask, but it is supposed to be a discussion. And yeah, so there are at least At least two correspondences between quantum field theory in higher dimensions and not necessarily conformal and but however supersymmetric and on the one hand theory of vertex operator algebras but on the other hand then also well modular tensor categories topological quantum field theories and alike that And alike, that have attracted considerable or some interest in the last few years. We have heard about one of those already in Tomuyuki's talk yesterday, which was very nice. So this is a correspondence between n equals to two supersymmetric four-dimensional quantum field theories and vertex operator algebras. Operator algebras. There is a kind of cousin thereof, and they're probably, in fact, related. Although I must admit, I don't understand the relation fully, but maybe in the audience, somebody can help with this. They're probably related to each other, and that might be interesting, in fact, to carry over information and inspiration between these two stories. But yeah, I want. But yeah, I want to focus on the second story, which hasn't yet been discussed at this conference, although I'm pretty sure that Tudor will talk about this tomorrow. So maybe some aspects of the discussion and what I'm doing here can also serve as an appetizer for his talk, I hope. So it's a relationship between a quantum field theory in three dimensions, which has n equals four. Which has n equals 4, or some aspects also work with n equals 2 supersymmetry, and then vertex operator algebras where the setup is as sort of indicated in the caricature here. One has a three-dimensional space time where you can have, for example, for the two-dimensional part, which is then just inflated with another half-axis Riemann surface. So that is sort of the Surface. So that is sort of the geometric setup on which this three-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theory is supposed to be defined. And yeah, then it is a manifold with a boundary, with a two-dimensional boundary. And well, here, of course, we cannot go into the detail, so I just can state the picture as it comes out. There exists so-called topological topology. There exists so-called topological twists of the three-dimensional field theory, which make the theory topological in the bulk. However, on the boundary, it's not going to be topological, but holomorphic. And then one can study algebras of boundary operators, and as it is holomorphic, they will have an interesting holomorphic operator product expansion. And on relatively general ground, Costello and Gaudio-Yotto have argued that this different Have argued that this defines a VOA, a vertex operator algebra, which is of course one of the main topics here. Now, so yeah, but on the other hand, and I think this is one of the striking features, one of the appealing features perhaps for this audience, the picture that one is getting, getting is in many ways reminiscent, but in other ways richer than sort of a story which is, of course, in this community very familiar, the story of Community very familiar the story of the Chern-Simons-Wessmann-Witten correspondence, where one has a topological Chern-Simons theory in a three-dimensional space-time and on the boundaries, well, the Western-Witten conformal field theory. So this here, this story is described or can be described as a sort of richer story, which, however, as far as sort of formal topological field theory setup is concerned. Field theory setup is concerned, it shares several features. So, for example, well, there's a VOA living quote-quote on the boundary. The VOA has a category of representations here, just generically denoted with our R's. So the representations can be associated to points on the boundary Riemann surface, and the points on the boundary Riemann surface can be endpoints of line defects that extend in the three-dimensional bulk. So, that is something. Bulk. So that is something that you have in Sherman-Sahaman's theory. But on the other hand, what is expected, and about this, we can maybe start a discussion then, or this would be an entry into the discussion, to be generically non-semi-simple. So they have interesting additional features, in particular manifested in the existence of non-trivial home spaces between different representations, which would correspond to in the TQ of T. To in the TQFT language, to local operators localized on line defects. So that is already perhaps of interest. So it is richer in this respect. And there is a very interesting, I believe, in general conjecture that relates then some object from this three-dimensional supersymmetric field theory, which is the, well, Is the well a particularly natural object, one of the most fundamental objects of all, namely the algebra of local bulk observables, that is, point-likely, point-like localized observables in the three-dimensional bulk space-time. So the algebra which is generated by those to the X group of these, well, the VOA representation category. The one associated to, well, the word. Associated to well the vertex algebra itself, or in other words, the vacuum representation. Another way of saying this is that one expects the ring of, I mean, the local bulk observables in the topological twisted theory, they have an important meaning, an important role in the physical description of these supersymmetric flow theories. They're the generators of the ring of functions of the moduli space of VAC here, which here Space of vacuum, which here is having two types, two branches, which are traditionally called Higgs and Coulomb branches, respectively. So in a sense, this statement here, this conjecture, this conjectured dictionary relating the local bulk observables to the generators of this X algebra is, well, it amounts, if you. Well, it amounts, if you wish, to a reconstruction of the geometry or the structure of algebraic variety on the ring of functions on the Higgs and Coulomb branches. So it reconstructs from pure algebra some important geometry that is important for the physics of these three-dimensional Kinikos for Suzy Fault theories. So this sort of just as a kind of pictured. As a kind of picture to have in mind to get started for the polling. So, I find this a rather striking story. I mean, for at least two reasons. There is on the one hand, this vast enrichment of, say, this TQFT, CFT holographic correspondence, and on the other hand, this kind of reconstruction of geometry from some algebraic. From some algebraic objects that are coming from VOAs and VOA representation categories, I think is a rather beautiful story. So, here I just want to flash this just for the sake of inspiration, what could be questions. And maybe if we want, we can, well, I can say a few more words, but I really want very quickly to hand over sort of to you. So, yeah, I mean, on the one hand, I mean, well, One hand, I mean, well, a general sort of type of questions one can have is this is a kind of this should be, I think, ultimately a kind of two-way road, which is from, say, VOA and TQFT, one should be able to prove, confirm, or substantiate, make more precise some statements and conjectures that one has about the physics of these very interesting. Physics of these very interesting three-dimensional quantum field theories. But on the other hand, as it often goes, well, the physics leads to certain expectations which may have very interesting consequences when deciphered in fully mathematical terms, which then may be rather interesting statements, for example, about VOAs and their representation theories. That I would suggest is maybe one topic we could start with a little bit. And one other thing which I One other thing which I find very interesting and striking is that there seem to be on the both sides, so on the side of TQFT as well as on the side of physics, hints. But yeah, I must say my understanding of this is limited and partial and superficial. Well, the relevance of derived structures. And I would suggest that this could be an interesting thing to elaborate and discuss. thing to elaborate and discuss in this round. I know, well, in this audience, there are certainly people who have thought about it and I would hope to learn a little more on what is behind. This can in particular, for example, well, help to enrich this story. So for example, well, there's the, I mentioned the ring of functions on the moduli space of VAC here. I would suspect, and I've in the literature seen hints. Seen hints or discussions or conjectures that this could lead to richer structures that these guys have, which then may be important for the deeper physical understanding of these theories. And, well, there's a lot. I just, as I said, I want to sort of inspire you with listing a few directions we could go. So, I mentioned also the relation between 3D and 4D stories, where this 4D story was discussed in Tumuyuki's talk. Discuss in Tumuyuki's talk. And well, this should again lead to interesting relations. Like, for example, there was a variety reconstructed from the X. And well, in Tomoyuke's story, there appeared the associate varieties. I think he, if I understood correctly, but this was a little brief and quick, he mentioned this as a conjecture that these should be related in some way. But here, the very formulation would need to be made more precise. Anyway, I More precise. Anyway, I mean, maybe I should stop talking and, I mean, perhaps, well, a starting point could be to ask Thomas, for example, I mean, as an expert in VOAs, what he would find particularly interesting from that point of view in this correspondence. I mean, you have been working on this, you are still working on this. Maybe you can say a few words about this. Thank you, John. Thank you, Jorg. So maybe I first say one thing to this point raised by Tomiyuki, and then a few more general things. So there is this picture that this X algebra is somehow related to the Coulomb branch of the theory, and that the associated The associated variety of the VOA should actually be exactly the Higgs branch. The ring of functions on the Higgs branch should correspond to it. And then there are certain dualities of theories where Higgs and Coulomb branch get interchanged. And Tomiyuki, Kazuya, and I, we just were interested purely for VOA reasons on the complete. On the complete understanding of admissible affine vertex algebra of SL2 as representation category. And what we notice is that the atypical blocks, all of them coincide with the principal block of the unrolled quantum group of SL2. And so And then Tom Yuki talked to a few people that specialized in quantum groups. And these people have found out that the spectrum of the principal block coincides with associated varieties of certain important cones. And so So we strongly believe that this is actually, that this should have a 3D explanation, that somehow if sometimes affine vertex algebra was at admissible level, they are associated to 3D theories, and then this correspondence between associated varieties and X algebras of fine vertex algebras is some kind of self-duality of those. Of self-duality of those, but this is quite unclear to us. Um, so this is why Tomiyuki didn't write down a concrete conjecture. And maybe somebody here in the audience has something better to say than I have. That sounds like a 3D mirror symmetry statement. Yeah, yeah, that is exactly. It should be a 3D mirror symmetry statement. There are some really famous families of 3D theories that are self-mirror. Yeah, and that are self-mirror, almost self-mirror. And what we thought is that for general Lie algebra, general Lie group, the mirror one should correspond to the Langnon's dual algebra. This seemed to be to us most natural, but we weren't completely sure. It comes from the way the resolutions in the resolutions of the FINVOA go. Do you have any thought on this, Todor? No. Yeah, I'm not sure how you would see that easily. Since we only have some. Yeah, sorry, I need to think about it. You talk about the Langlands duo. I'm understanding that you are talking about fractional levels. You are talking about fractional level FIB. Yes, yes. So, one typical phenomenon that appears in this context is that the Langlands dual of something that's simply connected is not simply connected, so that there is some simple current extension involved. Some feature like that, or Yeah, we actually don't have much to say at the moment because we only understand SL2. So I have nothing to say to that. Okay, good. But David is here. So David, do you want to do you have anything? There is a suspicion which I am not quite certain of, but so if. So, in the context of any colourthosophy and meals, if you take some simple boundary condition like fuel-Neumann boundary conditions and you start applying various element, some element, you apply to some element of SHUZ, S duality group, you will get a more complicated boundary condition where the Fourier theory is coupled to some possibly mysterious 3D. Possibly mysterious 3D quantum field theory, mechanical phosphorus symmetry. If you apply the S-transformation, that's what we call T of G in the paper with Edward, but for other elements of SL2Z, very little is known about these theories. Except presumably have a Higgs branch or Coulomb branch, depending on how you see it, which is the important cone, perhaps. Need potent cone, perhaps that's conceivable at least. Now, I wouldn't be surprised if, because of this SH2Z transformation involved, these 3D theories after B-twist or A-twist were to have line defects which are related to the line defects that you find at these normal boundary conditions after these duality transformations. After these duality transformations. And those could very well be representations of a quantum group at a fractional level. So one possibility is that these Lie algebras at admissible levels appear at some of the boundaries for these trivia theories. Traded theories. But I yeah, I don't have a very clear idea of how to check this further. Now, it's we heard from Tomoyuki that these theories also appear in for the context as caral, sorry, this vertex algebra as caral algebras of GS diagras theories. Now, typically, if you compatify a 3D theory in a circle, you get a 3D theory which has the same kind of algebra. Has the same current algebra at the boundary. But again, I do not imagine one could try to argue that the compatification on the cycle of the general theory is related to these 3D theories. I had some thoughts about it, but I haven't made any concrete. But anyway, so this is as much as I can suspect on this matter. On this matter, yeah, thanks. I mean, really, what Tomiyuki wanted to point out is that we were all quite happy and let's say positively surprised that the X algebras of admissible level affine VOA seems to be related nicely to associated varieties. And we are hoping that this is another question one could ask from the 3D perspective. Perspective. What one might suspect is that there must be a kind of relatively general relation that perhaps is insufficiently understood between the 3D and the 4D stories. And I mean, I saw in some paper of Dylan Budson something. I mean, he claimed a certain relation which comes from basically. Certain relation which comes from basically viewing the 4D on the space of like C gar times Riemann surface and then doing with some equivalence reduction along that circle. And well, I cannot say that I really studied and understood his argument in any detail, but this seems to be the kind of picture one would expect to produce such relations and maybe explain such relations. And maybe explain such relations. So, I wonder, this must be close to what David likes to do. So, is this a potential source of relations of this type, as we're just discussing? I mean, I think so, but another thing that is worth mentioning about the Tomoyuki stock. Tomoyuki's talk. He drew this committing diagram at the very beginning, and he was mentioning the fact that instead of the VOA, you can start from the Poisson VOA in order to get the zoo algebra. And I think the Poisson View A has something to do with what you see in the four-dimensional theory if you just do an homomorphic topological twist without turning on an omega-beground. Of the ground that might help in going from 4D to 3D in the sense that you wouldn't have to worry about the omega deformation. Because in a way, the role of it is not quite clear. Yeah, why you would. I mean, the omega deformation is in the story of well, Beam and Rustelli are probably not. Of well, beam and rustelli are probably not there, right? So, um, it it has it is in later read later, yes, of course, you can edit and you can play with it, but uh, there is a story without it. This is what I no no, so the Rastel-Lime and all construction can be also interpreted as an omega-deformation of the Lomorphic topological twist of the Foudinic theory. It's a slightly different perspective, which A slightly different perspective, which lands on the same perfect algebra. That was described in the paper of O and Yagi a few years ago. So that has the best chance of relating to something like Davide and Kevin and Thomas's story in 3D. So it roughly looks like it should work in 4D. In 4D, one has a vertex algebra localized on a surface, and if one does a circle compactification on the link of the surface, one would end up with a 3D theory with a boundary and hopefully a vertex algebra at the boundary. But there are some technical issues to deal with in that compactification and keeping track of twists properly and such. So, I mean, it's my So, I mean, is the summary or the impression I got from this correct? That sort of Tomoyuki's remark or conjecture is basically based on this example of admissible level fine algebras, and that is sort of experimental evidence. It is not really something that came out as a clear prediction from these physics backgrounds, but could be potentially in the future. Potentially in the future. Is this sort of a fair summary of what I took from the I think so. It's somehow a striking observation that hopes to have an explanation. Okay. Yeah, also chatting with Chris, who I don't think could be here. Yeah, Chris, is he around? I mean, I was hoping. No, I don't think so, but yeah. No, I don't I don't th think so, but yeah, he's also convinced this is a this is this prediction is a statement of 3D mirror symmetry and it somehow has to do with compactifying these 4D theories on a circle and then getting boundary boundary VOAs and the associated variety is supposed to be related to the original Higgs branch and then X of in the vacuum module should be related to a Coulomb branch. It sort of almost makes sense. I hesitate to say anything too concretely. Like, you would want to say that compactifying the 4D holomorphic twist on an equivariant cigar leads you to the three-dimensional A-twist, which is the thing or whose local operators are Coulomb branch, or the Coulomb branch chirling. The common bench colouring. I see. Okay, yeah, interesting. So maybe it's an interesting interesting direction for the future then. Yeah, so it seems there's not yet so much clarity available. Yeah. I think Madrid is about is to take the picture you flashed in the previous slide and just put an untaxed. And just put an anti-chiral algebra on the other side. Okay. Because, like, one of the main applications of 3D TFT is to make 2D CFTs out of null algebras. So if anybody has ideas of how these non-chiral theories might look like, that would be very nice. So if you're talking about non-chiral theories, that's pairing left movers and right movers in a way that things like modular invariance should be should be obeyed. So, of course, it's rather speculative, but we've learned in this concept. But we've learned in this conference about the underlying categories a lot in David Redoux talk. And the general methods we have to understand, for example, bulk fields. Now, they are quite categorical. Of course, they are developed in a framework in which for mathematical reasons we have much stronger assumptions, finiteness conditions. But I think that at least as long as the underlying categories are Underlying categories are rigid in the sense that there's a left and a right dual and they coincide. That there's a chance to generalize these methods. It's getting very difficult if you are getting to a class of vertex algebras which are not rigid anymore. So if you have this general quote and de Gwetier categories. Yeah, so then probably the co-ends Jürgen was mentioning. Mentioning, in the best possible world, they should exist, but as objects in some completion of the category. Yeah, so this is not completely out of reach, but it's to get it on a mathematical firm ground that requires a bit more work. I was wondering if, for example, people know how to build non-chiral theories on these admissible level LKGs. Well, that we. Well, that we, to my knowledge, that's not known because these admissible level categories have infinitely many symbols. So you have to generalize the existing tools, which work in the setting where you have finitely many symbols, but not necessarily semi-simplicity. So we have the tools for the non-semi-simple case. You have to generalize this to this situation where you have infinity. Where you have infinitely many symbols. But if the situation is nice enough, such objects might exist, for example, as int objects, also hopefully int objects of the category. So in some suitable completion. But that's something that can in principle be worked out with present-day technology. It's just not possible to work it out in one afternoon. Possible to work it out in one afternoon? At least not for me, maybe for some other people. So, David, since for this admissible level, we now have a classification of modules, it should be in principle possible to write down what the co-end should look like as an object and the end completions, what the bulk-Hilbert space of the non-Chiral theory should look like. I think I think that's something one could probably try to do. Yes, and if you know how to do it for the bulk Hilbert space, for the not Hilbert space, but for a vector space for bulk fields, you will be able to do it immediately for defect fields. So that's more or less in one go. I mean, I feel tempted to sort of I feel tempted to sort of suggest the view from the other side. I mean, shouldn't it with the help of, or I mean, I may even have a bit of experience of my own. I mean, with the help of just studying Knisching Zamotrykov equations in Genes 0, at the very least, one seems to be able to write down some crossing invariant non-holomorphic correlation functions. I understand very well, and I was struggling with. I understand very well, and I was struggling with it myself a little bit, that the factorization of it, so the precise determination of what is propagating intermediately is a tricky thing. But I just want to mention there is at least a certain starting point that could be the start of an analysis of this type. So, do you know that? I mean, in this admissible level theories, you have these relaxed high-speed modules, and do we know what the KnischNixon modules? Do we know what the Knischnicks-Domino-Samologikov equation looks like for them? Well, you know, what you can do, I'm quite confident, is basically to work in a formalism where you introduce sort of this additional twisting by continuous parameters which geometrically are related to moduli of bun g. So then you have correlation functions, which are not just functions of the underlying complex structure. The underlying complex structure moduli of the Riemann surface, but on top of it, as there are functions of the moduli of bun g and they satisfy Knishiksomochikov type equations which are partial differential equations both in sort of variables Z for complex structure moduli and X say for moduli of 1 G and with this it is possible in It is possible, in Genesis Zero at least, to write down crossing symmetric combinations which exist basically for generic level, but of course can be specialized to rational levels. And they exist for generic values of representation labels, which, however, can also be specialized to the integer one. The integer ones, and then you have something which satisfies connections on Motrikov and which is crossing environment. The thing which is tricky is really the precise analysis for some reasons, okay, which I shall probably not attempt to explain here, is the precise analysis of what propagates intermediately. So, how to decompose it as some over intermediate representations in the intermediate channel. Channel. Alternative approach, if you have a free field realization, would be to replace contour integrals of chiral screening charges with non-chiral integrals on the whole surface of non-chiral screening charges. If the integrals can make sense, they can give you something single-valued. And I understand that sometimes this VOA that comes from 4D have excellent. Come from 4D have exceptional free filterizations that I've seen in some papers by us telling collaborators of BIM. But I have not followed details well enough to know if those are suitable or if those have are known for things like LK. Yeah, so this beam-Rastelli construction is something that Dražin Adamovich understands very well and And this Mimar-Selli construction can somehow be understood as inverting quantum Hamiltonian reduction. And these special levels had the property that at these levels, the algebra of interest had the property that the quantum Hamiltonian reduction was trivial. And then the inversion just involved trivial times free fields. And for admissible level fine VUAs, the reduction is not trivial. So you have something non-trivial, but that would be something like a VR so minimum. Be something like a Virasaur minimum model. And then you have additional free fields. And indeed, Gatten Davida, I think one can use this. One can write down a non-chiral version of that and get non-chiral screening charges and can use them. So I think that's a good point. Another question would go yeah, please please David. Please, Davide. I know. Tudor, you want to speak first? Sorry. Okay, so another question that I would like to ask the audience: in some situations, there seems to be a relationship between the geometry of the associated variety and the properties of the conformal blocks of the vertex algebra. In the sense that sometimes the conformal blocks of these vertex algebras diverge at certain loci in the model experience. In the model special elements of compost structures, or perhaps in the model species of bundles, if we can couple them to bundles. And I've seen in simple examples that this divergence seems to be happening in places where there is an holomorphic map from the surface into the associated variety or something like that. And I was wondering if this is known or understood, or if you have seen anything like that. I mean, the canonical example I have is simply. I mean, the canonical example I have is symplectic bosons, where a corrodion function will diverge on the theta divisor, which is also the place where there is sort of a classical solution for the classical exponential value for the synthetic bosons, which is a map of a certain twisted by some bundle from the surface into the associated variety of the synthetic bosons, which is C2. GC2. And I've seen similar things happening in BRST reductions of symbetic bosons, but it's, I don't know, I was just wondering if, you know, I was just wondering if there is a way to understand that the variety is more than just the result of the calculation from the algebra, but it's something that controls properties of conformal blocks. Controls properties or control blocks or things like that. Do you have a place where one can read about this symplectic boson observation so that one can stare at it a bit? It's a bit scattered, but in the last few papers I wrote on the next geometric language, for example, like the last one I wrote, where I was computing some correlation functions on some. Correlation functions on synthetic bosons on the sphere. You could see some of these. Okay, thank you. David, can you understand that in terms of a Hilbert space? Sorry, if this is showing up in a 3D context and this the more And this is the more general story need not be, but if it is showing up in 3D, then conformal blocks should be the Hilbert space on a surface. And that's a homological thing that might jump. So that would be the locus where somehow the non-trivial supersymmetric vacuum for the 3D3 state and Riemann surface, where the Higgs branch or Coulomb branch, depending on the twist, fields. Depending on the twist, fields can get a classical web on the surface, which is compatible with the twist. So it's a place where you might expect something special to happen, but I don't know what to say beyond that. This is what geometrically happens in general at Newport and cone, right? Or the projection to Bungie of the Newport and Cone. This is where Hitchin Hamiltonians degenerate, right? Is this what you What you the singularities that you have in mind this was more about a dependence on maybe the complex structure of the surface or it was like on parameters of the On parameters of the conformal blocks. Yes. Or potentially the bundles, if you couple it to a bundle. Which is why it involves sort of maps from the surface into the nil potent, well, into the nilpotent cone or its resolution or something like that. Yeah, that's right. So that would be a good example. So if I look at the conformal blocks of the admissible LKG. Admissible LKG, do they have interesting singularities or monotromies or this, I think, is on the places where there are maps into the yeah, this basically I think is known. I mean, or I mean, not well known, probably, but yes, indeed, I think this is the decisive distinction between, say, the, well, The well, I mean, you could formulate the Knischian exomology of equations for compact West-Minnow-Wittens in the same way. You can introduce twisting by bundles, holomorphic bundles on the ribbon surface and so on. And they have, well, basically trivial singularities or trivial monodromy around these critical loci, and the difference. And the difference I'm pretty sure of this admissible level cognition some logic of solutions of that type will be that they have a non-trivial behavior at the singular lossa. So there is, I mean, well, a relatively famous and simple one is when you have a four-punctured sphere, then you have just one twisting parameter. Let's call it x. Yes. And then there is a very interesting singularity when that x is equal to z. X is equal to Z, the cross ratio that describes the four-punctured sphere. And I think a lot of sort of the non-trivial things which have to do with what is more complicated have to do or are sort of reflected in that singularity. And well, for conformal blocks, there are monotromies around it. For say, physical correlation functions or non-holomorphic correlation functions, you can cancel them between levels. You can cancel them between left and right, and so on. So, some glimpses of the story one can see, but of course, there's a lot probably more to be understood. Right, so you don't know what happens specifically to that missible level in those situations? Well, I know, I think I know that the sing alert, I mean, okay, I was mainly working when studying H3 with it. When studying H3 with a generic level, but these issues don't go away when specialized to admissible level. They stay. But they would go away, however, if you really would specialize maybe to some SO2 with someone within yeah, that's, I think, an interesting story. I would like to maybe spend, well, where time is running, I mean, I think another sort of interesting I think another sort of interesting circle of questions we can at least briefly try to discuss is this issue or story of potential relevance of derived structures in this context. So perhaps, I don't know. I mean, I think, yeah, right. I was just. Yeah, I can say a few things. I also have an hour to talk tomorrow. So I'm not going to say too much. So if you, okay, you maybe in. You okay? You maybe very brief advice, of course, can be great. So, if one wants to find non-semi-simple line operator categories or in a 3D, 2D physical context, one needs to look for theories that have local operators around. Around, and the most prevalent ones come as twists of supersymmetric theories, which is the context that you drew a little diagram of York. And in this case, when the topological properties are coming about from a twist, there is no choice but to work with DG everything. DG everything or in infinity categories. And so in particular, under dualities, the only thing that has a right to match is a DG category. And that's very easy to see. That there's no chance of working with abelian categories. Categories. And it's a very familiar story in like two-dimensional mirror symmetry, right? That's homological mirror symmetry is a statement about DG enhancements of derived categories or A infinity enhancements. And so it's the same thing here. So the statement on this chart that says line defects become representations of the VOA, that's a derived equivalence. It's a one-way derived functor that optimistically is an equivalence. Functor that optimistically is an equivalence. So the thing on the left in the 3D column is a DG category, and the only thing it can possibly match is the derived category of representations of the VOA. So then a few lines down, when one is computing local observables, that's just endomorphisms of the trivial line in the bulk. The bulk. But because this is a derived equivalence, and endomorphisms means take derived everything. And so you end up with this axed algebra when looking at the VOA. So this ends up having several strange consequences. If you try to form a TQFT out of this sort of structure, Structure, you end up with infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. I think in nice cases, and particularly when the 3D theory is conformal, and so moduli spaces are conical, one ends up with infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces that have a homological grading that is non-negative, and they have finite degree of finite graded dimensions. And so the simplest example is the Hilbert space. Well, the simplest example is the Hilbert space on a two-sphere, which is this local operators thing that is typically an infinite dimensional algebra. The next one on a two-torus, one ends up with Hochschule tomology of this representation category, which in all examples I know of in this logarithmic world is infinite dimension. World is infinite dimensional. And that leads to problems with cutting and gluing and defining that properly that I don't know how to answer fully and would love to understand more of. And possibly Christophe will talk about that in his talk. Well, I'm not going. Well, I'm not going to talk as an organizer, but we have. Is someone talking? Sorry, or is Lucas talking? Well, actually, since we are not talking, Lucas has prepared two very brief slides, which he might flash if you are interested, and which are kind of summarizing what we consider to be some of the main results. So maybe I. So maybe I can hand to Lucas and he can explain it a bit as a mini talk of three minutes. Yeah, so yeah, we have this short poster so you can see it, right? Yes. Yes, okay, excellent. Yeah, so the setup is that you just have a modular category, not necessarily semi-simple, and then Quite simple. And then, one thing that we can do is that we define a symmetric monoidal category of surfaces where the boundary components are labeled with projective objects. And then the thing that one can prove is that this gives rise to a differential-graded modular functor. So you have a symmetric monoidal functor from this labeled surface category, or better, a central extension. Or better, a central extension thereof, because the representations of the mapping class groups will be projected, but we know that. And then this is chain complex valued. And yeah, this satisfies an excision property that is formulated in terms of homotopy coens. And I'm sorry, we should maybe say to excision is factorization, is gluing. Yeah, that's a compatibility with gluing and the With gluing, and the mathematical way to do this is through homotopy coherent. And then some example values are exactly the ones that Tudor has already mentioned or that Jörg also mentioned. So the X algebra on the two-sphere, Hocht complex on the two-torus. And so then you get consequences like that. There is an asset to that action on the Sochiel complex. And the main idea is essentially that you bring together That you bring together the homological algebra of the category and the low-dimensional topology. And one thing that we are able to do in this framework is, for instance, that we get something that is a generalization of the Verlinde formula. So the Verlinde formula is the statement that the S matrix diagonalizes the fusion. It transforms the fusion product into a very easy diagonal product. So the S. So, the S matrix does not intertwine with the fusion but transforms it into a different product. And we can lift this to an equivalence of framed E2 algebra. So, there is on the hosted complex E2 structure, the one coming from the monoidal product. And this is transformed into a different E2 structure. And we find that this is the linear E2 structure. And this reduces not only in the semi-simple case to the usual vanilla formula, but also if you Formula, but also if you take zero tomology, you find generalizations of the Valinde formula to the non-semi-simple case that Ingo and Azad have given. And one nice thing is that, so in this diagonal product here, we have the quantum dimension. And if you do this thing here with the E2 structures and so on and so forth, this, in a sense, automatically gets replaced with the modified dimension without having to throw this. Mention without having to throw this in, it comes out. That's a nice feature of this. Yeah, that's, I guess that's it. And the modified dimension is defined by the modified trace. Okay, yeah, when I say modified dimension, that's a special case of the modified trace. Yeah, so that shows up naturally. It's actually a part of the Linus E2 structure. So because it's the cyclic delinquent. It's the cyclic delinquent conjecture, and for this, you need a Kalabi Al structure. And the Kalabi Al structure that goes into this is the one coming from the modified trace in the tensor idea of projectives. Can this somehow be upgraded to a PQFT? Is it possible? Is it possible to formulate some sort of three-manifold invariance? I mean, if you really wanted to turn this into a TFT in the traditional sense, then of course you would have to assign dualizable chain complexes to surfaces. And then for these dimension reasons that you already mentioned, that in this naive sense, it's not going to work. We can extend. We can extend it to some. Sorry. So there are stupid cases where it does seem to work. So if you want to ask, what is the invariant for Taurus times S1? That's the character of this Hochschild complex, which, at least in many examples, seems to be a finite thing. There's a natural regularization. There's a natural regularization of it. Okay. So, Tudor, your invariants for three manifolds are not anymore scalars, but they are power series in Q. Is this correct? Because if you take the dimensions of the Hochschild complex, then you won't add up dimensions in different degrees, right? Yeah, that's right. So, well, sorry, like this is not totally. Sorry, like this is not totally well defined, right? You would take a Poincaré polynomial and somehow try to resum it. Yeah, okay. And then take the limit where t goes to minus one. Yeah. Yeah, or consider it as an interesting function in its own right. Yeah. Yeah, so. Yeah, so this is really neat. Thanks for sorry, and I didn't know about the most recent steps in this. Thanks for sharing the slides. For simple-minded person like myself, the question is, of course, natural. Is there an example where one sort of can push it through to the end? So where there is, well, a is well a known 3D n equals 4 Q of T with known associated VOA to which this theory can be applied following Tudor's slogan well all the correspondences should be derived yeah I hope to give one tomorrow okay excellent and this hopefully served as an appetizer Hopefully, it served as an appetizer indeed, as hoped. There is, I mean, we should spell out a warning, and I don't know how subtle the point is. What we are doing is we take an ordinary abelian category, which is great it, and then we derive it. And what you are doing in this 3D Young-Mills context, if I'm understanding it correctly, then you are starting from. Correctly, then you're starting from a structure which is already derived. And this can be really subtle whether just taking, in a sense, the H0 part of the representation category and then deriving it is the same thing and that the diagram really commutes on the nose. So that's a kind of a general disclaimer we should make. And the theory is worked out for modular. Is worked out for modular categories which also have this class of finiteness conditions because for these finite categories we know exactly what this action of S is, which Lucas was showing here in this displayed equation. So we are using for this S more or less directly Lubachenko's theory, and this is something that's not generalized, for example, to infinitely many simple objects. Infinitely many simple objects. But definitely, it's an interesting hint from the 3D story that to look for an extension of the story that Lucas has shown on his slides. Thanks. Yeah, so the case with infinitely many simples will definitely come up. However, there is some hope in that if these boundary vertex algebras exist. Algebras exist and happen to be in homological degree zero, then you would hope that the category can be described as the derived category of VOA modules. Oh, yes, there's definitely hope, but if something doesn't work out right away on the nose, then there's no reason to give up this hope. Give up this hope. Yes, so that was the disclaimer. It was not about giving up hope at all. And children, so the example that you're going to give tomorrow probably won't be like K3 Gozo-Witten model, right? But isn't that like a nice model to start with since the many Hilbert space and human services are finite dimensional? And one can also work out many. And one can also work out mapping class group action to maybe compare with VOA side. I was going to talk about a C2 Rosensky-written model, which has infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, unless you do the thing that you and Sergei and collaborators did. So often these infinite dimensional theories have deformations that That kill all of the infinite stuff and kill all of the derived structure. Yes. But how about just K3? Since the tire space is... Sorry, I had missed what you said. One could totally do this. This is certainly not the example I have in mind. I think one thing that is somewhat confusing is that if one looks at the SL2Z action, Look at the SL2Z action that was only written down. That doesn't look at all like SL2Z action on a VOA side. So, for example, it's not unitary. And the T matrix is like arbitrarangle or something like this. Is this something you worked out? No, it's in Rosalind Witten's. Oh, it's already there. You see? It, of course, would be, since that's what their paper was about. Paper was about. Yeah, no, I'm going to give an example that so, like, it's, it's really, it seems like it should be stupidly simple, but it has a lot of these features of an infinite dimensionality, a need to regularize, and has deformations. And they're this sort of who's talk? David's talk, maybe, from earlier this week? Someone's talk. There was this notion of like an almost semi- This notion of an almost semi-simple category that has many blocks, and there's a nasty non-semi-simple block, and then lots of simple ones. And that corresponds to the setting where the 3D theory has deformations that I think you guys analyzed in terms of equivariance. That does allow much, much nicer. Does allow much much nicer computations and makes everything nicely underived. Yeah, I see. Thanks. So, I mean, there are some cases at least, okay, where it seems good from the From the VOA associated to the 3D story is known. Okay, you will discuss one tomorrow. There are some others like triplet and so on, which I think have been understood, where by now I think one has also a equivalence of braided tensor categories of Kashtalustik type that is known, right, Thomas? And then, so do I understand correctly? It is sort of basic finiteness requirement. Basic finiteness requirements that would prevent us to apply Christoph's and Lucas's story to such examples. I think these are all really good cases that would allow you to apply that technology, from what I understand. I mean, do these cases exist? Are there some cases where it basically one has all that one would need, or is this not so clear? That is what I'm trying to understand. Maybe we should discuss this after Tudor's talk when we have some things. Yeah, that is probably a good suggestion indeed. Because we shouldn't. Because we shouldn't make Tudor give away some of the punchlines he wants to reserve for tomorrow. Yeah, I don't want to make you listen to it twice. We have a lot of time tomorrow after Mono. Do we want to schedule another session then, Costa? Yeah, why not? I mean. Yeah, that's probably really a good idea because after Tudor's talk, things will be clearer, I think. I'd really appreciate. Really appreciate maybe some expanded version of Lucas's slides. Yeah, that's I think he has enough time to prepare this for until tomorrow. Maybe super informal. Sorry, that was not a nice request. Some super informal extended discussion. Yeah. Yeah, we I think it's it's for us, it's very positive if you make this request. So Requests. So, and we will definitely ask questions on the categories that show up in your talk. So, and that's probably a good idea to continue this tomorrow in the afternoon. If this is fine with people in band, if they don't want to go hiking, but I mean, we cannot go hiking anyhow, right? Tudor. Yeah, so I'm really interested in. Yeah, so I'm really interested in this and I exactly would like to understand how your story, Christophe, applies to triplet and co. If we can discuss that a little bit. That would be good. Yeah. No, we will do this. And I think it's a very good idea to take up this discussion tomorrow. This could be This could be a natural end for the discussion session today, although, well, we probably don't have to, I don't know what the organizers would say, we don't have to cut it off sharp. The time formally assigned to it is over. There are many questions open and where there are many continuations we could talk about. So I would pass it or hand it over maybe to the organizers to decide if we sort of officially end the discussion session for now. End the discussion session for now, or if we just sort of let it go a little bit further? Why don't I stop the video and we can informally whoever wants to stay stays and I mean it's late for you or for us it's not late. Yeah, here it's getting late indeed, but I should go and make some dinner. Okay. Okay. Okay, so let's maybe say goodbye for now to whoever wants to leave or needs food or whatever. And yeah, see you tomorrow.
