Yes, thank you. Yeah, and thanks for having me. It's been a blast. I mean, what a place. It's joined with Max Land and Michael Weiss, who are here at Kostavinus in Legisburg. And yeah, it's about homology manifolds and the non-existence of Euclidean bundles for them. It's about destroying a theorem, which, if you've known me for a while, is sort of the thing that gets my juices flowing. So, throughout, I'll be fixing a dimension of everything. It's going to be larger, equal, what's silly. And I'll probably forget to write it again. That's one thing. And the other thing is, I want to be a little bit careful in distinguishing between, because this talk will have some very complex tomology manifolds and something that are homotopy theoretical or not. So I want to give this a name, this thing, and you can make fun of me for however much you want afterwards. Let this be the functor that extracts the homotopy type. That extracts an honot to be type. Okay, so that's the conventions part. So, yeah, homology manifolds. I think they're sufficiently arcane, so I should also apologize. I mean, I was ready to go. I was ready to go right after Marcus' talk, and sort of taking my iPad and taking off my scarf and just walking down to give a talk, and then realized that everybody was leaving for lunch. Somehow, Marcus Wolfgang and I have just been arguing, and then there was deer, and my thoughts are still helpful, so I apologize for being a little unorganized. Uh okay, so I mean I think I guess I could define these first. Not to do that. Uh uh compact mouse cloth space Uh compact Mausstoff space uh is called an homology manifold. Uh if two things happen I mean one and this is over the bigger condition uh the the thing that sends u to the chains of x relative to x minus u uh as a sheaf As a sheaf on X with values in V of Z, this is invertible. That's somehow the main condition. And then the second condition, which is a bit negotiable. Okay. So this one is a bit negotiable, it's about some point-set assumptions on this thing. Is about some point-set assumptions on this thing. So, in order to conform with the theorem, with the definitions in the papers that we're sort of talking about, it needs to have the following assumptions. It needs to be second-countable, sub-locally contractible, that means almost locally contractible. That means every inside every neighborhood, you can find a smaller one that's contractible in the given one, not in itself. Not in itself, not in the big space. Those are like locally and semi-locally, and you want it to be in the middle. That's this and a finite covering dimension. Both finite cover dimension or finite away. Finally, yeah. And so let me maybe immediately give two remarks. Two remarks about this. I mean, two is to ensure that the passage between topological spaces and their homotopy types is somehow painless. It's to ensure that on the one thing, locally constant sheaves on x is the same thing as functors from Hunters from synex into well into whatever you take as your target category. But one is that and this also makes sure that X is hypercomplete, meaning you can detect equivalences between stalks. Equivalences between sheaves can be detected on stalks. Detected on stalks. Stocks. In particular, you can detect invertibility on stocks. So, in particular, that makes one equivalent to just the condition that the local homology of X is isomorphic to Z in dimension D for every point in X. Okay, so that's somehow. Okay, so that's somehow a bit of points at blah blah. And I mean, if you don't have this, you have to maybe think a little bit about what the correct definition is. But as I said, that's somehow to be negotiated with whoever writes the definite account of these things. Yes, I guess so. Yes. No, I mean, do we want a manifold of a given dimension or not? I think so. Yeah, but I'd rather. Yeah, but I'd rather it be constant and the homology manifold have dimension D. Yes, absolutely. And yes, so and I guess I can do that here. Examples are few and far between. So the simplest thing is a topological manifold. There's of course such a thing. That's, well, that's the proof of Poincaré radiality. That's not Poincaré radiality itself. That's the proof. And the other thing that's fairly obvious, if M is The other thing that's fairly obvious, if M is a homology sphere, fortunately a homology sphere now, sort of the notation clashes a bit, we call this a Z-sphere, i.e. a manifold whose homology is that of a sphere, then Sm, its unreduced suspension is a homology manifold. I mean, it's actually a homology sphere in the sense of that it's a homology manifold that's homotopy equivalent to a sphere. And note also that Sing of a sphere. Okay, so that's a simple example, and that really then is only a manifold if the original thing M was a topological was a sphere. And more generally, you can take things like more generally manifolds with cone-like singularities, cone-like singularities. like singularities where the links are z-spheres. Points. Z-spheres. This is an example where you have two of these strange points, where the links are the original sphere. So those are a couple of examples. Those are not going to be the examples we care about. And unfortunately, I can't write any of the examples we care about really down. Is the definition at least clear? Yeah, so one of the basic properties is these things have global functor radiometry. So I guess that's a formulate setup here because one part of it is. Namely, if Um namely, if you have a compact sort of homology manifold, that I mean, the definition I gave it's always compact for the for the purposes of this talk, then this is actually a finite finite space. That's Marcus, give me the name, please. A and R, compact A and R's have the homotopy types of finite CW complexes. Fuck, I did not write down who this complex is. Now, write down who this is. West, thank you. This is West theorem. And these really have global Punk radiality. The homology of X, what I mean, right? The co-chains of X are really isomorphic to the co-chains of X twisted by this thing where I erased it. This is that sheet. Like the orientation of that sheaf from the definition. And because of this equivalence, I will sometimes regard it as a sheaf, and mostly I will regard it as a local system on the underlying underlying homotopy. Okay, this really, I mean, this is the standard proof of concrete reality for manifolds, actually proves this, and this is this is more different type of form. Okay, that's that. That's that. And now, generally, for something like a finite anima, I call for a finite anima. In John Klein left, which is due to him, there exists a dualizing complex. There is a unique sheaf. No local system. local system the X2 spectra such that which way around does this go the co-limit over X of E tensor DX this let me just write this equal it by a specific map but never remind that to the limit over E Remind that to the limit over E for all E from next to spectra, this is the Klein's idealizing spectrum. Okay, so I mean this is the sort of higher categorical way of formulating that for for every finite For every finite homotopy type, you have something that plays the role of the orientation in Hohmann-radiality. And generally, I mean, this can be quite complicated, it's not a sphere in general, but it always exists, it's always unique. But it doesn't come from any sort of local geometry on X, because I mean, there is none. And so, here's a couple of And so here's a couple of facts. One of these derives from the fact that this has Poincaré duality. With this, or maybe I'll start by saying x is a finite animal f and x is Poincaré if and only if this thing factors from from x into the invertible spectra. Yeah, if and only if it's pointwise a sphere. And it this thing is of dimension D if this factors through the space of t spheres. It's maybe point one. Sorry, if it's mine's t, yes, thank you. And this will tell you that if x is a homology manifold and I regard omega x as a functor from sing x to dz. sing x to dz, then that's the co-chains on dx. Then omega x is the co-chains of d subx. Okay, so I mean that's sort of this uniqueness statement also holds when you replace spectra here by the derived category of the integers and then this formula precisely becomes this formula. I guess I can also put local coefficients I guess I can also put local coefficients here. Now it literally becomes the structure. Does this use some collection of these available coefficients? Can I say it again? Does that use any of the point-set assumptions? I think was the question. And I think the answer: if you define it correctly, then the answer must be no. But I mean, already if you have no points at the summit, if you have a compact human. If you have no points at the summit, if you have a compact Hausdorff space, its underlying homotopy type is not finite or compact. So this thing might not exist, and then you need to say something. But I think once all the terms make sense, then it's also correct. So that's the thing. And if X is a topological manifold, then this dualizing complex also has a very simple description, namely it is the normal bundle. Description, namely it is the normal bundle of the map. Then this is j of mu x, where j for me will be the map from k top to. I guess this is always a problem, the topological J-homorphism. Like the spectrum, I mean, before this sits KO, right? And somehow the normal bundle of a topological, our smooth manifold. Bundle of a topological of a smooth manifold would be classified by Map2KO by calling this, in this context, calling this topological K-theory smooth K-theory. So, I mean, this is as a space that is Z cross Bg, this is Z cross B top, and this is Z cross B O, but the smooth part will not play a role in my talk. So I'll just call this thing in the J. Clear? All right. And with all these things assembled, I can state a theorem. And then we're going to have some fun with it. So this theorem is due to Fair enough, sometime in the 80s. Let me just check whether I wanted to say something before this. Sure. That if you have a homology manifold, then well they say that there exists a canonical. A canonical, and I don't quite know what that means, but maybe quote the theorem accurately put it there. A canonical map from sing x to k top, might then think of as the normal bundle, such that j of e As such that J of E is D of Z. Or in other words, the spherical vibration that, so this thing, if you have a conqueror radiality space, this thing, I mean, it's a stable spherical vibration, and then it's called the spivach vibration. And this says that the spivach vibration of a homology manifold always comes from a topological bundle. That's obviously true for manifold, obviously, but that is definitely true for manifold. But that is definitely true for manifolds, where it's just you take the stable normal level of the manifold. But they claimed it's always true for every homology worth, whatever canonical here might possibly mean. And let me call this statement A before I forget. Because of the board space, we'll need to erase it, but I will need to refer back to it. So I'll call it A. We claim this is false. Can I ask, is this true for this suspension of a homotopy? Yes, there it's easy because the homotopy type, if you take a Z-sphere and you suspend it, the homotopy type of the result is actually a sphere. It's a simply connected manifold whose homology is that of the sphere in the next dimension. And the canonical is not far. The canonical has no meaning as far as I can discern. So I wouldn't. I mean, the Spigah fibre. I mean, the spivak vibration in that case is trivial, so you can take the trivial top bundle. It doesn't get more canonical, but you know. Yes. So, I mean, as I said, erase this. I mean, I claim the thing doesn't exist at all. So, I don't know what it could possibly mean for it to canonically exist. Okay, statement clear? That's what I'll try the rest of the talk explaining. Well, I'll now try for 20 minutes to explain why you might care, and then my 20 minutes. Why you might care, and then my 20 minutes how you make it go away. Okay. So, is there like a statement like lips should correspond to like, I don't want to say smoothie. I'll write exactly that down in the like ha section. Okay. Yeah, because it's fun to control. Yeah, because it's fun to confuse oneself about these things and but I put that here, why care? I mean in particular I mean this is a very good question because I mean I haven't given you an interesting example of this thing and I can't. So why couldn't possibly care? First answer is by authority. So I got into this because Schwerze came to, well I mean when Marcus and I were still in Bonn, he came to my office and Marcus was around and told us like I can define in the world of diamonds I can define in the world of diamonds something like homology manifolds, but I can't define actual manifolds. And so I wonder how bad can these be. One of his goals in life is to transfer results between the reals and the pedic numbers. So he was wondering how does the real case look? We didn't know. We started looking into this, into the theory of these things. That's as far as we got. And then, okay. Now we don't know anymore. The reason he's sort of interested in, analog exists in other contexts. Analog exists in other contexts. Other contexts where manifolds don't. So maybe by comparing these two, you can get a sense for what happens in these other contexts. But I have no other context. Other people do. That's the first thing. The second thing is the famous missing manifolds problem, which I will. Which I will spend some time after this. So see about this in the next 10 minutes. And now to address the question, if you recall that somehow smooth structures on a top manifold M correspond one to one, I mean not to concordant correspond one to one to lifts of the topological tangent bundle. Motomatophyte. Oh, no, no, K top. K top to KO. Thank you. Absolutely. Thanks. Right, so the precise structure that the normal model has controls much about the regularity of your manifold. So it's a little bit surprising that these things. Of your manifold. So it's a little bit surprising that these things which locally have absolutely no regularity, their tangent model looks like a topological manifold always. Would have been very surprising. Does that answer your... Was that sort of the thing you were looking for? The second statement is the version that I accidentally wrote here. So if you just have a Poincaré complex that lifts from pig S to K top. Mod equivalents, they correspond to degree one normal maps. So if everything is oriented and they correspond to degree one maps, so M the topological manifold, degree one map to X, and the factorization of the Of the dualizing complex through J is the normal bundle. Am I saying this correctly? No. Normal bundle. Normal bundle here. K-top here. Met existence. This is not bottom. I really don't want to kneel, but why are you so small? Small that the board can't be a meter up. Okay. Is this visible? Like a topological manifold together with a degree one map to X and a lift or a factorization of the normal bundle of the manifold through X. Like a topological bundle of X that pulls back to the normal bundle. These things are one-to-one correspondent for a general Poincare complex, or maybe So, in particular, this would have given you a manifold mapping to the homology manifold. And that's somehow how you get started on the classification theory of these things. Used to get started. Okay, that's somehow these things make the, would have made this surprising. That's sort of what I want to want to highlight here. That I don't really. That's like you don't really. It sounds like a fishy statement or an amazing statement. And I talked about it in Copenhagen last week, and Eve came to me and said, Ah, this was the only result about homology manifolds I ever liked. It was very friendly. Just playing with the music. No. Yeah, well, thank you. Well, thank you. Like a microphone. And then there's a conjecture, which I learned on Monday. It's actually due to small, that homology manifolds, this is just me trying to sort of paint the general picture, homology manifolds with something called the DDP disk joint discs property are homogeneous. I'll explain what this is in a second. In a second? Sounded like it. Thank you. God, now we can't ask anymore. Yeah, homology manifolds with the distraction disk property are homogeneous spaces. So in particular, they have a local model. So this would mean you would expect a tangent bundle. With structure group the homeomorphisms of the local model. Homogeneous means that, I mean, the homeomorphism group acts transitively, so locally around every point these things have to look the same. And that's how if you extract what tangent bundles of manifolds look like, it should be that you have a tangent bundle whose structure group is homeos of this local model. But nobody has ever seen a local model. But nobody has ever seen a local model, like which is very strange. Nobody knows any homogeneous example of a homology manifold as far as I know. They can prove that they exist, but nobody can write one down. Are there a ton of manifolds? Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. Never seeing one of those. Yes. Okay, but this is also in very stark philosophical contrast somehow to the theorem before, which said there's always like these stably, there's always an R N bundle there. There's always an Rn bundle there. But the local model very much cannot be Rn unless you're. So, what's the DDP? That's a bit of a weird condition. Even Schmuel agrees that it's certainly not the right one. DDP means that for every two maps or embeddings from a, sorry, embeddings from a two disk into X, means every F. Means every F and G can be homotoped apart instantly. It can be isotoped apart instantly. Isotoped apart instantly. So, for example, they like to put a metric on X, and then it means in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of F and G, you find F prime and G prime whose images are disjoint. One way of putting it, maybe that's the best way of putting it, but it depends on the metric on X. Right, it's weird because this fails for four manifolds. And three manifolds, and two manifolds, and one manifolds, and right, so this somehow combines, it's a very weak form of transversality, and the dimension condition that dimension is larger than five, right? For topological manifolds of dimension five as well, have this, it's called transversality. It's a very weak version, but it somehow simultaneously encodes the dimension. Encodes dimension condition, which I mean, how bizarre. But anyway, and the example is: so SM does not have this. So if you take the suspension of a Z-sphere, it does not have this. That's a fun exercise to work out. You can take both of these to be the, like pick a non-trivial loop in M, unless it's a, it does not have the DDP, unless M is the actual sphere. Otherwise, it has to have fundamental groups. Actual sphere. Otherwise, it has to have a fundamental group. So pick a non-trivial loop, embed it in M, and then cone it off. Take both F and G to be that cone. Those are embedded two disks, and I'll wonder why you can't do this. I always get confused every time I do this talk, so I'm not going to try and say it. You keep saying you can't give us examples, but does this proof, the non-existence of this theorem that used to exist imply that it was also. As far as I can tell at the moment, it implies exactly nothing except that everything is open again. It implies exactly that there are... I mean, we can't even give you a concrete example, as I will ask me again at the end if you're the logic situation is slightly convoluted. And therefore if I try to unravel it now before I actually state the things. Unravel it now before I actually state of things. A little bit weird. Okay, so right. You would ideally want to have lots of these DDP homology manifolds. They should all be homogeneous. Then the local models would be some cool infinite family of evil twins to our end, or evil siblings. And somehow also the interest in homology manifolds, to some extent, I think, depends To some extent, I think, depends strongly on whether these things are true. Like, if they're completely random spaces about which you can say almost nothing, oh well. If these things are true, then clearly they're a fundamental thing of nature that has to be studied. A little unclear where the world actually falls. Okay, so that was a bit about this, and now I wanted to talk about the missing manifold problem, because that will actually lead to the way we build the counterexample. And this will And this will require some setup. So, for one moment, just to make contact with the sort of preparatory lectures that existed, let me just write down the surgery stocks. We call the surgery sequence. And then I will modify it twice. Maybe uh so what's that about? As usual, cut is either stiff or top. I will mostly be talking about the top case, but I cannot resist stating it in general. I cannot resist stating it in general. An axis-oriented PD. Then it's a Fiverr sequence that has three terms, as I guess every Fiber sequence does. It's these three. Let me try to very vaguely define them. Define them. This is the realization of the simplicial set of block homotopy equivalences. So this consists of n, the topological manifold, n n, plus a homotopy equivalence to x cross delta n. But you may object that x cross delta n is just x because I'm in homotopy land, but as an add, it's not. If you don't know what an add is, that somehow is. If you don't know what an add is, that somehow a zero add is a closed manifold. A one add is supposed to be something like a border, but something like one add of manifolds is exactly a border. Breathe. And two add is three closed manifolds, three cobordisms between them, and a null border new blue in the middle. You can hopefully do four adds and higher things themselves. So that's the block structure space. Then there's the normal Bolton space. Normal politeness, yeah, it's not topological, it's a Kapner Police position. This is the realization of the simplicial space where the set is, whether the thing you put in is the things I erased. So it's a manifold, let me write this all out again, it's a manifold with a map to x cross delta n and a lift of the tangent bundle of the manifold. Like this. Like this? Top is again. Top is again cut. Cut diff is KO. So that's that thing. And the final thing is this is the realization of the simplicial space of, I guess I should just write Pawn Carey and add. In functors from phases of Poincaré and in functors from x to dz and then take compact opinions on the outside. Let me just leave it at that point array of dimension. Yeah, let me just leave it at this level of detail. Okay, those are precisely the L spectra that Wolfgang was talking about when you put a certain Pokemon array structure on this thing. Put a certain Pomp array structure on this thing. Is there a reason for speaking to the oil? No, then I have to talk about twistings, and in a moment I will want to reformulate this, and then there's twistings, and I don't want it to be there. Okay, so I hope many people here have known this sequence longer than I've been alive, and maybe not anymore, actually. But I want it to be that this is how you classify manifolds. And then, one way, I guess. What does Marco say? What does Marco say? The homotopy theorists. I've just come up with another one for bypassing this. So the point is if you speak in a point and cut this top, this thing is contractible. That's roughly the Poincare conjecture. Yeah, squeak your eyes a little bit. That's manifolds, some are homotopy equivalent to disks, and there's only one, if you're topological. But that implies that, ah, right, I'm just missing a theorem. Let me add that first here. It's the theorem of Sullivan that this space, that's the sort of completed version of the thing I just wrote down on my note earlier. This space is the same as lifts now in the full-blown as a space, it's lifts along the J homomorphism to K. That's great theorem of Sullivan. So if you stick in a point, the space of lift here is just the fiber of, in this case, K top mod pick S. So that's G mod top. That says this term is contractible. That says this term is contractible, so this is equal to this. That one is just G mod top. And well, this is quadratic L-theory of a point. What we learned from this is G mod top is loops to infinity zero of quadratic L-theory of a point. Okay, now you can stick this back in. This term is therefore also described by something L theoretic. If x, let's say it's a manifold itself, then that you have a Then that you have a canonical lift like this. So then the space of lifts is identified with maps into the final. So it's identified with maps into G Montop. So it's identified with maps into loops infinity zero quadratic L-theory. So in that topological category, both these terms have an identification in terms of L-theory. And of course, then you wonder how do you describe the entire thing L-theoretically. And that's what Rynitsky did. Rynitsky used this. I mean, a great elaboration of this. To describe the entire surgery sequence completely in terms of L-theory, namely he proved that topological structure space of a Poincaré complex sits inside the fiber. The problem is somehow, you can't quite say this in terms of quadratic L-theory. So for example, this thing might just be empty. So, for example, this thing might just be empty. There might not be such a thing. And if you want to give some good formulation, that's a sort of not. I mean, in that case, you can't really say it in terms of maps into quadratic L-theory, because X will map, but you have no lift. And so you have to turn this statement around a little bit, and the change that occurs is that you switch from quadratic to symmetrical. So what comes up is that this thing now becomes the fiber of x10. Of x tensor, the symmetric L theory to a point, mapping with an assembly map to the visible symmetric L theory of x. And you take this fiber over the dualizing complex tensor z is oriented point array. Of course, in that case, this really is the trivial thing, but oh well. Now, it's this thing, and it's the collection of path components in there. The collection of path components that define a fundamental class. Define a fundamental class. Right? An element. Ah, I need to loop this, right? Same mistake I made. Same statement. That's correct. So a point in this spectrum is a D dimension D L theory homotopy. You require this to be okay. So feast your eyes a little more. That's Feast theorize a little more. That's a wonderful theorem. It simultaneously encodes when is there a topological manifold? That's traditionally called the toposurgery obstruction. That's the question, does there exist a lift to a fundamental class of this canonical object that has dualities that live in here? And then if it exists, then it turns out that the fiber of this assembly map, I mean, is the same as the fiber of this map. It also mutes dualism. Except that, yes. Except that, yes, I forgot the decisive point. I have to take the connect t. No, no, I have to do nothing. No, no, no, sorry. Almost good, almost good. I said fundamental problems. What's your complaint? Well, that it might be a you said the space of lifts. Ah, okay, yes. I'm not making a mistake in the. Don't you need a dimension restriction to get consequences that I said in the very beginning is enforced throughout the whole talk. Yes. You need stricter enforcement. Okay, so that's the theorem. And I mean, you can't quite deal with only symmetric forms here. You have to be able. You have to be able to actually see them. That's what the visiblest form. I don't want to get into sort of technical thing that you can't quite work with ordinary symmetric forms. You have to make a slightly finer one of these prompt array structures to formulate this. Okay, but here's the thing. Markus has said this, Wolfgang has said this. Uh L spectra are four periodic at least all the ones that appear here. At least all the ones that appear here. So, what you learn from this is the top structure set is almost for periodic away from pi zero. Because somehow we're not taking all path components of the fiber here, so there's something missing in pi 0. That was called the missing manifolds problem. Originally, this had been announced by Zeeman. This has been announced by Seemman, I think, as a theorem that is always for periodic. And Mark Powell has told me that Andrew once forced everybody at Oberwofach at some meeting to sing I've made a mistake when they discovered this. That must have been some sight. Don't before my time. At any rate, so yeah, is it clear why this is called the missing manifolds problem? You sort of have a four-periodic thing and there's stuff missing at pi zero. And so Capelle made the conjecture that, well, maybe that stuff is not. That, well, maybe that stuff is not manifold, but homology manifolds. They sort of fill in for the missing manifolds that this predicts should be there in PyMod. So that was a long-standing conjecture that was finally resolved by Brian Ferry Meo Weinberger. I don't want to write all this again. Let me just move it here. Again, let me just move it here. So they showed, and this was somehow in the 90s, that if you take the homology structure set, homology manifold structure set here, then you can just erase these constants. Okay, so that precisely sort of puts back the missing manifolds. Let me call this B. So what is Axel selling again? Oriented property. I mean there's a version for memory into things, but then Version for non-oriented things, but then the definition is just this isn't a tensor product anymore, it'll be a fiber product over BC2, or tensor over BC2. Take the orientation into account, it works for general things. And the dimension bigger or equal to five or six, I don't remember one of those. Okay, so is that statement also clear, understandable to some extent? You're not assuming X is a reduction of the X. No, they did not. No, no, they did not. I mean, it used to exist always, right? So how could you possibly have to require it? The fun part. Yeah, they didn't invoke A in order to. Ah! So here's the remark. B uses A. I don't know, I think easy. What we prove is not used to writing so few letters. We show that A implies not B. No, what B implies not A. Me show that B implies not A. Okay, so that you will find if you try really hard implies that A is false. Or that there's a mistake in the deduction of A to B, or Craig made the wonderful joke, or you know, it's a very simple thing to now have a third theorem which says we are wrong. So, I mean, if we believe that the proof, the deduction of A, of B. That the proof the deduction of B from A is correct, then I mean A must be false for this. But the counterexample is sort of inexplicit, right? Because you're using an assumption that always works. So the last 10 minutes, I will now try to write down what the counterexample actually is. Can I ask on Sunday, what did you believe? Sorry? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I should immediately say, I believe in B. I believe in heat. I see no reason not to. It's too beautiful. No reason not to. It's too beautiful to be false somehow. Do I have another reason? No, absolutely not. The proof of A, if you look at it, is I'm on record, so it's slightly wrong. Let me leave it at that. I mean, there's a clear point. I mean, so much slow. Imagine I looked at it, couldn't make heads of tails of it. It seems like the argument is basically locally true, therefore it's globally true. But I mean, that way you prove that everything's trivial anyway. But Schmool explained to me. But Schmuel explained to us a way of reading the proof where the mistake is that this thing does not split off its zero Posnikov translation. This thing does not split off its pi zero as a, I mean splits it off as a space, but not as an intimidate loop space, and they small fucked it up somewhere in the proof. But they hide this very well, that they're using this. Okay. One should maybe also say that Schumer at least claims that they have. Claims that they have yes, that's also a good point. Yes, so Schmu claims so Weinberger says, I mean, so Weinberger has written now in a ratum sent into the archive. I mean, it's not with claiming this is false, we've convinced Schmuel, Schmuel has convinced Ferry, and I think he's also told us what the status with the others. But we're in contact with Schmuel, he sort of immediately believed this and has somehow convinced the others in this that there's a mistake there. And Weinberger says that proof still works. Proof still works, reproof still works if X has a top reduction. Okay. I do not understand that it yeah, and he also claims it also works in some situations where you don't have a ray of sound. Yeah, but I don't. I mean, I don't even know what the situation is, so I'm not trying to say. So he doesn't believe in B either. Well, he believes in B. He believes in B. Well, he believes it. He believes it B. He says that the proof as they have it, if you just insert the assumptions at the beginning of the paper, we only consider Pompey complexes which have a top reduction, then it works. But I have literally no comment on this whatsoever. I haven't looked at the proof of this in any capacity. It doesn't say they repaired the proof without using A. So Schmoul has some ideas for how he thinks he can make this work again, but I think also fairly confidently says he's not going to. I think also fairly confidently says he's not going to write it within the next you have to ask him. I'm not in the business of repairing this for the moment. I don't want to be confused with a phosphor good. Okay, so I guess I now have five minutes to explain the counter example. So it's not very complicated. I mean there's I mean, there's somehow the thing that goes in is a thing I will not explain, but somehow a good understanding of the L theory spectra that evolves like homotopically how they behave. And I guess that sort of arose through this Nynofa collaboration for some of us. And with the results that could this all look like this, we went to Michel and he immediately said, yeah, that all looks good to me. And now, can't you make an example like that? So that's how it all fits together. Um so here's the the counterexample today um namely you start let me just generally start with an element alpha in uh the stable stems uh with n alpha uh n alpha or maybe I'll just write bg here to make it unstable immediately. Ustable immediately with n alpha equals zero. And it's probably bad. K alpha equals zero. So we have a map from the sphere to BG. And because chi alpha is zero, for example, let's say this element has limited degree n, because chi alpha is zero, we can mod out k and make it a map out of the k, the mod k mu space. I mean that map is not uniquely determined by alpha, but it certain exists. Not uniquely determined by alpha, but it certainly exists. Then we can take a framed manifold such that this is more than a 2k equivalence, 2k plus 1 or something, to n. Like you just fashion a manifold with a map to this space where the manifold has more than, I mean, for safety purposes, let me just raise this so I don't have to think about the numbers, but where this is below the middle dimension. Like, you can realize an outer complex as a manifold. Like, you can realize an arbitrary complex as a manifold as long as you stay away from the middle of it. Fragment is closed. M is closed, yeah. Closed and fragmented. So now you look at this, and this map for large enough D, or D, yeah, D is good. For large enough D, this will factor through EGD. I guess D is the dimension L. L large enough. And so you can make a And so you can make a, so this carries an SL bundle or an SL vibration over it, you pull it back, you get some E with fiber SL. And the theorems we prove is if, so the real thing we have to work with is if n is, if k is odd, then first of all, this is a framed manifold. So, this is a framed manifold. This is a Pompe array complex. I hope we can all agree on that. So, there's a two out of three for Pompe array complexes, just by the session sequence. So, this is a Pompe array complex. The statement is then there is a homology manifold manifold. Homos of the equivalent to B. Hey, I've given up on the zinc, in case you hadn't noticed. And how do we do this? Well, And how do we do this? Well, for D large enough. I mean, you might have to choose, for L large enough, you might have to choose L even larger than the dimension that you can realize this. You pick some very, very large L, and then eventually this becomes realizable by yourself. That's the statement. How do you make this? Well, you stick it in here, you produce a lift here. So that really uses D. We say nothing about any geometric. We say nothing about any geometric constructions, we just show that this thing can be made so that you can find the lift of its tautological class here to this thing. So that's more or less a computation. And then the second statement is you can choose these things so that they don't admit top reductions. So that's one, I guess. And two, choose alpha so that this does not emit the top reduction. Namely, and that's a fairly standard way, I guess, of making Pokemon complexes that do not emit hop reductions. Let me just give one example, but it will be clear that it's a fairly generic one. E.g. pick alpha is the map from, I mean, the three torsion generator. The three tor I mean, so the three torsion in pi four of this, which is lemma 24. Then this applies. And so we can then do this in the dualizing complex of E, I mean, because this manifold is. I mean, because this manifold is framed, the dualizing complex of this thing is, well, it has this usual formula. You take the vertical dualizing complex along the finest, so the vertical dualizing complex of the map, and then you add the thing coming from the base. The thing coming from the base is trivial, so it's just the vertical dualizing complex of this. But, I mean, the dualizing complex of a sphere bundle is just the pullback of the sphere bundle to its total space. So if I just give this. Space. So if I just give this map a name, it's the pullback of this original thing. So how do I call this? It is already there. It's just a composite from each of the G side. Yes. So I need to give it a name. Psi. And then this is just psi. But now pi 4 of b top is zen, and now look at And now look at what if we try to factor this map through B top, I mean it's just what's pi 4 of this space. I mean this has pi 4 z mod k or z mod 3 in this case. We've made this to be a big equivalent, so this also has z mod 3, and this is a high-dimensional sphere bundle. So pi 3, pi 4 of this will just be z mod 3. And I mean factoring the identity map from z mod 3 to z mod 3 through the z Three through the Z, it's going to be problematic. That thing actually Z plus E mode. Ah, that may. It has no three torsion is the point. Yes. Does somebody know by heart? I fall. Okay. And like pi 4 of E. I mean, that's the end of the talk. Let me just write this down. That's the end of the talk. Let me just write this down. Pi 4 of E, 2π4 of E top to pi pi 4 of BG, which is the mod 24. I mean, this cannot exist. That's how. You have no direct argument to say that this is not is a homology. Absolutely. Except to involve these. Yes, right. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely we don't. Could there possibly be another? Could there also be a power or something? No. Yes. Yeah, yeah. So apparently the logic situation is a little bit screwy. But I mean, I think we have this strong belief. And so Schmoo claims, this is maybe the comment Marcus was trying to make in the middle. Schmoo claims that you can, this theorem you can salvage not just in the case, I mean the proof, you can salvage not just in the case where Sell, which is not just in the case where x has a top reduction, which clearly doesn't apply here, that's the whole point, but you can also apply it when x has what's called a two-patch structure. And this thing will have a two-patch structure. So if that claim of Schmool's is correct, that will make this counterexample unconditional. But, I mean. Which is why you wrote counterexample to A rather than. Yes. The end. Questions? To what extent can I melt away on your work with the nine author paper and just try to? 97%. It's almost no 9. I mean, it depends a little bit on. And you will not find it formula. And you will not find it formulated this way in the paper by Brian Ferrinio and Weinberger. I guess this formulation will be the one that... The construction of this arrow will depend on stuff we do in my mind. I think in their mind it does not, because otherwise how could they possibly have proven this theorem? So I think formally the answer is not at all, but the account in our language becomes much clearer. The account in our language becomes much clearer, I think. But I think this is all very classical. It's just, you need to know, I mean, in this theorem that if k is odd, you can produce such a lift. You need to know about the homotopy types of this thing. And again, you can go through the literature and collect these data. Just reprove these things. Could you say a few sentences about what goes into doing what? Yes. I mean, if I can get it together, I can just prove it. If I can get it together, I can just prove it in a few sentences. But you need to know a couple of facts. So, the first thing is because the files are simply connected and this thing will have a section if you choose L large enough, you don't actually need to lift this class. You can lift this class in normal L theory. That's essentially the pi-pi theorem. So you map this to the normal terms, then yeah, I mean, maybe let me just leave that like that probably. I mean, just leave that like that problem. I mean, it's because these relative terms then, in quadratic L theory, you'll just get an isomorphism with a Peppy theorem. So lifting this would be the same as lifting down here, but down here the map is an isomorphism, so you only need to lift it here. So you need to lift from X tensor LS, I mean there is a canonical fundamental class in X tensor normal L theory of a point, you need to lift it to here, to some class there. And then the statement is, how do I say this definitely? How do I say this, the simplest? Because this thing is oriented, the normal L-theory bundle will actually be. Can I do it in private with a piece of paper, not on the board? But I think will. Yeah. I can, but yeah. It requires writing a couple of things down. More questions before we? We'll take a five-minute break and then continue. Five-minute break. Five-minute break. Whether that works with this. I mean, I wouldn't know how to tell if nobody has anything. I would not be able to tell whether anything is an homology manifold unless you either give me a topological space on which I can check this which nobody knows how to make one thing or this thing. I know no way of how do you check. Yeah, yeah, okay. I mean, you're saying this is explicit. So you're saying this is explicit. You just try to start the question. This class is only defined as a homotopy. So that homotopy will change the homeomorphism type of the process. When you're asking, is there a homotopy class of maps such as? Map such that the holy morphism type of result isn't volume. That's going to be a nightmare.
