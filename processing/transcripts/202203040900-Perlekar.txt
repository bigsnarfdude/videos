Good morning, or good morning, everyone, depending upon from where you are, where you are presently. So, what I'm going to talk about is turbulence modulation in buoyancy-driven bubbly flows. This is going to be slightly different than what has been discussed yesterday or day before, where people talked about homogeneous isotropic turbulence. What I'm going to talk about would have features which might resemble homogeneous isotropic turbulence or might have similarities. Or might have similarities with homogeneous isotropic turbulence, but we will see as we go along what are the differences. And so, whatever I'm going to talk about is a work which was done in collaboration with Vikash, who was a graduate student at our institute, and Dhruba, whom many of you know from Norway. So, let's go ahead. So, what is the system that I'm interested in? The system is very simple. There's an experimental setup in Detlepscrook where you have a large tank. Group where you have a large tank, the bubbles are rising through the tank, and as they rise, they stir the fluid. So, you can think of it as instead of a standard way to generate turbulence, where you have a grid and you have a flow past the grid. Here you have Lagrangian particles which are large enough. And as they move along, they generate weights, and these weights interact with each other to generate turbulence. Of course, you can also on top of it impose a large-scale Of it impose a large-scale steering. So, the typical length scales that are present in the system is that if you have a large-scale steering that acts at around 50 to 70 millimeters, the diameter of the bubble is 2 to 5 millimeters. So there is a scale of order 10 separation between the large scale cisterning, if it's present, and the bubble diameter. And then the dissipation range or the Kolmogarov scale appears around 0.4 to 0.2 millimeter. Appears around 0.4 to 0.2 millimeters. So these bubbles are big. These are not passive, you cannot approximate them as passive particles or small inertial particles. They indeed act back on the fluid, they deform. And the Reynolds numbers in these experiments are quite manageable between 160 to 300. So the non-dimensional numbers, because you are talking of bubbles as they are going through the system, are the Reynolds number, the Galilee number, which is the ratio of buoyancy to visceral. Which is the ratio of buoyancy to viscous dissipation, the bond number, which gives you an idea of how deformable this Lagrangian particle is going to be. It's the ratio of buoyancy to surface tension. The Artwood number, which characterizes the density difference. For what I'm going to talk about today, this B parameter is going to be infinity, so let's not worry about it. So we will think of the system where there is no large-scale driving, you have only bubbles, which are You have only bubbles which are moving through the fluid, and as they move along, they generate some flows. And what is the problem? The problem is to understand how do we characterize this flow. Is it same as homogeneous isotropic turbulence or is it something different? So of course I'm going to look at it numerically using standard techniques of pseudo-spectral methods and bubbles would be fully resolved. And so let me not spend time on that. Let me go over to the Time on that, let me go over to the interesting part, which is the results. So, one thing which I would like to point out is: in most of the experiments, the Galilee number, which is equivalent of Reynolds number here, is around 200 to 1000. Because one typically works with air bubbles in water, the Artwood number, which is the density contrast, is very large. It's close to one. The bond numbers are between one to five, and the volume fraction of the bubbles is fairly small. It's around two percent. Fairly small, it's around two percent. So it's small enough that you can ignore, for all practical purposes, uh, inter-bubble interactions. That is, the bubbles don't collide with each other. So there is no, you can completely ignore coalescence and breakup processes. So what is the question? Well, there were experiments on this system because the setup itself is very relevant for variety of industrial processes. And what they found out was very interesting. Was very interesting that for scales which are smaller than the bubble diameter, one observes a k raised to minus three scaling. Okay, so there is they don't observe minus five-thirds scaling. Instead, they observed a k raised to minus three scaling, and they call this as pseudoturbulence. And how did they argue that why you should observe k raised to minus three scaling? The answer was that, well, you see, as the bubbles are rising. As the bubbles are rising, they generate waves. The waves are dissipated in the proximity of the bubbles themselves. So there is no mechanism like a cascade. You instantaneously dissipate whatever the waves that are generated. And therefore, from dimensional arguments, you would expect that the energy production is proportional to energy dissipated in the wakes times K inverse. When you balance it with viscous dissipation, you get K inverse. Balance it with viscous dissipation, you get k raised to minus 3 scaling. So the argument is good, seems to agree with experiment. The question is whether it's true. Right? So we went ahead and started to do these experiment, do these or address this question numerically. And so the first thing we asked ourselves is: let's look at the dynamics of a single bump, right? And well, the things are quite complicated here, depending upon the Galilee number and the Atwood number. Number and the output number, which is a density contrast, you get different, you know, as the bubble is rising under buoyancy, the wave structure is very different, the trajectory of the bubble is very different. And so the first question we had in our head was that, well, does the bubble dynamics depends on the outfort number? So, you know, if you want to reproduce or check the experiment, should I do simulations at very large outfit number in systems which are numerically very inaccessible or low outfit number? Or low outward number would be all right. So, what we did was, as a check, we did simulations with multiple bubbles. Remember, for a single bubble, the wave structure is very different. But when you look at multiple bubbles, as it happens in a variety of physics systems, that when you have a collective behavior, somehow things start to look much more similar. And that's what we observed. And we said, all right, it looks the same, but then is it true that the art? But then, is it true that the output number dependence is not so relevant? One can just do low output number, high Galilee simulations to tell also what is going to happen at a fixed Galilee and high output number. So, the first thing we did was to look at the energy budget. And what we found, which is quite interesting, is that although surface tension is present, it's a mechanism by which you can either absorb the energy or come back the energy. The energy or come back the energy into the fluid. It does not do any work in the steady state. So, what we found out is that whatever is the energy dissipated in the fluid is same as the energy injected. So, that's very good. But this is in the statistically steady state, not instantaneously. But then we said, all right, let's go ahead. Let's first ask what the experiments found. The experiments claim that whatever is the energy dissipated. Whatever is the energy dissipated, it's mostly dissipated near the wakes. So, what we evaluated was the viscous dissipation. We also looked at the energy dissipated in the wakes through an approximation, which is what is used in the experiments, and compared it with energy injection. And again, we found consistent with the experiments that most of the energy that is injected in the vicinity of the bubbles through wakes is indeed dissipated off. So, that's very good. We are still consistent with experiments. We are still consistent with experiments. Then came the next question: that for the arguments that the non-linear terms are not relevant, the way experiments argue was that the time scale of energy production because of buoyancy is larger than the time scale of viscous dissipation, but the time scale of non-linear transfers is going to be way higher than any of these time scales, so it's not relevant. On the other hand, when we looked at numbers from our simulations, we found Numbers from our simulations, we found that the time scale of non-linear transfer at larger Galileo-Reynolds number is comparable to the time scale of energy production. So, most probably it cannot be ignored. And so there was one more reason to revisit the said question. Well, if that was the case, then we've said, okay, let's go one step ahead. Let's see whether our data on liquid velocity fluctuations agrees with the experiments or not. Agrees with the experiments or not. And quite remarkably, we found out that irrespective of the Artwood number or the Galilee number, the core of the distributions for the horizontal as well as the vertical components of the velocity fluctuations is consistent with the experiments. Of course, you are talking about a buoyancy-driven bubbly flow. So there are more velocity fluctuations in the vertical directions than in comparison to. So they have more upscale. Comparison to. So they have more upscale velocity fluctuations than downscales, which shows up in the vertical velocity fluctuation PDF, which is asymmetric. But remarkably, the X component of the velocity PDF also shows exponential distributions, which is also observed in experiments. And so note that this point, this is very different from standard homogeneous isotropic turbulence, where you would have expected a Gaussian distribution for the velocity. A Gaussian distribution for the velocity fluctuations. So we went ahead and then we looked at the energy spectrum. So, first, we did simulations at low Atwood numbers, and well, consistent with experiments at Galini around 300 to 600, we found even at low outward number, k raised to minus 3 scaling. We also did some high outward number simulations, which were followed by some other simulations by the group of Innocenti and others, which were at much higher output number of 0.99. much higher output number of 0.99 and with exactly the same parameters as the experiments and they again found exactly as what we had found energy spectrum which is k raised to minus three actually their spectrum overlays on our spectrum we also did one more thing we looked at the time series of the signal and evaluated the frequency spectrum and compared it with the frequency spectrum of uh obtained from the group of deathlef and again you find that you know the data is on top of each other That you know, the data is on top of each other, so that was very good news. That we are able to reproduce most of the characteristics that are observed in experiments. So, we are now ready to ask the question whether this is just laminar kind of dynamics, where most of the energy that is injected by buoyancy is dissipated by viscosity, and that gives rise to k raised to minus 3 scale. So, to do that, we did the standard scale-by-scale energy budget analysis, which Scale energy budget analysis, which everyone in this room is aware of. And so you have the non-linear transfer. Of course, because we have a surface tension term, you also have a contribution because of the surface tension, which is on the left. So you have non-linear transfer plus transfers due to surface tension should be balancing viscous dissipation plus energy injected because of buoyancy. Their last term was because of steering, but in present case, there is no external steering, so ignore the last term. Didn't so ignore the last term. So, what you have then is a very simple balance that if there is a non-linear transfer, you would have pi k plus if there is a transfer because of surface tension, you would have fk sigma should be balancing the energy injected by buoyancy plus the viscous dissipation, whatever there is. Now, if we had to go ahead with the arguments of Lance and Bhattar, the left-hand side over here, pi k plus fk sigma should be equal to zero. Fk sigma should be equal to zero, you should have fg of k is equal to dk. So let's see if it's true. Well, it turns out that it's not true. What we find, and which is also one would expect, is that most of the energy is injected around the bubble scales. So this is a cumulative plot, of course. So most of the energy, which is the green curve, is energy injected because of buoyancy. It saturates around the bubble diameter. Bubble diameter. You have viscous dissipation which acts at smaller scales. But interestingly, both the transfer mechanism, the non-linear transfer mechanism, because of the fluid non-linearity, as well as the energy transfer due to surface tension are active at large Galilean number. And if you actually look at net production, it's happening because of both the non-linear transfer and the transfers in energy. And the transfers in energy due to surface tension. If you add the two, you get the purple curve. And quite remarkably, you see in the Lance and Battalion, they argued that the net production would go like epsilon omega k inverse. So if you look at the cumulative PDF, that should go like log k. And indeed, we find that this purple curve shows a log k scaling. So although Lance and Batal did not think of there would be a transfer because of surface tension from one scale to other scale. From one scale to other scale, it turns out that the dimensional arguments are very robust. So the net production has contributions because of nonlinear terms and surface tension. If you add the two, you get the net production, which still goes like energy dissipated in the waves times K inverse. Of course, this then balances with viscous dissipation to give us a K raised to minus 3 scaling. All right, so that's fantastic. Then you can ask the question, but. Then you can ask the question, but where is the nonlinear flux sitting? So, what we do is because you have the scale-by-scale energy budget, you can plot the nonlinear flux as a function of space. And what you find is that at the front of the bubble, so this is the top panel, is the picture of the bubble slides as you go on increasing the filter scale. So, at very large. So, at very large filter scale, which is slightly larger than the bubble diameter, the bubbles are, of course, not visible, they are getting smeared out. At scales which are slightly smaller than the bubble diameters, the bubbles are clearly visible. At these scales, one can clearly see that at the front of the bubble, the energy is transferred from large scales to small scales, whereas at the back, there is both upscale and the downscale transfer in the wake region. Downscale transfer in the wake region. Of course, these wake interact with each other such that the net transfer or the net flux, which is sum of everything, is still positive. As you go on increasing the filter scale, you find that the front and back starts to get more and more symmetric. I mean, then, you know, at large enough scales, you would expect that the flux would go to zero and these things would become completely symmetric. Symmetric. And indeed, this symmetric structure is very reminiscent of what happens if you just take a Stokesian kind of a flow, which is a Hadamard solution for a isolated bubble rising under due to gravity. What you find is there again, a similar structure appears. And the net flux, of course, in this case, this is Stokesian, is of course identically zero. So as we are going to larger and larger scales, Larger and larger scales, the near-vescitinity of the bubble is remarkably similar to what you find in a Stokesian flow. So, the large scale, very large-scale structures resemble a Stokesian flow in the system. So, then let me go ahead and let me ask the question, what happens if you go beyond experiments? And when I ask, say beyond experiments, I mean Galilee, which are much larger than what has been achieved in experiment, Galilee, larger than. An experiment, Galilee larger than thousand. So we did then a systematic set of simulations, increased Galilee way ahead from 300 to 600 to 1029 to as large as 2057. And of course, as we went ahead, we had to perform some of the largest simulations. So at 2057 Galilee, the box size itself was 2048 cube. And the bubble constituted of close to 200 grid points across bubble diameter. So these were very high. Diameter. So these were very high and very well-resolved simulations. What you find quite remarkably is that even from the picture, the wakes of the bubbles are very turbulent. If I had removed the bubble from here and if I had just shown you the snapshot, you would have said, ah, this is a snapshot of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. So now the question is, would you expect a minus 5/3 spectrum in the energy? Is the pseudo-turbulence washed? Is the pseudo-turbulence washed away? Would you have a transition from k raised to minus 3 scaling continuously to k raised to minus 5/3 scaling? Now, so before we go ahead and ask what's happening with the energy spectrum, let's ask ourselves, are the velocity fluctuations changing as I go on increasing the Galilee number? And quite remarkably, what you find is that the statistical statistics, at least the core regions. Statistics, at least the core region of the PDF, is remarkably self-similar, right? Irrespective of what is the Galilee number. Remember, I have increased the Galilee number by an order of magnitude and the core region of PDF is falling on top of each other. Actually, as you go on increasing the Galilee number, the PDF becomes closer and closer. Same is happening for the vertical component of the PDF. So, this would tell you that the single point velocity fluctuates. The single point velocity fluctuations are far away, still far away from what you would expect for homogeneous isotropic turbulence. But if you plot the energy spectra, something remarkable happens. So what I have done as a standard in the theories of turbulence is I have plotted all the spectrum on a single plot. On the x-axis, I plot k psi, where psi now is a length scale which I have evaluated. Scale, which I have evaluated in the spirit of Kalmagarov, assuming that you know there is only not assuming there is only one injection mechanism that is energy injection because of buoyancy and you have viscosity. So the length scale that you can naively think of if there is a five-third, if there is an inertial range and a transfer of energy from bubble scales to some intermediate scale. So then you would expect that this scale would go as new. That this scale would go as nu cube by epsilon g to the power one fourth. So I plot kxi on the horizontal axis, the energy spectrum we scale by nu phi. I mean, this is a standard thing on the vertical axis. You find all the data collapses more or less onto a master curve. And remarkably, what you find is that it's not the pseudo-turbulent scaling is washed away, but a new phi-third energy spectrum scaling appears. Scaling appears, and this scaling appears from scales which is correspond to the bubble diameter or whatever is the largest scale to a scale which corresponds or is closer to k psi. And then after that, you observe another scaling, which is indeed similar to the pseudo-turbulence scaling of minus 3. So now the question is that if you look at the energy budget, would you observe coexistence of Coexistence of both the regimes, that is, at scales which are larger than this size scale, you would observe a constant energy flux because of the non-linear terms. So the nonlinearities become more dominant, whereas the scales which are smaller than psi, you would expect that the viscous dissipation balances the transfer due to the surface tension term. So again, we look at the energy budget. Remember, so let's first look at, so the leftmost. So let's first look at, so the leftmost or figure A is the case where Galilee number is small, close to 300. This is similar to what we had discussed earlier. Most of the energy is injected due to buoyancy. You have in the nonlinear, you have contribution because of nonlinear term as well as the surface tension term. The non-linear contribution and the surface tension contribution are comparable. If you add the two, you get the Add the two, you get the net contribution, which balances viscous dissipation to get k raised to minus three scaling. As we increase the Kalilei number, something remarkable happens. The non-linear transfer starts to become more dominant. Now, you know, we have finite size simulations, so, and moderate Galilee numbers, but it's quite clear that in the left of the dashed line, the non-linear flux is the dominant energy transfer mechanism. Is the dominant energy transfer mechanism in this regime? The viscous dissipation is small. As you go to scales much larger than Kd, the surface tension starts to dominate. And the net production, rather, both surface tension and energy transfer due to non-linear term are present. The net production here balances viscous dissipation to give you, you expect minus three scaling. So in this regime, you already expect presence of both. You already expect presence of both the 5/3rd and minus 3 scaling. And then, if you increase the Galilee number even further, then this contrast becomes very clear. And you indeed observe that for scales which is larger than this dashed line, which corresponds to the sine inverse, you have the non-linear transfer, which is the dominant energy transfer mechanism. Whereas for scales which are smaller than sine inverse, Sinewards, you observe both the non-linear transfer and the energy transfer due to surface tension to be active. Their addition gives you the net production at these scales, which again balances viscous dissipation. And so at these high Galilee numbers, at small scales, right, you still have the minus three scaling and not something which is going down exponentially. So now we have a new kind of turbulence where. Of turbulence where at scales which are satisfied by or which is like a dissipation-like scale, you above that you have a five-third scaling. And for scales below that, you have a minus three scaling. And now it's not at all clear what happens to smaller and smaller scales because the bubbles as they deform would continuously keep on transferring, exchanging energy with the fluid, and this balance of viscous dissipation. This balance of viscous dissipation with surface tension, we expect will go down all the way up to the smallest scales. So, in this particular scenario, we expect that even if you go to small enough scales, you would never see exponentially decaying energy spectrum, E raised to minus k square like spectrum, but rather you will go all the way down with a k raised to minus three scaling. So, that's what we believe or what we think would happen. So, this So, this is where I would conclude. So, in short, what I've shown is that at moderate Galilee number, which is where experiments are, we observe that for scales which are smaller than the bubble diameter or k greater than kd, the energy spectrum shows the minus 3 scaling, which is the standard pseudo-turbulence paradigm. What we found out, which is slightly different than what was earlier issued, is that in this Is that in this regime, the nonlinear transfer is relevant, and the transfers in where you observe minus free scaling appear both because of transfer due to the non-linear term as well as surface tension, which then balances viscous dissipation. At high LED numbers, which is beyond experimental range, but I am very sure that they can do these experiments if they wish. You observe dual both minus pi third which is a turbulence like scaling a columnarum like scaling and for scale smaller than oh this should be k psi you observe a k raised to minus three scaling and we at least from our arguments it looks like that the pseudoturbulence mechanism would give you minus three scaling all the way up to the smallest scale quite interestingly our conclusions do not depend on the density contrast they were quite low On the density contrast, they were quite robust, they are independent of the output number. And so, what's next? And we don't know what we would find. What happens to the statistics of velocity differences? Remember, the flow is anisotropic. We haven't distinguished it into a in-plane SO2 sector. And so, all those things need to be done. What happens when you look at higher moments? Do you start to see multifractal behavior? What do you observe in pseudo-turbulence? What about Lagrange? Pseudo-turbulence? What about Lagrangian statistics of these large bubbles which are moving through the fluid? These are all open questions, and that's the next thing that we would like to address. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Prabhuji. So we have time for questions.
