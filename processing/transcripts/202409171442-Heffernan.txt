Hi everybody, thanks for coming and I just want to thank Rebecca for all the hard work that she's done on organizing this workshop. I am a disease modeler and most of the motivation behind all of my work has to do with quantifying distributions of immunity in populations, but also how your immune response is boosted and decays over time, whether that's decay because your antibodies are waning or because the pathogen is evolving away from your immune response. So, we look a lot at the individual level type of model. We're looking at in-host infection and vaccination and how you gain immunity and how that translates to like if you get infected to transmissibility because your immune system, your initial condition at the time that you're infected is going to affect your viral shedding or your pathogen shedding. It's also going to affect your susceptibility. And then, what we do is we take this information. And then what we do is we take this information from our individual level models and we translate that to look at population distributions of immunity so that we can get distributions that look like this, where these people are totally susceptible, some immunity, more immunity, totally resistant to infection, where different shades can be different subgroups of the strata of the population. So this could be by age, you know, career stage or different types of jobs. Age or different types of jobs, like things. So, this is why age here. But when we're looking at infection and vaccination, we think about individuals being, their immune response kind of being on this conveyor belt. And so you can get infected and get bumped up to here in your immune system status. Your immune system status can decay over time, swimming down the belt. And then you can get a vaccine, which bumps you up to here, and so on. So when we are So, when we are modeling individual-based immunity and population-level immunity, we also then have to consider in this multi-scale model, this feedback system, the behavior of the individuals that have mild, moderate, severe infections. Even if they're not infected, if they have some immunity, is that going to change the behavior of individuals as well? Also, Also, when we're looking at the behavior of the individuals, the individual and the population at large, we need to consider the compliance to public health rules that are being not really enforced because we don't enforce them in a lot of countries or jurisdictions, but that are being recommended. And one of the things that we do as well is we can say, okay, with this, these are the waves of infection that are happening. Of infection that are happening over time, and this is a graph for COVID. But we know how many mild, blue, moderate, yellow, and severe infections are happening in all of the different age groups, and how are those age groups also different in their behavior? And so when we look at models like this, oh, I keep on putting it, this doesn't work. Okay, we have very large models that we consider. And so this is a model for COVID. This is a model for COVID-19. This is with Lauren, who's online, and other authors, where we have mild, moderate, and severe infections. People start out totally susceptible, and there's a probability of mild, moderate, or severe infection depending on your age group. If you have a mild infection, you go to some level of immunity. A moderate takes you to a higher level. And a severe infection takes you to an even higher level. And we consider that there's different levels of shedding coming from these individuals. Levels of shedding within these individuals. You can also be infected if you reside in this level and in this level. And if you look at this one, then you can go to mild, moderate, or severe infection. And the probabilities that you go to mild, moderate, severe are different compared to if you are in this S1 class. We also look at waning immunity, we look at uptake of the vaccines, and the different shades of purple here in the vaccinated class align. In the vaccinated class, align with the shades of purple in terms of your immune system status after infection. So, when we're looking at a model like this, we have to consider then the age structure of the population. And we look at contact structures and how they change over time too, depending on what rules are being recommended in terms of social distancing and masking, work from home, schools being closed, so on. This is a very big model. This is a very big model, lots of parameters. There are actually only a couple of parameters that we weren't able to inform from the literature and other studies and from talking to infectious disease specialists. This is some work that's very similar to the Oxford Stringency Index, but this is work that we did in Canada where we looked at all the different provinces and territories and determined what their stringency level would be for home, work, other and school. And school over time. And so, if you're interested, we publish that and we have that in a publicly accessible database if you want to use that data. Okay, but what we do is we take that large model and we calibrate the model to actual hospitalization data or case report data. And so, here we're assuming that 15% of severe infections are hospitalized. We use that, we calibrate the model to We calibrate the model to the data. The data is either red plus signs. And we smooth the data, calibrate that to the model. And then what we get out of it is this Kappa parameter. This Kappa parameter is a parameter that scales with the public health stringency over time, the changes in the variant of concern, behavior, and so on. Behavior and so on. And you can see that when you're doing the calibration, you can get this way, these waves. So, some things I'll just point out that make sense is that when delta comes into the population, you get this big increase in this parameter kappa, and that's because delta has a higher transmissibility than the previous strain of COVID. Same with Omicron, you get something that comes in when it's below, when this Kappa parameter is less than one. This kappa parameter is less than one, then that really is a reflection of government exercises like contact tracing and testing and how that's changing, but also behavior change in individuals. But it can also be a function of environmental changes that we know also affect the transmissibility of the disease, like the humidity, the weather, and so on. So inside this cap of parameters. So inside this Kappa parameter, we include PPE compliance and relaxation, social distancing compliance and relaxation. Those are related to behavior. These Kappa 3 and Kappa 4 components are testing, raising, contact transmissions. Those are the behavior of the government or the health system. And so we're interested in trying to not just calibrate these things that have to do with population behavior compliance, but also Behavior and compliance, but also government behavior and compliance. And so, this is where we've stopped with this project because we need to know from, or we need to gain knowledge from other people or collaborations from other people on how we should try to tease this Kappa apart into these different components, including the behavior. So, I'd be really happy to talk to people if they have some ideas. And I was really interested in all of the talks from. In all of the talks from this morning, with those different data and the changes of behavior over time, because that could really help you. It's also important to understand when we're modeling behavior, if we're looking at different types of functions that have similar shapes, how they affect the outcomes of public health measures that are going to be important in terms of informing public health mitigation. And so, this is like a simple exercise. And so this is like a simple exercise that we did way back in 2014, where we just put these different functions into our models that are supposed to modify the behavior of the susceptibles and the infectants over time, depending on how many or how high the level of infection is. And you can see from these, no behavior change is the dashed dot, but these functions that we calibrated to be similar in shape and magnitude for Shape and magnitude for the different parameters that we are considering. You can see that the outcomes are quite different. And then, when we put these into a stochastic model where we're looking at the peak magnitude, which will be important for public health mitigation, the peak time, the epidemic end, and the total number of infections. You can see that the variability is going to be quite large where, remember, these functions we've calibrated to be quite similar in shape and magnitude. Similar in shape and magnitude, but the magnitude is different. And when we put it into a stochastic model, we get an even different number, and that's because in deterministic models, we don't consider covariances between populations. But also, the variability that we get in these things is also different. And so, the mathematician in me is: if we're going to consider different functions in our models, we need to understand where. Models, we need to understand really what the difference is in the outcomes that we're also measuring and reporting to public health, or even just the literature for all the people who are reading your papers. Okay, so it's difficult to determine what function is best. There are other ways, of course, to model behavior change, and something that we've looked at is where we have people that have not changed their behavior at all, they move to Behavior at all, they move to some middle level of behavior, and they move up to a full level of behavior change so that they're not going to be infected. These also are going to change their vaccination rates. But behavior can wane over time. And something that we looked at is this is people's reactions to Hurricane Katrina and the news articles over time. And you can see that over time, since the 30th, Time since the hurricane, people are reacting to the news with a less effect because they're getting tired of hearing of it. And so, this is what happens with all disasters, and this is what's going to happen during a pandemic, that we're tired of hearing about it, and we're naturally going to wane our behavior back to our natural behavior. And so, we tried to use this to give us a decay rate of our behavior from S2 to S1. Behavior from S2 to S1 and back to S0. And we used media reports. This is from GFIN, which, Julian, did you mention GFIN? Oh, you haven't talked yet. You talked to me. And so what we got was media report data in many different languages across the world. It's like news poll data. And we used this in English and French to calibrate a model to Canada during the pandemic. During the pandemic of 2009. And just by using this newsfold data and this waning rate, and by using this media to affect the rate of uptake of positive behavior change, we're able to get two waves of 2009H1N1 and similar qualitative outcome to what we observed in Canada. Qualitative, you can see that the axes are not the same in terms of numbers. Axes are not the same in terms of number. So that was just using three levels of behavior. You could imagine that there's many levels of behavior that we should consider. And those levels of behavior should beep through into the exposed class, the infected class, the people who are tested class, the people who are staying home class, the vaccinated class. All these things are going to affect our behavior, plus, our history. Behavior plus our history of our infection and vaccination is going to change our behavior, and who we talk to is going to change our behavior. And so, you could think that this model can get huge. And so something that Ian and I are working on right now with one of our PhD students is looking at continuous social distancing. So, it's like a part of PDE, no longer ODEs. So, we're going moving up and down from zero to one in all of these different classes. But, where Different classes, but where we get stuck is what functions should we be using to move us up and down the social distance. And so we'd be very happy to talk to people who have some intuition on this. And again, the data from this morning I think could be very useful and helpful for this type of modeling exercise that we're here. So if this is. So, this is work in collaboration with lots of different people. These are the funding sources. I'm happy to talk more about and have questions. I just want to remind people that there's a bath biology meeting happening in Edmonton in July. And I hope that people who are close by, even if they're not math biologists, will come in and participate. I can take some questions.
