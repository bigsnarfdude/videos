We talked about uh the effect of elasticity and plasticity on model force meta flows. So hi everyone. Thank you all the organizers for inviting me. So yeah, I'm Matt Crostin from Oyster. So for those of you who don't know Oyster, well So, for those of you who don't know OISTE, well, this is OISTON. So, it's a new graduate university established around 10 years ago in Okinawa, which is a subtropical island of Japan, surrounded by Kurundi. The next phase. And this is my group. There, we mostly study multi-phase turbulent flows from particles, patterns, droplets. But today, I will speak on some turbulent mostly. Turbo mostly, and basically is the flow of an elastom stoplasting fluid in a model product media. I say model product media, but actually is a channel flow in which the walls are away. In the work it's been mostly done by my PhD student Mohamed and in collaboration with Simon Awag and Michen, but also so this is the thermos picture from Ian Samoa Review. So we know what So we know what are elastomics for plastic fluids. So fluids which exhibit at the same time elastic these plastic properties. And this is an interesting movie of a float that could be modelled as elasto-discoplastic fluid. Basically, it's a lens light happening in some light. And you can see that in some part the fluid is. In some parts, the fluid is basically solid, in others, it's probing also in a turbulent light, as you say. And it's interesting to see how far it is derived. So I will not spoken about that here, but it's more like what can be found in applications of flow-through constraint geometry. And there has been a lot of work in the past, so a lot of work has been done on viscopastic fluids, of geometry. Viscoplastic fluids, of gear, more recently with PvP fluids, RMR, for example, and NUPI. So what I want to do in this talk and this project was actually to study the combined effect of elasticity and plasticity. We do this mostly numerical, but then also we have some experiments in which we try to compare the numerical simulations. So what we do, so we solve the full nine-stootz equation, which I put here. So, I put it here with an extra stress thermal gamma, which models the non-Newtonian path, and we model the elastic plastic fluid with the ferometer model. So, there are two models, actually. One which the original one, say, which is simpler. So, we have an elastic modulus, a primer squadroty, and it's just fluid with an additional parameters. And then there is a slightly more recent one in which. A slightly more recent one in which we can also take into account the shared signal properties of the food. The first model is simpler, so it's more easy to get some understanding, but with experiments, the second one is really confused. So this is a schematic of these models, and basically a fluid behaves as a Kelvin-borne elastic solid when the pediatric stress is smaller than the stress fluid. it's just fluid or uh it becomes uh not an almost auto-b fluid when the stress is above the it's just fluid. So it's important to remember that when the fluid is solid-like it's actually an elastic solid so you can add some stresses. So this is the geometry that I'm studying so it's a channel flow where the minimum half width is D and the walls The walls, which are these three lines, are wavy, and actually it's a single photon wave. And the cape introduced two additional geometrical parameters, so the amplitude of this wave, twice the amplitude of this wave, and the length of this wave. So one is, I will call it aspect ratio, so H for T1H, and the other is. For the average, and the other is the wavelength or magnetic wave. On top of these two geometrical properties, we have four dimensional numbers, which comes from the material properties of the fluid. So, we assume the Reynolds number to be sufficiently low to be not important, and we fix the disconfiguration. So, the main parameters that will vary are the Weissmann number and the peak of number. Okay, so before starting, so I will show you also how we validate model for cases. So we consider an EBP fluid, so it's a pluronic PF 0.27. With this fluid, we actually performed a series of credential measurements in the plot. And we extracted the infrared from the the exponent of the shape filling and the floor Exponent of the shape filling and the block consistency index. So it is known that with the Fermi model, it's able to represent it by these solid lines to capture reasonably well G prime and G double prime at I gamma while at low gamma the G double prime is usually common. But anyway in the upper part Upper part, I think, on the right part of this lab is acceptable. And the ED stress can be found in the flow corner, which is the asymptotic part, which we have. So we use this fluid and the microfluidic device with the channel flow. So one is a simple channel flow, which the flat, and another one is the Webby channel, which I just showed you. And we compare the results obtained by a small. Compare the results obtained with our simulations, which are the solid lines, with the one from the experiment. And this gives a reasonable validation for the experimental model. So, with that, we now move to the simulation part, in which we start varying the mingling number and the bicycle number. So, we start from a simple channel flow in which the two walls are flat, which is more easy to understand. So, as you can see, we have to be able to do So, as we increase the finger number, so when we add plasticity to the flow, we move from a puzzle like parabola, the velocity profile, to a profile like this green one, in which we have a plug in the middle with constant velocity, and then we have a stronger shear at the bottom. The effect of the Wasemann number is instead opposite, so as we increase the Wasemann number, the region which is plugged. The region which is planned reduces, and the limit of infinite by the meg number, you can expect the recovery of the possible profile. This is from a work that I done some years ago, Putin, Daulette. And because of this, if we compute the amount of the volume of the fiber by the solid fiber flow, we end up with graphs like this, so in which the percentage of my So in which the percentage of my volume occupied by solid like a fluid is actually decreasing with the vaccine number and increasing with the finger number. So this is for the simple channel. If we look at the same for our weby wall, actually it's a bit different. So for the linear number, as expected, actually it's the same. So as we increase the linear number, the amount of solid region in the code domain is increasing. However, when we look at However, when we look at the Pasimal number, it's different because even increasing the Pasimal number, the amount of solid keeps. So this is actually what our looks like for a fixed binger number and as being fixed device market number. So there are, for example, like this in Binger number 3, so I am of this vertical line over here, and varying device market. So there are two main regions occupied by solid. Main regions occupied by solid and fluids. One is the one close to the walls, which slightly reduces actually, as we increase the Wezmann number. And then instead we have a region in the middle of the channel, which initially is separated between these new blocks, and then with the Palaceman number, it becomes a single one. So if you look the If you look um how this uh the shape of this platform is affecting the flow, you can uh see this plot here. So if we start from the bottom, which is one can expect, as we increase the minimum number, as I said, the solid regions increases. And if you look at how the polymers are stretching, so we can measure it by looking at the trace of the conformation tensor, we can see that in the fluid-like regions, so the stretching progresses. So, the stretching progressively increases. So, actually, let's start from the top. So, as the Weiss-Mech number increases, as one could expect, the fluid stretching grows with the Weiss-Meg number, and for the largest Weiss-Meg number, we have a regions of I stretched for limits. What is less expected, I'm saying, is that even when we increase the Bignon number, we have a similar behavior. So, as we increase the Bignon number, the stretching of the polymers in the fluid-like regions in Polymers in the food, like regions in diseases. And to understand this, we compute this parameter. So, what is the parameter? This is basically the term inside the mass. So, which is zero in the solid like regions and the non-zero in the so if we remove uh eta peak, which I take out from the parentheses, so this number is bounded between zero and one, and we can see that uh uh We can see that in the region where the polymers are reflected, so this parameter is larger than zero. So if we divide the power equations by this hidden number, we end up with an on-droid fluid-like equation in which the elastic modulus is modified by this Eden number. So this is why even increasing the Mingan number in the fluid-like region regions for the for the satisfaction. For the subject or looking at something. Okay, so another thing that we can get from this simulation is that you may notice that for sufficiently high maximum number, so some of the points have some very small white crosses. So these are points in which the flow is actually unstable. So uh deploy is uh uh triggering some instabilities. Triggering some instabilities, and the points that we report here are just the mean of the time of this is an example of the time histories that we can get. So for something close to a visceral fluid, so in which the omega number is zero and we have a large pipe relatively large by semi-number, we get a stable closing pipe. So this is the velocity simple v 1.0 of our. Sample V1.0 of our domain over time. When we increase the, so for this plastic, we have a stationary flow, or a viscoplastic, or almost viscoplastic, so very low ballistic number, it's still stationary. But when we have a sufficiently high ligand number, even with low basement number, or vice versa, for the very large basement number, a very low ligand number, we can actually end up with some velocity. End up with some velocity profiles which are getting into junction. So the effect of mutual interaction of elasticity and plasticity seems to trigger these instabilities. So this is even more pronounced when we include shear film into the problem. So the mean value of these plotations are not changing, but you can see that the amplitude of these locations are much higher. So these instabilities for So these instabilities for elastic scale fasting fluids has actually been found numerically in some recent work, published in the journal on mechanics. But all of these are numerical simulations and we all use the same model. So the question is, are these coming from the numerical model or we can actually find them also experimental? Before doing that, we want to study how the geometry is affecting these instabilities. So we start from These instabilities. So we start from a case which is unstable, so this is an aspect ratio of 3, and then we progressively reduce the amplitude of our wall deformation. And as you can see here, going from the aspect ratio 3 to an aspect of zero, which is when the wall is arbitrarily flat, actually, this instability progressively disappears and we recover a stationary throughput channel. A similar effect is found when increasing the wavelength. Increasing the wavelength. So starting from an unstable case with the wavelength of 8, as we stretch our domain and basically enlarge the wavelength of the standard, eventually we end up with the flow which will recover the. So as I said, all of these are numerical, so we try to check experimentally. So as you probably know, most of realistic. Most of real elastic plastic fluids have a very low elasticity, so a possible way to try to increase the vaccine number would be to increase the flow rate, but this would also change the minimum number. So what we do is actually mix our EPT2 with the PF127, give some polymer RPTFs, try the different ones, PO, they all give comparable results, but I think the best one is. Comparable results, but I think the best one is this HP in the tried, as you can see from this shear geological measurement, the yield stress is not changing by the polymer concentration, which are the numbers we put in place. So apart from the fact that the stress is not changing, if you just look at the shear theology, nothing is really changing. And this, I think, is something connected to what Sorobo was saying yesterday. What Sorobo was saying here yesterday. So, shadow rheology is not enough to actually see changes in the extensional property of the flow. So, we moved to some extensional measurements. So, we did the paper. So, on the top, you can see that the case for the simple P of 127. So, basically, there is no filling. So, as soon as we open the plates, the sample spreads into two parts. So, there is almost no. So there is almost no relaxation time, anyway, nothing that could be measured. So this is order of milliseconds. If once we add our polymers instead, we can see that the time scale changed to something order of seconds. And if we look at how the neck of our EDP modified EDP through its behavior, it we can recover on a linear log scale, an exponential P level, from which we can extract V-able from which we can extract the relaxation time. Interestingly, this relaxation time is the same that HPAA would be so in a Newtonian fluid. That's a nice property of these polymers. With different polymers like PO, this would be the case, so actually the redox would be also cheap. That's why we actually prefer this, because we can actually measure the reduction time in Newtonian fluid and then add that to our polymeric to our EPP fluid and the reduction. Lower EP through it and the association can remain the same. So we did this with Kebber, we also did with Holstcar and measurement. And then we can try to put this flu, quantify the EDP fluid, the vapor enhanced elasticity, into our geometry. So these are the results from the simulation that we go from Newtonian to plastic EBP, UBP, which is affinity. Now we look at the experiment. If now we look at the experiment, so in the case of pure the basic PF127, we end up with velocity profiles which are very similar to what you can see here. So far the comparison is qualitative, so we didn't extract still the lines. But you can see that for sure a big difference between the case with and without is the polymer additives. So without polymer additives, the streamlines are almost straight. the streamlines are almost straight, indicating that we are even at regions of unique regions of which the velocity which the inflow velocity doesn't go. Once instead we add our polymers, you can see the polymers changes and we can combine it with domain and this is very similar to what we can find for our from our search. If you look at uh some maybe if you pick this magic, but Match, but you can see that these points are the ones you use for behavior. So, in the pure ulonic fluid, the particles that you see in the entrance of your channel actually never samples the regions like the maximum flow of the channel, and that's because this region is unyielded. While once we add the polymers, we are able actually to switch the full the full the full channel. And this can be very useful uh if you want to flush out the fluid uh the EDP fluid in these uh circulating regions. You can just add some polymers and then the incoming fluid will flush it out. Lastly, about the uh unsteady flow. So we can actually the probe where we can actually measure the velocity in one point over time. Locality in one point over time. We compare the case of basic EVP fluid and the EPP fluid at the point. And in detail, we can find that, so this blue line is the basic fluid, we have 127. So these small oscillations, I guess, are certainties. But once we mix our EVP fluid with the HP double date, we actually end up with some more macroscopic fluctuations, which I believe to be comparable. I believe to be comparable to what we found experimentally. Okay, so with this, I finished. So we did this market simulation algorithm experimentally in the question mark because you still want to do something, we want to measure the pressure plot in the experiment and compare it with the one simulation. And then the comparison that we have done so far is only qualitative, so only from a good plot, but we want to actually construct the plot of the loss profile. A flow of velocity profiles and how close we are to take anyone.
