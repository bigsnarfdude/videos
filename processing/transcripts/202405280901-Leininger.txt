I see that side was a short so you can use fonts on standards. Oh yeah, okay. Yeah, chalkboard lights too. I want that. Alright. Thanks, the organizers, for the information. It's been great so far. Right, so I want to talk about this joint work with Auto Kent. So let me just start. So let me just start with some background and some setup. So S will be a finite type surface. So that just means it's a closed surface, say orientable, connected, minus a finite number of points. And we'll assume that the Euler characteristic of S is negative. And orientation preserving homeomorphism. Okay, so what do I want to do with this data? I want to construct the mapping torus of this homeomorphism. So this is x cross 0, 1, where I identify x0 with f of x1. Picture. Here's the surface cross-the interval, and then I glue. So I first crossed the interval and then I glue onto the top of F. So, up to homeomorphism, this mapping torus only depends on the isotopy class of F. So if I change F to some F prime by an isotopy, then the resulting mapping tori are homeomorphic. So really the object that determines this surface bundle is not so much the homeomorphism itself. Not so much the homeomorphism itself, but the mapping class of that. So my MF depends on F as an element of the mapping class group of S. So this is the group of homeomorphisms of S, orientation preserving homeomorphisms of S, up to isotopy. So one of the motivating theorems is due to Thurston. Uh it's due to Thurston, which is from the late seventies. And that says that this mapping torus is a hyperbolic manifold, i.e., MF is polymorphic to H3. Polymorphic to H3 mod gamma, if and only if MF is what's called eight oriental. So that means there's no, well I guess if S is a closed surface, that means there's no Z plus Z subgroup to the fundamental group. But in general, it just means that all Z squared subgroups are subgroups. Subroots are peripheral. So, what does that mean? Well, if I have some puncture in my surface, so think about genus 2 surface minus a point, there's an obvious Z plus Z that you get by when I glue the top to the bottom, I can take this annulus and glue one side of the annulus to the other and get a torus inside of the free manifold. And that subgroups. Subgroups of I1. I get a torus inside of the mapping torus, and the fundamental group of that torus injects, that gives me a Z plus Z subgroup. So whenever I have a puncture in my surface, I always get such Z plus C subgroups. But these are peripheral in the sense that that torus in the three-manifold is homotopic into a neighborhood of the N. Okay, so this is equivalent to saying that. Uh equivalent to saying that uh f is what she calls pseudonyms. And uh so it doesn't matter so much for our purposes what Subramanov actually means. You can take it to mean that there's that F has infinite order of the mapping class group and there's no invariant essential one manifold. And if you think about it, if I had an invariant essential one manifold, I could take that one manifold One manifold, I could take that one manifold across the interval, and when I glue up, I get it twice. So, really, the content here is that when MF is ateroidal, that's equivalent to being hyperpoly. And so Thurston's proof really involved kind of developing the structure of pseudomonas and homeomorphisms and analyzed the action on Teichm√ºller space and its packification. Much space and application and then to, you know, and then did a lot of hard work in hyperbolic geometry. Okay, so this theorem didn't just come out of the blue. This was motivated by some work of Riley a few years before this, who gave the first example. Gave the first example of a free manifold that's the mapping torus, which is hyperbolic, which admits a hyperbolic metric. And that's the figure 8-0 top there. So if I take S3 and I remove the figure 8-0, it turns out this manifold is homeomorphic to the mapping torus, and mapping torus of a particularly nice homeomorphic. Taurus of a particularly nice homomorphism. So let me think about the linear map, 2111, as a map from the torus, which is R2 mod C2. So this linear map from R2 to itself descends to the quotient torus. And if I take the torus and I remove the identity, right, this is a group, you can think about. This is a group. You can think about zero, and R2 descends to a point. We'll call it zero, the torus. So I can take the torus and remove zero, and then take L, I'll call L zero, L restricted to this torus, and then this is homeomorphic to the mapping torus of that homeomorphism. And it's H3 mod A. H3 mod gamma, where gamma is a particularly nice subgroup of the isometry group of H3. The orientation-preserving isometry group of H3 is PSL2C, and gamma actually sits as an index 12 subgroup in PSL2 of the ring of integers of the Q of joint root minus 3. So Riley came up with this example and showed it to Thurston, and Thurston said, no way. Never mind, actually, yeah, tell him. Never mind, actually, yeah, tell them. Okay, so this, I said the word surface bundle. When you glue the top to the bottom here, so there's a projection of this onto the interval, just the surface cross the interval. And when I glue the ends of this, I can also glue the ends of this, and then I get a map from the list to the circle, and that exhibits the mapping torque. And that exhibits the mapping torus as a surface bundle over the circle. MF is a S bundle over the circle. And this homeomorphism, or its mapping class, is really the monodromy representation. So whenever you have a surface bundle over any space, you have an associated monodromy representation that goes from the fundamental group of the base, in this case the circle, which Z. Which is Z into the mapping class group of the fiber. And in this case, whenever you're building the mapping torus of some homeomorphism, you're just sending the identity, the generator of C, sorry, not the identity, the generator of Z to the homeomorphism that you used to glue. Chris? These instead of no way. So, what was the most surprising part? Well, the fact that the fiber Well, the fact that the fiber group, so if you look at the infinite cyclic cover or the universal cover, it's topologically universal cover the surface cross R. And so you're seeing some product structure in some space with negative curvature, which is surprising. And the surface group would have to be really distorted. And that was sort of his initial surprise. So these mapping tori, they're examples. These mapping tori, they're examples of surface bundles. They're surface bundles over a circle. All surface bundles over a circle arise as mapping tori. And in general, if you have a surface bundle over some space, there is a monodromy representation, a homomorphism from the fundamental group of the base into the mapping class group. And so this theorem, I think, was the initial motivation for The initial motivation for some work and questions that arose in the early 90s. So this seems to be attributed to Jeff Mess and Cynthia Gaio. But it was sort of certainly being discussed and circulated. Being discussed and circulated around this time, and I think really kind of picked up traction around 2000. And so let me state the question. Is there a surface bundle E over a surface? So this would now be a four manifold. We want the base and fiber genus. And fiber genus at least two, which is hyperbolic. That is, is there a hyperbolic four-manifold that fibers over a surface with surface fiber? And well, this question sort of naturally led to. Are naturally led to maybe this is too strong, maybe you don't want hyperbolic, maybe you want negative occur. Or even weaker, you could ask for gromohyperbolic. But is the fundamental group, is there such a four-manifold whose fundamental group is This fundamental group is word hyperbolic. Or even weaker still, heroidal in this case means no z-squared subgroups. So these are successively weaker questions, but even getting down to here, it became clear that this is It's not clear how to find examples. So, thinking about this in terms of this question or these questions, you can phrase this question, and as I'll describe in a bit, this question in terms of the mapping class group. And so we can turn these questions about existence of surface bundles with at least some bit of the structure into a question about mapping lessons. Mapping glass books. Yeah. So, why do you not want to consider the punctured case there? No, the punctured case too, yeah. So, if you could solve this for punctured surfaces, then. But your H-Royal is not Z-squared subgroups. Why are they not, why can't they be... Yeah, so in that case, they wouldn't be Z-squared subgroups in the punctured case. So I'm really thinking about closed here, because they're closed surface one little bit. I guess sorry, yeah, sorry, you would still have C squared. So I want to think about the closed case, but yeah, so they're okay. Yeah, let me state the equivalent formulation in terms of mapping class groups. So HMRL question is equivalent to Equivalent to is there a subgroup? I'll say so the mapping class group of the surface of genus G, where G is isomorphic to pi one of S. isomorphic to pi one of SH, where D and H are both T. All right, Chris, can I just ask, why is it weaker to ask for the things that have wrong hyperbolic buttons or the tricks to be hyperbolic? So being real hyperbolic is certainly stronger than being negatively curved. Not in dimension three if you admit it a negatively curved method, but also. Admitted a negatively curved metric, we also hyperbolic metric. But Girlman and Thurston constructed examples of manifolds that admit negatively curved, four manifolds that admit negatively curved metrics that are not, that don't admit any real hyperbolic object. So at least going from there to there is strictly harder. Just for four manifolds. Going from negatively curved to gromup hyperbolic fundamental group, well this is just a lot coarser. Well, this is just a lot coarser, and it's not clear how to take a gromov hyperbolic. If you know that the fundamental group is Gromov hyperbolic, how to actually produce a negatively curved metric. So in a way, thinking about this for three manifolds even, so you could start with the assumption that a three-manifold has a chromo-hyperbolic fundamental group, say a fiber three-manifold. But actually producing a negatively curved metric is still hard. It's still hard. For example, in four manifolds, where we know that you can't? Oh, that I don't know. Yeah, so the question of whether this is strictly harder for arbitrary four-manifolds, I'm not sure, but I would guess. But I just don't know that I don't really know the four-manifold theory. Other questions? Uh right. So um so one uh uh theorem about it from around 2000 from around 2009 is that there exist at most finitely many. It should should be harder because if you take a thing that's hyperbolic surface and you cross with like a finite thing finite, then that's going to be anyways. Yeah, no, I mean, so I think you probably want to assume that, you know, the top logical obstructions are, so it should be aspherical. Yeah. So there's only many. There's at most finitely many such G for fixed fiber and base genes. Okay, so let me try to do this. So this is an This is an incomplete list of references, but there are lots of constructions of surface subgroups of the mapping class group. So there's some classical ones from around the 60s due to Berman and Tiger Padira. A little bit later, Gonzales Diaz-Harvey came up with some related constructions and some construction with Reed. And then there's a whole slew of constructions that come from writing the Lardin groups, embedding writing the Lardin groups into mapping class groups. Class groups. We know there are lots of surface subgroups in writing LARN groups, lots of embeddings. You get lots of genus II surfaces, sort of, they're all over genus II surface subgroups, all over the mapping class group of essentially any mapping class group. There's another construction due to angle that I'll talk about, and there the relevant subgroups are quite. And there, the relevant subgroups are quasi-fouxium groups. And so, finding lots of quasi-fouxium groups inside of these three manifold groups gives you access to lots of other surface groups. So, I'll talk about this construction, this idea of angle in a little bit. It's relevant for our construction. But I wanted to mention, there are lots and lots of surface groups. All the surface groups that come from up here, not these three manifolds. Not these three manifold ones, they're all known not to be purely pseudonymous. So I could also say, I mean, via Egle Wise, virtual special, Breitson, together with some wreath product trick, showed that there are other ways of embedding three-manifold groups via writing alarm groups as well. Those are not going to give you any purely signal-ons of surface groups. But this approach that I'll talk about in a little bit via Eggle, using these quasi-Fiptian groups. Using these quasi-fixing groups is still plausible, and I think this is an interesting question. Is there a quick reason you can give us one that the breadwinners are not? Yes. So you can always find, whenever you have a homomorphism from a surface into a writing surface group into a writing larger group, you can map the surface into the Salvetti complex and pull back the hyperplanes. You get some. And pull back the hyperplanes, you get some one-manifolds. And you can use that to show that there are always elements whose centralizer in the mapping class group is contains as z plus z. And so those can't be pseudonymous. In fact, there's no one-ended surface. There's no one-ended purely pseudonymous subgroups that factor through rights. Okay. I'm gonna regret this, but I'm just gonna. I'm gonna regret this, but just uh okay, well the theorem uh i is that they do exist and there are lots of them. For all g at least four, there exist infinitely many. Infinitely many commensurability classes of purely supervisive closed surface groups. So the commensurability of the So, the commensurability, once you find one, then you can take covers of that surface, and that gives you examples of higher and higher genus surfaces. So, this sort of saying up to commensurability is kind of saying even up to that equivalence, there's still infinitely many. Obviously, by Bauditch's result, there can only be finitely many of a given genus. But But there are really infinitely many sort of distinct ones as you let the genus grow. Do you find one in every genus? No. Yeah, I think there's, so I'll explain where they come from in a minute, but we don't actually know explicitly anyone. For example, it lives in genus 4. It shouldn't be too hard to work out. It shouldn't be too hard to work out, but yeah, so most of these come from more of an existence statement. For any given, so you can construct lots of them very concretely, but we haven't actually looked at it. Actually, looked at. Okay, right, and then as a corollary, there exist infinitely many H toroidal surface bubbles. Okay, so um what about the the uh What about the conjecture or the question, trying to work our way back? So we conjecture that all of these surface bundles are hydrophobic. All surface bundles from the corollary. Our word diabolic. So let me say a little bit about why we think this and really kind of connect to one of the themes of the day, which is so I mentioned this earlier. These atoridal surface bundles, These atoridal surface bundles, the existence of them is equivalent to the existence of these purely pseudonyms of surface groups via the monodromia representation. So whenever you have one of these, you can build a bundle for which the monodromia representation is an isomorphism onto the group G. And so in that way, you can turn this question about these surface bundles into a question about mapping class groups. But you can also turn the question about Roma hyperbolicity of the surface bundle into a question about Into a question about mapping class groups. So Barb and Mosier introduced this notion of convex co-compactness in the mapping class group. And they proved one implication of the theorem I'm writing down here. Homstep proved the other implication. There's another proof by Lahan, former student Sardar. To the starter. And it says that E is a word hyperbolic surface bundle, not over anything, really. If and only if the monodromy representation Is has finite kernel and convex co-compact image. So wondering why these are working for robotics. Literary by B is a word for bottom surface. Surface bundle. Surface bundle. So convex co-compactness here is hopefully that's not too distracting. So Farben Mosher defined convex co-compactness by analogy with. Convex co-compactness by analogy with convex co-compactness for tiding groups. So there, convex co-compactness, something about acting co-compactly on something convex. And in the case of the Mapping class group, they defined it as acting co-compactly on something quasi-convex and Tichole space or Ticholymetric. Another way to say it is just that the orbit is quasi-convex and Tichole space. And then they had some other formulations. But the point is that really, this is something that has just to do with the subgroup of the mapping class group. And so this theorem is amazing. It's saying something about the subgroup of the mapping class group is telling you something very precise about the associated surface bundle. And in a way, this is kind of a And in a way, this is kind of a coarse analog of Thurston's theorem. So there's lots of work developing convex co-compactness, giving equivalent formulations, other ways of thinking about it. And then there's also several papers about proving that. About proving that being purely pseudo-nosed and finally generated implies being convex co-compactness. Convex co-compactness implies being purely pseudonymous and finally generated. But the converse is the kind of thing that you would need in order to take this theorem and produce word hyperbolic surface bundles over surfaces. So in particular, one of the One of the results that I'll mention later is kind of very closely related to this construction, which is why we sort of conjectured that these should all be convex, but compact. The surface groups are all convex, but compact, and hence the associated surface bubbles are where hyperbolic. Okay. Any other questions? Any other questions before I mean genus greater than four? In our construction, so let me yeah, let me state the actual theorem that we prove and the reason I mentioned the figure eight knot. So there exists a type-preserving I'll say what this means in a second, homomorphism from pi 1 of the figure 8 ma complement into the mapping class group of the torus with three punctures. So to construct to construct homomorphisms into Into mapping class groups of closed surfaces, there's a sort of well-known branch cover trick that you can apply. And so you need to take branch covers over this torus, branched over those three points, so that at every point in the pre-image of those three points, you have degree greater than one. So if you can do that, then there's a finite index subgroup of this that will lift to the mapping class group of that closed surface. Class group of that closed surface. And the best you can find with all those constraints is genus 4. But you can do genus 4 and higher. Okay, so I mentioned McLaughlin. And so, where do the surface groups come from? So, McLaughlin proved that. From so McFlagman proved that there exist, let me just say, lots of closed, totally geodesic surfaces in M8. So, in fact, what's true is that, so inside of the figure eight knot complement. The figure eight naught complement for any point and any tangent plane to that point, you can find a sequence of closed totally geodesic surfaces whose tangent planes converge to that. So they're dense in the two-plane bundle. So there's lots and lots of these. But then in addition to that, Kahn and Wright and Cooper and Fuder constructed lots of other. Constructed lots of other quasi-Fouxian surfaces as well. So, in addition to these, there's just loads and loads of other quasi-Fouxian closed surfaces. And so, all of those under these representations will be purely pseudonymous. So what is this type preserving? So, inside of here, every element of this group is either parabolic or hyperbolic. And this is saying that the only elements that are reducible, non-pseudonosa here, Non-pseudonosov here are the parabolic ones. So every hyperbolic element is pseudonosov in particular because these are totally geodesic and the quasi-fixing ones are nearly totally geodesic in the sense that every element in those groups are hyperbolic except as a three-manifold group, which means that the images are purely signal on. Okay, so that's the this is the theorem that I want to talk about. That I want to talk about, and this is a consequence that I just described: working out the precise branch covers on exercise. So our approach to this, which I'm embarrassed to say, especially once you see how short the proof actually is, we've been thinking about it for a long time. Thinking about it for a long time. It's really a combination of two different ideas. One that I want to talk about now because it's related to the construction. This was an approach due to Egel, the one about three months ago that I mentioned. And then the other was due to Wright. So I'll describe Alex's question and then how these things fit together and then try to tell you. Fit together and then try to tell you how to agree with theorem. Sorry, just to how do you go from having a close totally geodesic surface means to injecting it to going to the fundamental group level? Right, so a totally geodesic surface in a hyperbolic manifold will inject on type one. And so the surface group sits inside of here. And then this being in particular type preserving means that the only thing means that the only thing that can go to the identity is the identifier. So that's also injected. Yeah. Other questions? Can you say again what hypozygote means? It means that hyperbolics go to pseudonosos, parabolics go to reducibles. I don't know why I didn't say it that way. Okay, so let me start with Egel's original. With Egel's original suggestion, this was, I don't remember exactly when he mentioned it to me. I think I was still a graduate student, but it was around 2002. And so let me just remind you of the hypotheses here. So we'll start with some circuit negative value characteristic. And now this is a little bit excessive for. This is a little bit excessive for the purposes of this kind of discussion, but I want to take a finite set. I'm going to use this notation a lot later. So I'm going to take a finite set, and I'm going to write sx for s minus x. And if I have a homeomorphism from s to s with f of x equals x for all x and x, so I have a homeomorphism that fixes each point in this finite set, then I get the homeomorphism. I get a homeomorphism, I'll call it x of x, from the surface punctured at x itself. Okay, so the particular instance that is important here is the case where z is just a point inside of S. And then, so I want to think about the mapping torus of Of some homeomorphism. And so this surface bundle over the circle, its fundamental group, sits inside of a short exact sequence, pi1 of the surface into pi1 of manifold into pi1 of the circle, which is z. And this short exact sequence of the fundamental group of this sits inside of a short exact sequence associated to the Associated to the mapping class group that's due to Berman. This is often called the Berman exact sequence. So there you have the mapping class group of the surface punctured at this point Z. There's a homomorphism where you just fill in the puncture. If I have a homeomorphism of S, and I should, let's assume that all of our homeomorphisms are pure, meaning they fix. Are pure, meaning they fix each puncture. So I can fill this back in and I get a homeomorphism of s. And that's surjective because any homeomorphism, any mapping class is represented by a homeomorphism that fixes that point. And what's the kernel? Well, if you think about an element of the kernel, that's a homeomorphism of S such that when I, with this, put this extra puncture, such that when I fill that puncture in, it's isotopic to the identity. To the identity. So, what happens on isotopy? Well, Z is going to trace around some loop on the surface. And so, every element of the kernel of this homomorphism gives you a loop. And in fact, that loop is well defined at the homotopy and precisely determines the kernel. So, the Berman exact sequence says Says that the kernel of this homeomorphism is precisely described by this. Another way to think about this: if I have a loop, I can get a homeomorphism by, turns out, pushing backwards along the loop. So think about an isotopy that's pushing Z along that loop backwards. And then you puncture. That's some homeomorphism of the punctured surface. So that's a way of taking a loop and producing a homeomorphism of this punctured surface. And this sequence embeds inside of here. Embeds inside of here. So you can see this sort of purely algebraically, if you like, the way that the stable letter, this element here, when I conjugate, acts on this, is precisely the way that homeomorphism acts on this. Okay, so now if I have a surface subgroup here, then I get a surface subgroup here. And one theorem of Kra says that so I want to know when things are purely pseudo-anosive. And, okay, let's forget about this for a second. Let's just think about the elements of pi, one of s. When are they pseudo-unossive as mapping classes here? Well, when I point push around, if I push around a loop that doesn't just fill up the entire surface, in the sense it happens to be disjoint from some essential. Happens to be disjoint from some central curve, then that homeomorphism is going to be reducible. For us, that's the only way to have reducible. So beta and pi 1 of s is 0 also if and only if beta is filling. Okay, and then Egle said if we start with F being pseudo and awesome And if we have a surface subgroup, so let's say pi 1 of sigma inside of pi 1 of mf, and I want to know, is, let's call this b, is b of pi 1 of sigma purely pseudo-mosso? Well, according to Kra, if I look at the intersection of pi 1 of sigma with pi 1 of the fiber, With pi 1 of the fiber, then I need all of those things to be filling. So I need pi1 of sigma intersected with pi 1 of s to be filling in s. And I mean every element in here besides the identity needs to be filling. And what Egel said is if you start with sigma quasi-Fouxian, that's enough. That's enough. So, the elements that don't intersect the kernel, that is the ones that project non-trivially to Z, it turns out that those things are necessarily pseudonosa here. And if you think about it, there's some map which projects to a power of the original pseudonosa. So it certainly restricts what the potential reducing curves are. Okay, so this is a construction for surface subgroups. Once you apply it to all those quasi-fluxian surface groups, there's lots of examples that you could think about. And we know lots of examples that fail to be purely pseudonymous. There are lots more, and maybe these are still, some of those are still purely pseudonymous. So I think it would be really interesting. I will note that I mentioned this earlier. This earlier. So, with Spencer Doll and Autumn, we showed that being purely pseudo-emissive is equivalent to being convex co-compact in this case. So in this sense, once you've found your purely pseudo-offs of surface group, it's necessarily convex token-packed. You have a word hyperbolic surface bundle. So this is part of the effort. So, this is part of the evidence for thinking that the surface subgroups that we construct are also convex co-compact. And I should say, too, this doesn't depend on this being a surface group. So there are lots of free groups that are purely pseudo-hasil, and they're all convex co-compact. So you're worried then about an element with a kernel times a power power. Oh, so that's what Ian sort of said: was an element of the kernel times the power of f is if it's hyperbolic inside of here, then it'll be pseudonos of here. Oh, if it's hyperbolic. Yeah, so and so if we start with a quasi-Fouxian surface, then all the elements are hyperbolic. So the ones that project non-trivially to Z are going to be automatically C Mausing. Right, if I start with a quasi-fixing thing, If I start with a quasi-flixing thing, everything's hyperbolic. So the only things you need to worry about are the things in the intersection. Maybe this is my quasi-fixed one. It means that it stabilizes a quasi-circle in the circle, the sphere at infinity of H3. When I think about this group acting on H3, About this group acting on H3. There is a circle. Another way to say is it's quasi-convex in the if you have a closed manifold, it's the same as being closed. So with Egel's original approach, the things you need to worry about for quasi-fixing surfaces are the ones, the intersections with the fiber. The intersections with the fiber, and you need those to be offline. That's a good question. I haven't really thought much about the bonus between Public Superanasa and Panx compacts. I don't really have to understand the difference. So take the Public Scorano survey and look at how they act on the Murray space. So what's hard? Is what's hard showing that finding a convex place where they're acting co-compactly? Or you can find the convex place to know how much they're. So, the actual Teichmohr space is kind of the hard way to think about it. Another way that's equivalent that Autumn and I proved with, and personally independently showed, was that if the orbit map to the curve graph is a quasi-asymmetric embedding. And so the hard thing is showing that it's a quasi-symmetric symmetric embedding. I mean, so you know that the orbit map is always going to be Lipschitz. So proving that you get a lower bound as well is hard. And if you If you, so, okay, I don't. If you had a group that was purely pseudonulsive and had a normal surface subgroup of infinite index, then that would be purely pseudonulative also and would be distorted and so would not be time excode impact. Okay, let me tell you the next ingredient. Tell you the next ingredient. So this is not what we do, but we use this. The other thing involves the question of Alex's that I mentioned. And so it says, does there exist a homeomorphism F from S to S such that F is So it's that F is fixed point free. And every loop, beta, every essential loop, beta, fills with its image with F beta. So I take a loop and I look at the image of that loop, and together those things should intersect every simple closed, essential simple closed curve. Clothes, essential simple clothes here. So if the answer is yes, then you can produce a purely pseudonoci surface group. Let me explain where that comes from. So there's a map from S into the configuration space of two points on S, which is just, I'm thinking the order configuration space. So that's S minus the diagonal. The diagonal, which just sends every point to the point in its image. Okay? So this is just one of Berman's many lovely sequences. The one that's relevant here is: I can take the mapping class group. The mapping class group of the surface minus two points. And I can fill in those two points. Every mapping class is represented by a homeomorphism that fixes those two points. And then if I have something that's in the kernel, it's isotopic to. The kernel. It's isotopic to the identity after I fill them in. So, what happens? I get those two points are sort of moving around the surface. It's an isotopy, so they never crash into each other. So, that's a loop inside of the configuration space. So, you get the kernel of this is the fundamental group of the configuration space of two points on the surface X. But the fundamental group of the configuration space is the pure break group of, in this case, two points on the surface. In this case, two points on the surface. So, this embedding of S into the configuration space induces a homomorphism on the fundamental group, which maps pi 1 of s into this pure break group, and hence into here. This condition, so the fixed point-free condition is the only thing you need in order to define this map, and this condition. And this condition ensures that the element is purely pseudonasu. So, this result of kra has a version that's due to Ima Yoshi, Ito, and Yamamoto, which says that under this assumption, df star from pi one of s into the pure break group, or let me think about it as a map into the mapping class group. A map into the mapping class group here is also purely pseudo-awsive. Meaning it's injective, and every element in the image is pseudo-awsive. I should say every non-peripheral element. If S is a closed surface, which is a case of interest, that gives you actually an also closed surface subject. Okay. Okay, I'm out of time, so let me just write the, put these two together and say what our, where the example is. I'm happy to tell you later why it's life-preserving. So let's come back to Let's come back to this example, L, which was 2111, the map from the Taurus to itself. This fixes, so L fixes 0, but that's the only fixed point. So if I delete 0, I have a map on a once-punctured torus with no fixed points. And so let me call that L0. It's a map from the torus minus itself. This has no fixed points. And the torus support. And the torus, the punctured torus, is so small that every essential loop has to fill with its image. Or beta, L0, beta fills. So it satisfies, it's a positive answer to this question, but the torus is not a closed surface. The function torus is not a closed surface. So let me say what the map is and then I'll be done. Then I'll be done. So the mapping torus of L0, so L doesn't have any other fixed points, but its square does. Its square fixes two points. So L squared fixes some point Z, and L of Z is W, and so I get inside of here. Inside of here, I have the functor torus going into the mapping torus of L0. But I can also map this by this DL0 into the configuration space of two points, points zero. And then I can construct, so notice that L0 Here's me a map from the configuration space to itself just by acting on each of the coordinates, and it preserves the image. So L, let me write it L0 cross L0. That's a map from S cross S to itself, preserves the diagonal, and this sends DF of D02 to itself. So I'm going to take this and build. So, I'm going to take this and build the mapping torus of this. So, now this is some five-dimensional manifold. And the embedding of T0 into here extends to an embedding of this three-manifold into this five-hole. And do this here the fundamental group of this five-man. The fundamental group of this fine manifold also sits inside of a short exact sequence. And so we have pi1 of the mapping torus of L0 cross L0. C. That short exact sequence also embeds inside of here. So the fundamental group of the fiber group is the fundamental group of the configuration space, which is again the two strand grade group. This is now going into the torus punctured at 0, Z, and W. And this embedding, so the induced homomorphism from the map, from this map, this map, gives you an induced homomorphism, the short exact same difference here. I'm not sure that exactly that works here. So this map from here all the way down to here is our homomorphism called delta zero. This is the type-preserving homomorphism of zero. Okay, so I'm out of time, but if you want to know more about But if you want to know more about why it's time-preserving, thanks. Chris? The fiber of the figure eight. Yeah, so the fiber of the figure eight, it goes to some, that's also type preserving. So it goes to some distorted. So it goes to some distorted subgroup of the mapping class group here. Sorry, sorry. We don't know that that's. No, sorry, we do know that that's distorted because it's distorted in the three manifold. But the connection with this kind of so-compactus thing is the whole three-manifold group may not be distorted. But anyway, yeah, so it's distorted in the three-manifold group, and so it's distorted. So, how hard is it to shut down? Embarrassingly, not very hard. Even though we thought about it for a very, very, very long time. So, this approach you've had for a while, let me say quite closely. Alex mentioned his question to us in 2018, I think. And yeah, we started thinking about that and then thinking about So the figure eight not two on one one, okay, there's this nice thing, it's not the right thing, but you get the map of the three manifold, and so we start thinking about that. But we had some really convoluted approach to trying to prove that it was purely pseudo-nosive. And work. Yeah. I can tell you more about the failed attempt, which is maybe kind of interesting, but Which is maybe kind of interesting, but I think there's more time. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, they're embedding into the mapping button. So, right, so the thing is, like The thing that we were stuck with is we knew that there were, so in the pumped torus, what do these things look like? You have these arrays inside the pumpedaurus bundle. And we knew that you want to show it's anoidal, then you want to know that there's no essential torus. And so you're worried about a central tori that looks. You're worried about a central tori that looks like this. And when you have this, there's an annulus in there between those two. And so we actually knew how to produce lots and lots of loops where you had immersed annuli. So they were sort of that the boundary of the annulus was crashing back into itself. And so we had some conditions that we were trying to show sort of not very generic. Not very generic where you had those immersed annuli. But it turns out that none of those immersed annuli are immersed. And so those tori just aren't there. Yeah, and what do you know? Not so much. We know that we have a retraction of this thing onto this. And that's part of the ingredient for proving that the initially many commensurability classes here are actually distinct commensurability classes here, right?
