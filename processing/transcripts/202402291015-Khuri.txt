So, my talk will be very similar to Martin's, except different in the respect. It'll be totally in higher dimensions. So, we will be interested in the vacuum Einstein equations. Here for the next one or two slides, we'll have a possibly cosmological constant. But one of the first primary results that's of interest here is due to Holland's Ishibashi Wald and Hollands, Ishibashi, Wald, and independently by Monkrief and Eisenberg. And it says that if you have an asymptotically flat analytic and stationary vacuum black hole solution, then it must have at least one other symmetry, an axis symmetry. And you can have more of these, but you have at least one of them. And a combination of the time-like, well, asymptotically time-like translational symmetry with some combination. With some combination of the rotations, identifies the horizon as a killing horizon because this vector field becomes null there. But for our purposes, we're interested in the fact that stationarity naturally produces extra rotational killing fields. So the assumption of axisymmetry, if you want to solve the stationary vacuum Eisenhower equation with axisymmetry, it's very natural. So another basic result in this realm is due to Galloway and Shane, where they To Galloway and Shang, where they generalize the Hawking topology theorem. It says that cross-sections of the event horizon with a non-negative cosmological constant are of positive Yamavi invariant. So they admit metrics of positive scalar curvature. And this in low dimensions gives restrictions on the topology. For instance, in a case of integers dimension, let's take dimension five, where the horizon cross sections are three-dimensional. Then the topologies of the horizon. And the topologies of the horizon can be spherical spaces, quotients of the sphere, S1 plus S2, or connected sums thereof. So it's an interesting question then to ask which one of these possible horizon topologies from the classification can be realized as a regular black hole solution. There are further restrictions due to Holland's Holland and Ishibashi. For instance, they showed that among this connected sum, they can only occur. Sum. They can only occur between S1 process 2 and lenses. So, for instance, you can't have multiple S1 process 2s connected sum together for the horizon. And also, if you have, due to Hollands and Yezadiev, if you have the maximum amount of axis symmetry, then the horizon topology gets even more restrictive. You're either a sphere, a lens space, or an S1 plus S2 product, some extra tori dimensions. And so, this is an even higher dimension. And even higher dimensions. So I'm moving back and forth between five-dimensional space-times and higher-dimensional space-times here. And then the question is: which one of those topologies has been realized so far? Well, in five dimensions, we have, in actually higher dimensions, we have the Myers-Perry solution, which are the natural generalization of the curve black hole. So they have one horizon of topology S3. They have two rotational healing fields. So two angular momenta. And the first non-trivial example of a state. Non-trivial example of a stationary vacuum black hole of non-trivial topology is due to Emperor Riall, who produced one with a single rotation. And later, Pomeransky-Sinkov generalized this to have two rotations. They're both axisymmetric, biaxisymmetric. And then for lenses, the first black lens solution, RP3, is due to Kondurian Lucietti. And thereafter, Tomizawa and Nozawa produced an infinite number of lens solutions. An infinite number of lens-space solutions. However, these are not vacuum buckholes. These were obtained in the realm of minimal supergravity, which is a type of generalized Einstein-Maxwell theory. So you can think of as higher-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell. And it turns out that in the case of extreme black holes, when you have this very long asymptotically cylindrical neck near the horizon, you get much more restrictive conditions than just the positive Umavia variant. So for instance, there can't be any connected sums at all in that realm. In that realm. Okay, so some basic questions. One of the basic questions, you can ask questions about the topology of the horizon. You can ask questions also about the topology of the domain of outer communication, the region outside of the black hole. So what are the possible topologies of the domain of outer communication for a stationary vacuum black hole? In four dimensions, this is very restrictive due to topological censorship, which says that if you're asymptotically flat, then you must be simply connected. Then you must be simply connected. Resolution of point-grade conjecture says that you're just a complement of some balls in R3. That's the for the time slices. So this is really a question for higher dimensions. And another question is, is the domain of addicted communication topology uniquely determined by the horizon topology on one end and then the topology of the asymptotic end? You can have clos√©-fine asymptotics, ALE asymptotics, for instance, and do those two conditions with the stationary vacuum. With the stationary vacuum assumption, completely determined the solution. And this is dramatically false, it turns out. And another question is: for each possible topology of the DOC, does there exist a stationary vacuum solution that realizes it? So that's the main question that we're interested in. If you can prescribe a list of topologies that are naturally associated with some type of axisymmetry, can you then produce a solution on a regular solution on each of those topologies? Okay, so we will restrict now to the realm of maximal amount of axis symmetry. So we'll always be in the case of coming to torus action. So we have this action by a two torus, and of course, also this stationarity symmetry. So the orbit space is two-dimensional. And a very nice theorem of Holin Shijadjiev showed how to encode the topology in the orbit space in a very efficient way. Orbit space in a very efficient manner. So the orbit space is a row z half plane. So just think of a half plane where on the z-axis there are a sequence of intervals, which we call rods. And with each interval, it's the place where one of the rotational killing fields vanishes. So we have, in fact, some possible linear combination of the killing field vanishes on each of these axis rods. And we call this object, which is just a sequence of two integers, we call this a rod structure. We call this a rod structure. So each interval on the z-axis has a particular rod structure. And if you know all the rod structures, then you know actually the topology of the domain of added communication and the horizon. So there is also an interval on the axis, just like in Martine's talk for the horizon, that you would say has 0, 0, 0, 0 rod structure, because none of the axisymmetric killing fields vanish there. So here's a diagram describing this. Describing this or schematic of this type of rosy half plane. So, here, this is the row direction, z direction, this is the half plane. And on the z axis, we have a sequence of intervals. So, each interval, say this one, there's a linear combination of killing fields, rotational killing fields that vanishes. So, in the actual total space of this time slice, this interval Time slice, this interval represents an S2. This is a non-trivial two cycle for the domain of addicted communication because one of the killing fields vanishes and the other one is coming alive and then collapses at the other end to make a two sphere. This squeakly line where none of the killing fields vanishes represents a horizon. And to determine what type of horizon it is, we simply look at the rod structures directly above and directly below the horizon rod. So if we take a curve in the order, So if we take a curve in the orbit space connecting the two axes directly above and below, at each point, so here's a blown-up picture of that curve, at each point there in the fiber, there's an actual full torus. But as you go to the top, one of the generators of the torus collapses. As you go to the bottom, another generator of the torus collapses, the opposite generator, this schematic. And this reminds one of the hop vibration. So here's a picture. The hop vibration. So here's a picture of R3 foliated by flat tori. Here are the flat tori. And the theta parameter parametrizes these flat tori. And you can see that there's a central collapsed torus where one of the generators collapsed. And as you move out to the other end, the other generator collapses on the z-axis. So in this way, we know that this horizon with the one, zero and zero, one rod structure gives rise to a three-sphere. And then all the other lens spaces can be classified. Other lin spaces can be classified similarly. Same with S1 plus S2. Okay, so we have a way to understand the domain of addictive communication topology. And actually, better than looking at this here, I should probably go back to the picture that I had above, because it's simply the idea to say, what is the orbit space? If I take a sequence of rod structures like this, this is the most complicated. Like this. This is the most complicated region in the orbit space. Remember, each one of these is a non-trivial two-cycle. Well, it turns out that if you take a single axis and just a little bit above and below, this represents a disk bundle over the two-sphere. So this is this base axis is a two-sphere and the little lines emanating out and above are disks. So you get a disc bundle over a two-sphere. And then we have multiple of these disc bundles consecutively, as is drawn here. Consecutively, as is drawn here, they glue together in a way that's called linear plumbing. So we have a sequence of linear plumbings of disk bundles, and this phenomenon is well understood from topology. But it also turns out to be very nice from the perspective of the domain of added communication, because this is essentially as complicated as it can get in this realm of axisymmetry. So, this region will be a plumbing of disk bundles. This is another plumbing of disk bundles. This is a horizon region, and then we have, of course, way out here at the And then we have, of course, way out here at the asymptotic end. So we can glue all these components together and then get an understanding of what the domain of adding communication looks like. It's always going to be a linear sequence of linear plumbing of disk bundles. There's some other pieces which I didn't draw in the picture, but they're just simple, say like a four-ball or a solid torus. And that symptomic end has exactly the same cross-section possibilities as the horizon. So you can have like an S3 and S1 plus S2. And S1 process2, or a lin space in the asynthetic antipode cross-sections. Okay, and just one last comment on the topology here: is that if you compactify the domain of adding communication, if you fill in the horizons, and there's a nice way to do this in a simply connected manner, again with the linear plumbings, if you fill in the horizons and you fill in the asymptotic end, you get a simply connected compact four-manifold. And we can then just apply the known results due to Donaldson and Friedman for the classification. To Donaldson and Friedman for the classification of such manifolds. And we find that the compactified domain of added communication, if you compactify correctly, must be connected to some of S2 plus S2s and complex projective spaces. So at least in four dimensions, four dimensions of time slice, we understand pretty well the domains of added communication topology, the possibilities. Okay, so back to the question of which one of these topologies can realize a stationary vacuum solution. A stationary vacuum solution. So, in this, now I'm going to go to a general dimension, n plus 3. There will be n-dimensional torus actions, so multi-axis symmetry, one dimension of time, so it's a homogeneity two action. Again, we have this rosy half plane. And like in Martine's talk, we will place the metric, we'll take an onsatz for the metric, this vowel perpetuo onsatz, which has here the torus fibers. The torus fibers, my pointer is not working. We have here the torus fibers, right? And this Fij, which will play an important role for us, is the metric on the torus fibers. These W twist the torus, think of them as a twisted torus bundle over a three-dimensional space-time here. These are the twisting components, and this is the rosy half-plane orbit space in isothermal coordinates, and of course. Isothermal coordinates, and of course, this is time. So the point is that we can replace these twisting parameters wi with a more convenient function called a twist potential. So this form measures how twisted the bundle is. And because the orbit space is simply connected and we're dealing with a Ricci flat manifold, there exist potentials. We call these twist potentials. They serve two purposes. Number one, the boundary. The boundary condition, the Dirichlet boundary condition of these twist potentials on the axes directly above and below the horizon, they're always constant from the equation. And moreover, the difference of the potential constants gives rise to the angular momenta. So we can easily encode the angular momenta of each black hole in terms of the boundary condition for these twist potentials. So that's one reason to replace the original functions in the metric with these twist potentials. A second reason is that we get a very nice structure. That we get a very nice structure for the Einstein-Hilbert action with these potentials. So it's always the case that under this amount of symmetry, when you reduce the Einstein-Hilbert action down to the three-dimensional orbit space, we have the scalar curvature of the orbit space, three dimensions, plus some matter Lagrangian. It has a very nice structure. It turns out to be a non-positively curved symmetric space, SLM plus one mod SO m plus one. Okay, so this is the Okay, so this is the this is what you this is the harmonic energy, this is the metric on the target space, and here is a more explicit way to represent the map into this target space. These are the Euler-Lagrange equations, namely the harmonic map equations coupled to gravity in three dimensions. Okay, so when you reduce isolated action to three-dimensional space-time, we get this type of structure. Of structure for the stationary vacuum equations. And here we encode the harmonic map in terms of a symmetric positive definite matrix of determinant one, where you can see how the coefficients of the metric play a role here, F being the determinant of the torus fibers, and here are the twist potentials. Okay, so knowledge of the torus fiber metric F along with the twist potentials completely tells us the harmonic map and ability to Harmonic map and ability to solve this harmonic map equation actually allows us to solve the remaining equation by quadrature. So, really, the full stationary vacuum equations in this amount of axisymmetry reduces to a harmonic map with target SLN plus 1 mod SON plus 1. And the domain is flat R3. So these are all functions on the Rosie half plane. We add an extra fake rotation to make the geometry of the energy density. Of the energy density looks nice, and it becomes a flat R3 minus the Z-axis where all the topology is encoded. Okay, so it was known to Holland and Yejadyev that if you prescribe the rod structures, i.e. the topology, and the potential constants, namely the angular momenta, and you have some prescribed SN5, say Pelusic Line, then you have a unique solution. So we were interested in the converse problem given some. Converse problem: given some rod structures, i.e., given a topology, and given some angular momenta that you would like to prescribe for each of the black holes, can you solve the Einstein equations? And we found that this is true in great generality. There's essentially no restriction that we found. Any amount of angular momenta, any rod structure, so it means any type of topology you want. We can solve this harmonic map problem and produce a space-time. A space-time with some caveats that I will mention in a few slides. But the point is that this is not just a typical harmonic map problem. If you look at the way the harmonic map is encoded, you have a dividing by the determinant. And recall that on the boundary of the orbit space, this is where some of the killing fields vanish. So in particular, F will go to zero. So this is a singular harmonic map problem. And what you want to do to encode the topology. And what you want to do to encode the topology or encode the data in this harmonic band is to prescribe the way in which it blows up on the boundary of the orbit space or on the z-axis in R3. And so that's the difficulty. This is modulated by the fact that this is a non-positively curved target. So you have all the nice analytic properties for harmonic maps and non-positive curvature. So here's a very quick outline of how this proof works. It goes back to the work of Weinstein in the 90s, who did this for four dimensions. 90s, who did this for four dimensions. So, the strategy is to encode all the topology and the potential constants into a model map, what you can think of as an approximate solution. So, it's a map into the target space, and it has bounded tension. So, if tension is zero, then you're a harmonic map. Bounded tension measures how far away you are from being harmonic. And you obtain this model map by essentially pasting together known solutions in the Solutions in the sensitive regions, like on the axis where you want to have the prescribed blow-up, and also at infinity. And then in the intermediate regions, you just glue them together in some random way just to make sure that the tension is bounded. And of course, at infinity, we'd like the tension to go to zero. In fact, you can do this essentially so that it has compact support. So once you have this model map, you can use this as a type of Diersley boundary condition. How do you prescribe the boundary conditions for our PDE? Describe the boundary conditions for a PDE that blows up. We construct some model of the blow-up and then make sure that your solution actually follows that model map in a bounded way. So, our solutions that we produce, we want them to be asymptotic to this model map, stay bounded distance in the hyperbolic target to the model map, even near the blow-up region. And the analytic procedure we use is just to take a sequence of exhausting domains. So these domains stay away from the sensitive areas. Stay away from the sensitive areas. They get larger and larger and exhaust. We solve the harmonic map problem on these domains with the Deer-Slade boundary conditions and then make uniform estimates to make sure that this converges on compact subsets and then take a diagonal argument. So the idea is that the distance function has convexity properties because of the non-positive curvature, and that we can use the non-maximum principle to get a C0 bound. Local energy estimates for the harmonic boundary. Estimates for the harmonic map can be obtained just by a standard integration by parts argument. And lastly, again, using negative curvature, the Bochner formula for the harmonic map energy density combined with the Georgian National iteration gives you the ability to bootstrap and get all the other higher order estimates. Okay, and one last word about the topology is that there are also known classifications more so than. Classifications more so than the Friedman-Donson theorem in four dimensions because we're assuming axisymmetry, we can go a little bit higher. And it seems to be the case that it's always a connected sum of product of spheres in the spin case. And so then one can recognize this repetition and then make a conjecture that perhaps a domain-bound communication with this amount of axisymmetry is always going to be a connected sum of product of spheres, at least in the spin case. Product of spheres, at least in the spin case. All right, so what are the two caveats? The two caveats to the existence result that I mentioned before. One is that there's the question of analytic regularity. So that is you produce this harmonic map. It's a singular harmonic map. You have to take it and construct the space-time from the harmonic map. So you take these elements, you put them into the metric format that we had, the Volphippepentry form, and you want to make sure that the coefficients of that metric are regular across the axes. And so that means that you need to analyze the blow behavior. You need to analyze the blow-up behavior in a more detailed way, say the next term in the expansion of the blow-up for this remark map. And this was done in 4D by Chan and Li and independently by Weinstein. And Gwynn also did this in 2011 for the Einstein-Maxwell equations. But as far as I understand, this has not been carried out in the higher dimensional setting, but it's expected to hold without any significant difficulty. The main issue. The main issue that arises, and the main question that we have an interest in, are the conical singularities. So, Martin referred to these as struts on the axis. So, the point is when you construct the space-time, let me use some ink, when you construct the space-time, you have, say, an axis here. And then you can look at the disk emanating outward, and that disc may have a cone angle at the axis. And of course, At the axis. And of course, this just means that you have a fake matter distribution and you didn't really solve the Einstein equations. So we'd like to be able to say, prescribe the angular momentum in a certain way or prescribe the topology in a certain way such that these conical singularities are resolved. That's the main question. So this time, beyond the methods of constructing solutions explicitly, which is done a lot in the physics literature, we have A lot in the physics literature, we have explicit functions. You can check the conical singularities directly. There are two methods that I'd like to describe of how to resolve these conical singularities, and each time you pay a price. So this theorem that I attempted with my student Jordan Rinoni says that we can balance any of the configurations that we like in any dimension. This is in the static realm, not with the angular momentum. You can impart some angular momentum, but we can't control it. Angular momentum, but we can't control it. But we can balance any of these configurations in the static realm with a certain type of matter fuel. So, if you recall back to the results that I mentioned at the beginning, there were the black lens solutions of Kendori Lucyetti and also Tomizawa-Nozawa. So those were constructed in the realm of minimal supergravity. So they used this extra matter field, a type of Maxwell field, to help balance the possible conical singularity. The possible conical singularities. Here, the closet line-type matter is going to be used in a similar fashion. Okay, so a basic outline of how this argument works is the following. Say we're given a desired domain of added communication topology, in general dimension. So a sequence of rod structures and a sequence of horizons also inside there. We want to encode this topology in a higher dimension. This topology in a higher-dimensional realm. So, we're going to take that topology and put it into a simpler, higher-dimensional manifold, such that when I quotient down, I get back to this original. But the point is, it's sufficiently complicated here that I want to put it into a simpler setting. And that's the first step is to embed it in a higher dimensional topology that's simple. And the amount of extra dimensions that you require is commensurate with the amount of complexity for the topology that you initially prescribe. In fact, That you initially prescribe. In fact, the K here is the number of rod structures that you have. So each rod structure gives you essentially another non-trivial two-cycle, and so it makes the topology more and more complicated. Okay, so the second step is on this higher dimensional space-time manifold, we solve the static, could also be the stationary vacuum minus sign equations, but we can't control the angular momentum. So I'm mostly going to focus on the static case with the same congenty two torus action. Two torus action. So, even though we added extra dimensions, we're also going to add an extra amount of symmetry. So, that's always a conjugate T2 torus action. And then use the advantages of the simple topology and the simple solution. So, because it's a simple topology, we produce very simple solutions. In fact, they're explicit to balance any conical singularity. So, that's the second step. Now, that's a vacuum solution. So, when you go to the high-dimensional realm, it's a vacuum solution where we balance all the singularities. And then the last. balance all the singularities and then the last step is to quotient back down to the original topology in a certain way so that you produce the the correct rod structures and then you get a solution that's regular but because of this quotient mechanism you add matter fields and so these are what we were calling the calluza klein matter fields that you get in the solution okay so in a little bit more detail let's say we have a k rod structure so uh gamma are the little intervals Gamma are the little intervals on the z-axis, and v's are the actual rod structures, which are a sequence of integers that tell you which linear combination of killing fields vanishes. The way to embed this into a simpler rod structure, a higher dimensional topology, is to keep the same intervals on the z-axis. They're exactly the same. But we change the rod structures in addition to adding more dimensions. So instead of just having n dimensions of rotation, we have n plus k dimensions. We have m plus k dimension of rotation. So our vectors get longer, and we take the same broad structures. So these are exactly the same as before, but we add to each one of them a standard basis vector that's far out in the extra dimensions that we added. So just it's a fairly simple procedure, and it's not clear exactly why to do this, and perhaps there's other ways to do this. But the reason that we do this is because with this new rod structure, it certainly encodes the old rod structure. It certainly encodes the old rod structure, and we can derive one from the other. But with this new rod structure, we can change coordinates in the torus. Okay, so there's an explicit coordinate change, so an SL M plus K Z matrix, which changes from the coordinates that the rod structures that we would like to have, and it changes them into the standard basis vectors. And it's just a matrix you can write down explicitly in terms of a submatrix determined by the original rod structures. The original rod structures. And so, what's so good about this type of rod structure? Well, we have a rod structure now that consists just simply of the standard basis. Okay, so one, zero, zero, zero, one, zero, two, and so forth. With this type of topology, this is our rod structure setup now. We know exactly what it is. In fact, there are classifications for this. Just again, a connected sum, a product of spheres with some additional tori. So, okay, fine. We know what the topology. Tori. So, okay, fine, we know what the topology is, but moreover, we can solve the Einstein equations there. And that'll be on the next slide. Here's just a schematic of what we have done so far. We start with some initial rosy half-plane, which has some type of, say, lens space here, of RP3 horizon, and a sequence of rod structures unlabeled down here. We go and embed this into a higher-dimensional setup, as we stated before, with the new rod structures. Said it before with the new rod structures, and then we make a coordinate change of the torus. So we don't change any topology, it's just changing, is just realizing what it is. It becomes a now much simpler rod structure, and then we know exactly what the topology is. And here we're going to solve the vacuum Einstein equations and then quotient back down to get the original topology. Okay. All right, so here's how we solve the Einstein equations up above. So this Einstats in this method for this Method for this observation for solving the static vacuum eigen equations in this in this setup was investigated thoroughly by Empron and Rial before they produced their black ring solution. So we have, you can see the Valoha-Papetu setup, where here the torus components are simply orthogonal to each other, and there's no twisting with the base three-dimensional manifold. So they're just simply orthogonal and there's no twisting. And there's no twisting. The drawback to this is that you can only produce very simple rud structures. You can only make this function vanish for each of the torso generators. And so the only type of rudd structures you can get are the standard basis solution, the standard basis vectors. So that means it's perfect for the type of rust structure that we have from the previous slide. And it turns out that the static vacuum Einstein equations with this onsatz reduce simply This onsatz reduced simply to producing harmonic functions UI. So you take a sequence of harmonic functions. They're harmonic on R3. They're actually symmetric harmonic functions. You can produce them explicitly in terms of logarithms. And the only thing you require about these harmonic functions is that they blow up on a prescribed interval on the z-axis. So they're a Green's function. They produce a uniform charge distribution on a certain interval on the z-axis. And you want them to have a certain type of to have a certain type of asymptotic there in terms of two log rho, but that turns out to be the case. You can write them down again explicitly. Moreover, the conical singularity angle defect, we can calculate the angle defect here. It's just the limit of this quantity in terms of the harmonic function as you approach one of the axis rods. Here, alpha is some combination of the first derivatives of the harmonic functions, which you can solve. Functions, which you can solve, it's a piece of the metric, but you can solve it by quadrature once you have the harmonic functions. And whatever this constant is, this is the conical singularity. Okay, but if you notice, these are harmonic, all I need are harmonic functions. And if I add a constant to a harmonic function, it still is harmonic, and it's still going to blow up at the same rate at the boundary. So it still satisfies the property that encodes the rod structure. So, in fact, I can add constants here to the harmonic functions to balance. To the harmonic functions to balance each of the conical singularities. And I don't pay any price for it in terms of it doesn't affect any of the other axis rod conical singularities. Because of this orthogonal structure and there's no twisting between any of the torus components, we can add constants. This is the next slide. We can add constants to each of the harmonic function to balance the conical singularity. So in a sense, it's just a scaling of the circle for each of these tori so that they are. These tori so that they are balanced. Now, if you were trying to preserve asymptotic flatness or something of that nature, then this would destroy that. But here, we're not trying to preserve any type of special asymptotics other than it just is some type of collusic pine asymptotics at affinity. So that's perfectly fine. So we've balanced the conical singularities. We have a solution to the static vacuum Einstein equations in this higher dimensional realm. And each black hole is an And each black hole is an S3 because of the simple rod structures. But there's an interesting corollary to this, and that is that we can do the same procedure if we don't have any horizons at all. So we can take a sequence of rod structures on the z-axis with no horizons and just solve again with our harmonic functions. And in this situation, it turns out that if you add up all the harmonic functions and subtract two log rho, and then find an appropriate. And then find an appropriate constant so that this goes to zero at infinity, which it turns out there's always you can find such an asymptote constant, so you just choose that constant. Then what you have is a globally harmonic function on R3, except possibly the z-axis, but it stays bounded there, and it goes to zero to infinity. So one can apply a maximum principle, or weak version of the maximum principle, used by Weinstein a long time ago to show that this function vanishes. Now, this function turns out to be the static. function turns out to be the static potential. So now we have a constant static potential and therefore our time slice for this static space-time without horizons is a Ricci-flat. It's a complete Ricci-flat manifold with some interesting topology, which is exactly the topologies that I mentioned before. So these, let me, the connected summer product of spheres, if you compactify. Anyway, so this is a new type of gravitational inseton not obtained using any Obtained using any Kaler or hyper Kaler onslaughts, so it's not special holonomy. We check the holonomy, it's generic holonomy. Okay, so the last step in the procedure is to quotient. Okay, so we want to quotient back and get the original topology. So the idea is in the original coordinates, you can view it in the original coordinates as just a projection from the first to the first n component. So we recall we added k additional torus dimensions. Additional torus dimensions. And so in the original torus, it would just be a strict projection. Those were the extra standard basis elements that we added to the rod structure. So that kills those off, and we get just the original rod structure. But in the geometry of the solution that we produced, the torus that we're quotienting by is, of course, twisted. And so when we look at the metric, the total space metric of this object that we're taking the quotient of, well, it has a submersion format. So here's the Submersion format. So here's the quotient metric here in this, the one we're interested in, the Bell Pepetri form. But there's a torus fiber metric and then some gauge fields here that show the twisting with respect to the base manifold. So our solution that we want to have, the metric that we take at the end for the original dimension is this quotient metric g. G. And I should emphasize this is very different than the solutions we produced previously in the other theorem, which were by theoretical means. Each of the functions here is or can be written down explicitly as a linear combination of harmonic functions on R3, axisymmetric harmonic functions. Those axisymmetric harmonic functions are just in terms of logarithms. So if you have a very complicated rod structure, these will of course be very complicated, but at least they can be written down. But at least they can be written down explicitly. So the question is: what are the matter fields that we get? Well, if you go to the O'Neill formula and look up the formula for the scalar curvature of a Riemannian submersion, well, it has a very nice structure. And that is that, so the total base scalar curvature of the Einstein reaction becomes the scalar curvature of the base, and then this sequence of objects here. And it turns out, well, these are written in terms of the torus. Well, these are written in terms of the torus fiber metric, but these combined together give the harmonic map into the same symmetric space, but with a different dimension. And this gives the Lagrangian for abelian gauge fields. These are the gauge fields here. So we call this collusion client matter. But it turns out to be in the physics literature called a sigma model. And there's also some abelian gauge fields associated with this. So we don't solve the vacuum Einstein equation. We solve the Einstein equations coupled. Solve the Einstein equations coupled to this special type of matter, and we can solve on any topology that we like. Okay, so I'd like to just mention in the last just minute or two some result that I obtained with Martine, Gilbert, and Sumio. This is older, but since it's related to the previous topic and also Martine's talk. So, Martine talked about the Kurok and Nikolai solutions where you About the Kurok and Nikolai solutions, where you superimpose an infinite number of short-shield black holes and they're balanced in four dimensions. Well, you can do that in higher dimensions. So, we showed that one can do this, superimpose an infinite number of spheres or S1 cross-s2s and produce a static vacuum solution. And the reason for the balancing is the same as the reason for the Myers-Broken Nikolai solutions: that the periodicity of the solution helps balance the conical sync. Helps balance the conical singularities. And an interesting corollary, again, as before, is that if we do this procedure, which you cannot do this in four dimensions, but in higher, say, five dimensions, you can do this where you have an infinite sequence, again, of axis rods with no horizons whatsoever, as long as it's a periodic rod structure, then you can still solve the equations and balance all the conical singularities due to the periodicity. The periodicity. And we found a nice solution where the time slice is an infinite connect sum of S2 plus S2s. And because, again, there's no horizon, you get that the time slice is a Ricci-flat, a complete Ricci-flat minimal. So we produced Ricci-flat, complete Reachy flat on an infinite connect sum of S2 cross S2. So here's the, just to visualize the rod structure. So you can see this is a periodic sequence of rod. Sequence of rod structures. And these dotted lines indicate where each. So this is one of the S2 plus S2s. Here's another S1 cross S2. This interval, it sells, as I described before, is an S3. So this is where the connected sum is appearing. And so you have this infinite connect sum of S2 cross S2s, and it's a regular solution all the way down. So I think I'm out of time. So I will go ahead and stop here.
