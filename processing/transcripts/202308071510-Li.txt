So, it's my pleasure to introduce our next speaker, Dr. Yang Yangli from the University of Chicago. He will talk about the resistance and the variety of unassociated linear surfaces in 3 magnitudes. Yeah, thanks for the introduction. I would like to thank the organizer for the invitation. So, today I'm going to talk about anatropic minimum surfaces. So, what are they? So, we know that So, what are they? So, we know that minimal surfaces are critical points of the area functional. So, we have many experts here working on minimal surfaces. We know that it has many, they have many applications in both math or outside math. And here from a picture, you can see that those are like two catanol and helicoid. They are very basic minimal surfaces in Euclidean space. We can also view them as some kind of building block of minimal surfaces in R3. Three, um, okay, so there are critical points of the area functional, and we know that for the area functional, it's basically saying that for every point we should put some infinitesimal area element, which is always one. But in real life, or maybe in physics, it's too ideal because we should expect that could be some perturbation on the area functional. And that's the reason we would like to consider anisotropic mineral surfaces. Uh, mineral surfaces. So, when the substance involved is anatomical, meaning that the energy, the surface energy, is directional dependent. So, for example, like crystals, the surface energy depends on its direction. And here is a picture of some crystals. For example, this is the largest one is the havenium. This is some metal crystal. And you can see that the shape of that is not like a sphere. Shape of that is not like a sphere because if we consider, say, the area functional, like the CMC surface for the area functional, then what we obtain is always a sphere. But here you can see many facets on that. The reason for that is that the area, the surface energy, the surface tension depends on the direction. So that's the reason it doesn't look like a sphere. And there are also critical points, but for a new functional, we call it unentropic functional. And this is. Be functional, and this is also closely related to the Finceler geometry. If you consider things one-dimensional lower, so this is like if we consider something similar to the error functional, it's always like a geodesic, but if it's directional dependent, then this is something in physical geometry. The distance always depends on the direction. And so, unentropy minimal surfaces, they are critical points of the unentropic surface energy. So, before I'm going to the rigorous definition of anotropic energy, let me give you some, tell you some notation that I'm going to use. The first one is that Mg here we always consider to be a three-dimensional closed Riemannian manifold. Here, closed means that it's compact and has no boundary. And secondly, we consider the notation SM to denote the unitation bundle of the manifold. Of the manifold m. So it's like for every point x associated with xv is just a tangent vector at the point. And we also use the following notation, courtesy of m, which denotes the space of sets of finite parameter. Another folder is culture poly sets. It's just basically saying that if we consider the curtain, a given set inside is even a subset of the manifold, and then if we consider Subset of the manifold. And then, if we consider its characteristic functional function, then it should be a B V function, body variation function. And for every culture poly set, we can define this reduced boundary, d star omega. It's the set where if we consider the radon-nicodium derivative of this current function, then it has density one. And this reduced boundary has some important properties. For example, Important properties. For example, it's always a subset of the topological boundary. This is something that we expect. And the second one is saying that it's better than just considering its topological boundary is that almost every point in this reduced boundary, we can always find the tension plan in the measured sense. And the third reason that we consider this cultural policy sets or boundary cultural policy sets, because if we consider the whole If we consider the whole space of reduced boundary, then this is what proved by Emgrand saying that the whole space is weakly homotopy equivalent to Rp infinity. So here, as you can see, this is like the controversial is a double cover of this space. And then for every n, the n's cohomology is always z2 if we take the z2 coefficient. So, this way we can see something like a Morse theory where you try to look for We try to look for say critical points of the area functional or even the unentropy surface functional. We can always work on this space and then using this non-trivial topology to find out critical point. Okay, so now let's turn to the unatropic energy. So for every atrophic integral, it's an even positive smooth function f from the unit tangent model. F from the unit tension model to a positive to the positive real number. And it's even meaning that this is dependent, even means that f of xv is the same as f of x minus v. And in practice, in order to obtain some estimates on the PD I'll mention later, we also need to impose some elliptic conditions on F and did something just saying. And this something just saying that if we consider the second unit of f with respect to v, it should be always positive. The hashing is always positive. But for simplicity, let's ignore this part. And then with this integral, then we can define the so-called anisotropic energy with respect to F. So given a Bausian catch-up set, then we can define the energy to be the integration. To be the integration of f along this boundary. So, as you can imagine, if f is always a constant, then in fact, this will give us the area functional because basically we just integrate the surface area and surface area element. And similar to the definition of minimal surface, we just consider the unison minimal surface. The unentrophic minimum surface to be the critical point of this given unentrophic energy. So, if we put some, we put an arbitrary vector field on the manifold, and if we do the perturbation along the vector field, the first order should always be zero. And this is the definition of minimal surface. So, as you can see, even though we call it minimal, but it's not necessarily minimal, it's just like a quick point. Okay, so you know, next. Okay, so in the next slide, we'll see some examples. So the first one is, as I mentioned before, if f is always one, if it's always a constant, then this is just the area functional. And the second case is always, some people are also studying that is the weighting manifold case. So in this case, f is only, we know that f is a function with respect to both x and v. To both x and v, but if it's independent of the direction, if it only depends on the point v, then this could be viewed as, say, minimal surface inside a weighting manifold. And the third one is I'll show you some PDs because so, for example, if you consider M to be the three-dimensional Euclidean space, or maybe a flat torus, and then F of X V is in the of the point, but it just depends on the direction in the tension. Depends on the direction in the tension space. Then we'll see that if we do the computation, if we can derive the Euler-Lagrange equation, is the following. The divergence of D of F minus twice H of F is zero. So here, D is with respect to the V direction. Okay, so as you can see, the left-hand side, you can see the mean H is the mean conversion. So basically, we can say that the left-hand side is the anisotropic mean conversion. Incursion. And we can also compute the second variation, which gives us the so-called Jacobi operator below. So you may compare the Jacobi operator in Jishao's talk, the previous topic. And USDA is more complicated than that. And that's the reason we need to impose some elitic condition to make sure that this will give us a elite. Electric operator. So, this is our setting. Is there any question on this unison? So, it's just like a kind of natural generalization, but can still put on some direction on the something on the tangent space. Okay, so the first question is that why we only study surface here, the main reason is that it. The main reason is that in this case, if we consider a more strict condition, it's not just minimal, but it's actually area minimizing. Then it was proved by Anguen Simon in 1977 and later Shen Simon in 82. They showed that every F-array minimizing hypersurface is regular, but up to a single set of co-dimension, at least two parts epsilon. So, in particular, if we just consider the surface case, then each of Surface case, then it should always be smooth everywhere. But if we consider things like one dimension higher, that could be some singular point. And in that case, we need to deal with the singular set. And indeed, this is kind of sharp. Frank Morgan in 1991, he constructed some example, just which is a cone over a cliff of Taurus, which lives in four-dimensional Euclidean space. And it's very minimizing, but we know that because this is a cone. Minimizing, but we know that because this is a core. So the origin is indeed a singular point. So in high dimension, in general, singularity is inevitable. But as you can see, there's a gap over there. We are here, the single point is codim three. But the first reason only saying that it's two parts is. So it's still open, like what is the sharp dimension? Dimension, whether that one, whether the epsilon could be one or whether that could be some fractional house of dimension is a wide open problem. And similar to the area case, once we have this singular area minimum call, we can consider the value of the Bernstein problem. So in this case, Kono Mooney and Yang, last year they showed that for the anisotropic case in R5. Case in R5, there exists a nonlinear graph. So in the area functional case, we know that this is in the nine-dimensional Euclidean space. But here, the sharp case is the five-dimensional. And there's also another result by Ottischodo and Chauly. They show that if F is sufficiently close to one, then every immersed stable minimal hybrid. Every immense stable minimum hypothesis in the four-dimensional space is flat. So maybe there is some hope to prove the regularity in dimension four, but we need to assume that f is sufficient close to one. But it's still unknown whether or not one can do that. Yeah. And there are also many other people working on this problem in different ways. Okay. So the goal here is. So, the goal here is trying to find a smooth unattributable minimal surface with respect to some elliptic integral in a three-dimensional closed manifold. Okay, so the method that I'm going to use is as same as the previous two talks, is also the min-max theory. And here we can see the so-called ungrounded case minimax theory. Let's recall that. Let's recall that in the isotropic case, in other words, in the area functional setting. So, a sui part on M is a continuous map from a unit interval to the space of caching poly sets such that omega 0 is the empty set and omega 1 is the whole manifold. And the collection of all three parts will be denoted by this curly S. So as you can see in the picture, we can consider omega 0 is the point on the left hand side. The point on the left-hand side, and omega-1 is the whole manifold. So you just sweep, you'll see that this map is sweeping out the whole manifold, and that's the reason why it's called sweepout. And this is non-trivial. That's why you cannot deform, you cannot isotropically deform that to just a point, a constant map, for example. So, and that's the reason why we know that the so-called min-max width is always positive. We define that as. We define that as the volume. You've seen the same definition in the previous talk. And this width, because this is a minimax value, we should expect that to be realized by a single point. This is like the multi-pipe theorem. You can see that when t is zero, then you see that we can see that's the point A and one is the point B. They have lower elevation. So you should expect we can find a path of the can find a path of the least elevation and see with the see which is has the highest elevation should be the critical point so that's the the settle point and this is how uh grandpeace and later uh markets and iv they are able to obtain the minimal uh surface is the following we let's assume that we are able to find a optimal sweep of omega so if So, in other words, like the width is really realized by the mean mass of this given one. But in this case, you can see that the slice with the area, which is exactly W, is not necessarily a critical point. The reason is that, so for me, so we should expect that this one to be the critical slice, but even when this But even when this size could close to a point, it could with quite a lot, it can also have the area which is exactly w. So, we need to the first thing is to get rid of this weakening slice. And that's the so-called prototype precision. We put it tight such that for any slice, it should look like just flat. And then we can get a new min-max sequence. Sequence and in this case, the slide which is close to the endpoint would decrease their area quickly. So that's the reason in this case, the slices achieving the width are exactly critical slices. Okay. And because we're starting with some functional cultural policy, those are just something, some geometric object in geometry measure theory. Manage theory. When we take the limit, they are not necessarily smooth. So we just find some weak solution. So we need to improve its regularity. This was done by Shane Simon in 1981. They showed that indeed the critical slices are smooth. And this result relies on obtaining some curvature estimates for stable minimal hypersurfaces using the standard blob analysis and also. Analysis and also the application of a stability inequality. So the option is that this ungramped minimap theory can really find a smooth embedded minimal surface in the closed three-dimensional closed three manifolds. Okay, so we are trying to adapt this idea to our anisotropy setting, but find that there's a But I find that there's a difficulty. So the first thing is that we expect to obtain some removal singularity from distributed inequality. That's from this is the when we do the second variation. If it's stable, then we get this inequality. And if we move the second term to the left-hand side, we obtain the new one. New one. So if we know that sigma has a single point at a given t, then we can use a cutoff cheek. We plug in some cutoff function. And then we can get a bound, a L2 bound on the second fundamental form. A is a second fundamental form from the right-hand side. And then by some standard trick, we can show that it's indeed A is L infinity bound boundary. So P is a removal singularity. Here we Here we essentially use the fact that if you consider this, I call it area ratio bound. That's we consider the area of this of the current or maybe this sigma in a neighbor in a geodesic ball of radius R and compare that with the disk. We can see that the superframe always bounded, it's uniformly bounded. And that's how we're able to get the bound on the first time. Because if we do a cutoff chip, we Because if we do a cutoff chip, we put inside a cutoff function, we obtain one over r square on the first term. And we need a bound. Okay. And Allard, indeed, William Allard, in his paper in 1983, he generalized the Shane-Simon scheme, but just for smooth, stable, unsmoof, minimal hypersurfaces. And he conjectured that. Surfaces. And he congested that we can obtain the smooth minimal hyper surface using this minimax theory. But the big issue here is that we are not able. Sorry, let me go back to this part. The difficulty is to get this ratio bound. So we proved Amgrain's conjecture in dimension three. This was joint work with This was joint work with Guido de Philippis and Antonio de Rosa. And we showed that given an arbitrary closed three-dimensional Riemannian manifold and an elliptic integral, then we are able to find a smooth unatrolled minimal surface. And this was an improvement of their previous result. In the previous last year, they showed that they can find an unattropher minimal surface with at most one single point. So basically, we removed that single point. Single point. And the primary challenge for us is that there is no monotonicity formula in the analogy setting. So this is something the monotonous formula is very essential in geometric analysis or even geometric flow minimal surfaces theory. So let's take a look at the so-called mortality formula. In the area case, if we define A of R to be the area of the minimal surface. The minimal surface in the ball of radius r. And then, if we type in, because we know this is a clear point, so we can put some vector field, which is here we put the radially pointing out, pointing outwards vector field, and we obtain the following inequality there. And this tells us that A of R over R squared is increasing. So, this tells us that So this tells us that if I have a bound, let's see, let me try to draw a channel here. Suppose that this is a minimal hyper surface, and if I have a bound on the area of radius one, then we are able to obtain the area bound of the radius, say, some delta, no matter how delta, no matter how small delta is, we were able to get a bound. We were able to get about that, the DM ratio. And when we do the blob analysis, we just need to do the rescaling to make this delta one, delta ball to be a ball of radius one. And then we do the blob. We hope to get a limit. And the motivation here tells us that once we have the, it gives us an upper bound on the area, and it guarantees the existence of the limit, at least in the weak size. However, in the unatrolled setting, we will see that actually we have, if we do the same computation, we obtain this new inequality. But there's a constant lambda there. Lambda is just the radius of the maximum of f and the ratio of maximum f and the minimum of f because it's directional dependence. So for some direction, the So for some direction, the length could be larger, the surface energy element could be larger, but for some direction it could be smaller. And the ratio would appear in the inequality. And once we plug in this one, we'll see that over r to the power 2 over lambda, this is increasing. But this could not give us the error ratio boundary of we like. What we really need is F of R. what we really need is f of r over r square. Here is f of r over r q 2 over lambda. So 2 over lambda is some number less than 2. So you can see that when r goes smaller, this one will be much larger than the first one. The second one is much larger than the first one. So you will not able to get them. Sorry, when argos are smaller, the first one is much larger than the second one. Larger than the second one, so you are not able to get a bar on the first one in general. And this tells us that if we just do the block, we will not able to get the limit like the tangent space or tangent colour. Yeah, that's the main difficulty that we need to address in the analyst traffic setting. Okay. So, the key idea in our group is. The key idea in our group is trying to obtain a bound for the list because there was a paper by, I think also by Art. Basically, he says that module some technical assumption, the monotonic formula, the existence of monotonic formula is equivalent to saying that f is exactly the area functional. But because we are considering general anatomic energy, so we should not expect. Energy. So, we should not expect the existence of the motoristic formula. Instead, we would like to prove that even though we don't have the motivation formula, we can still get this error ratio bound. And this is like the proposition. We're saying that we're able to find a constant which only depends on the area manifold and the unentrophic energy. It doesn't depends on the sweep part or anything like that, but still, the cryo slice in the remax construction, it always has this. It always has this ratio bound, every ratio bound. And once we have this proposition, as I mentioned before, we can do a block analysis. We can do a block and then we take a look at this geometry object and then try to show that it should be regular. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So that's a good question. So when we do Yeah, so that's a good question. So, when we do it pre-type, even though it looks like it's getting that, but this is macroscopic, it's not microscopic. Because when we do it pre-type, we only see the area. We couldn't see the error ratio. We need to make sure the error ratio holds for arbitrary radius. So, in the small scale scale, we could not see that. See that. So that's the reason we need to find a different way to prove that. Okay. So this is a sketch of proof of the previous proposition. So let's assume that we start with some optimally suite path. Let me show the picture here. Assume that this is the suite path. This is the NBL manifold. And then we have the super here. And then we have the three part here. It looks like almost flat, but only macroscopically. And let's assume that this is exactly the critical slice. And we argue by concern: suppose that we can find a point P in the previous size with high density. In other words, the error ratio. In other words, the error ratio bound fails. Then, in the picture, as you can see, in some small scale, the slice should look like the picture here. The red is the creole slice. You will get quite a lot. So that's how we can have some point with high density in the quival set. High density in the queue slash. So if the ratio is really large, what we try to do is we just cut out this slice, cut out the sweet part in this neighborhood, and replace it by some flat sweep part, which I cut and paste. So you'll see something incompatible on the boundary. So you need to. Boundary, so you need to get some estimate of the boundary. But the good thing is that because apparently this archibald can assume that the density is really large, so you can compensate the area on the boundary. And when we do this cut and paste, we'll see that the mean-max value of this new three part will be strictly less than the original one. And that gives us a contradiction because we Because we assume that we start with some optimal sweepout, but now we obtain a new sweepout which has a smaller switch, smaller width. Okay, so this is just a rough idea, but in practice, so we need to do more because it's not necessarily true that there is only one critical size. There could be more. And you need to make sure that they can, you are able to do this cut and paste on multiple domains and make them. Domains and make them compatible. But this is like the sketch. Okay. So once we have this one, then we are able to conclude the existence of a smooth RHP minimal surface. So here's our strategy. The first one, we adapt the ungrampy minima construction to the RHOP setting. And the second step is to apply our proposition before to show. Proposition before to show that the previous slice has this area regional bounds. And then the next step would be to get the regularity. So we need to adapt the Shen-Simon or maybe Shane-Simon Yao curvature estimates to this case and then to remove the singularity. But this is also not that trivial. The reason is that previously in the area functional case, we have the multi-ti formula. Basically, it can tell us more information. Basically, it can tell us more information. For example, when we do the block, the tension space, if it exists, it should be a cone. But in our case, we only obtain, or we only know that we have aeration bounds, the limit exists. It does not necessarily be a cone. So there are some estimate losing. You cannot just using the original one to obtain the estimate. But fortunately, in the surface case, we can apply some birth-signed type theorem. Bird-signed type theorem by Brown White on the stable mean unactual mineral surface to showing that with some configuration distances space, if it's smooth and if it's stable, then it should be a plan. So we don't need to get from call to plan. We directly from just a tangent space to a plan. This is how we are able to show the smoothness. And also, And also, by some contradictory argument, we are able to get the coefficient estimates as what Shen Simon or maybe Shen Simon Yao did in their original paper. Okay, so this is like the story of the construction of unattropher minimal surfaces. And this one, so to my collaborators, because they've been working on the anatomy minimal surfaces. Minimal surfaces for many years. So, this is a very good result for them. But personally, my motive, I've been working on the minimal surfaces using min-max to construct minimal surfaces in, say, close to running manifolds. So, my motivation study the unattributive minimal surfaces is to get some extra information on the original one, on the error function, query points for error functional. So, here are some query functions. Functional. So, here are some questions that I would like to consider. The first one is about the so-called violence. In the isotropic case, as I mentioned at the beginning, we know that in actual polyset, the space of cultural polyset between modules, this is because we know that the boundary of a cartial poly set is the same as the boundary of the complement of the given set. Uh, the complement of the given set. So, this is like a boundary, this is weakly homotopy to R infinity. So, we can consider the previous constraint, three part is just one parameter family, but in fact, we can consider two parameter family, three parameter family, key parameter family. And for each one, it can give us a sort of key width, index width. And Bernardo Anche and Ebini in 2007, they showed that actually. 207, they show that actually it grows some linearly. This something like the value for the item values for, say, harmonic functions Laplace. Okay. And in fact, we can follow that proof to obtain a similar result to prove the P with sublinear growth for the P with these anisotropic minimal surfaces. Surfaces. But then something appears onto the volume term because in the volume term, we say it's something related to L functional, it doesn't depend on direction. But when we replace it by f, the f functional, there should be some term up here. F only depends on f at a given point. The question is that, can we find an explicit formula for this m of f? If we are able to find that, then we. If we are able to find that, then we'll see that the left-hand side has something to do with the mean-max minimum hypothesis, minimum surfaces, and the right-hand side is something related to the volume. Here is something related to the anatomical energy. It's like a bridge connecting these two different geometry objects. And one application of this one is to study the distribution of the minimal surface, mean maximum surfaces in a given closed three manifolds. Given close three manifolds. And Fedora Anché and Antoine, they showed that for general metric G, they were able to find a sequence of minimal surfaces equally distributed in a closed three manifolds. But here, once we consider the ionization setting, actually we are considering not just the MBM manifold, we are considering the graphs manual because the space that we consider when we define it. The space that we consider when we define the F is S of M S M. This is the unit tangent bundle. This is just the double cover of the Waxmanian bundle of M. So this bound law gives us a connection, a bridge connecting the unstructured minimum surfaces and the Grace-Mannium bundle, deformation of Grace-Manny bundle. So the question is that can one prove a generic equation. Prove a generic equidistribution of unshocked surfaces in the Grand Smanning bundle. This was originally conjectured by this paper. They conjectured that minimal surfaces, they are, at least for genetic metric, they are equally distributed in the grace-manual manner. This was already known for, for example, in the hyperbolic case. And for some arithmetic degree manifolds, there are also some. manifolds there are also some some results similar to that but it's still widely unknown for general degree manifolds even for boundary metrics yeah so those are the questions that i would like to study in the future okay i think i'll stop here thank you
