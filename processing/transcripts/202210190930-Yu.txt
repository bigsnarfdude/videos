Thank you for having me here. And today I'll talk about our research on the nonlinear mechanics of epidermal cell walls. So we know that plants are subjected to different kinds of forces, including external forces like wind and internal forces like internal tissue pressure and turger pressure. And all these require the plant cell water to be strong enough to keep the mechanical intelligence. Strong enough to keep the mechanical integrity of the plants. And especially in the primary cell wall, they also need to be extensible enough to allow plant cells to grow. So, overall, it is requiring the primary cell wall to be not only strong enough, but also extensible. And this shows that this kind of mechanical property plays very important parts for plants to achieve different kinds of purpose and functions. However, our understanding of the mechanical property of the primary Of the mechanical property of the primary cell wall are still quite limited. And a better understanding of that will not only tell us more about the wall structure and the physical responses of the wall as a material, as well as inspire the design of biomimic materials and provide valuable parameters to help us build plant models to simulate the plant growth and other physical responses. So we have these questions for the mechanical properties. For the mechanical properties, like how extensible and strong are the primaries, or the abdominal cell walls, and how does the stiffness of the wall change during deformation, and what happens if we stretch the wall cyclically and repetitively. So to do that, first, we use onion as a model organism where we are able to isolate this seven micron thick onion epidermal peel that only consists of a single layer of primary cell walls. And what's more important. And what's more importantly is that we are able to prepare this material into desirable sites for mechanical tests, which is critical for the further parameter and data analysis. And to perform different kinds of tensile tests to the wall, we have this device where we're able to stretch the wall according to our programmed protocol. And that also allow us to monitor the amount of deformation as well as the applied force. As well as the applied forces at the same time during the stretching. And here shows a video of the onion peels that is being stretched. So to study the mechanical responses of the onion pedermal wall, we plot the stretch-strain curve of the onion peels that is being stretched in different protocols. So first, we would use the monotonic loading test where we would stretch the wall as much as possible and record its first time load. And record its first-time loading response. And then following that, we have cyclic loading tests where we would stretch the wall cyclically and record the loading and unloading process. And finally, we have this progressive cyclic loading test where we would stretch the wall cyclically to different stress and strain to show how this property changes along stretching. So the first experiment we did is the monotonic loading test where we stretched the wall as much as possible. Test where we stretch the wall as much as possible or until our device limit. And we can see that for the wall peeled from both longitudinal and transverse directions, they are able to be stretched to 50% of its original length without breakage. And the maximum stress they're able to reach is around or even more than 50 MPascal, which is comparable to the rubber band. And if we take a closer look on the Closer look on the shape of the stress-strength curve, we can see that they can all be characterized into three different phases, starting with the stiffening region where the modules of the wall are increasing. And as the stress reach to a certain point, the wall starts to yield where the modules of the wall starts to decrease. And finally, it will reach this linear region where the stiffness of wall stays constant. And the fact that the wall shows this non-linear three-phase stress-drawn response suggests. Three-phase stress-drawn response suggests that the wall would have different mechanical response at different stress and strain, and potentially the underneath molecular movement of the polymers could be different at different stress and strain. And further, we performed cyclic loading tests where we would stretch the wall, we would load the wall and unload the wall at the same speed and do that repetitively. And we, in this test, is able to reveal three different kinds of properties. As we can see, Of properties. As we can see, that after the first cyclic loading, there are a certain amount of irreversible deformation when we start to stretch the wall again. And we term this plastic deformation. And as we mentioned before, starting from the second cycle, the curve become elastic and repeatable, meaning that if we stretch the material for third, fourth, or fifth time, the stress-run curve would remain reflectable. The stress-run curve would remain roughly the same. And third, interestingly, we can see that the loading and unloading curve of the material follow different paths. And this is often referred to as hysteresis. And the area of this gap between the loading and unloading path is the amount of energy that is being dissipated during this deformation. And hysteresis is actually a very common or typical feature for the viscoelastic material. For the viscoelastic material, and this is a kind of material that has both elastic and viscous property. And one important feature of this material is that their deformation is time and rate dependent, meaning that if we stretch the material with a much slower rate, they would reach a higher amount of deformation. So we want to test this rate dependency on the Y as well. So here shows an example of the rate. Here shows an example of the rate-dependent deformation, and the material we use is the packing strip. In this experiment, we would pre-stretch the wall repetitively to minimize the amount of plastic deformation and make sure the stretching curve becomes repeatable. And we can see that as we lower the stretching speed, the material would reach a higher amount of deformation and even some additional plastic deformation. So, however, if we did the same experiment on the unipidermal wall, Experiment on the onion epidermal wall, we can see that the stress-run curve of the wall stays the same as we lower the stretching speed with 100-fold. So this suggests a rate-independent elastic deformation. And we also repeat this experiment at 4 degrees Celsius, where the viscosity of the material would tend to increase, and we're more likely to see a rate-dependent deformation. However, in the 4,000 degree, we still... In the four-cells of degree, we still see that the stress-run curve of the onion epidermal will remain the same as we lower the stretching speed. So, there are a couple of insights from this experiment. And first is that by comparing the material property from pectin and onion epidermal wall, we can see that pectin may play a very limited role in the reversible deformation of the wall, that they are not directly involved in this. Involved in this reversible deformation of the wall as we see in the coarse current model of the wall as well. And the second insight is that the fact that we didn't see any rate-dependent elastic deformation of the wall suggesting that this elastic deformation could be completed very quick and require very little relaxation time. And if we look at this at the molecular scale from the coarse group model, we see that the We see that the main mechanism of elastic deformation, potentially the straightening and reorientation of fiber, they might require, they could be completed relatively quickly and require very little relaxation time as well. So now that we know the elastic deformation is rate independent, but how about the plastic deformation? So to do that, we stretch the wall at different strain rates and record the first loading curves. And just by first glance, Just by first glance, we can see that the wall shows a higher amount of deformation at lower speed. And if we measure the resulting plastic strain at different speed, and we can see that the material has a higher amount of plastic strain at lower speed. So collectively, this suggests that the plastic deformation of the wall appears to be rate dependent. And if we relate this back to the molecular scale, the main mechanism. The mechanism of the plastic deformation, the sliding of the fiber, are potentially rate and time dependent, suggesting that this is a molecular movement that might require a longer amount of relaxation time and appears to be time dependent. So, now that we know the wall behaves as a nonlinear stress-frame curve, and we're able to review different mechanical properties. Properties with the cyclic loading test, we use this progressive cyclic loading test where we stretch the wall and unload the wall and then stretch and unload the wall at a higher stress. And we do that with the increasing amount of stress that ranging from the stiffening yield into the linear region. And to quantify these properties, we developed this analytical framework where we could analyze the reversibility of the water from. Reversibility of the wall deformation and the partition of the input energy in terms of whether they are being dissipated or they are being stored in the wall. And finally, we are able to see how does the stiffness of the wall changes at different stress. And collectively, with this experiment and framework, we're able to allow parameter analysis at different stresses. And due to the time limit, I will not go. And due to the time limit, I will not go into each parameters, but collectively, generally, they show that mechanical properties of the wall are stress dependent. And here are two examples of that. And if we plot the deformation as a function of stress, we can see that the blue curve representing the plastic strain shows that the plastic deformation initiates after the yield stress. And we can also see that the elastic strain, the blue curve, The elastic strain, the blue curve kept increasing even in the yield and the linear region. And for another example, if we plot the modulus as a function of stress for the elastic loading or unloading modulus, we can see that the modulus kept increasing at the yield phase and it is able to maintain this value at the linear region. So overall, this is showing that the wall is able to maintain its elastic. is able to maintain its elastic modulus and stiffness even after a very extensible amount of extensive amount of plastic deformation which might have significant biological importance for the cell wall to maintain its stiffness during extensive deformation. So to summarize, our study show revealed intrinsic mechanical response of abdominal cell walls that it shows this nonlinear stress. It shows this nonlinear stress for response where different wall properties are stress-dependent and shows some very dynamic mechanical properties along stretching and provide this analytical framework that is also applicable to other materials. And our analysis also provide information for analysis of what's the deformation mechanisms of the wall at high strains that's beyond 20%. And we also show that contrary to typical viscoelastic material. Typical visco-elastic material, the elastic deformation of the wall was rate-independent, while the plastic deformation was rate-dependent. It will be interesting to explore the molecular basis of this time dependency and the relationships between the plastic deformation and the growth of the wall. And to have some ideas and discussions in the group, we have a couple of questions in terms of with the core square model, we're able to review some of the molecular insights into the how cells. Into how cell wall deforms during stretching. And with that insights, are we able to potentially could we come up with a constitutive model that could describe mechanical behaviors with wall with parameters that represent molecular properties of the wall. For example, the interaction between the cells microfibril and the bending stiffness or how. The bending stiffness, or how much contact they have, and are we able to model using these equations or piecewise functions to describe the stiffening, yielding, and linear region that would be informative for us to, for example, if we have a stress-run curve, if we use that equations or functions are able to generate molecular insights, and that could also potentially be useful for the modeling approach, and for some other Some other challenges as well. Is it possible for us to come up with equations and models that provide quantitative molecular institutions as well? In terms of how do these parameters affect build stress? The number of lateral interactions between cells mic fibro. Is there any effect from the bundle size and the strengths of their interactions and the time dependency of the slippage movement? Of the slippage movement. And as we can see, that right now we could model the wall that is being stretched to 2012, but then we would reach a computational limit. So could we model the cell wall stretch to a large strain beyond 20% that we can potentially know the molecular mechanism of the linear region and this increase in yield stress? And I'm referring to that as the wall reached the yield point and the slow. Point, then the slope of the stress-run curve didn't fall or become flat. Instead, it kept increasing, suggesting that we need a higher amount of force to further deform wall and introduce more plastic deformation. So, could the potential mechanism be the continuous recruitment of fibers from other directions and that could perfectly balance out the slippage of the cells and microfibrils, or could there be other Or could there be other molecular mechanisms that contribute to this linear region? And with that, I'd like special thanks to Dr. Yaoji and Dr. Daniel Cosgrove and our funding resources. And I'll go back to this page and that's all I have. It will be great to have some ideas within the group. Thank you. Now we can pause. All right, thanks so much, Diggy. So I see one question on Zoom. Bernard, go ahead. The first one is just to be sure to understand. So it was a very clear talk, wonderful. But the onion peel you have, it was growing. I mean, before you started, you think, I mean, this is the growth zone of the leaf. It's a growing tissue, right? And it's homogeneous in growth. I mean, if I look on the onion. I mean, if I look on the onion itself, before you start, no, actually, I think if I go back to the slides. Oh, I don't think so. So we actually isolate this onion peels from the onion scale of the white bulb. So I think from that point, the onion is not able to grow further anymore. So technically, it doesn't have like. So technically, it doesn't have like as a plant, it wouldn't choose to grow any further. So we're not sure it's actively growing at that point. Okay. So and when you pull the thing, I mean, you kill the inner vacuole, or so you can pull and, because if not going to align when you pull, I mean, at the cellular size, can you remove that? So you just pull a lot? So how do you do that? Just pull a lot, or how do you do? Uh, I'm sorry, because if you pull on something with the then the reconfiguration of the cell will actually do something, so you have to remove that. How do you do that? So I think this test is actually a response, a macro scale response of the whole unipidermal cell wall. So that would the shape of the curve would reflect in. Shape of the curve would reflect the changing or the dimensional deformation of the cell itself. That would be a factor into the stress-run curve. And we actually characterize, like, for example, the Poisson ratio and how cell wall would deform in response to this tense cell loading. That's a factor. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Another question? Thank you for your talk. That was very interesting. Thought that was very interesting. Um, well, on the slide here, you mentioned that you would like to model wall stretch to large strings larger than 20 percent. I'm wondering what would be the purpose of that, because I would think that in a growth situation, if the cell wall has grown by 20%, there will have been biological processes that will add more material by that time. And so, how relevant is it to fit the experiment? Is it to fit the experiments done on that issue? Yeah, good question. So, I think one advantage of deforming the cell wall to a very large strain is that the wall and fiber starts to go through very significant or dramatic, dramatic is not a good word, but a very large scale and a lot of structural changes that may not appear in the very small. not appear in the very small amount of deformation. And with the large scale deformation and significant, much more significant changes in the wall, and by understanding how cellulose rearrange at high scale, it could help us further understanding, for example, how does the fiber interact with each other and how does maybe the matrix play a role in the large deformation and reveal some of the features in the wall structure. In the wall structure. So we did some like structural characterization of the wall when it is stretched to large scale, and we start to observe some very large scale cellulose network rearrangement. So that is very insightful for us to understand this interaction and networks of fibers in response to changes. And by this, we're By this, we also will generate insights into how this cross-sectional cross-laminal structure, its capacity, and what is its potential as a material. All right. Thanks so much, Jingi. Fred has some follow-up questions, which I'll encourage to share over Slack. You can communicate that way. So thanks again for a lovely talk. And our next speaker is Mark Alber, who is a distinguished professor of mathematics and Distinguished professor of mathematics and directs the Interdisciplinary Center for Quantitative Modeling and Biology at UC Riverside. So, Mark.
