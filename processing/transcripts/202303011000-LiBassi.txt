The next speaker is Lucas Ibasi, who speaks on cubic three points and IHSM with a non-symplicate automorphism. Thank you. I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me here. It's my first time in Canada, and it's a wonderful place here. So thank you again. Thank you, Peggy. And my talk will be very similar in the beginning to the talk that Samuel gave yesterday. In fact, it deals with the relation between cubic threefolds and IHS manifolds with an asymptotic automorphism, which is an interest that's historically present in mathematics. But I will start with the motivating example, which is just the one we saw yesterday. The one we saw yesterday, but we will see it again. Tell me if I write too little or too bad. I can write better than this. I know that I started badly, but okay. So we start from a qubit, C, triple, four, which will be given only by Zero locus of a polynomial genius. Then we can consider the 3-1 cover of before by cubic fourfold branching dot RC, just like Samuel did. And Y will be given by F3 of the same thing. F3 of the same thing plus x5 the cube equals zero okay and here we can consider like like did some yesterday the copy automorphism sigma is to one sigma abs on y by just multiplying the Multiplying the last variable by a third root, a third root primitive of the unity. Okay. And then we can consider the final variety of lines on white. The final variety of lines on a cubic fourfold is by Ukrainonagi information. Of this donati information equivalent to Hilbert's chemo, two points on a PH3 surface. And as we said yesterday, sigma sends lines to lines, so it induces another automorphism on the final variety of lines. We call sigma bar. Starting here. Moreover, this automorphism Automorphism, let's look at how it's working on the symplectic form sigma bar. White, one can do the computation, it's pretty easy. It's just a multiplication by the third root of the unity of the symplectic form. So it does non-symplectically, purely non-symplectically important. Okay. Okay, and before going through the other thing, let's say that what's the invariant platus of it. Invariant is just the letters generated by by theta. Yeah, so that's the motivated example and why we construct this example because as explaining the rest of the example, we have this the following map. Consider the model space of The model is space of used QD threefolds, so small that meets a map, period map on a complex temple minus an hippoplane arrangement, modulus and groups. Actually, yeah. Okay, then here we. Here we can this result due to your hypothesis and lid map. Then, as someone said yesterday, we can construct a model space here for this kind of manifold, which I believe equals M6. Maybe you could draw two, okay? I will explain in a bit what's this model by space. This also has a map here. So C damage. And so this is isomorphism. So that's the motivating example. Before going to the thing I want to talk about, I wanted to explain a bit I wanted to explain a bit the definition of this modular space because it will help to get us through. In order to construct this modular space, we need to define what is called a row depolarization. So we can say it in general: let X be an IHS manifold and we fix its type, yeah, fixed type and let actually let's take it marked data marked and fixing its type nails. And fixing this type means to just fixing the type. Uh L will be eta of X. Yeah, then it's a rot polarization, so I need to define what it's raw, what it's deep. Let the rho be an isometry of the abstract lattice L. Absolute lattice L. So, sorry, the ether is a market. Sorry, beta is a marking. Yeah. I took the marking from most of the starting. Yeah, I took the marking, yeah. H to x02 in this direction. And what's the question? He can't really define L. You can't really define everything that way. Yeah, I cannot define everything. You first have to fix the L. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was my way of saying this. Yeah, yeah, sorry, sorry. It's more clear like this. I fixed an in fact, I fixed the deformation type of AHS manifold. Okay. Yeah, okay. So I I let there all be an exometer of the abstract lattice L. Exometer of the abstract lattice L, yeah, and we need to define also T. So, suppose to have an embedding J of T in L such that J of T is just the fixed lattice of L. Okay? Then L G of T is L to 0, the pixel lattice of L. I use this notation. Okay, yeah, yeah. Okay, so in order to construct a rotucularization, because we want to construct a modular space that takes in account the fact that we have a fixed sub lattice uh non fixed sub lattice, an automorphism acting uh uh acting on the actual lattice. We need these ingredients. We need these ingredients. It must exist a yota from T to Ron Severi Ms. So that's the right definition and rotarization for For X is consists of the following: existence of a yotta such that obviously the condition here we have J, here we have an embedding on the H2. Here we have the mark eta, just this diagram coming. So we have the existence of the ata, and then we need another condition. Here we will have the atomorphism row acting, and you want there will be again eta of which you want the existence. We want the existence of a sigma acting on X such that induced automorphism homology must start with this diagram computer. Okay, so this is the moduli space that we can construct the moduli space of and And row T okay and it has a period map alternative P rho T going to M rho T to omega rho T which is the following omega the project to decide I will define what is this object in a moment omega omega bar greater than zero. What is this? We define S to be the orthogonal complement of taking L and this is just the complexified and taking the eigenvalue relative to. The I n value relative to C, where C is the action, the primitive root of unity, which of the action of sigma and the simplexic, therefore. Here. Here was X3. Okay. And before going on, just say we have this period map At this period map, what is the image of this period map? Actually, yeah, it's this, as someone said yesterday, minus an upper plane arrangement consisting of where H is the union delta per, where delta is in the Is in the S that are MPM classes in this. Okay, yeah why the image is here is I think. You see, here is I show you because it will be useful a bit later. Because if we take the delta and bm plus in S such that the period a period, omega is uh orthogonal to it. Or cover a suite, then it means that then it means that eta to the minus one of delta is in the Neuro anseveri, obviously, by the definition of Nehron Severi. And then we can take, we can consider on x, eta an important. X is an invariant of the class, which we call it. It always exists because we admit a non-symplectic automorphism, purely non-symplectic outmorphism. So it always exists an ample class, and we can construct it to be invariant. And we, and like this, we have that. This we have that tau is an ample class, so eta to the minus one of delta against tau is equal to zero. That's impossible because MBL classes have got a sign-on mechanic. Okay, now I put the definition. I can go, I can start the talk basically, and I go. Start the talk basically, and I go where it differs with some story. Here's the chapter about singular cubics. Well let's picture a ten-dimensional complex body. And as uh we say the the root map the image of the period map for cubics Image of the third metal cubics was the complement of some hyperplane. So let's picture like the noval hyperplane. I don't want to go more into the details of it, but there is another component, the cordial complement, the cordial component relative to the cordial hyperplane, which I'm not considering in this talk. Okay. And then consider. Then consider Cn to be acubic whose period lies over here. So we can consider the jetty compatification of the moduli space of smooth cubics, as done by Claude Pottersa and Toledo, and consider and they extend the map also to the nodal plate, their paper, for example. Example. So here we have an auto-cubic, and if we consider only the moduli space of six polarized, forgetting that of the wrong, EHS manifold of 232 type, over the same period there will be some stomipercillers. Let's see, see my honeypercal over there. Unfortunately, or fortunately, it depends. For sigma n, we cannot define an automorphism of sigma sigma sigma n article sigma n represented by a log. You can the reason is that one because if we go over this upper plane. Because if we go over this hyperplane, it means that ambient classes get in the neurons vary and we get these walls, basically. But we still want to give a relation between unity in these two. So the strategy is to change role. And this is Change role. And this is what decided the Sigma, the family that generates another family with another automotive with a bigger impact. Because we have to change this in order to get account of this particular instances. So first step we want to do is find the Correct wrong eye. Okay this means the following. If we start from a cubic whose period omega lies in the orthogonal of delta one one delta i plus is then we can define that i the lattice generated by this delta one delta i but also if omega is orthogonal to delta one delta i is orthogonal to delta one gonna have to raw delta one rough delta i and we don't need rho square because because we have the rho square plus rho plus like the entity is equal to zero on the orthogonal of the on the entity by entity and so it's an orthogonal Because it's an order for the automotive muscle practice. So, okay, we can define Ti to be Ri plus the 6, which was the invariant lattice for the initial row. But we have to consider its separation in F, because this might be not primitive as a sublattice. Primitive as a sublattice. In general, it's not. Then, which will be the correct right? Obviously, maybe we start with a lift of identity over Ti plus rho restricted to Si, where Si is the orthogonal complement of the sign. The orthogonal complement of L. This list of the automorphism might not exist in general. Because it's actually the condition here is that the raw max are trivially on the district of the i. But there is a condition. Then we want. Then we want to find a geometric realization of sigma sigma n, we want to find sigma n such that Such that the Picard of sigma n is Ti. Because we want it to be generic in the model space we are going to construct. And how do we do this? We do it like this. We starting from a cubic. We're going to consider only the GIT stable cubic here. So they must have isolated symbols. Must have isolated the similarity of tape of type A1 to A4, just for formality. This can be given in general by X0, F2 of X1 X4 plus F3 of X1 X4 equal to zero and epsilon n, the cubic fourfold. The cubic fourfold will be given by the same thing plus x5 to the cube equals zero. Then we add that the funnel that we construct, funnel variety of epsilon n in general is singular. Here we constructed the singularity isolated in 1000, and also this is as a single. And also this is as a single as is a latent singular point in one zero zero zero zero with a zero more which we call p 1 0 0. f of epsilon n is singular and the singularity of f of epsilon n will be just the lines passing through this singular point p. This singular point P, but the amazing thing is that this is a singular K3 surface in the following sense. This is just F2 equals to 0 and F3 X5 to the Q equals to 0. And here the coordinates we are in RP4 of coordinates x1 and x5. So we just like this. Like this. And this is a similar K3 surface in the sense that its minimal resolution is a K3 surface. It's all it has only seen isolated AD singularities. Okay, then with this in mind, we can stick the following theorem. Okay. Theorem. Delta 3AI lottus. What's this lotus? This is the sublottus of the cubic threefold having, whose general element is a cubic threefold having an isolated singularity of type AI. So the delta AI in locus is irrational. A ten minus i dimensional modular space of fourfolds of k three two type. To type in though endowed with a norm simplex automorphism of order three Having invariant di. I will explain in a bit what is di but just note yes this is the theorem of for i equals to one is the theorem of Boissier Tamer Sarty on the generic On the generic degeneration. So, when we consider a generic element on this outer plane, it's just a singular cubicle with only one singularity. Then with I equals two for me and we and it means to consider more and more more and more specific More and more, more and more specific degeneration of the same thing. And just go what's the eye and some brief consideration about it because. We start from A1 singularity with a cubic threefold. The cubic fourfold will be, for example, a two singularity, a cusp, and then the K3 will be not singular. And the Ti is just three plus max loop. And these are the TI in the other cases. Right? Okay. And as you can see, And uh as you can see uh all the automorphisms constructed are natural are natural as they leave uh invariant uh the minus two plus coming from the vertical morphism. And this or every one of these one can write for example an isomorphism because there there is always this six which is invariant. This is just six plus four, I guess. Before, I guess. And yeah, there are some analysis for everyone. Before finishing, just say why I chose to write them in this order, A1, A3, A4, A2. Because for the three cases, one can... In this talk, I hid some dust under the carpet. That's because the the period map I constructed before. The pure meta constructed before for a rotipolarized manifold, it's not inject always injective. It's injective in the case of six polarized, raw six polarized. Here is injective automatically. In general, there is a condition that has to satisfy that there is the case of degenerality. Case of degenerality and for these three cases all work fine. This case actually is the most complicated one because there are many reasons why it's different from the others. For example, a P3 has three points, three similar points, not only one, or which like in the other case, which are permuted by this automorphism, these three singular points. And I didn't manage to construct the I didn't manage to construct a proper modulo space like the other case for this. I would only describe it as a subfamily, giving more and more with more definition. So that's it. Thank you for the attention.
