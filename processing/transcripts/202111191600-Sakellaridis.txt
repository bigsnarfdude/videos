Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be speaking here. Like everybody said, I started learning representation theory from Bill's notes, but that's hardly the only point of intersection. My first paper has Bill's name on the title. It has Shalaika's name twice on the title, so maybe that's why I ended up at Johns Hopkins. And many other points of intersection that I will allude to later in the talk. But because of this, I thought that it would be a good topic to talk about the Castlemo-Salaika formula and what I learned in 20 years of Years of trying to understand it, and I met Bill shortly afterwards and after my thesis. And I was always very grateful for the generosity by which he shared his ideas, by the simple way in which he made young mathematicians feel welcome and feel that their ideas are appreciated. Feel that their ideas are appreciated. One thing that I think harms mathematics a lot is when people do not tell you what they don't know. They just throw at you some definitions and you're supposed to believe them and think that everything around them is understood and Bill never does that. And Bill never does that. Bill likes to go back to the important problems, and he's very open about what he does and what he doesn't understand. So this is extremely, extremely important. And I've definitely benefited a lot from that. And I've also been many times the object of both his outsize praise and his outsize. Praise and his outsize criticism, and I've always enjoyed both. Okay, so let me start with my talk. I will talk about various aspects of the Casimir-Shellika method, which was used to prove the Santani-Casim and Sheleika formula for spherical functions. For spherical functions on the Whiteker model, and subsequently for many other models, many spherical functions on many other spaces. So G will be a connected reductive group over a non-Archimedean local field. FQ will be the residue field and the notation will be G is equal to G of F. So you have a nice space on which G is acting and the problem is to compute eigenfunctions of the spherical. Compute eigenfunctions of the spherical Heke algebra on X. And the problem, one motivation for this problem classically has been that, for example, when X is a homogeneous space with some multiplicity one property, and you have an automorphic representation, and you consider period integrals over the stabilizer subgroup. Stabilizer subgroup and because of the multiplicity one property, this functional, which you can think of as an embedding of pi into the space of functions on x, has to be an Euler product. So the image consists of functions which are products over all places, and at almost every place, these functions are eigenfunctions for the HEC algebra. So that's one place where this problem comes up. Comes up and in his two papers from since 1918 Compositio, Castleman, in the second paper together with Shaleika, introduced a new method to solve this problem. And in the first paper that he wrote by himself, he reproved McDonald's formula for zonal spherical functions, so spherical matrix coefficients of the group. And in the second paper, which I like, they Second paper, which I like, they generalized Shintani's formula from GLN to arbitrary unramified groups for the eigenfunctions of the Whiteker eigenfunctions of the Hecke algebra. So the goal of this talk will be to revisit the methods in the light of subsequent development. Okay, so what do you need to follow this talk? There will be some notation that if you can, so my slides, I hope, are. Um, so my slides I hope are online, but would be good to pay attention to that notation. B will be Borel subgroup, and its unipotent radical, A, the Toros quotient. So we parametrize G mod n mod K orbits K is G of O. G, remember, is defined over the ring of integers and reductive, so K is a hyperspatial maximal compact subgroup. And by the eva-Hori decomposition, G. Eva Hori decomposition, G mod n mod k is the same as the torus moduloids maximal compact subgroup, which is a lattice. And this lattice will be denoted by lambda. I should say that I will assume, although the papers of Casmer and Shalaika were about general and ramified groups, I will assume that the group is split mostly for simplicity, but not only for simplicity. Some results have not been. Some results have not been proven in general. So, in that case, A mod AO can be identified with the lattice of co-characters of A. We consider the normalized action of A on G mod N, the unitary action, so that includes a modular character. And S of X will denote the Schwartz space, which, since we're in the non-Archimedean field, The non-Archimedean field is just compactly supported smooth functions. A basis for the k-invariant functions on the Schwartz space of G mod n is just given by the characteristic functions of these cosets represented by the lattice. But again, there will be a normalizing factor. So we take the characteristic function of the integers, which is Which is this one, and then we apply the normalized action. So you get a characteristic function times a factor, which is essentially the inverse square root of the volume. So h equal to the Langland dual torus of A. It corresponds to unramified characters of A. And the eigenfunctions. Eigen functions under the normalized action of the torus on G mod n will be denoted by I of chi. This is the normalized principal series, the normalized induction, the unramified principal series. I of chi will be the, will denote this representation. And if we fix invariant measures throughout, the C infinity space is the smooth dual of the space of compactly supported. Space of compactly supported functions, smooth functions. We have mailing transforms that take us from compactly supported functions to the principal series just by integrating against the A action. And the Mellian transform of the basis vector that I denoted by E of lambda is again E of lambda, where now lambda is understood, E of lambda is understood as a character. E of lambda is understood as a character on the dual torus. I'm using this exponential notation because, as usual, we're using additive notation for the lattice elements. So, exponential means multiplicative character of the dual torus. So, in this notation, if I take the inverse of one minus e to the lambda, I can think of it as a series of elements. So, this is going to be a series of Series of compactly supported functions whose Melling transform is precisely this one minus e to the lambda inverse as a function on the dual torus. There is some ambiguity here, by the way, because you can also expand this as a geometric series in minus lambda, just by plugging, by taking out e to the lambda from both the numerator and the denominator. So implicit. So, implicitly, whenever I write down this series, I will have to fix the support of the series. But you will assume that whenever I do that, the support is the one that appears in the notation. So I'm not taking out the factor e to the lambda. So, a basic example, SL2 mod n is just two-dimensional space without the origin, and then the characteristic. And then the characteristic function of O squared is can be written as a series in the characteristic functions of O star squared translated by powers of pi of the uniformizer. So this series together with the normalization in the definition of the basis elements can be written as this thing that looks like a local L facto. And indeed, it's And indeed, it's a local L-factor if you apply Melini transform to it. So, this function is invariant under Fourier transform on f2, f squared, sort of as a symplectic space with an appropriate character. And what does Fourier transform do to unramified functions? It takes Fourier transform is anti-equivariant with respect to the normalized action of the torus. So that means that it takes the Mellin transform of at chi. Melling transform of at chi to the Melling transform of chi inverse, and then it also multiplies by a scalar like that. So you see that this function is invariant under Fourier transform. Are there any questions on notation? Okay, so it's important that people are happy with the idea that this power series represents both local alpha. Both local L factors after you take Mellin transform, but also functions on G model before you take Mellin transform. Okay, so the waytaker model, so we will assume that G is split, fix a maximal unipotent, which now I'm denoted by N minus. It doesn't play a difference, of course. N and N minus are conjugate, but just to fix ideas and fix, you know, positive versus negative weights and things like that. Weights and things like that, it's more convenient to denote by n minus, although I'm sure I'm going to make some, I'm sure that my slides have some sign errors here and there. And then we fix a generic character. We make some integral choice, so the restriction of the character to any simple root space as conductor O. And we induce this character, it defines the Whiteker model. And my notation will be C infinity G mod n minus psi for the induced. Psi for the induced character. And the syntactic assumption formula for Hecke eigenfunctions on the White model states that the eigenfunction corresponding to the principal series with parameter chi, this would be denoted by omega chi. Of course, this eigenfunction is unique up to a scalar. So here it's normalized. So here it's normalized so that its value at 1 is 1. And this function together with this square root of volume factor is equal to the Shur polynomials, the trace of chi understood now as an element of the dual torus, on the representation of the dual group parameterized by lambda. So remember, lambda is a co-character. So remember, Lambda is a co-character for the group, so it defines a, and in fact, lambda is a dominant co-character for the group. So it's a character for the dual group, and it defines a highest weight module for the dual group. Okay, so in the trace of an element in the maximal torus of the dual group, an unramified character, on this highest weight module, or rather it's dual, is the value of Value of the spherical function adds pi to the minus lambda. The dual here appears because of my annoying convention with n minus, so don't worry about that. Okay, so that's the classical Casmond Chaleika formula. It has a dual formulation that is a little bit easier to grasp and to understand. So if you have a So, if you have a dominant weight, we're going to again fix the basis of functions. Now, those will be compactly supported functions on the Whitecker model, compactly supported sections of the Whitecker model, like the E lambdas that we defined before. So, W lambda will be supported on the coset represented by pi to the minus lambda. And it's going to be zero elsewhere, and on that coset, it's going to be one up to this volume factor again. Okay, so we have a basis for compactly supported with Legger functions, compactly supported modulo and minus, of course. And now consider the SATAC isomorphism, saying that the Heike algebra of G is isomorphic to the representation ring of the dual group. Representation ring of the dual group. So the representation with highest weight lambda will be will correspond to a Heke element called H lambda. And the Casano-Shaleika theorem has the following much more pleasant form that says that if I take my basis vector w0 and I act on it by the lambda, the Hecke element corresponding to the representation. To the representation with highest weight lambda, then I get the basis element w lambda. So, in other words, the Wuitecker model realizes geometrically the Sataka isomorphism, the Heke elements corresponding to the representation or rather the distinguished basis of the Sataka isomorphism. So the basis corresponding to irreducible representations. To irreducible representations in the Heke algebra becomes a geometric basis when this Heke algebra acts on the Whiteker model. Unlike the usual Satake isomorphism, which what does it say? The usual Satake isomorphism would be obtained by the same process, except that you replace the Whitecker character by a trivial character. And then this function Function by definition of the saddle isomorphism, the action of this function on the characteristic function of n minus k would give you the trace of this representation understood again as a function on the dual torus or as a sum of functions on g mod n minus. So the right hand side here denotes a sum of identity functions on g mod n minus identity functions on g mod n minus by the conventions that I introduced before. Okay, so it is the function on g mod n minus whose Melling transform is the trace of this highest weight module. Are there any questions on that? Okay, so let's say why the theorem, the theorem Why the theorem here implies the Casaman-Chaleka formula? It's actually equivalent to that, but also one implication. So you want to compute the eigenfunction of the Hake algebra corresponding to the principal series with parameter chi at the point pi to the minus lambda. So this is the same, if you take into account the volumes, this is the same as the inner product of that function with. function with w lambda, which is essentially up to volume factor, the characteristic function of the concept of pi to the minus lambda. But the theorem above tells us that this function is h lambda, the Hecke element H lambda applied to the characteristic function of the basic coset. You can bring the Hecke element to the other side by taking the dual Heke element, but now this is supposed to be an eigenfunction for the Heke algebra. For the Hecke algebra. So, when you act on it by the dual Hecke element, you obtain by definition of the settle isomorphism, you obtain the trace of chi on the dual representation times the value of omega chi at one. But omega chi is up to this point kind of arbitrary up to scalar, so we take this value to be one and you get the trace of chi on. Trace of chi on the dual representation. So this theorem, this formulation implies the other and actually vice versa. Okay, so now from now on, I'll use the notation x for the Whittaker model. So x is not just a space, but it also includes the data of this Whittaker character. And up to now, we didn't fix the We didn't fix a morphism from the principal series to C infinity to the Whitecker model. So we said that these eigenfunctions are defined up to scalar. But if you want, you can fix a morphism like that. My goal for the next few slides is to explain the Casan-Mon-Chalika method. So, and then I will explain some extensions of that. So, we can fix a morphism as the dual of a morphism from functions on Whitecker functions to the dual principal series. And this dual morphism is called, well, this morphism here is called the Jacquet integral sometimes. And this dual morphism I will call the Radon transform because it's just an integral. Well, it's an integral over the Borel subgroup against this character. So, this integral obviously produces. So, this integral obviously produces sections of the principal series. But this is actually the Melling transform of the Radon transform, which is just the integral over the unipotent. Okay, so if you just integrate over the unipotent, you get a function on g mod n. This function is not compactly supported anymore, so that's why I put S plus here. It's a slightly larger space in general. But this Radon transform is this very simple procedure by which you start. simple procedure by which you start from functions on a space x and you produce functions on the much simpler space g mod n just by integrating and the problem of computing the hike eigenfunction is equivalent to the problem of computing the dual map so to compute the radon transform of these basis vectors w lambda for all dominant elements lambda So, the first idea of Castleman was to use functional equations for these Radon transforms. So, you have the map that goes to I chi, you have the map that goes to I chi w, but generically these representations are isomorphic and we have a multiplicity one for the Whittaker model, so there must be some intertwining operator here that makes this diagram commute. This diagram commute as the character varies, these intertwining operators are going to be meromorphic. And the second idea was that it's really hard to compute spherical vectors, so why don't we instead compute the Radon transform of functions with smaller support, for example, the Vahori invariant Whitecker functions. So we can take the Eva Hori invariant Whitecker function that is supported on n minus n minus pi to the minus lambda times the integral points of the Borel. And this is very easy to compute the Radon transform of this function because this function lies entirely within the open Borel orbit. The support of this function lies entirely within the open Borel orbit. So if you want to integrate over the Borel against the Borel subgroup or the unipotent radical of the Borel subgroup, you get an answer which You get an answer which is very, very transparent. So, the Radon transform of this function restricted to the Borel is really supported on one coset for B of O and then how does the Casm-Cheleica formula continue? Well, if you know, you have this simple calculation, which is already done. If you also happen to know this Fourier transition, If you also happen to know this Fourier, this intertwining operators, and you can write a spherical vector in terms of these operators, then this gives you the desired formula because if you want to compute the dual maps from the principal series to the Whittaker model, the dual of this Yvahori invariant vector is very easy to go. Ipahori invariant vector is very easy to compute. And then the spherical vector, which is written as a linear combination of Ipahori vectors, if you know this linear combination, that implies the formula for the unramified Whittaker function. One thing that's extremely surprising about this formula is that if you look at the form of the form of If you look at the form of the Heke function, of this Whitecker function, it looks like an eigenfunction of the torus. So it's a linear combination of characters of the torus. And this is very surprising because there is no torus action on the Whiteker model. Okay, as I will explain in a few slides, you expect this to happen asymptotically, but the Castleman-Shellika formula tells you that this actually happens for You that this actually happens for all dominant lambda, not only asymptotically. So, for reasons that I don't really understand very well, unramified functions, unramified Hecke eigenfunctions are already look like eigenfunctions for the torus everywhere on their entire support and The point of my talk somehow is that the same arguments work to compute Heke and functions for a lot of other spaces. The only thing that we used here really is the existence of an open Borel orbit that allowed us to compute easily the Radon transform of a Ivahori invariant vector. And of course, we need to know these intertwining operators Fw, which will be different in every Fw, which will be different in every case. But once you can compute these intertwiners, that leads to a formula for eigenvectors of the Heke algebra on any nice variety x. Are there any questions? Let me pause here a little bit. Okay, so what are these intertwiners FW? This was already known to Gelsand and Karstan. Already known to Gelfand and Karzan that in the case of these intertwiners between Radon transforms for the Whiteker model admit a very nice description in terms of the so-called Fourier transforms on the basic affine space G model. So what are these Fourier transforms? These Fourier transforms can be described first for simple reflections. So when W is a simple reflection, and let's assume that G is simply connected. The J is simply connected, we consider, so we fix a simple root alpha, and we consider the parabolic whose semi-simple quotient is PGL2 and is associated to the root alpha. So, this is the parabolic P alpha, the parabolic P alpha, and then you take the derived group of this parabolic, and you have a vibration of G moden of. Vibration of G mod n over G mod, the derived group of this parabolic, whose fibers are the basic affine space of SL2, which, as we have already seen, is essentially two-dimensional linear space without the origin. And then we define Fourier transform on these two-dimensional linear spaces using a symplectic form. So, to define Fourier transform, you need to somehow identify the space with its dual, and you do that. It's dual, and you do that through a symplectic form that is actually determined by the Wuetecker datum. The Wuidecker datum determines a symplectic form on these fibers, and this gives rise to Fourier transform. You define it fiber-wise, and then that gives a definition of the Fourier transform for simple reflections. This is a transform that makes this diagram commute for simple reflections. For simple reflections, and because of this reason, you actually know that the Fourier transform satisfy the brain relations of the valgroup. So, they actually define an action of the val group on functions on g moden. Again, not compactly supported functions, as you know from SL2. You cannot, Fourier does not preserve compact support on F square without the origin. You have to include the origin. So, it's a slightly larger space of functions. Of functions, but these are the transforms that appear in the functional equations for the Whitecker model, for the Radon transform of the Whitecker model. This has been used recently by Nadia Gurevich and David Kasdan to extend the definition of Fourier transforms to the general quasi-split case, namely they extend them precisely by this diagram. So So, okay, so somehow this completes the story for the Whiteker model. I explained in previous slides that the calculation reduces to knowing the intertwining operators that make this diagram commute, and that makes the calculation go through. This is essentially the gist of the calculation. Let me make a digression here also. Digression here, also having the name of Castleman. Castleman showed that for an admissible representation pi of G, the asymptotics of its matrix coefficients can be understood in terms of a pairing of Zac modules between, here there's a typo, this should be pi and pi dual. So you take the Zacchae module of pi with respect to n, and there's a k module of pi dual with respect to n minus. To n minus, and there is an invariant pairing between these Reiquet modules such that the matrix coefficients of pi asymptotically look like can be computed in terms of this invariant period. This is a very well-known theorem. It was extended by Bernstein to arbitrary smooth representations. If my understanding is correct, is back in those days there was not much communication. Those days, there was not much communication between the West and the East. So, Bernstein was working independently and he proved the same theorem for arbitrary smooth representations. And you can formulate it in terms of some universal representation, namely C infinity of J, that's where the matrix coefficients live. And the theorem says that there is a canonical asymptotics map between C infinity of G and C infinity of the asymptotic cone of G, where the asymptotic cone. Where the asymptotic cone is whatever you would get by just parabolically inducing these Jacques modules, by applying from Benny's reciprocity to the statement that I made here. So the asymptotic cone is just the quotient of g times g by n times n minus and the diagonal action of the torus. And this equivalent morphism has the property, is characterized by the property that the function and its That the function and its asymptotics coincide close to infinity. What does close to infinity mean? For example, you can evaluate them both at sufficiently dominant elements of the torus. Okay, so we have this theorem of asymptotics. And this theorem of asymptotics can also be applied to create a similar statement about asymptotics on the Whiteker model. Asymptotics on the Whitecker model, there is a similar map, equivariant map from Whitecker functions to degenerate Whitecker functions, so functions on G mod and minus, where again, those two functions, a function will coincide with its asymptotics if you evaluate it on a dominant enough element of a torus. And in fact, we know how to compute this map, it fits into map, it fits into a diagram of Radon transforms. So the horizontal map here is the asymptotics map and the slanted arrows are Radon transforms for the Whiteker model and for Gmod N minus. So these Radon transforms are simply integrals over N. And the fact is that this diagram commutes. Sometimes in the theory of symmetric space Sometimes, in the theory of symmetric spaces, this Radon transform here is called the constant term. And this asymptotics map, which is a combination of a Radon transform and an inverse Radon transform, is called the normalized constant term. So these transforms are well known also in the theory of inharmonic analysis and symmetric spaces. And the statements that I showed you before about the form. Before about the form of the spherical functions, give the following surprising corollary for which I don't know a conceptual reason: that when our Whitecker function is unramified, and this doesn't only hold for Whitecker functions, it holds for the zonal spherical functions, it always holds for unramified functions. The asymptotic equality holds on the entire dominant cone. It holds on the nose everywhere. So a Whiteker function is equal to A Whitegare function is equal to its asymptotics everywhere on the dominant column. But now that gives you a very easy way to compute the action of the Heke algebra on this guy, if you know it's asymptotics, because computing the action of the Heke algebra on this guy is very easy. This is just the Sataki isomorphism. This is just the space G model minus. So if you know this fact, which follows from This fact, which follows from just generalities about Casimir-Sheleika method, the problem reduces to computing just the asymptotics of some Whiteker functions. So to prove the Caseman-Saleika theorem, here I'm getting into more detail, so we're not done yet, it's nice to calculate the Radon transform of the basic function, because once you do that, then you reduce the action on a complicated space. The action on a complicated space to an action on a simpler space, which is given by the Satya Keyomorphism. And there are actually not many options for the Radon transform of the Whitegare function because we know that they should be stable under Fourier transforms. You also know something about its support. So, pretty much these two conditions determine the Radon transform of the Whitegare function. It's this function which It's this function, which I remind you: I'm using this notation to denote a sum of identity functions, a linear combination of identity functions on GMOTN. Okay, and if you want to compute this, so this is for the Radon transform. If you want to compute the asymptotics, and sorry, there shouldn't be an empty set sign here. This is the Radon transform of a Whitecker function. Transform of a Whitecker function. If you want to compute its asymptotics, you just invert the random transform for G mod then, like the standard intertwining operator, and that gives you the asymptotics of the Whitecker function. Two very similar formulas and very closely related to each other. So the theorem is that, like we saw before, okay, so this is just repeating the theorem about the Radon transform of the basic function in its asymptotics, same typo here, this shouldn't be. Same typo here, this shouldn't be an empty set. And here's the proof of the Casimir-Schalaga formula. If you want to calculate the action of this Hekel element on W naught, it's the same as calculating the action of this element on its asymptotics, but we know the action of the and then restricting to the dominant cone. So, but we know the action on the asymptotics is given by the asymptotics is given by the it's given simply by the Sadake transform so the Satake transform of H lambda is by definition the sure polynomial the denominator of the sure polynomial will cancel with this term and then you're left with the numerator of the sure polynomial if you restrict it to the dominant cone you just get e to the lambda that's one way to compute that the That the Heke element H lambda acting on W naught is equal to the basis element W lambda. And this can be applied to other spherical spaces. Like I said, the only thing you need to know is that there is an open Borel orbit for this method to work. And then you need to calculate these intertwining operators that will make the diagram commute. And these turn out to be not Fourier transforms in general, but some abelian gamma. In general, but some abelian gamma factor, abelian unramified gamma factor times Fourier transform. And this gamma factor is very, very interesting because it lies behind the so-called L function associated to spherical varieties. So if you know the fact that spherical varieties have L functions associated to them, this is where the L functions actually show up in local harmonic analysis. They show up in these scattering diagrams. In these scattering diagrams, in these gamma factors that make these diagrams communicate. And these gamma factors, in turn, modify the asymptotic formula by an abelian local L factor. So instead of the asymptotics of the Whitecker function, which looks like that, the asymptotics of our basic function on another spherical space will have the same form, but multiplied by some abelian local L factor. So for example, in the group case, So, for example, in the group case, and that's going to lead to McDonald's formula, also proved by Castleman. In the group case, you have the same numerator, but you also have the denominator. When you compute the asymptotics of the basic function, the basic function here is the characteristic function of the integers. So you have a denominator, which and this implies the McDonald formula for horizontal spherical functions. So, here the L function that I wrote before. The L function that I wrote before in the previous slide, I had an L factor. This L factor here is the L factor corresponding to the nilpotent radical of a Borel subgroup of the dual group. And the formula here about the asymptotics of the basic function implies a formula for the unramified Plancharian measure, which, as you know, is given by. Is given by the gamma factor corresponding to the adjoint of the function. Let me make a digression before I go to more general spaces. Can someone remind me what time I started? Is it about seven after? Seven after, okay. I still have five minutes at least. So, um. So let me make a digression also relate to Bill. Suppose that we have a representation of the dual group of H with a technical assumption, the center should act by a non-trivial character. So we can form a formal sum of representations given by the symmetric powers of V. And this formal sum corresponds under the static isomorphism. Corresponds under the Satake isomorphism to a series of elements in the Hecke algebra whose Satake transform is an L function, is a local L function. And Kasselman asked whether this series of elements in the Heke algebra can be explicitly computed as a function on the Cartan double cosets of the group. So this is motivated by beyond endoscopy because these are the non-standard basic functions that one would Standard basic functions that one would need to plug into the trace formula in order to insert L functions into the trace formula. So these are non-standard basic functions. So it would be nice to have a formula for them. And indeed, one way Lee computed the formula and then I computed another one. And it actually, based on what I have just explained, it looks like this. So the proof I just explained. So we just need. So we just need to act to use this Hecke element to act on the basic function. But then the resulting function can be obtained by just calculating the asymptotics of the standard basic function acted upon by this L factor. So if you take the asymptotics of the standard basic function and you act on it by an L factor, that gives you another series of elements. Elements, like it gives you something that looks like an L function, but as we know now, we can interpret it as a function on Gmod N. And then you restrict it to the dominant elements, and that gives you an explicit formula for this non-standard Hecke element corresponding to the L function. Are there any questions? Okay. Okay, so let me continue with other spherical spaces and basic functions on other spherical spaces. So for the GLN cross GLN plus one Rankin-Selberg variety, so the quotient of the group by the diagonal of GLN, if you play the same game and you want to compute the asymptotics of the basic function, the characteristic function of the integers, you're going to get an expression like this. It again has the same numerator, but The same numerator, but then the denominator corresponds to a series of elements on G mod n, and this series of elements on G mod n is actually given by half of the weights of the tensor product representation. Sorry, actually this statement is wrong. I should take the tensor product representation and its dual. So there is a mistake in this statement. It's not just the tension. Statement. It's not just a tensor product representation, it's a tensor product representation and it's dual. So this sum of two representations has a set of weights, and then you split those weights in half by pairing them with rho. And the positive weights are the ones that appear in the denominator of this formula. And obviously, that has something to do with the fact that the Rankin-Selberg integral gives you this L-function. And I finish by mentioning the geometric meaning of these functional equations from joint work with Jonathan Wang. We have some assumptions on our variety. It should be, its dual group should be equal to the dual group of G. Hopefully someone can do it more generally in the near future. This includes, for example, the Rankin-Selberg case. So, as we have seen, the gist of So, as we have seen, the gist of the Casman-Shaleika method is to compute the Radon transform of the basic function. And the Radon transform restricted to the Boreal subgroup is just the push forward of the basic function, the integral of the basic function, along the fibers of this map, where x maps to x mod n. Okay, x mod n here in the sense of invariant theory, the GIT quotient. So, if you start with a function, with a basic function on x and you compute its image on x mod n, Image on X mod n that essentially does all that you want. You calculate the Hecke action on functions this way, you calculate Plancherel measures, you calculate local factors of global integrals. So this is the important calculation to do. So for example, in the Whiteker case, I remind you that this is what you get from Radon transform. And in the Rankin-Salberg case, this is what you get from Radon transform. So in the basic function can actually be defined even when x is singular through some shift function dictionary. Here we need to work in equal characteristic. And it turns out that the radon transform of this corresponds again to some L function. Function. That's the main result of the paper with Jonathan Wang, although we haven't completed the proof of the statement in every case. So, what can we prove? We start from a geometric model of X of O, which is the so-called arc space of X of O. And in fact, we're using global geometric models, but I'm not going to show that. So, this is the geometric model of X of O, and this is the geometric model of its GAT quotient by the unipotent. GIT quotient by the unipotent, and then the push for you apply push-forward map to some shifts instead instead of functions. No. Okay. And now we want to explain the various terms that appear in the formula. So remember in the numerator, we had something like 1 minus q inverse e to the minus alpha. These terms actually disappear if you compactify this map, if you replace the stack quotient of x mod n by the quotient of x times the By the quotient of x times the affine closure of g mod n mod g. So these terms in the numerator can be understood in terms of a compactification of the map of the space x mod n. So they will disappear if we compactify. And then we only have to understand the denominator. And the denominators, so we obtain such a formula for the push forward of the basic shift for the basic function. sheaf or the basic function because of various reasons that have to do with perversity of the push-forward sheaves and a factorization structure which implies that actually the push-forwards always will look like geometric series. So the only thing to determine is what are the thetas that determine the geometric series. And then you have the analog of the Casum non-functional equations which tell you what are the Which tell you what happens to this push forward when you apply a simple reflection divider. So I still have a couple of slides, but I think I'm going to leave it at that. There is some geometric meaning to these push forwards, and there is a geometric meaning to the functional equations of Hasselmann. And here is my favorite. And here is my favorite spherical variety, which is not smooth, which you've certainly seen in some other talk of mine. If I take the affine closure of this space, this is n copies of GL2 modulo, almost the entire unipotent radical of the Borel, but not quite, times the diagonal copy of Gm. Then this space gives you an L function and this L function And this L function is the n-fold tensor product L-function of GL2 to the n, where again I made the same mistake as before. I should take this representation plus its dual. Okay, and I'm going to finish here. Happy birthday, Bill. Many, many more travels full of energy. And let's hope that we're going to be in advance and watching. Banff and watching some other soon.
