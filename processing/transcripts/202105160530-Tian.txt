So, the first speaker in our workshop is Professor Gang Tian, a professor in Peking University. His title is Research Flow on Final Manifolds. So, please. Okay, thank you. And thank organizers for inviting me to give this talk. Give this talk. I guess it's the first time to give a Benf talk online. That's quite an experience. And also I was very impressed by this introduction of Professor Ni and about IS at Zhejiang University. I'm sure with his leadership and And with collaboration with the bank, I guess there will be a more successful workshop in the Zejiang University. I'm sure many of us will join more workshops later. But anyway, it's my pleasure to give this lecture here. And it's nice to see many. Nice to see many friends online. So especially Alice and Paul. I guess I haven't been to Princeton for more than a year. So it's so hope you are all doing fine. So my title of my talk will be a rich flow on phenomenal manifolds. So it's essentially a joint work with. With Li Yen and Sha Hua Zhu. So we know the rich flow was introduced by Richard Hamilton. And so you can hear me, right? No problem. Hello? Yes, we can see. Okay. I make sure it's all. So for any initial metric, there is a unique solution for. Unique solution for some time. So if we assume an underlying manifold, M is a complex manifold together with a Keller metric. So we know the Keller metric local is given by a Hermitian positive metrics valued function. And which satisfies a further condition, namely the omega is closed. So and so that means locally this Hermitian matrix is given by dd by derivative of functions. So luckily the rich flow preserve a calorian condition that is if the initial metric is calor, so does the GT along the flow. Suppose that the first chunk class is positive, it's definite, then we can take any calories. Then we can take any Kayla metric, omega 0, such that the initial metric, the Kayla class of initial metric is given by Foul-Schmung class, a multiple Foul-Schmung class. So lambda depends on a sign of Fourier class. So then we can consider the normalized Richie flow. In 1986, Hua-Dong-Kao proved there is a unique solution omega t for this normalized Rishi flow. This normalized Rishi flow. And furthermore, he proved if lambda is minus one or zero, the omega t converted to a K line isometric. Especially when the lambda is zero, he give another proof of a Calabiot theorem. So it remains to consider the limiting behavior of omega t as t goes to infinity when the first chunk class is positive. So in this case, this state. In this case, these days people call this such a manifold Fellow manifold because this due to work of Fellow on a classification for three-dimensional manifolds of this type. So basically, in this talk, we concern the following conjecture. So the conjecture has certain form. Certain forms. So I just stated in the most probably costly and is not so precisely, but actually that as we will see, this will imply all other refined version. So any sequence of this on a federal manifold contains a sub-sequence converted to a n space in a Gromo-Hostop. In the grommohost host of topology. And the limit is a smooth calorie rich solitan outside the closed subset of codamine at least four. Okay. So sometimes it's often referred to as a Hamiltonian conjecture. So this was stated in my 1997 paper precisely. So there has been many So there has been many progresses. So in 2013, Zhang Qi from UC Riverside, he proved there's a uniform constant such that for any X in M and any R positive, this volume ratio is bounded from above. So this together with Paramount's non-collapsing result, so implies. So implies a Gromohaus of convergence of m omega t to a n space. Of course, here to be precise, we mean any sequence contains sub-sequence converged to a n-space. And so this nan space may not be unique by this, I mean, just in this from this statement. But anyway, so this These consequences is rather straightforward once you have this Zhangqi's estimate and as well as the paramount estimate. So the question then becomes what is the best regularity of omega infinity and the convergence omega t towards omega infinity. A solution omega t is called type 1 if a curve called type one if a curvature of omega t is uniform bounded otherwise we call the type two okay so this is uh i guess this is a kind of classification due to uh hamilton okay and it was speculated all the solutions are of type one so that that what does that mean that means uh that means curvature of omega t is uniform bounded and that actually implies this uh in this this in this conjecture the limit m infinity is actually smooth and omega infinity is also smooth okay so so also here i should say it's uh um so once you have a certain kind of uh uh regularity like uh conjectured in the in the in the like stated in the conjecture then uh Conjecture, then this limit must be a caloric solid on a smooth part. Okay, so that's that follows from Perman's work. So now let's back to this page. So then the question is, does type 2 solution exist? And for a long time we cannot find any type 2 solutions. So that's probably leads to this concept. So that's probably leads to this conjecture. So there are some partial results. In 2002, Permanent stated without giving a detailed proof, and later Zhu and I give a proof. So namely, if M admits a Keller instant metric, then omega T converges to this giving Keller instant metric. So for example, on S2, On S2, which is a fellow, one-dimensional manifold. And on S2, there is a round metric, which is Keller Einstein. So then S2, this rich flow is always converged to this round metric. But this condition assumption is rather strong. What I mean is not all the fanal manifold admit canine style metrics. canine instant metrics. So in 206, after John, I proved a little bit more. We proved if M jumps to a fellow manifold M prime, which admits a Keller Einstein metric, then omega T converges to a Keller Einstein metric on M prime. So this jumps means M and M prime are differentiable, the same differentiable manifolds, but they have a different complex structure. Okay, it's a and a complex. Okay, it's a and the complex r to m is as close as it's sufficiently close to m prime than the complex m prime. But anyway, that's just this is supposed if this like this speculation, there's no type 2 solutions, then this is the best result you can get, basically. So that's what you get. So if m admits calibration, So if M admits a caloric soliton, then similar convergence was proved by Ju for torture manifolds and in the same paper with Ju and also improvement by together with Shi Jing Chang and Zhu. And then more recently, the Wang and Seth Li Basically, what mean general difference? The difference between this last case from previous one is because if M admits a rich soliton, then there's a S1 action. That's a so-called action. So there's a holomorphic vector field whose imaginary part generates this so-called action. And so then So, so then this in this joint work with Zhu and so on, we need to assume initial metric is invariant and this so-called action. And De Wang and Sek Need He did they removed this assumption. So, the context has been solved, and in dimension three, it's due to It's due to this my joint work with Zhang Jin Lee a few years ago. In high dimensions, there are two related papers. It's one by Bomler in the Enos and another by Chen De Wang in the JDG. So in fact, the Bombler solved the generalization of HD conjecture, namely he only needs to assume the scalar curvature is bounded, which is automatically true for Kalarische. True for caloric flow. So, in the same paper, one I did with Zhang General for dimensions three and less, we also prove the following. So, if we assume HD conjecture is true, so then the M infinity omega infinity is a limit of, I mean, assume this M infinity omega infinity is a limit of this. So, then the M infinity is a normal. M infinity is a normal variety. So namely, it could be singular, but not too bad. And omega infinity is smooth outside the singular set, which is a singular set is analytic sub-variety anyway. So this gives a refined regularity for M infinity. That's what I mentioned, that's what I mean at the very beginning. Namely, I stated the conjecture in the In a less refined way, but with existing past walks, you can get a refined regularity. So this is proved by developing a partial zero estimate for caloricity flow. So then the question is: is this the best regularity for any limit? Okay, so this is the same question as it's basically different formulation of the Different formulation of the question asked a moment ago. So, so this, so, so, whether M infinity can be smooth. Okay. So, or it's always smooth. Of course, sometimes M infinity is smooth. I'm sorry. So, so it's M infinity always smooth. So, it was speculated before M infinity is actually almost smooth. It's always smooth. So, equivalently, the omega t is always a solution of type 1. type one okay so so so so they if this speculation is true so then what we have a rich flow is that you have a limit the limit is always a smooth manifold though the limit may have a different complex structure like what Zhu and I already did if you made some assumption like that okay so so so so all other words whether this can whether this caloric flow in the limit has which is a might be singular can can can can limit be a singular singular space so so our recent work together with uh with uh lian and uh xia zhu we proved this speculation is wrong okay so they are solution of type two so so and uh so So, we found a solution of type 2 by using so-called G manifolds, which actually extension of these torque varieties. So, let's maybe since this is more algebraic, so I probably go this part a little bit faster, just the state the results, you this state of results. Results. Okay. So let's assume G is a reductive L group. For example, this as this S N C, something like that. So we call M by equivariant complication of G, simply called G manifold if it admits holomorphic G cross G action on M okay with open With open and dense orbit isomorphic to G as a G cross G, homogeneous manifold. So, I mean, let's say G manifold, the G itself as a Lie group, it has a G cross G action in general, right? Because from left multiplication and from right modifications, okay. So you basically extend these two, this left and right multiplication. Left and right multiplications to a complication. So, if so, so the manifold we have, the g manifold is simply a complication of group G and which inherits the action of left and right multiplications. And we call polarize whatever. So, the torque writes a special class of this. Okay, we call G M is a fellow complication or simply a fellow G mat. Or simply a fellow G manifold if its anti-canodic line bundle is g cross g neither is ample line bundle on that. So basically say if a first chunk class is positive because we already know this g cross action g cross g action extends to a computation. So this condition, even though I guess I stated, I should just say it's the same as the C1 for chunk class positive. Okay, so then we want to give a criterion for a fellow. Give a criterion for a final G-manifold n to admit the canine isymmetric. And for this purpose, we call some basic effects about the on the reductive Lie group. So let's I go through this fact, this just simple facts, standard facts about the group, Lie group. But you don't need to remember this. I guess in the end, you just want to remember theorem, which is give you a so giving a group reductive E-group. Giving a reductive E group, we can have maximum torus. So then we have giving the maximum torus, we have non-compact part of the algebra. And then we also have a root system roots. And then we have root system positive roots. Then we have a wide wall. And then we have a positive white channel and so on. So then we can further define. Define so this is in sigma is the interior for Kong generated by positive roots. And then we can define volume form. So this is this pi y essentially is like volume form when you integrate on the groups. So on the algebra. So then we can define like average. It's a center of it's like average of this. Of these roots, positive roots. So that previous topic had nothing to do with the manifold. It's just giving a group G, you have these things. So here is a highlight of this. So now I give you a computation. So we can have two things. So we can have one actual thing, namely polytop associated to this. So that's the image of one. So, that's the image of momentum map induced by T. But T induced action on M, which in this case is given by a Hamiltonian function, there's a moment map. And so, it has to be a Hamiltonian function because the manifold has a positive function class. So, then you can define a positive part of this polytop called P plus. So, then we can associate the very center. Can associate the very center with this. So, this is just like a volume form against it's it's it's like definition of a center in the in the Euro, except we use this as a volume form, as a volume form. Okay, so only thing you need to remember is that you can define a battery center, which is associated to this G component. Okay, so then we have this dead clocks. Uh, Dev Clark's theorem, which he proved in five six years ago, and he this is a very nice theorem. He proved that M be a fellow G manifold and P a polytop as such to that. So then this M admits canine is a metric if and only if this barrier center is contained in this, remember this is positive Kung. Remember, this is positive Kong generated by positive roots. And then you shift this Kong by two rows. It's like average of a center. So you just shift this Kong such that the center of a Kong is at this point. So Del Krauss proved this theorem by a continued method as a function. Method as Wang Shijia and Xiao Huazhu did for tolical manifolds many years ago. And an alternative proof was given by Li Yan and Bingzhou and Zhu in 2017. They proved the theorem by establishing properties of Mapuche's K-energy for K cross-K invariant metrics. Moreover, actually. Moreover, actually, they found that condition on the barycenter is equivalent to case stability. So, this fits well with a general theorem, a general picture, namely existing cannonstone metrics is equivalent to case stability. But in general, case stability is not easy to check yet. At least there are many problems. There are many progress, but we still giving a manifold is still a difficult question to check the case stability. But in case of G manifold, this Descross theorem gives a very clean and checkable way to check whether there's a canonical metrics. So then we can consider the two. Consider two groups rank two. So this is two, rank two. Just apply the previous theorem to these cases, okay? And check that very center conditions. Then we found, so we just look at the two groups. This is probably the simplest group we can use for our purpose. So one is SO4C. It's a other is V4C. So it's a group of rank two. So namely maximum. So, namely, maximum torus have a dimension too. So, it turns out if you check these very center conditions, sorry, you first check complications, you found that there are only three fellow SOC, SO4C manifolds, and three fellow SP4C manifolds. So, namely, giving these two, either of this group, Either of this group, there are only three computations which are fellow, namely whose chunk class is positive. Then, by computing the barycenter conditions and using a Deb Claus theorem, we can determine which of such a final G manifold admits a canine symmetric. So, in fact, there's only one SOC manifold and two spin 4C manifolds, which admit a canine symmetric, while there are other SOC. Why are there other S4C manifolds and one SP4C manifold, we do not admit the canine symmetric. So especially half of these six manifolds admit the canine symmetric, while other half do not admit the canine symmetric. So our theorem is my theorem is actually one we Actually, when we prove this, the theorem is that G be a complex reductive D group and M be a fellow G manifold which admits no canine submatrix, then any solution can rich flow on M with the initial metric omega zero. Probably we here for I don't think it's necessary, but let's see. Assume, but assume this initial metric is a k cross k invariant. K is a maximum. Invariant. K is a maximum compact group of G. So at least in these cases, this must be of type 2. So the must develop singularities. So I should make a remark. So when we first prove this, we assume G to be a complex, semi-simple. So later on, I guess I. And I guess I will leave it a typo here. So, in the original statement, the theorem assumed G to be semi-simple. So, later, this Zhu Sha Hua observed that the semi-simplicity condition can be removed. So, anyway, so now we just need a reductive equal condition. So, that implies there are two SO4C manifolds. SO4C manifold and the one spin 4C manifold on which Keller Rich flow develop a single type 2. So this speculation was wrong. So namely there are solutions of type 2. And probably there are also many others, but so here we use. Uh so here we use a group. Maybe there are some we use these G manifolds and maybe there are also more general cases one can one can one can check. But our proof is relies on the G manifold a lot. So there are basically two main steps. Let me outline a proof. The first is more crucial. More crucial. Basically, we state two propositions and let m infinity omega infinity to be a smooth limit of a Kelvin matrix. So we prove that theorem by contradiction. So we assume the limit is smooth for this G manifold case. So then we try to see whether there's a contradiction. Because this Because this manifolds, we have more we can control them in more effective way. So suppose it's a smooth limit. So then we claim this is also a falloch manifold. This is a closure statement. So this proposition was actually was was uh actually was uh we submitted this paper we also um i guess ref thank thank the referee and he he read he he he asked many questions so we we actually help us to clarify to make proof more uh more and more clear okay so so anyway so this at the beginning we thought this is uh not so difficult a thing to to see but it turns out thing to see. But it turns out this is not crucial. And the smoothness is crucial. If without smoothness, actually, this is it looks like many statements can go through, even the limit is normal, but turns out that that's not good enough. And so 1G is a semi-simple group, but now actually, I guess I just complete the transparency this. Transparency this afternoon. So, I guess I use some pages from previous one. So, now actually, we don't need, we just need to assume G to be reductive. But anyway, this is probably not so important because this semi-simple is not bad conditions. And in our experience cases, all the cases are semi-simple. So, the second proposition is if we So the second proposition is if g is a semi-simple then the limit m infinity is biholomorphic to that. So this is two things. So one is so one proposition say limit has to be a G manifold. And second proposition says the limit is must be actually by holomorphic to the manifold start with. So this will give you a contradiction. So, this will give you a contradiction because when you give a counter-example at the beginning, you assume m does not admit K-9 style matter. Okay, so if we assume this speculation is right, so then the limit is a calorie smooth calorie rich solid, M infinity is as a caloric solid. But since this is the semi-simple, then this M infinity has to be a has to be a terrible metric on M infinity must be terrible. And then this, you say this proposition too, this is a bi-holomorphic original manifold. So that you get a contradiction because then the original metaphor admits a canine is a metric. So that's a contradiction. So okay. So that's a simple logic. So of course now apply this to proposition to a to apply this to proposition to our to two groups so4c and sp4c of rank two i mean all these group all these two groups are semi-simple so we can apply that this proposition to prove our man theorem once we have proposition one okay so so so basically the three at least the it's a two of so4c manifold one of sp4c manifold which they do not admit They do not admit the canine style metrics, so they must develop singularity type two. Okay, so so a moment ago I said this proposition one is more crucial. And that's because, however, in the case of rank two, since we can list all the possible SG compatibilities, there are only six of them. So we can use the persuasion of warning for the growing. Of volume for the Gromov Chigroma of a convergence to conclude proof. So, for these particular two groups, we don't need a proposition two because we can we find all the six G complications. They all have a different volume. So, they cannot be a limit of another. S a smooth limit. So, so the proposition one is crucial. Namely, we need to prove if it's a smooth limit, the limit has to be G manifold. The limit has to be G manifold. So namely, the orbit in the process, this is not arbuous. It cannot be like in a limit. The orbit can shrink to can change a dimension or something like that. So let's skip this. So let me outline the proof of proposition one. So roughly tell you what's the key. So, roughly, tell you what's the key point. I'll use the Smooth limit. Now, by Quadara inventing theorem, we can invent M into Cpn by orthonormal basis. So, this is like what I should be refined the version of Cordarian Bennett. So, we use orthonormal basis. So, then we can talk about convergence. So, first, there's bihomorphism onto its image. This image, so induced by omega i, and the phi i converged to the holomorphic map from m infinite and to its image. So here we assume this remind you, the limit is smooth. Otherwise, I be it's not you need more to do more to have these things. Okay, so. So, especially the problem last condition may not be true. So, then this limit converges to this as some manifolds. And there's also uniform constants such that this omega i is bounded by restriction of Fulbright-Studi matchup. That's called omega hat i. Okay, so so. Okay, so so omega hat i, which is the restriction for the slurry metric on the sum manifold on the image are equivalent to the original metric. So we need to show this m infinity head. So m infinity head is same as m infinity, just a different way looking at it. So m infinity is symmetric limit of mi and m limit of m i and m m hat m hat infinity is a is a limit of as a complex sub manifold. Each one has a different advantage to the use. But they are bioholomorph to each other. So we just need to show M infidelity hat is a G manifold. So and it's not hard to see the G cross G action can be lifted to action on M infinity, Cp in N as subgroup. CP N as subgroup, then it's an induced action on the M infinity hat. So it's suffice to prove there's an open dense set. So the difficulty is to prove that's open density orbit. So limit has open density orbit. The limit has a G-cross action. That's rather trivial to see. So, so many things we need to check this open this OG orbit. So, so I guess so let's open orbit in the M. So then we look at this image, this open orbit, and then the complement is a divisor, and this device converts into a divisor. Okay, so because dimension tests. So because dimension cannot jump in a limit. So then we put the can jump, cannot jump. Okay, so it's a so then we put this. So the starting point is, let's say it's that T C is a maximum tolerance subgroup in the G. And small T C is basically the algebra. So then we form the basis. Okay, so so since this action, we already said action Og can be nifted to a CPN, it can be linearized. Okay, so then this maximum torus can be a is must be a subgroup of maximal torus group in this outermost group of CPN, CPN, okay, the PSAF. So then for this, once you need a Once you linearize, you look at this maximum torus. The maximum torus of this group has a dimension n plus one. So then there are some vector field. And the subset when the Tc does not act freely, does not act freely to S here, are just hyperplanet. Are just hyperplants. So that's because this maximum torus scale is just diagonal groups. So then we take out this plan and put the open set, open set. And we first prove this closure lemma. This first proof for any this thing, this is open dense g orbit. So basically to prove. So, basically, to prove this, we need to say for any induced vector field G by group action is non-zero in this part. So, giving any algebra in element of a group G, because of group action, it induces a vector field, induced vector field. And of course, the induced vector field on field on M for each omega i also and you pass the limit. So that's that part also uses smooth convergence. We prove for homo for fixed element in the edge of the group G once it's induced action on the on the induced electric field on the on the n with rush different i. Of course, sorry, induced action is the same. Sorry, induced action is the same, but then you want to see that in some sense there's a limit, okay? Because your metric varies, omega i varies. So, but nevertheless, we can prove this vector field with respect to omega i in the in the Chigger Group of topology, actually converged to a converges of vector field in the limit on the M infinity. And this part we use smoothness again. We use smoothness again. And the key reason for that is because for a holomorphic field on a phenomenal, just like this conformal field on S2, it always can be written as a gradient of some gradient of some functions. So for conformal field on S2, we know it's a gradient of linear function. So here we can also have a potential. So, here we can also have a potential. And once you change a metric and the potential have some relations, then you exploring that, you can prove convergence. So, you choose some basis in a certain way. This is rather standard for root decomposition. root decomposition. So then we can choose the basis of the algebra and the algebra of G and we do these things. The upshot is this induce honor vector fields and they converge. And these NIMI fields are independent. So but this is the independent as a vector field independent. What do we need to prove they are they are actually pointwise independent at least on this open part. On this open part, open subset of this object. So to prove theorem, we only need to show this for any span of this and in this open part. So this part is a limit of orbits, open orbits, and subtract some hyperplanes. And we want to prove this is level zero. So that means this. level zero so that means these these vector fields are actually on this set uh linear independent on each point at each point okay so so so then there are some uh by choosing a basis of the algebra we we did before you can have some orthogonal analytic conditions so so then you pass the limit you get passing we get the conditions on this okay On this. So I should say why we do this, and this is holds for this. This is just by definition of this. Once from one to R, that's in by choice of our basis, by choice of our basis, this is simply a basis, sub-basis of Torah, maximum Torah. Maximum torus. And by definition of this, we know this is independent of this part. So you start with the maximum torus, which part is because it's a group is simple, it's commutative. So it's easy to check this condition. But then we need to check to move this condition to whole span, not only on the sub-span. So this we use some also going on the condition. Maybe I go a little bit. Condition. Maybe I go a little bit fast. I have still a few minutes. So we have this condition. So we only to check this. This checksource. And this is equivalent to this. This is just through these impendings. This equivalent basically is the same thing in a different gauge, in a different gauge. Because through this holomorphic impending phi infinity, this goes to that, this goes to that. Goes to that, okay? And x goes to here. So to check the previous one, we use this some this partial zero estimate in bending. And then we get this, because this is a normal for that. And so then we only do these two. only do these two are independent. So what we have here is we want to prove each span is not non-vanishing. And we know on each of these is non-vanishing. So then if they are independent point-wise, then this is true. So this is done by examining. I mean, basically, follow some estimate. Maybe I skip this. Okay. So, so, so. So, in the limit, you prove they are independent. So, to prove that, again, you need to use this potential. See, you can go to potential and prove a potential level. Potential with different I, actually converge. So, after that, you still need to define a stable line to, it's not finished yet, and I And I didn't give a detail. So, this also requires some arguments. So, we define stabilizer, then from above, you can conclude is this you can conclude, okay? Gamma is a stabilizer discrete. This is because, but since our group is non-compact, so we still need to, by this moment, we still don't know whether gamma is. We still don't know whether gamma is finite or not. So next, we best want to prove it's finite. So once we prove finite, then it's gamma must be trivial because volume is preserved. If you have a finite group and the volume is a jobs. So basically, only you need the action to be kind of regular, namely like finite. So this is. Finite. So this is being finite the same as these two are the same. So namely for this maximum torus, this non-free action part is outside orbit, is outside this limit of open orbits. So this is like this. And I skip this part. This takes a few, maybe two pages to. Few, maybe two pages to prove. Okay, so anyway, after this, you prove this is G manifold. So we still want to determine a limit of caloric flow in above zero or corollary. So by now we know this caloric flow must develop type 2 singularities, at least for these G manifolds. Giving any G manifolds which do not add Which do not admit the Keraline style metrics, then it's let's assume manifold G is semi-simple. So then for any K cross, K this for some initial metric, this Kelly Rich will develop finite time, develop type 2 singularities. So, but according to this conjecture, we know there must be a link. Conjecture, we know there must be a limit. So the limit is a singular, according to what I did with Zhang Jin a few years ago. This limit must be a normal variety, and this singular set is sub-variety, and this omega infinity is Kelly Richelita. So this got to be true. This has been established. So then we can ask the question in our Can ask the question in the case of our G manifolds. We know the limit cannot be smooth now. So, but can we identify this limit? Whether this limit still is a G variety, okay? The G variety means the complication is a variety, not necessarily a manifold. It's still a complication of G group G. G okay, but after complication may be singular. Of course, it has to be normal. Singular cell is called complex for amain two. So actually, at the beginning, we thought this must be a case. We worked quite hard. And first, we extended Dark Claus's theorem to a singular G-met varieties. And first, we observe this very center, all these things can still be defined. things can still be defined for for G fellow Q fellow G manifold let's don't worry about Q fellow Q fellow just means the singular thing singularity are not so bad okay and it turns out this those those are only singular we need to worry about due to some compelling theorem okay so so we proved that if M is a Q fellow G variety with a fine polytop okay associated to Okay, associated to this group action, then M admits can be if and only if this. Actually, I never, I don't think this fine polytop condition is needed, but at the moment, our proof needs that. Let me explain that. By P being fine, we mean that each vortex of P is the intersection of precise K foresets, where R is a rank of G. is a rank of g okay for example in the s s s or for c this r is a two okay r is two so so so so for for right now for this proof we need this particle being fine because we need a background metric with rich current bounded from above so this time we use the metric Guildeman constructed so so so for for that purpose we need for for that purple we need uh we need uh find this uh we need this polytop to be fine okay so so i uh i think we should be approach using uh some general theme i did with the chili and uh feng wang wang feng and uh chu li okay in that case we actually prove this uh Uh, Yauti and Donazon conjecture for Q fellow varieties. We prove namely, it's a fellow is a K-stable if and only if there's a Kane's metric on the varieties. So on the singular varieties. Of course, that Ken Einstein metric is only smooth outside singular set and has some weak regularity on the other singularities. So then it amends to check a certain uniform case stability by. A certain uniform case stability by using a very center conditions. So it's like what this Li Yan and Zhouping and Zhu Shaoa did for smooth case. Maybe one can still do that without using some reference matchup as what we. As what we did now. So, anyway, this still open condition is an open question to drop these fine properties. So, as application, we classify the all Q fellow SO4C varieties which admit a canine symmetry with the same volume as that of smooth. The same volume as that of smooth fellow complications. Because volume is preserved and the Gromo host of limit. So that's what Toby did. So it turns out none of them can be a limit of calories on a smooth fellow, SO4C fault. So it suggests the limit of smooth G variety along a rich flow may not be a G varieties. So actually, so So that actually turns out to be the case. So in a few months ago, this Li Yan and Li Zhenye, both PhD students, former PhD students of Frank Peking University, they construct the semi-stable limit of K unstable phenotype manifold. In particular, they found the limits of normalized Kelly Rich flow on those K unstable. K unstable fellow S4C manifolds, which do not admit the canine symmetrics. So, in short, they identify limits, at least for this S4C. I think also for SP4C. So, they identify limits. And those limits, two limits, are not G-manifolds. Rather, they are called horospherical varieties. And of course, it will admit Calorish solitudes. Can rich silicons. So, so, so, I think the so if a limit is not smooth, then the limit of G manifold may be some other type of varieties, and which may not be G variety. So, so, so, I guess, guess the question still remains is. Even in the case of all these manifolds with a lot of symmetries, it's still interesting to see what the calories will behave at these things. For example, in 96, when I've constructed example, count example Clavi problem, and I used this Mocha, Umura manifold. Umura manifold, which is not a G manifold, but this, which is a which is complication of a G divided by finite group. So maybe one can still understand this complication of G cauching space of group G by finite group and see whether we can find some new phenomenon. New phenomenons and I guess still things to do. Thanks. Thank you, Professor Jian. Thank you very much for the wonderful talk. Any questions? Yeah, please, please. What is the lowest dimension in which this? Dimension in which this type 2 happens? Actually, I think it's maybe dimension 2 is not possible. I don't think dimension 3 is possible either, because in dimension 3, I think the limit of calories flow must be also smooth. And possibly, I'm not sure about dimension 4. So I guess here the dimension is quite high. So it's a hopefully dimension 4. Is a hopeful dimension for one can do something? So maybe there is one dimension four, yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not sure. I guess at least by the knowledge so far, the dimension four is the least dimension we can expect. Okay. Other questions?
