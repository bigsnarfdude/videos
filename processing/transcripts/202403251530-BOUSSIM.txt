Students, so today I would like to present a work in progress that I have now, which is identification of potential outcome distribution under selective attention. So the question or the problem of identification of potential outcome distribution is very relevant when you care about heterogeneous effect of treatment. So in practice, you can rely on assumptions like Can rely on like instrumental variable assumptions coupled with some kind of ranking variance assumptions or also selection on observables. However, when you have in practice the fact that you can only observe the outcome for a non-random subpopulation, there is this problem called sample selection that you need to deal with also because you don't only have to worry about. You don't only have to worry about the fact that treatment can be endogenous, but because of the fact that the outcome will be systematically unobserved for a non-random subpopulation, it's also an issue. So think about a question where you are interested in the effect of college attendance on earnings. So you have to first take into account the fact that individuals self-select into college. Self-select into college and also they self-select into the labor market. But you only observe the wages, the income for those who are in the labor market. So, yes, you are interested in only the effect of college attendance, but you will only observe the wages for those who are also selecting into the labor market. So, you need to address this double and regulatory problem jointly. Jointly. If you do it like separately, you may have biases. And in the literature, there are several attempts to solve this problem, relying on parametric assumptions or structural models. And also, like when they are in use of instruments, you generally need to have instrument with large support. Now, in this paper, what I'm trying to do is to provide identification results for a marginal distribution of potential. Result for a marginal distribution of potential outcome without relying on bias assumption, structural assumption. And I also don't need instrumentative support. I actually need a binary instrument. My approach also accommodates multivariate outcome, discrete outcome, multi-use and binary treatment, and I have point identification. So the way I approach the question, I first derive a representation result. A representation result that I will show after this slide. So, this is a model. Consider an outcome that can be multivariate and a treatment D that can be binary or continuous. Now, I have the sample selection indicator, which is one if your outcome is observed, zero otherwise. So, here y star is a latent outcome, and as I said, I observe y, I don't observe y star. And I'm interested in a marginal distribution of y this star. marginal distribution of y d star which is equal y d star is y star if d equals 1. So here I have t can be endogenous also s is endogenous so this is why I've said you have a double ontogeneity pull. Now what I'm interested in is the distribution function which is the C D F of Y distal. Now to answer that question I have this first result. So I think this result So, I did this result, and that is a first contribution of my paper because this is a generalization of a result in Andros in Columb 2005. So, it's a local representation of a multivariate copula. So, suppose you have a n-dimensional copula and you fix like some point in 0, 1 power n. So, I showed that for every j between 1 and n, you can always find. You can always find a unique parameter, which is like a correlation parameter between one and minus one and one, such that this representation holds. So, meaning that you can always separate for a given j, this is a joint distribution of u1 until uj, and also this is a joint of uj plus 1 until n. So you can always separate both. Now, this one, Now, this one, which is local, meaning that for each vector of point that I'm trying to evaluate the popula at, I have a different parameter here. So rho is a function of two variables, not a function of n. Otherwise, you don't have any constraint there. So rho is a function of the copula of the first js. And the copula of the plus n minus j. Yes. Everything like this, there's no constraint, but there's no constraints. Oh, I saw. Okay. Yeah. So this parameter always exists and is unique. And as I said, it's just the person correlation coefficient between these two product of integrated. So as I said, this allows me to tackle the problem with double ontogeneity because now I have, since I have two ontogeneity. Since I have two endogenetic problems, I can use this result. And the first lemma that I have before the identification result is this one. So this object can be identified from the data. And I prove using theorem one that it equals this. So here, this object I'm looking for, this correlation parameter that I also don't know, but I know this probability here. probability here which is just what I observe here so what I have here is one equation with two unknown so the use now of the binary instrument will give me two equations and two unknown giving some stability so the previous theorem uh can I interpret it as you are writing a coherence into a the term class the coherence yes yes in the pivot case is exactly that Is exactly that. Now, in the multivariate case, it needs to be independent between the two. So, here, when I suppose now that I can observe a banning instrument, so I rewrite the MA1 conditioning of that instrument. So, I have this. And the identify assumptions are these two assumptions: exclusion restriction and local coordination stability. So, exclusion restriction is very common. Exclusion restriction is very common in the IV literature. They are just saying that the potential outcome is not affected by the instrument. Now, this assumption can look like new, but it's not really new in the literature. You can actually relate that to already existing assumptions in the causal inference framework, like monotonicity or rank invariance, or also copular stability. Stability so this assumption can be related to those, and I do that in the paper. Now, with these two assumptions, I can identify the distribution and the local parameter. Because again, what I'm doing is like I'm creating two equations for 21. So, I have a system, and I just prove that the Jacobian of that system is a P matrix. So, by global universe theorem, I have a unique solution. So, this is what I have here in this theorem here. So, this is what I have here in this theorem here. That under assumption one, I identify the marginal distribution and the local parameter. When I have continuous treatment, also, I just need assumption one, which is exclusion or assumption local correlation stability. With that, I can rewrite things that way. And using the properties of the conditional distribution, I are again. Conditional distribution. I have again this system because Z is binary, so I will have again a system of two equations and four more. And again, this new system has a Jacobian, which is epymetric, so I have a unique solution. So these objects are identified even in continuous treatment case. So here, the one thing that I do is I allow Y to be multivariate. So, when I get the CDF, I can get the quantile in a straightforward manner. Now, when it's multivariate, I need to rely on optimal transport to get a quantile. Not the quantile, but I would say quantile type object because there is no clear definition of what is the quantile you want to know. But with optimal transport, you can always come up with a definition, and the papers already did that. So now. So now assumption one that I use to identify my parameters is not testable when Z is binary. If Z is more than binary, I can test it. But in the case Z is binary, I try to come up with an idea, which is like I should have these two distributions. I mean, actually, these two random variables should be equal. That Y given S and D and Y is. Y given S and D, and Y star given S plus 1 and D plus 3. So from the data, I can get a distribution of this one. And when I, for my identification result, I can also compute the distribution of this one. So I call them PDA QD, and I can come up with a test comparing these two distributions. And if they are different, I'm sure that assumption one cannot work. So I just finished. So, uh, I just finish here. So, the main contribution of what I'm doing is to provide conditions under which I can identify the marginal distribution of counterfactual or potential outcome with the binary instrument without relying on parametric assumption, structural forms, and instrument with large support. I also, to achieve that, I developed a new representation theorem, which is a generalization of the prevalent case in. Of the bivalid case in this paper, and I show that I just need the same assumption to identify the objects of interest in the binary treatment and the continuous treatment. So, thank you very much if you have any questions.
