And thank you for the organizers for giving me this opportunity to speak today about the topic that I love. And I would like to use this opportunity to ask some questions that I couldn't ask because I was sleeping during the problem session. So it's Friday already, so I'll try my best to avoid being technical and tell you some story. And tell you some story and some questions that this story leads. So, this talk is largely based on two papers. So, Asymptotic Lex Inequality, a paper which already appeared, joined with Craig, Lynchman, and Fam, with Cui. And a recent note just with Lynchman, where we settled the Remaining Mixed Characteristic case for some question from the first paper. Of some question from the first paper. So, this is how it relates to mixed characteristics. So, let me start slowly and introduce to you just some notations that I use today, right? So, today I will consider only Metherian local rings. So, M is always maximal ideal, and I will also only consider M primary ideals. So, I can always talk about the covalent of Colonth of an ideal which is the length of the quotient ring as an Artinian and Naturian local ring. More explicitly, I can define the colon as the length L of a largest chain starting from I and ending at the whole ring, right? It necessarily will be saturated chain, and this length is what I'm going to call the column. To call the colon and the colon is pretty much the most the most obvious invariant of a non-primary ideal and using it we can define a bunch of other invariants. For example, the second invariant that I am interested today is the multiplicity, which I'm going to give you some definition of multiplicity as the leading coefficient of Coefficient of the polynomial obtained by taking consecutive powers of a fixed ideal i and observing that this colon of i to the power n will eventually become a polynomial. And then I'll take this leading coefficient and normalize by dimension factorial and define this to be the multiplicity. So this normalization is needed so that multiplicity becomes Becomes an integer. So, an easy computation in a power series ring shows you that multiplicity is always one, and in fact, this normalization makes it always an integer. So, both the colon and the multiplicity are integers. And the next part, right, is the next obvious question is to relate them. So, Lex inequality precisely relates. Precisely relates them in a uniform way. It tells me that there is a constant, specifically the dimension factorial and the multiplicity of the maximal ideal, which gives me a uniform relation, right? The multiplicity of any primary ideal is less or equal than the colon multiplied by this constant. So the last leg introduced this inequality actually. This inequality actually with a specific purpose in mind. This purpose is now called Lex conjecture. So the conjecture predicts that for a flat map of local rings, we always have an inequality of multiplicities in a kind of intuitive direction. So the multiplicity of the base, right, should be no or less, no more than. No more than the multiplicity of the target. So the intuition behind this is that we expect multiplicity to be a measure of singularity, and we expect the singularity of the source to be over the singularity of the target. So this property is known for many invariants, but surprisingly, despite so many years of development, it's not known for multiplicity, even though now, I mean. Even though now, I mean, by recent work of Lin Chunmin and Chen Men, we know a lot more. So, Lin Chuan showed that, for example, in three-dimensional case and in the graded case, and the recent paper of Chen Men showed that for in the case where S is localization of a standard graded ring at the maximal homogeneous idea. But still, the full scope of the conjecture is open. Even though it's been, as you can see, quite a long time. And what Leg did, right, he introduced this inequality to show a partial result. So this conjecture holds up to a constant, and this constant is the dimension factorial. So it's kind of a recurring theme in multiplicity theory that sometimes this dimension is your friend, this factorial is your friend, and sometimes this factorial is your end, right? It makes multiplicity. It makes multiplicity an integer, so it's a good thing. But on the other hand, as you can see, it makes Lex conjecture quite difficult. And well, with the view of this, just with the view of inequality, and especially knowing the corollary that Lech obtained, we want to ask whether Lech's inequality is sharp or not. And Lech considered this question himself and This question himself, and he found that actually the inequality is not sharp as soon as you see this factorial. So in dimension at most one, the factorial is equal to one. So you can just plug the maximal ideal and get the equality. And more sophisticated result is that if you see this factorial, so if the dimension is at least two, right, then the inequality is actually. Then the inequality is actually never sharp. For any rink and for any ideal, you will never achieve the code. And this gives us immediately a bunch of questions, right? The problem or meta-problem is that can we actually sharpen Lex inequality? And today I want to consider uniform problems. So can we sharpen Lex inequality in a uniform way, right? And to make it a meta problem. To make it a meta-problem, I also want to allow you to include some additional data. We will see some instances of this problem. I mean, this is, of course, a meta-problem because I didn't tell you which invariance, which additional data. We can consider it's something that you could look at. And we can start, of course, by including no additional vector. So if you just look at Vector. So if you just look at Lex inequality itself, we can ask: well, I know that it's not sharp for any given eye, but if I consider all ideals of a local ring, will it be, can it be improved? Can we decrease this constant appearing in Lex inequality and get something sharper? And again, the desire for uniformity comes because For uniformity comes because I want to see Lex inequality as a uniform inequality, right? Uniform, for example, uniform upper bound on the quotient of multiplicity over colon independent of i. And if you want to get another instance of the problem, right, you can modify the left-hand side by including something else depending on i, right, while trying to decrease the right-hand side. So, we will see an instance of this a bit later. So, we start with this question and we turn to another source where Lex inequality appears. And this source is maybe a bit surprising. It's the geometric invariant theory developed by Manfred. So, I will be very rough and very quick. So, what basically Basically, he was interested in is in, he was interested in constructing compactification of moduli of smooth varieties. So smoothness is an open condition, right? So if we consider some kind of set of varieties, I mean, fixed dimension or maybe something else, right? Then we expect smooth varieties to be open there, right? So if you want to do, if we If we want to use algebraic geometry to study the moduli space, we would like to compactify it. And what is compactification? We want to understand what are the boundary points, right? So we have boundary points of this open set, so the sort of limits of smooth varieties. And that was the goal, right? To construct, to understand what varieties are limits of smooth varieties. And the natural question is that what are And the natural question is: What are actually singularities appearing on these limits? And for the Manfred's construction, he observed that somehow lexicon equality happens, appears. So it appears not exactly in R itself. You have to adjoin a variable because, sort of, you know, to allow one parameter degeneration to this limit point. Limit point. And what happens is that if you consider the supremum of left type, right, of multiplicity over the colon, it should be equal to the corresponding factorial. So we consider r with a joint variable, so it's dim R plus one dimensional ring, and we get on the right-hand side the corresponding factorial. And Manfort observes that this condition is extremal. Condition is extremal. So if you just look at the powers of a fixed ideal, I, we get that just from the limit from the definition of multiplicity, the multiplicity of i n is equal to the multiplicity of i times the power of n. And then we just again use the definition of multiplicity as a limit to get a cancellation in the limit. And you see that the quotient of multiplicity of i n divided by the colon of i n. Divided by the colon of n converge to the factorial. So we see that together with Lex inequalities, the supremum of Lex ratios is sandwiched. On one side, you have the factorial times the multiplicity of the maximum ideal, and on the other side, you have just the factorial. So the condition that Manford encountered, it is the extremal condition. It is the extremal condition. It is the lower bound on this ratio, on the supreme of ratios. And we can derive from these two inequalities one obvious corollary. So if the multiplicity is equal to one, then we will have an equality, right? Because both sides are equal. And we get an instance. And we get an instance where we can compute the supremum, and it's exactly equal to the factorial. But Mumford also, from the geometric consideration, from knowing a bit more about the construction of moduli spaces, we have an example where the supremum is the minimum possible. So if you just take a normal crossing. So if you just take a normal crossing right as a simplest singularity, it must appear on the limits of small varieties. So with this corollary is, and with this example, you see that the question that I asked is non-trivial, right? In one case, you see that Lex inequality cannot be improved, right, if multiplicity is equal to one. And on the other hand, in my normal crossing example, you see that. example you see that the multiplicity can be drastically improved right in fact uh you know you can um remove multiplicity completely right because normal crossing is a double point so the correct question to consider is the following right so when uh actually can be characterized when lex inequality cannot be uniformly improved right when is the supremum of all Supremum of all quotients of multiplicity in the colon, when is the supremum actually equal to the factorial times the multiplicity? Okay, so I want to provide to you a complete answer to this question, but first let me just make a very quick detour for one slide to this condition of multiplicity being equal to one. Of multiplicity being equal to one. So due to Nagata's work, right, essentially, we can completely understand what multiplicity equals to one actually mean. So the truth is that the way how we defined the multiplicity, it is something that only sees full-dimensional components, right? Because I took the Hilbert-Samuel polynomial, which is in. Which is invariant, which sees essentially everything. And then I took only the leading term of this polynomial, right? So I see only things of full dimensional. So multiplicity of a singularity is equal to one precisely when there is only one full dimensional component, right? And including embedded components. And this component E is non-singular. Component E is non-singular. So just wanted to give you this detail so we can understand the statement of our result. So our result gives us basically that it requires very special, very degenerate singularity for lex inequality to be uniformly sharp, right? Sharp, right? So we can improve lex inequality always, for example, in a complete irreducible singularity. So the conditions that we get is that if multiplicity of the reduced part of the completion is bigger than one, then Lex inequality can be uniformly improved. So the supremum, in other words, is less than what is given by Lex inequality, the factorial time. Lex inequality, the factorial times multiplicity. So, I want to describe to you a sketch of the proof, right, and explain to you how did mixed multiplicity appear. So, first, there is one easy direction, which I'm going to prove by example. So, this direction is that if the multiplicity of the reduced part of completion is equal to one, then we actually get the equal. To one, then we actually get the quote. And basically, what we do in this case is that we pull from the reduced string, we pull the powers of the maximal ideal. So, you consider a family of ideals, which is obtained by taking powers of the maximal ideal and your join the new radical. And then, essentially, a simple computation shows you that, well. That, well, first of all, just by definition, right, the colon of it is equal to the colon of the maximal, the power of the maximal ideal in the reduced part. And those guys, by my assumption, will converge to one, right? Because the multiplicity of the reduced part is one. And second is that you can compute the multiplicity of each of this ideal, and you get that basically. That basically it will be equal to n to the power t times the multiplicity of the ring, right? And then it happens that if you just take multiplicity of each i n divided by its colon and you take the limit, you will see that it will converge precisely to d factorial times the multiplicity of the maximum vector. Okay, so this direction is quite easy. So, this direction is quite easy, and the other direction is the one that you have to work with. And the absolutely crucial start for the proof is, in a sense, an elementary lemma, right, proved by chasing exact sequences, but this lemma is of great value. So, essentially, let me well, you can. Well, you can see the statement, right? So, let me tell you what the intuition, right? So, we have the ratio. So, if you take M prime ideal and we take a parameter which is not contained in this m prime ride, then we get inequality on this left-up ratio, so multiplicity divided by the colon. And I also include for simplicity d factorial. And we can bound above by two. Can bound a ball by two things. First of all, we can either increase the ideal, so we take i x, which is a strictly bigger ideal, or we can actually decrease the dimension, right? So we take the same ideal i, its image in armodex. And you see that conveniently my d factorial decreases to become d minus one factorial, which is appropriate for this d minus one dimensional ring. For this d minus one dimensional ring Karmodex. So, this inequality is absolutely instrumental because it tells us to do induction. So, we can do induction simultaneously on dimension and on the colon. If we will be given that Lex inequality can be uniformly improved in R mod X, then we can do induction. We can do induction on the colon of i to prove that lex inequality can be improved uniformly in r because it's always sharp for any individual ideal, essentially. And for maximal ideal, it is obvious, right? Because we get multiplicity on one side and multiplicity times d factorial on the other side. Cannot be sharp. So So, this works well, I mean, to set the induction, right? But we know that I already told you that Lex inequality cannot be improved in dimension one, right? So, in dimension one, we know that Lex inequality is always sharp. So, the corollary is that we can reduce the proof of our theorem to dimension two, and in dimension two, we still need to. We still need to work. But we want to still use this lemma, even in dimension two, but then we need to be very careful because this R mod X now will have dimension one, right? And we cannot just assume that Lex inequality is, I mean, we know that it's not sharp there. So we need to know. There. So we need to know much more, and this much more is a result that we called asymptotic Lex inequality. So this is something that, in a sense, fits our intuition, right? So this upper bound, the sharpness of flex inequality should be something special, right? Because usually when you have an Usually, when you have an inequality, right? When it's sharp, it is something special, something interesting, right? And we can greatly sharpen this expectation. So if you have one-dimensional isolated singularity, then it happens that the deeper ideals behave increasingly like ideals in a regular ring. So the deeper you go, the better you can make Laxon equality. Uh, Lex inequality. So, more precisely, is that um, what is Lex inequality in one-dimensional regularity? It just tells you that the multiplicity is less or equal than the colon, right? Because the multiplicity is just equal to one. The multiplicity of the maximum ideal is equal to one. And we can approximate it. You can tell me which epsilon you want, right? And we can be epsilon close to let's. Close to less than equality in regular ring by taking I of sufficiently large colour. So for example, I can take epsilon to be one half, right, and this will give me a hope to start induction using this crucial lemma. Because one plus epsilon is So one plus epsilon is three halves is surely less than the smallest multiplicity of a single ring, which is two. So this gives me a kind of approach that I'm going to sketch to you, right, to combine it. So we still want to do induction on the colon of i and to set this induction we use the This induction, we use a crucial lemma. And to actually be able to use crucial lemma, we need to know that the colon of i modulo x is actually large, right? Then we use a symplication equality and we get that inequality can be improved a lot, right? So instead of multiplicity, I can just put three halves. House. But this leaves us a case which I didn't tell you yet, right? So we assume that in the case where my assumption doesn't work, so is the colon of i mod x is small, we need to still improve Lex inequality. So if we can do this, right, then I can do induction on the colon of i, right, because I, right? Because everything just fits in the crucial lemma. So here I have a term for which I can use asymptotic lag, right? So the three-half constant happens. And here I just use the induction on the colonel. So the proof is done, provided that we can do step two. And step two, as you can see. Step two, as you can see, this is an instance, another instance of this meta problem of improving Lex inequality. So we need to improve Lex inequality in a particular case, right, where I know more by incorporating additional data on I, which is the equivalent of a modulo general linear form X. Okay, does that make sense? Are there any questions before I go? The questions in the room. Thank you. So what happened, right? Let me sum up again. So we have started with the problem of improving Lex and the quality general. Improving Lex inequality generally, and due to two great results, an elementary crucial lemma and less elementary asymptotic Lex inequality, I reduced the general uniform bound to one particular bound in this particular, in a sense that now I can incorporate more information about I, right? I can incorporate a bound on the colon of I modulo general form. And this is sort of if you imagine yourself being kind of an epilogue. Yourself being kind of in a polynomial ring that restricts you the shape of I, right? It tells you that in one direction its size is bounded. And somehow still we couldn't figure out how to use it. So we tried to use a different restriction on I that we can derive from the bottom, the colon module, a general linear form. A general linear form. So there is essentially a fault lower theorem that can be deduced, for example, from a paper of Junsovatanabe on M full ideals, is that the number of generators of a primary ideal I is bounded above by its colon modulo element Z, right? Any element Z, and the number of generators of its modulo Z, right? So the number of generators in R can be deduced, can be. R can be deduced, can be bounded by information modulo z. And I want z to be actually a general linear form. And if you apply this theorem in dimension one, you'll easily get another Fat Law result that in a one-dimensional ring, the minimal number of generators of any primary ideal is bounded by a constant independent of that ideal. You just apply this result and note that. Result and note that R mod Z will be zero dimensional, so it has finite length itself. In my case, we are interested in two-dimensional ring, right? So, I apply the theorem and I get that R mod Z is one-dimensional. So, the number of generators of I mod Z is bounded by some constant. So, if the co-length of I mod Z, general form Z, is bounded. General form Z is bounded by this n, then I get that the minimal number of generators of I is bounded by that n plus some constant. And we do this just because somehow the number of generators is an easier invariant, right? I mean, than the colon modulo general linear form, right? It's the invariant that easier to work with and the easier to picture, in a sense, right? So this. So we will now consider another problem. So, in my case, it's a two-dimensional problem, which requires us to improve Lex inequality uniformly given that only that the colon of I is bounded. Not the colon, sorry, the minimal number of generators of I is bounded. Okay, and well, I need it only in two-dimensional case. Well, I need it only in two-dimensional keys, but I want to ask you questions. So I'm going to ask it as a very general statement, as a very general problem that I don't know how to solve in full level of generality. So I want to ask you whether we can improve lex inequality uniformly by incorporating the data on the minimal number of On the minimal number of generators of m primary ideal pi. So I wrote a very formal statement, right? So, what does it mean is that we want to just obtain some constant depending on the dimension of the ring and an integer n. And this constant should be less than one, right? To make it an improvement of Lex inequality. And so we scale the right-hand side of Lex inequality. The right-hand side of lex inequality by that constant, right, which should work for any ideal I in a ring of dimension D and which is generated by at most n elements. So this is an open problem. I will describe to you some partial results, but I also want to ask more questions, right? Questions, right? So if you think about, for example, monomial ideals, right, this looks like a very combinatorial, very geometric question, right? Because you can compute for monomial ideals the multiplicity as essentially the volume of Newton's polyhedron, right, corresponding to the integer points of monomial ideal. And then there should be perhaps some kind of a combinatorial explanation, right? Combinatorial bound, which gives me a relation between on the left-hand side the volume of, you know, well, Newton's polyhedron is has cofinite volume, right? It is convex, but infinite such that its complement has finite volume. So you have this co-volume on the left-hand side. Covolum on the left-hand side, and on the right-hand side, you have the number of integer points, right, in the complement of Newton's polyhedron. And you also want to incorporate the number of generators, right? So the number of vertices in Newton's polyhedron. And I don't know if there are combinatorial results, right, which will give us some bound. And of course, if you have a bound, right, then A bound, right? Then, especially in such a combinatorial case, right? I mean, it is maybe natural to ask what is the optimal bound, right? So, I would be interested to know, right, what is the optimal bound for monomial ideals? What is more generally, what is the optimal bound in regular rings and polynomial rings? Is it the same as for monomial ideals? I don't know. And of course, you are welcome to consider special classes for ideals. For our purpose, actually, it is. For our purpose, actually, it suffices to consider only integral closed ideals, and this will be the result that I will tell you. So, it is a kind of problem which is again a bit open-ended, right? And allows to ask many particular questions. And I have for you two partial results that I want to consider. So, the first partial result. So the first partial result is from the big paper, right, for author paper, and it considers the equal characteristic case. So in the equal characteristic case, we have, well, we can answer the problem, right? So if I impose additional assumptions that R is equal characteristic, I have an explicit function, a bit ugly, right, and following, well, you see this function, right? It's D minus first power. is d minus first power of some fraction right involving d minus first root of n right but it is a it is a bound right and it holds in full level of generality assuming equal characteristic and unfortunately i know nothing in mixed characteristic right we don't know whether this result still holds a mixed characteristic and um And maybe even worse, right, the proof that we have. Well, clearly, since it doesn't work in mixed characteristics, it is characteristic-specific. And, you know, given that it's a statement about multiplicity, I truly would love to have a mixed, characteristic independent proof, right? And I do know it. And I want to explain. I want to explain to you what are the ideas of this proof, right? So that you see where a characteristic is important. And the characteristic is essentially important right at the beginning because we prove it in a positive characteristic using positive characteristic method and then we reduce mod p to get the equal characteristic statement. And then positive characteristic, what we can do is that we What we can do is that we want, we can use Hilbert-Kunt's multiplicity. So, this theorem, right? So, there is some function of NAD, right, which improves on Lex inequality. It is an easy consequence of results that Doug Haynes considered. So, let me remind you that Hilbert Kunst multiplicity is a kind of multiplicity which is defined solely in Which is defined solely in positive characteristics and which is based not on the powers of an ideal, but on Frabinius' powers of an ideal. So we just take an ideal generated by Q powers of elements in I, where Q is a power of characteristic. So you can think about it as if how do I define just regular paths? How do I define just regular power? I take all monomials of degree at most whatever n, right, on my system of generators, right? And to define Fropinus powers, I don't take monomials, I just take straight Pn powers. So it is a different filtration, but still, by result of Monski, the limit exists. And what Haynes proved is that there is a relation, this type of uniform. This type of uniform relation between multiplicity and Hilbert Kund's multiplicity of any primary ideal, which involves the minimal number of generators. You see that actually this constant, not the constant, but the way how the minimal number of generators appears, it exactly the same way as it appears in the theorem that we want to deduce. And then from Haynes theorem. From Haines' theorem, we use just a different result of Haynes. Haynes proved a Lag type of inequality, Lech type of inequality for Hilbert-Cond's multiplicity. So you see, we have multiplicity on the left-hand side, we have the colant on the right-hand side, and because the definition of Hilbert's multiplicity does not involve the factorial, there is no factorial. There is just multiplicity, oh, Hilbert-Cruz multiplicity of the maximum value. Hilbert-Kuhn's multiplicity of the maximum value. So it is complete Hilbert-Kuhn's analog of Lex inequality. And maybe just as an aside, is that because there is no d factorial, it's only sharp, right? If you plug instead of the maximal ideal, we get the quote. So, and there is always a comparison that Hilbert Kuhn's multiplicity of any ideal is at most multiplicity of that ideal. So, combined, right? Ideal. So combined, right, Lag inequality for Hilbert Kunds and the comparison, this result follows in characteristic P. So really, it's an easy consequence of all work that Hens did. Then, of course, the reduction mode P is a bit nesterer, but yeah, this is what it is. And of course, looking at this proof, right? Well, my naive question is that. My naive question is: Is there Hilbert Kund's multiplicity in mixed characteristic? So, well, this is a bit of overkill specifically for this problem. Of course, I mean, I would like to if somebody would tell me yes, right, because I love Hilbert's multiplicity and work on it a lot. But even if you cannot say yes, and you just look at Haines' proof, right, and the proof of the Haines proof, right, and the proof of the theorem that I just described to you, you don't need, in a sense, that much, maybe, right? So, what do we need? We need to prove the result of Haines, right? And then we need this additional properties, right, to deduce the theorem from the result of Haines, right? So, I believe that essentially Haines' proof is based on two observations. So, the first observation is that the Frabinius Observation is that the Frabinius power does not increase the minimal number of generators. And the second observation is that Frabinius power is contained in regular power. So the question is that is there is some kind of reasonable filtration in mixed characteristic or maybe even characteristic free filtration that will satisfy these properties, right? And then we don't even need that the limit exists. If you don't even need that the limit exists, right? You can consider limit superior, right? To replace the Hildekons multiplist. But the key is that we also need the second inequality to deduce from Hain's type of bound our theorem, right? We need also to get this, well, let's say, Left type of inequality, right? We need to bound this Hilbert-Kundst type of multiplicity. Hilbert Kuhn's type of multiplicity by multiplicity and the colant, by regular multiplicity times the column of i. And of course, you know, I mean, the function that I give to you is flexible, right? You can add a constant there, maybe, right? As soon as that constant is not too large, so you're still improving on, you know, on less inequality, right? So maybe you can even, you know. Even you know, relax this sketch of the profile. So, I don't know. I don't know what can work. Are there any questions? No questions from the room. Okay, so let me let me then, after speculating, after giving you the faint proof, and after speculating. After giving you the Haines proof and after speculating about this result, right? Let me tell you what happens in mixed characteristics. So we have this theorem in equal characteristic, right? So it provides us an approved Lag inequality for ideals of bounded number of generators. And we plug it in the Sketcher's proof, right? And we get the uniform Lex inequality in mixed in equal. In mixed in equal characteristics. So that was what was claimed in the four orthographic. The mixed characteristic case was open, and we found in the short note with Lynch and very recent one, we found a way to circumvent this. So while we cannot prove this theorem in a mixed characteristic, we can prove a Wicker statement. So the Wicker statement is as follows. So we first of all So, we first of all restrict to only integral closed ideals. And second, is that, well, we have maybe Agler constant. Anyway, is this constant? I don't know. It's personal whether it's Agler than the constant that appears in the previous theorem, but it's definitely, I believe it's a worse constant. But it is still a bound, right? It still suffices for our purpose. So I didn't explain to you. So, I didn't explain to you, but it suffices for our result to consider only integral closed ideals. And this result is characteristic-free. So we actually don't need the previous result. We can use this characteristic-free result and get characteristic-free proof of uniform lex inequality. So, in this case, the mixed characteristic is not special. So let me tell you actually some ideas of the proof, right? Because they're interesting. So the proof is easy, but it has a kind of trick on it. So the trick is that somehow we should pass to the associated graded ring with respect to general linear form. We have two cases. As you can see, my constants are different. You can see my constants are different in dimension two, in dimension bigger than two, and in dimension bigger than two, we just reduce to positive characteristic by taking associated graded ring with respect to the maximal ideal, right? If you take any ring and you take associated graded ring with respect to the maximal ideal, it will be equal characteristic. In a mixed characteristic, you reduce to positive characteristic. But it doesn't work without taking this inner. Without taking this inner associated graded ring with respect to general linear form, right? Because essentially, you would want to compare I with its initial ideal and the associated graded ring. And I wrote to you the formula for this initial ideal. Essentially, you just take piece by piece the image of I in each term of the associated graded ring. So the term of associated graded ring is mn. Graded rank is Mn modulo Mn plus one, right? And you just take the image of I in each piece and you staple them together. That's the initial idea. And just from the definition, you see that we can get minimal additional generators in each degree, right? You have intersection of I with Mn, right? And module Mn plus one that can get new generators. There is really no There is really no control, I don't know, any non-trivial bound on the minimal number of generators of the initial ideal, initial form ideal. The trivial bound is just the bound by the equivalent of IM actually. So really trivial bound. But because the associated graded ring, well, we can reduce to the case where the depth is positive, then the associated graded ring with respect to Great ring with respect to general form is a polynomial ring over R mod Z, and then we kind of cut dimension by one and we can do you know use this bound on the number of generators that I described to you earlier. I mean this bound and we can actually get control in this case and then we just use that fax inequality is not sharp right in this equal characteristic D minus one dimensional ring. One-dimensional ring. So it is a trick, and surprisingly, the same trick works in dimension two, but in a very different flavor, right? So we cannot use that Lex inequality is not sharp because R mod Z now is one-dimensional ring, right? And Lex inequality is sharp there, but we can actually emulate Hilbert Kuhn's multiplicity. So it's a kind of an instance where I can give you positive answers. Can give you a positive answer to this filtration question that I just asked, right? So we are working in a polynomial ring invariable t, right, with homogeneous ideals. So I can just split it by powers of t. And then I emulate what would Hilbert Kuhn's multiplicity, what would Frabinius power do, right? I raise generators to power Q and I raise T to the power Q. T to the power q. And well, it is not uniquely defined. So we take just a particular system of generators and we just increase these generators to power n. So it's not an invariant definition. It depends on the choice of system of generators. And it happens that the proof works because we are in a dimension one. So the tricks with multiplicity. So the tricks with multiplicity work. So yeah, we use Hilbert Kuhn's multiplicity proof in this case because we can adapt. And the last question, one more question that I want to ask, and again about mixed characteristic, but actually in characteristic zero, is to come back to this crucial. come back to this crucial result, crucial step in the proof of uniform Lag's inequality. So we had this result that we called asymptotic Lag inequality and which told me that in an isolated similarity deep ideals behave nicer and nicer. And the main result of our four-author paper establishes the same result in full in any dimension, but in past. In any dimension, but in positive characteristic, so this result says that we have again less inequality in a regular ring, which tells you that multiplicity is less ripple than the factorial times the colon, because the multiplicity is equal to one. And our theorem tells you that, again, if you can approximate it for any epsilon, right, you can get as close to this Lex inequality in a regular ring, right? In a regular ring, right, in a complete isolated singularity, but for deep enough ideals. So, in isolated singularities, deeper ideals behave increasingly like ideals in a regular ring. So, very sophisticated, I would say, proof in positive characteristic. This is what we have, and we don't know this result anywhere else, right? We don't know mixed characteristic, even in. Even in, yeah, we don't know mixed characteristic, we don't know characteristic zero. The statement is asymptotic, right? So you cannot just, it doesn't seem that you could do reduction mod p and the isolated singularity is bad, for example, because we cannot do inductional dimensions that we enjoyed in our main proof, right? In a uniform proof that I described to you. Described to you. And this isolated singularity condition, I want to mention that it is somewhat necessary. So if you take R of large multiplicity, large as a function of dimension, then you can join a formal variable and you get a counterexample to this result. So I don't know if isolated singularity is completely necessary, but it cannot be too much relaxed. I don't know if we are just. I don't know if we are just don't see what is appropriate statement, and maybe it can be proved easier, right? If you relax this late singularity to the correct assumption, but I don't know what this correct assumption should be. So yeah, again, mixed characteristic, characteristic zero, we don't know what to do. And maybe to finish this. Maybe to finish this on a slightly better note, right? Let me give to you a result which works in all characteristic and it has a very similar flavor. I don't know if this can be an approach or not. So this result is due to Harrow Bloom and HM Liu. And it is a different style of asymptotic Lex inequality. So this result actually inspired us to search. Inspired us to search for our asymptotic lecture in COVID. And it was used for them to get uniform convergence to study semi-continuity of so-called normalized hole of a single lecture. So anyway, the background is not important, but what this result says is that basically if you restrict the shape of an ideal, then you can approximate this Alex inequality. A Lex inequality of which the optimal Lex inequality in the sense that Lex inequality is that holds in a regular local ring. So you can again replace multiplicity by one plus epsilon. And the cost of it is while we, in our asymptotic leg, we take colon greater than something, right? Or actually, equivalently, you can require i to be contained in large power of maximal ideal here. Here, what they do, they need to sandwich I. It is both contains a large power of maximal ideal and is contained in large power of maximum ideal. It is sandwiched. So, if you picture it as a monomal ideal, right, here I drew a small picture for you. It's sort of contained, all the minimal generators are contained in this trapezoid, right? So, it's not a fixed trapezoid, but it's a trapezoid with fixed ratio. A trapezoid with a fixed ratio of the side of trapezoid and the side of the triangle, right? So, this is what delta in the statement is. So, for these ideals, which are sandwichedly, yeah, sandwichly generated, you can improve Lex and code. And their proof is based on Newton-Okunkov bodies. So, maybe Jack is a better person to ask what is a Newton-Akunkov body, but essentially it's a different way to do Tor. It's a different way to do Torrect degeneration, right? We start with appropriate D-dimensional evaluation and we use evaluation to transform your ideal to monomial ideal. And there we use combinatorics to prove the statement. And yeah, so this assumption on being analytically irreducible and algebraically closed, it's needed for this kind of machinery. And maybe it can be dropped with more sophistication. Dropped with more sophistication, but the important part is there is no absolutely no characteristic assumption here. And I don't know, maybe somebody else more knowledgeable about Newton-Nakenkov bodies or valuations, right, where this Newton-Nakenkov bodies start is that can you somehow incorporate isolated singularity assumption right in the proof, right? I don't know if evaluations work better or differently, right? Work better or differently, right? I mean, can you somehow do something, right? Or I don't know, maybe, yeah. So it's also a combinatorial question, right? Because you reduce to monomial ideals and you need to prove combinatorial problem. But it is also an algebraic question of what this kind of type of isolated singularity will tell you about combinatorial problem. So, anyway, I don't know if this can be an approach, but this is an exciting result. This is an exciting result in terms of characteristics and just in general, right? It's very cool type of really improved Lexington. Okay, so thank you very much for your attention. This is all what I wanted to say today. Great questions for Ilya? Okay, well, I have a question. In your mean partial result, in this, so you have this very concrete function C. This one? The previous one. The main thing, yeah. So, do you know if this is? Do you know if this is the best possible C you can put to actually get something for all in primary ideals? I do know, and I strongly, strongly doubt. I mean, I really would bet, I mean, I would be extremely surprised that it's sharp. Okay. So that's part of the reason why I ask for optimal constants here, right? Because I don't know if it's optimal in the regular ink. I mean, I doubt that it's optimal in the regular. Okay. Yeah, this question actually maybe I should demonstrate, right? It's open in regular ring of mixed characteristics, two-dimensional one, for example. Really open and mixed characteristic. Oh, there's a question here. Ilya, in these questions one and two, what happens to the D? Is it dropped on purpose or which one? The open questions one and two that you ask in this slide. The C. CA, the C was on the okay, yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah, it dropped by mistake, yeah. Okay, thank you, Renke. Okay, yeah, optimal constant dependent on n for fixed dimension. Yeah, the lifetime should depend on the rate. There is no reason for it not. More questions? Let me take one final look at the Zoom chat. Okay, no questions there. Well, let's thank Ely again.
