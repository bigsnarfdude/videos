Isabel Werner, and she will speak about the Steiner formula in the LP Pluminkovsky theory. Thank you very much. Thanks very much for the introduction and thanks to the organizers for doing this nice workshop. And the thing I'm really sorry about is that I could not attend all the talks because it was the last week of our semester and there were many. Semester, and there were many things like student presentations and department meetings and committee meetings where I had to go. But everything is recorded so I can still hear the talks. So let me start with the classical Steiner formula of the Brunminkovsky theory, and that was already mentioned several times during this workshop of, for instance, yesterday by Thomas and by Semyon. So I'll go quickly. So, I'll go quickly. So, for a convex body K and positive real number T, we look at the volume of the outer parallel body of K, that is K plus T times the volume of the Euclidean unit ball. So this is the Euclidean unit ball for me. And we know that this is a polynomial in T with certain coefficients W I are rewritten a little bit different. rewritten a little bit differently coefficients vi and the wi's are the query mass integrals and the vi's are the intrinsic volumes and mostly I'll take the point of view of the query mass integrals and of course there is a relation between the query mass integrals and the intrinsic volumes which I have written here and also many or some of the query integrals are very well known like the zero query mass integral is nothing else zero square mass integral is nothing else but the volume of k the first square mass integral is modulo the constant one over n the surface area and the last square mass integral is the volume of the euclidean unit ball so that is the classical um the steiner formula in the classical punminkowski theory let me now pass to the lp punminkowski theory and basically this lp punminkowski theory was initiated Ummikovsky theory was initiated by Erwin Ludwig. And then there are contributions by many people. And I apologize beforehand if I forgot some names, which I certainly did. So apologies. So what is the L-Pipun-Minkowski theory about? Well, a central object in the L-Pipo-Minkowski theory is the L-P-affine surface area, which is defined as follows. So for a real number P different from my Real number p different from minus n. The L P surface area is the integral over the boundary of k. So this denotes the boundary of k for me. What is integrated is the Gauss curvature raised to the power p over n plus p, and we divide by a boundary point inner product with its outer normal nx, and that gets raised to the power n p minus 1 over n plus p, and we integrate with respect to the usual. integrate with respect to the usual surface area measure on the boundary of K, or which is just the Hausdorff measure restricted to the boundary of K. So this is the LPF and surface area and notice that we need to assume that P is different from minus n because of this denominator in the exponent. There are several cases that are special. Well, the first case is that when p is equal to one, When p is equal to one, one recovers, then the term in the denominator disappears, and we recover the usual classical affine surface area, which is just the integral over the Gauss curvature raised to the power 1 over n plus 1, and that goes already back to Blaschke. Another special case is when p is equal to 0, then in the 0 affnant surface area gives us this integral here, the integral over the boundary of k of the inner part. Over the boundary of k of the inner product of a boundary point with its outer normal, and that is nothing else, as it's easily seen, than n times the volume of k. So p zero affine surface area is n times the volume. Now, as this p affine surface area is such a central piece of the L P Pon Minkowski theory, we were asking ourselves if it's not possible to establish L Psy A LP or Steiner formula for the LP affine surface area. And that's exactly what we did with Katya Tatako. Namely, given a convex body K in Rn that is C2 plus, so for the moment we need still that the body is C2 plus, and given a real number T, that's positive, and now we need that T is also bounded above, then Bounded above, then we can write that the PF and surface area of the outer parallel body of K, that is K plus T times the Euclidean unit ball, is now an infinite polynomial in T. And because it's an infinite sum here, we need this restriction or the upper bound on the T's in order that the sum is finite. Is finite. So we get, so to speak, an infinite polynomial with these coefficients. So we have some expressions which involve finite sums involving expressions that we call script w. So where we sum those up for m goes from zero to k, and then we combine those. That is, we combine the sum of these script w's and call them script p's. In particular, In particular, when p is equal to 1, we do not need to make a distinction between the script w's and the script v's. It's just, so to speak, one expression. And in analogy to the classical Steiner formula, we call the coefficients script W the L P Steiner coefficients, and the coefficients script V we call the L P Steiner Crevas integrals. Cuervas integrals. Now I have not yet defined those coefficients, so let me go ahead and define those coefficients that is the Lp Steiner coefficients and the L P Steiner quermas integrals. And in order to do that, well, it turns out that actually, so the theorem so far we have only in the case when kc2 plus. However, these coefficients and these square mass integrals, we can define. Mass integrals we can define for all convex bodies. However, for this talk, I'll stick with the body being C2 just to make things a bit simpler. As I said, we can do it for general convex bodies, and then we need to replace the corresponding differentiation expression by instead of taking usual derivatives, we need to take. Derivatives, we need to take generalized derivatives, but that can be done. And I don't want to go into details in this talk and stick for the moment with C2 during this talk. So case a C2 convex body. And we look at the Gauss map that sends every boundary point to its outer normal. Gauss map was just mentioned in the talk that we just heard. And the differential, so Gauss map is of class C. So, Gauss map is of class C1. If k is of class C2, then the differential of the Gauss map is called the Weingarten map, and the eigenvalues of the Weingarten map are the principal curvatures, which I call ki of x, of k at x. So then, also well known to this audience, the j's normalized elementary symmetric functions of principal curvatures are denote by h j, so it's just the sum of the corresponding. Just the sum of the corresponding up-to-order, you take it products of the principal curvatures. And the convention is to put H0 equal to 1. So in particular, H1 is the mean curvature, that is just the sum of the principal curvature, modulo the factor 1 over n minus 1. And Hn minus 1 is the Gauss curvature, that's just the product of the principal curvatures. Then, with that definition out of the way, I can now define the L P Steiner coefficients and the L P Steiner quermas integrals, namely, as I said, we can define it actually for a general convex body. So what are the L P Steiner coefficients? The notation was this. So this script WP with index m and k of a convex body, this is. Of a convex body, this is the integral over the boundary of k. Then we look at the inner product of x with its autonomous, so we've seen that before. But now it gets raised to the power m minus k plus n 1 minus p over n plus p. Then comes our term which involves Gauss curvature that gets raised to the power p over n plus p. And then comes more complicated expressions. More complicated expression. So it's the sum over indices I1 plus 2, I2, and so on, plus n minus 1, i n minus 1, and those add up to m of certain coefficients which we call c n p m and i have written them here. So those are these coefficients. And then come the product, j goes from 1 to n minus 1 of this binomial expression n minus 1 to. Expression n minus one, choose j to the power ij, and then comes aj to the power ij. So it looks a bit complicated, but it is what it is. And the as I said, we call those the those these we call the L P Steiner coefficients and the L P Steiner quermas integrals. We just that were these. We just that were these script v's. Those are just the sum, m goes from zero to k of the L P Steiner coefficients, modulo this binomial expression in front of it. All right, so let's have another look at them. That is in particular, let's understand the zero LP. zero L P Steiner Premas integral. That is the V script V P zero. Let's understand that to get a little bit of feeling of what we are looking at here. So that is K is equal to zero. Now, if K is equal to zero, then because the L P Steiner-Cremas integrals are sums of the L P Steiner coefficients, so if k is equal to zero, m is equal to zero. So what we look at. To zero, so what we look at is just this expression here: n one minus p over n plus p choose zero, but this is one. And then we look at the L. Pi-Steiner coefficient with index double index zero. So let's go back up here. So m is zero, k is zero. So this means this disappears. Also, let's now look here. M is equal to zero. That means that. zero that means that all the ij's are equal to zero so everything here becomes equal to one and in fact also this coefficient here becomes equal to one so what we'll end up here is nothing else but that integral which is our already familiar pfn surface area of k so in other words if we look at the zero coefficient at the zero lpsteiner coefficient At the zero L P Steiner coefficient, we'll get the P F and surface area of K, which corresponds exactly what's happening in the usual Steiner formula, in the classical Steiner formula. The zero coefficient is just the volume of the body. So it's the same behavior. Right. Now let me have another look at another special case, namely the special case when p is equal to 0. With a special case when p is equal to zero. Then we get on the left-hand side just the zero affine surface area of this outer parallel body of k, and we know zero affine surface area is n times the volume. So on the left-hand side, we'll just get n times the volume. What do we get on the right-hand side? Well, if everything is correct, we should get what we are expecting to get. And indeed, we do. Okay, what happens is that the zero Pisteiner query must interfere. Zero Pisteiner query mass integral, that's just n times the volume. We've understood that. One can show that if k is bigger or equal than n plus one, then actually all the L P Steiner coefficients disappear. And if k is between one and n, then the L P Steiner coefficient just become a multiple of the classical Trier mass integrals. So as a corollary, we get So as a corollary, we get, if p is equal to zero, we'll get back the classical Steiner formula, as it should be. Okay, now, so in particular, in this case, our infinite sum becomes a finite sum. Now, I want to mention a situation when the infinite sum is also a finite sum. Also, a finite sum, the infinite sum of our LP Steiner formula, and that is the case when p is equal to minus n L minus one over L, where L is a natural number. In this case, the infinite sum also becomes a finite sum. So the minus n L minus 1 over L affine surface area of the outer parallel body of K is the sum K goes from 0 to N to L. From zero to n to l minus one of our L P Steiner coefficient times t to the k. And now, if we look at the last L P Steiner coefficient, that is this one here, that is the L P Steiner coefficient with the index N2L minus one, of K, what we'll recover is the PF and surface area of the Euclidean unit ball. Euclidean unit ball. So again, we have this parallel behavior. The last coefficient is the PF and surface area of the Euclidean unit ball, which is exactly what happens for the classical Steiner formula, where the last coefficient is the volume of the Euclidean unit ball. Okay, I want to now look at some of the properties of these LP query mass integrals and. And there we observe various things, namely, firstly, the Lpsteiner coefficients and the L P Steiner quermas integrals are homogeneous of degree n n minus p over n plus p minus k. So that's the first property. Secondly, the Alpisteiner coefficients and Alpisteiner Kremlin integrals are invariant under rotation. Are invariant under rotations and reflections, and when p is equal to one, they are also invariant under translations. And thirdly, when p is bigger or equal than zero, or p smaller than minus n, then for all k and m, the Lp-Steiner coefficients and Alpinsteiner quermas integrals are valuations. So far, we can prove this last property only in Last property only in the case for general convex bodies in this p-range. However, if when we have in addition that the bodies are C2 plus, then we can prove it actually for all p, and then it's actually a consequence of our LP Steiner formula. And evaluations is very familiar to this audience, has been looked at by many people, and again. And again, I have put a list of names here, and it's by no means exhaustive. And I again apologize if I missed people, which I'm pretty sure I may have. Okay, so let me briefly indicate the proof of some of these properties. And let me start with the homogeneity. So we'll use two facts. Two facts. The first one is just, so to speak, change of variable formula passing from integration over the boundary of k of some function g to integration over the boundary of t k, where t is a linear invertible map, then this behaves like so. So integrating over g over the boundary of k. Boundary of K is the same as integrating the accordingly modified G over the boundary of TK and in comes the determinant of T in absolute value to the minus one times the Euclidean norm of T to the minus one transpose involved evaluated at the normal at the appropriate Are normal at the appropriate point and to the power minus one. This is just a transformation formula. Then we also want to relate the inner product of a boundary point on TK with its autonomal to the transported back inner product of a boundary point on K with its autonomal. K with its autonomal and the identity goes like so. And again comes in the norm of this map T to the minus one transpose applied to the appropriate auto to the outer normal at the appropriate point. So we apply this fact now with t equals to Now, with t equals to lambda times identity, and we also use that the elementary symmetric function of principal curvatures behave like so under this map lambda times identity. And then applying the fact to this t here and comparing things gives us immediately the homogeneity. Immediately, the homogeneity. So that is the homogeneity. Let me go to the invariance. There we also used the fact together with that if we have that t is a rotation or a reflection, then the determinant is, of course, one. And the norm of that expression here, That expression here, because of a T is preserving norms, this norm here is nothing else but the norm of this autonomal, and that is, of course, one. And we also use that the sets that the how to say elementary symmetric function of principal curvatures. Of principal curvatures. So that when we look at them on the boundary of Tk is nicely related to the corresponding ones when we look at them on the boundary of K. So we use all that. And the fact and that after some doing some work collecting terms and whatnot, we'll see that we have this identity here for the identity here for the L P Steiner coefficients and recalling that our L P Steiner quermas intervals are nothing else but corresponding sums of L P Steiner coefficients we'll get the invariance property as so I want to mention one word about the valuation the valuation property but only in the case p equals one case p equals one and in that case we don't have to distinguish between the L P Steiner coefficients and L P Steiner Kramers integrals because the sum is just in I mean the M sum is just becoming one term and if P is equal to one then okay what do we have to show we have to show that the L P Steiner coefficient of the union plus the L P Steiner coefficient of the intersection is The intersection is nothing else but the L P Steiner, but the sum of the L P Steiner coefficients. So now I have written again, well, in this case, when P is equal to 1, I have written again what the L P Steiner coefficients are. So it's this expression here. So basically, what is this expression? Well, it's nothing else but a sum modular constants of integrals. Constants of integrals of such a form. So if we want to show the valuation property, it's actually enough to show the valuation property of expressions of this form. And that's what we do. We show that expressions of that form are valuations. And to do that, we'll apply a strategy that was as That was, as far as I know, first introduced by Schutt. And we decompose the boundary of K-union L, the boundary of K-intersection L, the boundary of K and the boundary of L in such a way that we have common terms in each of these expressions so that we can compare things. So I let you stare at this for a moment. That's probably, yeah, I'll let you stare at this. Like you stare at this for a minute or so, well, maybe less and continue. So, we have decomposed these boundaries accordingly in parts where they have terms in common. And on these terms in common, now we want to compare our expressions. So, our expressions were involving the Involving the principal curvatures and eventually Gauss curvatures times these principal curvatures raised to some powers. And well, we note that those expressions here, if we look at, for instance, the boundary point that comes from the Boundary point that comes from the out of the union of K union L, then this is the minimum of the corresponding K and L's. And if the boundary point comes from the intersection of K into L, then it's the maximum of the corresponding expressions. I also let you stare again a little bit at those expressions. So, doing all this and collecting. So, doing all this and collecting terms and putting things together again, we can actually show then the valuation property. If one looks at valuations, it's natural to also inquire about continuity properties of the terms in question. And there is a long tradition of doing that, and therefore, it seems natural to Therefore, it seems natural to also try to figure out if the expressions that we have now, that is these L P Steiner quermas integrals and L P Steiner coefficients, have some continuity properties. And what we can say is the following, that in general, the L P Steiner quermas integrals are neither upper nor lower semi-continuous, let alone continuous. Here I write in general because, okay, we have. In general, because okay, we have seen, for instance, if p is equal to zero, we'll get the classical Fermas integrals, and those are, of course, continuous. So, but in general, they are neither upper or lower semi-continuous. There is one other instance where things are a bit different from the in general, and that is for a notion that was also basically introduced by Ludwig. And those are the mixed LPF and surface areas. So, how are those? Areas. So, how are those defined? Well, they'll get two parameters, P and S now. So, the P as mixed affine surface area of K is the integral again over the boundary of K, and we look at Gauss curvature, which we now raise to the power S plus P over N plus P. So in particular, if S is equal to zero, we'll get the usual affine surface area, P affine surface area. And then we'll take again inner product of a boundary point with its outer normal. A boundary point with its outer normal, which now we raise to this power 1 minus p n minus s over n plus p and again, integration is with respect to the usual surface area measure. So looking at those mixed pf and surface areas, we see that actually our L P Steiner coefficients are appearing there as well, namely if k is equal to m equal to l n equal to L n minus 1, where L is a natural number and P is equal to 1, our L P Steiner corresponding L P Steiner quermas integral is actually nothing else but such a mixed affine surface area or in other words excuse me Elizabeth I think your time is almost up actually. I think it's up actually so there was some delay so I think. There was some delay, so I think you can have some more minutes, Elizabeth. Oh, yeah, I started late. Did you take that into account, Thomas? I took it into account, I think. Oh, he took it into account. Okay, so our, let me say one word, our Elpicheiner coefficients or Cremas integrals are actually have, there are some instances that they have already appeared before, namely as mixed. Namely, as mixed LPF and surface areas, and this is actually my last slide, for those if p is bigger or equal than zero, those particular L P Steiner quermas intervals which correspond to this mixed affine surface area, those are actually upper semi-continuous and have homogeneity and valuation property and the invariance property. And as far as we know, even though And as far as we know, even though those had been looked at, that is these mixed square mass integrals, they have not, this had not been observed. At least the upper semi-continuity, I think, had not been observed. And that's it. Thanks. Okay, so thank you, Elizabeth, for this nice talk. Are there any questions or remarks? Are there any questions or remarks? Raised hand by Julian. Yeah, thanks, Elizabeth, for the nice talk. So my first natural question when I looked at these things, do you get any Kramer's integral inequalities, like except the classical ones for your news? That's of course, that's, of course, the natural question. Course, the natural question, yes, and we are actually looking, we have some kind of inequalities, but it's not exactly what we want yet, but of course, completely natural question. And we are working on that. All that is still, you know, work that is continued. And yeah, yeah. Of course. Thank you so much. Another question by Another question by Chofu. Hi, Luke. Thank you for the nice talk. So these valuations, you've determined. So do these things extend to the convex ring or do any of them? Can you repeat, please? So sometimes valuations of convex bodies will extend also to the convex ring. Oh, we have not thought about this at all. Yeah, so that is certainly, yeah, yeah, I'd like to hear more about that. Yeah. Yeah, we haven't thought about that at all. So make note, extend to convex ring. We haven't thought about that. Yeah. Thanks. Sure. Thank you. I also have a question, Elizabeth. So do you know what kind of regularity you have in T? So you have written this infinite sum, but how regular is this in T? In this Steiner-type formula? What do you mean? How regular? You mean how will you? I don't know. Is it differentiable with respect to G again? We haven't thought about this. Yeah, so that is certainly also interesting to look at. Yeah. Is it just a formal expression or how should I think about this infinite sum? It's basically mostly mostly just a formal it's not just a formal expression so when we started working out this formula it looked pretty it looked pretty messy at some point because you had so many terms that were having the same power but they couldn't be combined to an easier looking expression and um And what you then had to use to be able to what we saw at some point that we actually could simplify some of the expressions by using Minkowski's integral formula and various other formulas. And that helped us to simplify and to get the expressions to the point how they look now. Actually, I remember, and that is. And that is thanks to Andreas. I remember that was when I was in Frankfurt at this international summer school that they have there. I remember sitting in this, in my apartment in Frankfurt on the floor, and having the paper all spread out across the floor and trying to combine the expressions that we got. And once Once we could see in some easier cases that we could combine them, we believe that they could be simplified in this more combined form that you see now. Because in the beginning, so it's not just formal, there is something behind it.
