Thank you for the introduction. I'd like to thank the organizers for the invitation and the efforts put into this event. I'm jealous of being the on-site meeting, in particular trip to Mount Alban on Wednesday morning. So this talk is based on a recent joint work with one of the organizers, Jose Carrillo. One of the organizers, Jose Carrillo from Oxford, the good looking, the best-looking guy on the left, and a former master's student, Ms. Ling Chen, who is now currently a PhD student in Connegue Mellon. So before talking about our numerical studies of random genetic drift model using the optimal mass transport method, I'd like to briefly describe or introduce a few concepts in genetic. Few concepts in genetic drift from biology. So I can better explain or demonstrate our mathematic motivations and mathematic results. So we know that in a chromosome just consists of a long chain or string of the DNA that has many genes, which consists of the AT GC base pair. So a gene is then a sequence or portion, a part of DNA that can function. DNA that can function. So gene then encodes or functions through the base pairs. And the gene can basically determine the so-called genotype. For instance, one section of the DNA determines the color of eyes or color of hairs. And then allele basically determines the phenotypes. For instance, we're talking about the color of the eyes, red, blue, yellow. So an allele is basically what. Blue, yellow. So, and Leo is basically one of the forms of a given gene variant that inherited from the parents. And there are also some maybe misunderstanding on misconception between the genetic mutation and genetic or allele drift. So, genetic mutation in DNA or RNA is natural. So, it's basically there are spontaneous mutations, even for healthy. Mutations, even for healthy cells, and we know that they also can be induced or inspired by, for instance, chemicals or radiations. However, a genetic drift, ADH, or so-called ADH drift, is basically describes the change in the frequency of an allele in a population. So the drift is natural and it reduces the biological diversity, as we should see. See, for instance, I'll give you an example. Let's consider. An example. Let's consider we have a genetic pool that has two alleles: A represented by red and B represented by blue. So, if all the individuals can reproduce with the same frequency and there's no genetic mutation and there's no occurrence of migration, so let us draw randomly from the parent with placement. So, we have one red and one blue. Okay, so there would be that would give us four possibilities. That would give us four possible outcomes: red, red, red, blue, the blue, red, or blue, blue. And it's very easy to calculate that based on the unit distribution, the probability of two reds or two blues would be a quarter, and the probability of one red, one blue would be a half. So let's repeat this for the second generation. So let's do the random drawing and with replacement. So in the general So, in the generation that has red and red or blue-blue, we know that there's no chance that you have a different LEO. For instance, if you have red and red, then all the new generations will be red. So if you have blue and blue, then all the generations will be blue. But in the case of you have a hybrid combination of red and blue, then again, you have a half probability of having another red one. Having another red, one red, and one blue, the hybrid. So, if we continue doing this for the future generations, then we know that the only chance that you have a hybrid, one red and one blue, is based on that you have this hybrid, this combination in the previous generation, and the probability would be one half. So, that means depending on starting from the parent generation of one red and one blue, the proportion or the probability of having The probability of having one red and one blue after n iteration or n generation will be one half to the nth power, which converges to zero if we iterate infinite time, infinitely many times. So which means eventually we would have either the red and red or blue blue would dominate the whole genetic pool. So that's basically one of the simplest demonstration of the genetic fixation. And Randy Fisher first to my And Ryan Fisher first modeled the two allele problem. They assume that in these individual dial populations, the node generation can overlap, and each generation is drawn independently from the parent generation, and there's no migration and no genetic mutation. After this assumption, then the Radifischer discrete model can be written in terms of this transition probability in the bilateral form. So here, why about Bilabriform. So here, y of t, I use this y of t to represent the proportion of allele a at each generation t. And n would be the copy of allele a at the t or the n plus 1 generation, a t plus 1 generation. So I did a simulation starting from the half-half, for instance, we have. Uh, half half, for instance, we have half population of L A, half population of L B starting of total population 50. Then we do the shuffling and the drawing with the replacement by the Reinhardt feature, bilateral, the transition probability. Then we see that after iteration, we see the shifting between the genetic drift, but then eventually we see that the LEOB would dominate with the frequency one, which means then in all the eventual then in all the eventual iteration, there will be no a little A because there's no genetic mutation. So basically we assume that we see that in this case with no genetic mutation or the advection, the genetic or biological diversity is lost through the genetic drift or the ADH drift. Mora and Kumula, they were the first that They were the first that studied the continuum case or the large limit of the right fission discrete time model that they formulated this Kohler-Forward equation describing the probability distribution density of one allele. And then let's take a look at these, the Mura, the Mura, the Mura continuum model. So here, this is a purely diffusive model. Purely diffusive model. The only difference it has with the classical heat equation is that the diffusion rate is now not constant but spatial dependent. And in particular, we know that this problem, the diffusion rate is degenerate at the end points when x is 0 and x1. So a heuristic gives us that when there's always diffusion, the diffusive coefficient is always positive inside the domains, which means we always. The domains, which means we are expecting the spreading from the spreading or the diffusing of the population from the inside to the outside. But because of the degenerate diffusion rate at boundaries, on the boundaries, we see that these things would stay sticky whenever they touch the boundary. So, in that sense, we also should expect. In that sense, we also should expect the conservation of the total population after any iteration or in the whole time. So, eventually, one would expect that density would converge to two direct delta functions accumulated on the boundary because of the conservation of the total population. And another thing is one can consider so-called advection or from the fitness difference between focus. From the fitness difference between focal and opponent species by adding an advection term. So even we have this one advection term, but we still expect we have the shifting of the advecting of the solution, but we still expect the convergence to the direct data function in long time. And from the viewpoint of mathematical analysis, Sub and Sutta, they prove really. Suta, they prove rigorously by imposing two integral constraints that it represents the conservation of law, a conservation of mass, and conservation of first moment, second moment, first momentum. In the purely diffusive case, they establish prove the existence of unique weak solution, and then they present that this PDF converges to the direct out function as in a heuristic argument exponentially fast. Exponentially fast in a random metric. And theta is a function that can be calculated explicitly. Wait a second. Okay. So from the viewpoint of numerical analysis, then the challenges are how do we quantify the direct data singularity? In particular, when the direct data singularity presents, it can be very challenging, very difficult for us to capture spatial temporal dynamics. And so we are. And so we are motivated to present, to build up computation-efficient, but also biological relevant methods which are robust and convergent and stable, such that we can capture the direct out function to the fullest possible extent. So, I would like to mention before presenting our argumental method, I would like to argue that or demonstrate that there are also methods that That there are also methods that capture such blowing up. For instance, people propose the adaptive method, the moving mesh method to capture the blowing up method. That's one point from the numerical analysis viewpoint. But the other one is I want to emphasize from the mathematical analysis point, this problem also brings challenges because no boundary conditions can be imposed for this problem because of degeneracy of the diffusion rate. Degeneracy of the diffusion rate. In particular, actually, no boundary condition should be imposed for this degenerate parabolic problem. So I will not go into that direction. So let us now move forward to the numerical schemes. There are a bunch of nice people who propose to study these direct out functions. So, and they propose convex shape splitting or they. Or the impulse method. They did some cost-race comparison between the finite difference, finite element, finite volume methods. And also, some people studied the finite difference method that has multiple, three alleys indeed. I want to emphasize that all these methods are trying to capture the direct doubt function directly. That is, they work on the PDE directly and they impose this non-flux boundary. And then they impose these non-flux boundary conditions so they have the conservation of the mass and conservation of the first momentum without the adversion. Before we present our method, I want to introduce the idea or the concept of the pseudo-inverse distribution. So what is pseudo-inverse distribution? So let's give a probability PDF, probability density function f, which is positive. So the capital F would be The capital F would be its cumulative distribution function. And then we define or we introduce the pseudoverse of the CDF by saying you give me one area. Then phi would be the first location that's such that the CDF achieves the area eta. So that is pseudo-verse mathematically will be presented by this. Actually, it will be presented by this. So that is, given the mass eta, phi is the first location that accumulates this value. And when f, so this is well defined and it is non-decreasing. In particular, it's strictly increasing if f is strictly positive. The good thing about or the advantage about these pseudo-inverse distribution is that we can now transfer or transform the direct delta function, which is in heaven, which is in. function which is in heaven which is not touchable into star function which is touchable which is workable on earth so i did i should i should present more iterations for this so here it's just an illustration of the pdf and pseudo inverse function so if you see eventually this one goes to i i should present more iterations then the idea is to demonstrate that we have convergence of the pdf now transforms to the convergence Transforms to the convergence of the pseudo-inverse into a step function, as we mentioned earlier. So now, after we introduce this pseudo-inverse function, we are able to transfer the original Moran-Kimura equation into this Euler-Lagrange equation, this non-level equation. And in particular, the advantage is that we are now able to characterize the distribution. To characterize the distribution or convergence of the PDF in the Kimura equation to the direct data function by the convergence of the pseudo-inverse into this data state, which is explicitly given by the Heaviside step function. And another thing is, I want to talk about because the steady state is explicitly given. So if we linearize the steady state around the problem around the steady state, we have this eigenvalue. Steady state, we have this eigenvalue problem, and the principal eigenvalue is calculated by the radio quotient. And indeed, it's explicitly given by two. I want to remind you in this case that this one is optimal as it describes the exponential convergence rate in time, and we also have this optimal convergence rate in our proposed discrete scheme. So now we transform our Euler Lagrange equation by the GPU scheme, which I just wave my hands here by this variation argument. Now the thing is, we do this so we can transform now the problem of finding, solving the problem into finding a minimization problem for this n-functional. And function. We do this, did a little bit of the calculation, find the first variation. And then for this problem, now we did propose the Euler implicit scheme to solve the problem. When we look at the Euler's implicit scheme, one thing is that for our proposed scheme, because of the strong non-interity in the MPI, we like to explicit the potential. Explicit the potential into two parts. We use the convexploiding. So we have the both components of these energy functionals now are convex, which will be useful for our analysis of the uniqueness and the stability of the scheme. So now we are given this, we give this Euler's implicit scheme. So the idea is now we saw. So, the idea is now we solve these, we solve for the red dots, given all the blue dots. Now, we do this by first of all, now given this ends, now this end conditions are transformed from the conservation of mass. Now, we write the whole thing, write the whole thing as a fixed point, and then we will now solve the fixed point problem by the new iteration. By the way, I would like to mention. By the way, I would like to mention, so here basically phi should be a vector with solving the whole function for each time, for each fixed time. And this is the temperature, the Newton iteration that characterizes the convergence rate or decay rate of the Newton's method. So I just wave my hands to this technical part. So our main results are given. So, our main results are given by this. So, the proposed discrete scheme can be uniquely solved. And we also expect the dissipation of any functional, as well as the conservation of the first momentum, the mass of the first moment as in the continuum version. We also show the convergence of, indeed, the optimal convergence of the problem, module narrow of the spatial discretization to the discrete state. Discretization to the discrete state state in time. Next, we present several convergent studies that demonstrate our scheme. So basically, this is showing, we choose the reference solution to spatial size to be fine and temporal size to be fine. And present several two sets of robust convergence analysis of the problem to the steady state. Of the problem to the steady state, the converged order analysis. And here is a demonstration of the spatial temporal dynamics in the purely diffusive case, that is, when there is no focus potential or adversion. So we start out of symmetric initial data. And you see on the left-hand side, we're solving, we're solving. On the left hand side, we're solving the pseudo-inverse problem and respect the convergence to the steady state to the heavy satisfaction function. And on the right, so this is not this is not a solution from the original equation. This is now the recovering of the probability density from the pseudo-inverse. So because the pseudo-inverse is strictly montonic increasing, so we can always recover the original density from the pseudo-inverse. That is, we From the pseudo inverse. That is, we are now not working on the original Morat-Kimou equation. We are working on the Euler-Lagrange equation of the pseudo-inverse function. So, this is the spatial temporal dynamics out of the symmetric initial data. The second is the spatial temporal dynamics out of asymmetric initial data that we also expect a very convergence to the heavy site step function. Now, it's characterized by the And also characterized by the convergence to the Deranged Audio function of the probability function. And we also present several convergence analysis to support and demonstrate our theoretical results and several sets of the analysis of studies against the variation of initial data in the puberty of diffusive, as well as the replicator diffusive. Replicator diffusive equation. That's it for my talk. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for a nice talk. Any questions? Yeah, here's the question in the audience. Just a second. Hello, this is Bertram. Hi. Thanks for the nice talk. If I understand correctly, If I understand correctly, you used the uniform mesh here. Could you also maybe use a non-uniform mesh to resolve a bit better around where things are going on? Ah, you are talking about the Eulo-Lagrange or the Moran Timura. Yeah, about the soil inverse in the middle. You mean this? You mean this one? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah, okay. Oh, that's. Um, oh, that's very sharp. Yes, we're using the uniform, so that's the advantage of the pseudo-inverse. I, I, because of the time, I did not, I deleted my slides over the over why a uniform works enough because because the thing is, by the definition here, so the slight difference of the delta. Slight difference of the delta, for instance, remove the equal uniform variance or discretization of phi, but you see for the for the delta, for the delta, you automatically refine the depth, the delta when you have large number of, for instance, the spike solutions. So it's automatically there. So we do not need to use the non-uniform. Uniform is good enough for the five, but not for the original. But not for the original PDF, not for the little F, for the direct delta. Yeah, thank you. Thanks for explaining. Thank you. Any other questions in the chat or here? The audience? I might have a question. Maybe I missed it. I'm sorry if I did. At the very beginning, you mentioned that this model and you said there is no migration. At the very, very first slide, maybe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Next one, next one, next, next one. Yeah, back, back, back, back. Another one, back one more, one more, back. Yeah, here, you said that you consider cases when there are no migration and genetic mutation. So, for your model, this is still a case, right? Uh, yes. So, what do you have any ideas of what's going, what can happen? Of what's going on, what can happen to the model, or how things will change if you try, start including this more sophisticated things there. Ah, that is the presence of the V, of the potential. Can I go back? Yeah, sure. This one, the direction. So, can you explain it, please? I just kind of missed it. So, how will it be incorporated here? You're challenging me. Oh, no, if it's not an immediate answer, that's fine. I will be happy to talk to you later or just think about it. I just was curious. But what you need to do, what you say, is just you will need to change this term, right? Okay. Yes. It's like I know you work on the Kimo, Texas, like the Kimo, Texas. Yes, yes. Okay, okay. And okay, thank you. Okay, okay, and okay, thank you. No, it was just I was curious, I didn't really expect you to solve the problem right away if if there is no immediate answer. Thank you, thank you very much. Any other questions? Oh, yeah. There is a question online. Can you read the chat? Oh, Alicia, raise the hand. Alicia, you can unmute yourself and ask the question, maybe. Great. Okay, so thanks for the talk. It was really interesting. I was curious, so in the beginning, you had done. I was curious, so in the beginning you had done some simulations with 50 participants, let's call them, right? Oh, the okay, I see. This one. Yeah, so you had a population size of 50. I'm guessing that when the population size increases, then the time to the explorer, yes, yes. Exactly, yes, yes. So then, how does that just is that at all reflected in the analysis that you've done? Or is there ah, okay, that's now okay, you are bringing into another direction of how do we connect this problem with the stochastic differential equation. Like now you have brown, now you have, it's now you have brown emotion. Okay, it's something I've done, but I did not, it's not published yet. It not published yet. It's something I'm done. It's now a brownie motion, but now you have two absorbing boundary conditions. You are correctly right. So the stopping time or the stopping time, or we call this the generic fixation time, is now random. It's not a random variable. It's not deterministic. So if you do the simulation every time, you expect a different path. So this is just one path of the simulation. I just demonstrate to the audience. Yes, you are correct. Audience, yes, you are correct. The time is not fixed. You feel large, you feel you are 100% correct. You have a larger population size, you would see, for instance, I did something, I remember like 200 something just to entertain myself. Then you see they stay in the middle for a while and then while for a longer time and then, yeah, substantially larger time than when you have smaller population size. Yes, that's good intuition. You're correct. Yes, that's good intuition. You're correct. Okay, and so how does what you've shown here, how does that correspond with the later, more analytical part of your talk? Okay, so now we have, you started from the distribution which has two alleys, two alleles, but now eventually you see you only have one allele, the allele B, which dominates. So which means that's a, I mean, the I mean, the density would be then for B. It's a delta function, right? Yeah. So, yeah, that's the. And also, the thing is, this is a discrete model. So, it doesn't really make sense to talk about the PDF. Right, so for the PDF, can we expect that the model where you're looking at the evolution of the PDF is actually an evolution in time? Is it a time evolution that we're looking at really matching the evolution? Really matching that's a time evolution. That's a time evolution, yes. Okay, it's just the continuum, it's just the continuum version of the discrete model. I think people, there are many experts in this workshop using the so-called mean, the mean field limit. Yeah, I know, but do you know, but do you know anything about how the time evolution of the density model compares to the time evolution of Compares to the time evolution of the stochastic model? Again, I think you're talking about what I just mentioned. Now it goes to the direction of the stochastic differential. Now we have the Brownie motion that with two absorbing boundary conditions. Then that characterized the PDF of that Brown emotion characterized the PDF of the continuum model. That's that model. Model. That's that's that my uh work which I did not have presented here. Yes, okay, all right, all right, thank you. Thank you. So So, what did you say? No, should I stop sharing now? I mean, yes, please. Yeah. Oh, okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. You can hear me? I hope everybody heard me that we now have a break until 10.30 and we will read at 10.30 with talk with Marty as Annella. No? Oh, no? It's changed. Oh, I'm sorry, with the talk of Maria Caceres. Sorry, with the talk of Maria Caceres. Yeah, thanks. Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you.
