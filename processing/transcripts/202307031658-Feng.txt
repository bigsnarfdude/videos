To introduce our recent efforts to integrate the single-cell matiomic data to understand the gene regulation. And there is no doubt that we are deep in the era of single-cell motion. And for the first time, we have the ability to monitor the global gene regulation in solar individual cells in a single experiment. Furthermore, the advent of single-cell multi-omic technology has led to the Multi-omic technology has lead to the development of novel computational method that leverage genomics, transcribingomics, and chromium accessibility information to infer gene regulatory network at higher evolution. And usually after the data pre-processing, we will obtain two metrics for the gene impression and gene activity across soil and cells. So these two metrics overcome the fundamental Matrix overcomes the fundamental limitation inherent in the measurement of bulk data and allow us to discover new cell types and new cell states and trace their developmental origins. But the question still be, what is the cell type? We can trace this question back to 300 years ago, since Robert Hooke first observed the multicellular structure of planets. Multicellular structure of plant and animal under his microscope. And the biologics has aimed to catalog and classify the cells by their forms and functions. So as a result, currently the human bodies are frequently said to have about 210 different types of cells. And then in addition, the biologist also uses In addition, the biologist also used some reliable marker, reliable markers such as CD4 and CD8 that can be used to experimentally purify the cell types for the study. So this will lead to manually curate cell marker data set in a human or morph across solar and cell types. And the single cell multiplied. And the single cell martiomic advantage also represents a turning point of the cell biology, since we need to study how the high-dimensional and noise environment for the single cell can be used for the dimension reduction, for the clustering, and finally to define finally to define the cell type. For example, the human cell atlas has determined the one Has determined about 100 different immune cell types and studied their distribution across all the tissues. And the challenges we have in classifying and cataloging the various cells in the human body are even more difficult when we consider how they arrive in a developmental process. In 1957, Waddington proposed a Waddington proposed a powerful metaphor for how differentiation cell types can emerge from a single total cells. And this offers us a dynamic system view of cells, which is the molecular regulatory network can underlie the dynamic system in which the cell type is only an attractor. A tractor and attractor with certain stability. And the landscape analogy is appealing, but we are still a long way from using genomic dynamic system to describe cell steel transition or their identity in the most developmental context. However, currently, the number of cell reprogramming impairments have damaged. Have demonstrated that just a small panel of TFs and a small panel of TFs and their combination, which is from the TF module, can switch the cell type and the cell fit. So in summary, the cell type can be defined by a multi-scale viewpoint. Both the TF module, the TIF combination from the molecule level and the Molecule level and the single cell cell cluster at the cell level can contribute to define the cell type. So, the question is, if these two layers of information can be coupled and how should they be coupled. In our previous study, we inferred the regulatory network from the bulk RNC and bulk ATAC data for the MESA differentiation. And we can see from the hidden. And we can see from the heatmap of the network of visualization, we have three modules in the network. And we also profiled the single-cell ATAC and single-cell RSIC in the same cellular context, and we found they also have three-star populations. And then we found there is a significant overlapping between the network module and the differential expansion of the three sub-populations. Populations. So, this means that the regulatory module structure is consistent with the single-cell clusters. And then we further tested this coupling phenomena in another reprogramming data set, single-cell data set, which can convert the MEF to the induced neuron. Again, we found there is also almost perfect overlapping between the Perfect overlapping between the network module and the cell cluster. So, with this preliminary evidence, we next consider to coupling, consider coupling the molecule network and the single-cell cluster to better define a cell type. Here, we propose the commentary regulum, the C regulum here, and we define it as a TF commentary. TF commentary module, which is a group of TF combination, and they are binding RE and they are specifically regulating target genes. So the third region also can be regarded as a regulatory network. And the circulum is extended from the traditional idea of a regular, which only however the regulum only considers a single TF, but here we consider the TF combination. Here we consider the KF combination. We have an example in the MESC here. In MESC, SOC2, OC4, and NANOC, these three TFs have strong commentary effect and they will regulate more than 9,000 REs and more than 1,000 target genes. So after we have this concept, then we After we have this concept, then we want to use this, we use optimization model to infer this kind of theoregulum from single-cell multi-omic data. This slide is an overview, and the key step of our model is to introduce a TF commenter regulatory network, STEAM. And we will infer the TF commenter module from the STEAM matrix and The same matrix, and we expect they to explain the gene traction and gene activity to be the linear combination of TF module through the regulatory network. And then the output of our model with our model have two outputs. The first is the three regions, including the THEF modules and their associated regulatory network. And the next output is the linear common. Is the linear combination coefficient of each G cells? Then I want to explain more about our model. We have two important components here. The first is to construct a TF combinatorial matrix C from the single-cell multiomic data. Here we use the CSI index to evaluate the specificity of the relationship between TL. The relationship between TFs. Then we use this optimization to extract TF module from the TF commentator regulatory network. And the next component of our model is to make the extracted TF module while explaining the gene expression and explan the single-cell gene activity matrix. Activity matrix. So, with these two components together, we have our optimization model here. And after solving this problem, we will obtain the 3-aglons and the combination coefficient of each cell. Then we will compare our ciraglons with two sorta methods, CINIC and CRAMOA. And a chromo, and which can use this established pipeline to detect the TF module. And we construct the three code standard, three code standard TF combination database from the public data set. And the gold standard is from three-way of physical interaction. And from this figure, And from this figure, we can see that our C-veg gloom outperforms other methods in the precision recall, F1 score, and AOPR by the gold standard KL pairs from the independent data. And also in this simulation data, we show that our ceregrum can precisely characterize the cell type. We will review the core TF and that core TF combination. Core TF combination for each cell type. For example, this is the TF module for the K5C2. And we have the core TF such as get along, get a two here. And after that, we show that these TFs are specific to the cell types in many aspects here. And then we will. And then we will apply our model to the human facial atlas, including 15 organs and 45 cell types and about 5 million cells. After our application, we have our 25 C-regrounds here and here. These 25 C-regrams can represent the basical functional regulating unit of human physical development. Of human fighter development. And with the three regions, we can find, we can well define the organs because in the heat map of the annotating vector of each organ, we can see we can clearly review three gem linear classification from the silagon annotating vector. And also for the cell type, our silagon can also well define all the safety. defined all the all the 55 cell types here and for the including the including the cell type already defined in the human phytoatlus paper and the cell type that are not well defined in the in their paper we can all define them and we also we can also have the chance to reveal some novel cell states here we have an example of exceptral neural An example of exceptor neuron. When we analyze this cell type, here we show the cereaglum combination coefficient, and we found there is a group of cells associated with cerebral 25. Sergium 25 is related to the mitosis. And this is abnormal because we know that the neurons don't have cell cycle. So we guess there may be a group of early stage of cells that are not very easy to That are not very easy to distinguish with other methods. Then we use our stereogram annotation vector to filter out this group of cells. And we found this group of cells are closer to the istrosite. Then we analyze this two-cell group of e-sector neurons, and we found for the seragon annotation, the only issue the difference. Only show the difference in the serum 25, which is related to the mitosis. And then we check the macro genes present and the activity, and we found both of these two cell groups have highly and similar gene expression for the markers of excitement neuron. But they have highly differential expressive gene gene expression for the markers of neural stem cell or cell cycle. So, this means the signal of marker gene and the signal of our cerebral annotation is consistent. And this means we are studying an intermediate cell state between the neural stem cell and the mature neuron. And we can defend it. But with the ordinary method, we can't very easily detect it. To detect it. And finally, to show the behavior of surgery in a transition situation, we generate a time series dataset for the MESA differentiation. We have four time points and we apply our model to them. And then we build this third-gun transition map during this MESA differentiation process. In this map, we can observe three lineage. Three lineage here and two sub-lineage here. And in addition, in the view of TF commentator regulation, we can review how 3GON can become another 3agon at next time point, and how one 3agon can be differentiated into two 3agons at the next 10 points. We can know which TF appear and which TF disappears. Appear and which TF disappear, and how their pattern changes over time. And also, this is an ongoing work, and we will further consider the multi-scales, the quantitative time and spatial dynamic transcribing complex in our model in the future. So, finally, I want to thank our collaborators such as Duan from Collaborators, such as Stu Wen from Clamston and Professor Wee Wong from Stanford. Thank you. Objective function is a C matrix that used it to introduce the combination. Can you say a little bit more about the C matrix? Yeah, yes, the C matrix indicated the every pair of. The every pair of Tevo and their commentary effect. Thank you. Sorry, I can't hear. I might have missed this, but this regulatory score matrix, that's one of the inputs, right? Yeah, yeah. This regulatory score matrix is built from the also from the Also, from the single-cell RNAC and single-cell items data. But sorry, I don't show it in my slide. Is that based on correlations? Yeah, the correlation between TF and target genes and the banding score between the TF and REs, and we combine all the information together to define the regulatory score. So next we're going to have a discussion session. Sorry, took up so much time. I think it's just a lot, so it's good. Okay, so unlike the other discussion leaders, I wasn't given the paper to read. Yeah, so maybe we can use it to ask questions from the previous speaker or any other topics that people want to bring up. Actually, I have a question just around this slide here. Why don't we, so why not just model the R, right? Like, why do you convert R to a? Why do you convert R to C where you use C as your input? Why not just use R as the input and then have your recompression loss as R minus X times H, for example? Yeah, the R is representing the relationship between Tf and Tg, and now we want to extract the relationship between Tf and Tf. So we need to convert the R to the matrix C to get this information. But then you can derive the lens there. Thank you. Sorry, I don't know here. I mean, you can derive that later, right? With the C is derived from the R. Yeah. Okay, I'll think about C is different from R transpose R, that R is a transcription factor and type of gene network, and C is a combination of different transcription factors, and those are the combination of. And those are the combinational index. I think it's talked about paper from the party 10 years ago. But it's from C to R. I think it's a very complex problem in this case. Now she's formulating in a way that is seem like C is direct from R. It's direct from R, but it's like there's a process between them. It's a method of doing that. It's not like a direct. Doing that. It's not like a direct R transport R type six. It's error step and extracting the signal from R to see which two transaction factors really cooperating together to rapidly target. So there are many difficulties. Close that paper, also? I have a question. Since everyone here seems to be working on, a lot of people are working on gene regulatory networks and Working on gene regular networks, and we all know it's a pretty hard problem. And even looking at the presentation just now, I can see that the precision recall, the absolute value of those numbers are pretty low. Now you've inserted the combinatory facts. So what's the next step to try to get even higher percent of people? Maybe more beer. Maybe more data better or more different data type. Maybe better. This time, only based planning expression is very hard. After adding the text she, the laboratory, huge improvement. I don't know what the third data we added here. Maybe high C or maybe different historical history. I don't know what I was thinking about that. My question about this model is: What is the specific consideration for single-cell data compared to using bulk data for doing this regular discovery? Yeah, the single-cell, our point is to coupling the net. Coupling the network information with the cell type information. So, if we use the bulk data, we only have the network, we can't access the cell type cell cluster. Yeah, I understand. I'm just saying that modeling-wise, are there any specific changes made to accommodate single cell data? Sorry, my headphone, I can't see the clear. my headphone account say the clear oh okay sorry um um maybe i'll say louder so my question is um what specific aspects of your model are for single cell data or single cell data characteristics you mean why we use single cell data Why we use single cell data? No, I understand why you use single cell data. I just want to ask: if I use, for example, if I use the cell type from single cell data versus I use the bulk RNA-seq of that cell type, can I use the same model? If you use the single cell of a cell type. Of a cell type. A group of cells of this cell type. And the other is a bulk data of this cell type. That's right. You mean that? Yeah, okay. I think our model is to find more final structure of the regulatory network. So if we already have this I have this cell type. And we can just get the first two terms okay. We don't need the second and fourth term. Thank you. Is there a preprint to this work? Sorry, we don't post a it.
