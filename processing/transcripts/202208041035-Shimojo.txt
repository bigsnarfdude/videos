Hi everyone, my name is Masahiko Shimojo. First I'd like to express my thanks to all the organizers, Shikoshimatano, for giving me a chance to talk in this workshop. Ah, okay. Uh since my t uh this today the uh titling with the screen, so let me start from the standard Fisher KPP equation. This is the KPP equation which is scatter type. Then this reaction term is called a monostable synonym. Since any starting from any positive initial data, the solution converges to capital K, but it equals to infinity. So 0 is unstable and capital K is stable. So this nonlinearity is called monostable. In the setting of spreading this program, the standard example initial data is non-negative. Initial data, the Initial data, that has a compact support, that is compactly supported. And as time evolves, the solution wants to become capital K as t equals to infinity, since capital K is stable and 0 is unstable. Hence the front between 0 and capital K moves out. And the speed of the front is analogous. Is analyzed by Aronson Weinberger, and there is this C star that determined from this formula that if absolute value x is bigger than Ct, you converge to zero. And if C is less than C star, L is in a hole in interior, inside of the interior hole, the solution converges to capital K as t equals to infinity. And first, let me explain how to obtain capital C star by formal calculation. Now the solution, the shape of the solution is like this and in near the zero point of U, when u U is very close to zero, uh we obtain this type of linear linearized equation. Linearize the equation. I consider only one-dimensional case. Then, by substituting u is this exponential functional to this linearized equation, we obtain this equality. And solving this equality for C, we obtain this form, and by calculating the minimum value of the The minimum value of the right hand side, we obtain C star as a minimum value. Times square d d sub u times R sub u. The problem, a central problem I'd like to explain is the following SIR model. SIR is three component system and there is some saturation effect here. So alpha mu beta is positive constant and since R is component and consider only two systems and it by a simple calculation if beta is less than mu plus sigma one zero is stable at a zero and on the other hand beta is bigger than mu plus sigma. hand beta is bigger than mu plus sigma 1 0 is an unstable equilibrium and also there is globally stable equilibrium this is star pi star today I only focus on beta as a second case beta is bigger than nu plus sigma and this global stability can be proved by using this Ryapunov function this is a Ryapunov function of this Reference function of this ODE system. And now we add the diffusion term to this equation. For simplicity, first I consider this initial data. Let S is equivalent to 1i and I is compactly supported. From the uh information of the scalar case, uh the solution is compactly supported in is compactly supported in scalar type means as a solution converged to unstable equilibrium at space infinity. So this condition is natural to natural setting to consider the spreading. And the image of the time evolution is the following. S and I converge to one zero to space infinity from the initial data. So by uh this this is explained This is explained by our deployed scope yesterday. To linearize this definition, we substitute s equal to 1 and i is very close to 0. So the corresponding linear equation for i component is this one. s is equal to 1 and i satisfies this approximate linear equation. And by doing the same process as the spara KPP case, we obtain the VP case, we obtain the spreading speed of this equation must be 2 times this one, di times beta minus mu sigma squared. This is the image of the spreading solution. So precise and precise statement of the theorem is the following. Let S is lower bound, I is bounded. up lower bound, i is bounded from above by some constant. And if g is bigger than c star, s i converges to one zero outside of the stable. And if less g is less than c star, s i converges to the stable equilibrium, s star i star inside of the interiable observed but value x is less than c t. And the proof of the statement one is reduced to scalar Fisher KPP equation. So, and it is widely known. So, let me focus on the second statement in my today's talk. In order to prove the second statement, we approach Professor Tukuro and Giletti, and Professor Matanov, who is one of the organizers, they proposed one way to prove this type of budget of the final zone systematically. First, we need to obtain We need to obtain, we can obtain this inequality from a lower bound. When she is less than she star, we have to have several lower bounds like this. And we prove a contradiction argument. There is this XKT case such that satisfying this inequality and cannot converge to S star I star. Then by taking defining this kind of a function, S star is a function of function. this kind of a function, Si X plus D, T plus T K. And this kind of this functional function by taking the sub-sequences converges to s omega i omega xt. And this limiting function, the time t can move for all real time. And this is uh this uh uh omega limiting function was explained in the Rossi's talk in the first day and the uh As A and that is the same object. And if we can prove the following theorem, that means positive bounded entire solution which has strong bound is star I star. If we assume this by taking a limit in this inequality, we obtain the contradiction. So in order to prove the convergence of the final zone, we need to prove this type of unit type zone. And the real type theorem is proved in very general setting. Let F B m component vector field and the corresponding OD has only one positive equilibrium, U star, and consider the entire solution of the reaction diffusion system. And the statement is entire solution satisfying the following condition is this one. And that condition is the idea. And that condition is there exists more C i and capital G i such that it's con constant and the u entire solution is sum each pi 2 constant and there is this function, this is a Revano function satisfying the following mean equality. Then entire solution comes to use term and the proof is very simple. We calculate the time derivative of the weighted The time derivative of the weighted Jagannath function R, then by a simple calculation, integration by part, we obtain this equality. And choose a weight function something like this. Then this weight function satisfies the following inequality and substituting this inequality and this equation, we obtain this kind type of inequality. By substituting that part here, by substituting red part here and the blue it here. Then by taking R sufficiently large we can obtain this type of inequality and since f is a convex from the assumption we prove that this is less than this part, this term. And if we integrate this weighted energy function from minus infinity to d by integrating this differential inequality Differential inequality, we can prove that y is equivalent to 0, which means FU is equivalent to 0 and that implies U is used of the point. And this theorem is a generalization of these two tables. We don't need any assumption to talk. And this type of UV type COM is applied to many applied to many problems. One example, not only a SIR model, a pre-predata model, or predata prepared system, predata, predator prediction, three component system. And recently was shifting environment of competitive system is used. And today I'd like to explain the generalization of Explain the generalization of this local diffusion due type theorem to the non-local diffusion equation. Today, in the afternoon session, Professor John Shinbo, with my co-worker, will talk about the fractional diffusions. And my talk is a fractional diffusion case as Dr. Y Hong Du explained in his lecture as a In this lecture, the integral cardiac decay is algebraically fast. And in my talk, I explain the exponentially decay much faster decay, integral cardiac case. This is a plus equals hundred. Uh let me explain what is uh non-local diffusion again. Uh let j be an even symmetric function and uh which is probability probability density so the integral is equal to one and there exists lambda bar such that j lambda e lambda y e y is finite for any lambda distance. is finite for any lambda this one lambda bar and if lambda approaches lambda bar this integral diverges this is the can of our probe fusion kan of our probe and for non uh for non-local official kbp sphera equation is uh uh researched uh by many uh researchers and spreading behavior is for an example jing and tau And how analysis spreading behavior of KPP equation. Here, non-local diffusion is the convolution of the J star F minus F. This is the diffusion time. And our problem is the following. If we change the local diffusion, We change the local diffusion to the non-local one and the same reaction time. And we consider this only this case. And the initial data is the same point, satisfy the same condition. And the statement is completely parallel to the local division. Outside of the exterior board, the solution converges to one zero and stable equilibrium. And inside of the uh interiable, that is called. In variable that is called final term, the solution converges to S star, I star, when C is less than C star, and the absolute value X is less than C T. The difference is here. C star is given by this. C star is the minimum value of this function of lambda. Other other other other things is completely the same to local diffusion. So And uh since calculate the uh we again focus on the proof of uh second step maybe uh this one is uh explained by other lecturer, but let me explain uh why this is star here uh again in my lecture. Uh according to the linearized scheme uh we substitute s equals 1 and forget about equal 1 and forget about this term, then we obtain the approximate linear equation. And we formally substitute this exponential function. Then by a simple calculation we obtain this requirement. Then we divided each both hand side by e lambda x minus g t we obtain this equality for lambda and g. And C and divide it by lambda and taking minima. This is the same idea as local diffusion test. Then we obtain for formal, we can obtain the spreading speed. And for the proof, the proof is the outline of the proof is the The outline of the proof is the same. Technically, it's more involved. The only difference is technique, the scheme is the same. Only difference, I will explain the difference of the solution. To get the persistence, I mean this inequality, we apply the method of Duke Row and grow in pump of this paper and anyway we can prove this. We can prove that this inequality. and prove the this inequality. And doing the same scheme, the problem of the convergence of the final zone will reduce to is reduced to the new digital type theorem or non-local diffusion problem. And our new digital type theorem is the following. This is again almost the same as the previous slide, so let me explain where it changed. The changing point is here. point is here, local diffusion not is non-local diffusion here, and F is relatively entropy from equilibrium state. This is the difference from the previous statement. Uh since this restriction uh it may be a little str looks strong, but many ma problems in mathematical biology In mathematical biology, the equation has entropy type gap functional, so this is assumption. The restriction of the assumption is not so inconvenient to analyze real concrete problems. Anyway, we prove this. Then we can prove the convergence of the final sound by applying the same scheme as the local diffusion case. The local diffusion case. And let me explain only the difference of the flow from the local diffusion case. In fact, we cannot apply the integration by part, so instead of integration by part, we uh use Fubinius theorem and changing space variable X and Y uh technically. And after a little long calculation, And after a little long calculation, we can get the same type of inequality. Uh and the the calculation is uh uh exactly the same for uh with the uh what's the correctional diffusion case, but only the difference for fractional diffusion is we need to choose a nice way to do function flow. The difference is only here for fractional diffusion and exponential solution, and our choice of Solution. And our choice of weighted function here, only here I use one dimension. But anyway, this function is of one. Then this function satisfies La Parasian law, a non-local La Paracian equation law, and we can substitute here. And we obtain this inequality. And integrating this inequality from minus infinity to t we can conclude that greater. we can conclude that weighted energy is equal to terror and uh u is equal to u star and we can prove that the diagram is exact. This is the end of my talks. Thank you for your attention. Any questions? So can you show back the slide in the first part of your talk where you do the viewing of the So the only way of the first part with the diffusion when you have the reaction diffusion system, assuming that the reaction part is a Dyapuno function, whether the Whether the diffusion equation has a Lyapunov function at this point. So your theorem is an example of that. You have a Lyapunov function for the reaction, ODV. It indicates that there is a Lyapunov function for the reaction diffusion system. Oh, yes. It's an example. So my question is question is how optimal is this? You have some very general condition which gives you this implication. The existence of a Lyapunov functional for the reaction, ODE, implies the existence of the Lyapunov functional for the reaction diffusion system. Ah so uh your question is uh uh when we far uh thank you. Some people contribute. If if we find the ODE Japan functional, then can we get a juvenile functional reaction? And some succession conditions for that. Some optimal conditions. For bounded domain with nominal boundary condition, if we integrate all the Japan functions. only Japan function on space and that becomes uh Japan functional of PD reaction diffusion system. But uh under here for no unbounded domain we need weight to add weight like proof the proof. But also you need some condition on the non-linearity. Ah, this condition is look you need this this control H2? This control H2. So it's not the general theorem in the sense that the existence of the Lyapunov function for the reaction system has the existence for the reaction. You have some restriction. This this Rapinov function must satisfy uh uh this this condition. So uh any Rapinov function uh may not be applied. Have you thought about this question in general? While away from zero, I don't have anything to help you to make the PDE behind the make the PD behavior more like a LD Oh in order to apply the any we need to check with the condition without javana function quite easy the second and last page is about a year later Later, later. R is a big one. Now, for this minor quality, you have to assume the kernel function j decays very fastly, or it applies to more general kernels? For these to hold, do you need some assumptions on J? So if J does not decay very fast, this is still true. Yeah, this argument must be very large, so uh it's uh decay a little slow. Uh in order to make this weighted function uh this uh weighted functionality in Ready to functionalize in uh very defined, we need the decay rate. And uh this is the yeah. And I think this choice of weight is a function uh may have some relation with the decay of fundamental solution. If the it goes through a decay some fundamental solution that uh works for example for fractional diffusion. Fractional diffusion. Fractional diffusion must be algebraic. Also, derived some models for finish, and then we'll have more questions more discusses. Okay, let's uh thank you for the question. Thank you.
