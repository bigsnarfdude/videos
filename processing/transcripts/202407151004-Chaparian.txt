Okay, thanks so much Ian for the introduction and thanks for the organizers for putting this nice meeting together. So I'm going to talk about yield stress fluids in Porosmedia and they're going to be a hot topic I think in the meeting. Many of colleagues are going to talk about this OT Going to talk about this, Ruti, Claudio, Lauren, and others. So my talk will be mostly theoretical, but definitely this kind of problem has a lot of applications in industry, like pole recovery and cement routing of rock fractures, in which the lengths of the In which the length of scale is like meter or centimeter. And also in biomedical applications, like injection of gold cement into fractured vertebrae, where the length of scale is like millimeter or even less. So when this problem comes to Newtonian fluid, all of us know how to handle that. How to handle that. So, from PowerScale, we can integrate the equations and get the properties in the macro scale using the and basically drive the Darshan's law, which is saying that the flow rate linearly is related with the applied pressure gradient, with the permeability and viscosity of the fluid. Of the fluid. But for yield-stressed fluid, the things are different. So, first of all, we have threshold for the stress. So, the fluid is static or is not moving basically when the stress is less than yield stress. And then the behavior is non-linear, even for like simple policy. Like simple Poissy flow, if you look at the flow rate pressure gradients curve, so for Neotomian the equation is linear, right? But for yield stress fluid, you have a critical pressure gradient. So if the applied pressure gradient is less than that, the fluid is not moving, and after that, the equation is non-linear for. Is non-linear for yielder stress fluid, and even if you use like a symptotic approximation, so definitely when you go to higher pressure gradient, there will be a large error in the predictions. The second thing is that here the flow is heterogeneous for Yield stress fluid. And to describe that, And to describe that, so assume that we have the applied pressure gradient on this axis. So, this is the critical pressure gradient below which the flow rate is zero. When you exceed this critical pressure gradient, so the flow will start, right? But it's highly localized in a channel or so, and everywhere else the flow. And everywhere else, the flowing is static in these black regions. When you increase the pressure gradient, next the next channel is going to show up. And if you go to a very large applied pressure gradient compared to the critical pressure gradient, so nearly everywhere the fluid will be gilded. So as you see, we have different regimes in this process. Different regimes in this problem from highly localized, from not moving, highly localized, and nearly gilded domain. So what I want to do in this talk is that I want to address this critical pressure gradient and then sort of the Niotomian limit, and somehow combine. Somehow, combine these to get Darcy L, which is working for the whole range of applied pressure gradients. Okay, so I will address the yield plastic limit first and then the Niotonian limit and going to combine it. So I'm using numerical method. I'm solving Stokes equation, nothing surprising here. X and Y are the coordinate system. Why are the coordinate assisted to scale that? I'm going to use the obstacle length scale. And the Poros media is going to made with the solid obstacles. I'm going to describe it later. The velocity components mean velocity at the inlet. At the inlet, so the flow is from left to right, and pressure and stress tensor with the characteristic response S stress. Okay, so I'm going to use Binkham model to describe the yield stress fluid rheologically. So B is the non-dimensional number, is the Binkham number, which is showing the ratio of the yield stress to the viscosist stress. And phi is showing the solid volume fraction, and so 1 minus Ï† is the process. Okay, so in terms of topologies, I'm going to look at prosmedia made with square obstacles and also circular obstacles and bi-disperse cases. So these are normally dispersed. I'm looking at bi-disperse cases as well. Well, and I'm using boronoid oscillation of these circular cases to get a wide variety of obstacle shapes and also again the biomedical, sorry, the biodisperse case as well. Okay, so as I said, I'm going to scale the velocity vector with the mean velocity at the inlet. So the flow rate. So, the flow rate will be always like L of the inlet, which is not obstructed by the obstacles. And so, basically, the Q is always constant in this setting. So, I'm going to change the BINCAM number and we'll read the different pressure gradient in the sub quotients. So, just to highlight that, I'm using other. So, just to highlight, I'm using a went and Lagrangian method, finite element to discretize the equations. I'm using an isotropic adaptiveness in the forest scale. Okay, so pretty much adopted, let's say. And free femme for which is an open source code basically to implement all these. To implement all this stuff. Okay, so with the Bingham number, so if I want to address the yield plastic limit, I need to go to the very high Bingham number, which is basically showing the high yield stress compared to the characteristic misconceptors. And for the Niotonian limit, B0 will recover a B2. Recover a V to zero will recover the neotomic limit. Okay, so let's start with the yield limit. So here you see sample computations for the six geometries that I explained. So pincant 1000 in all of these six simulations, solid volume fraction is 45%. So you see that the flow is pretty localized at this pincer 1000 for. Income 1000, for example, for this geometry. For the others, you can still see the dominant channel, but you have other open channels as well, because BINCAM 1000 is maybe not big enough for the other geometries. So I want to derive Want to derive a model for the yield limit, and so for this aim, I'm going to look at the energy equation. So the first term is the viscose dissipation, and the second term is the plastic dissipation. So it's saying that basically the whole dissipation in the domain will be equal to the work done by the applied pressure. The applied pressure gradient times the flux. So, in the yield limit, plastic dissipation is the dominant term, and the reason is that here it's quadratic in terms of gamma dot, and gamma dot is going to zero, right, for the yield limit, and also being goes to infinity. So, this term dominates. So, I can rearrange the Rearrange this equation to get the critical pressure gradient, sort of non-dimensional pressure gradient, and that's equal to flux over the plastic dissipation function. So, to get the scaling for flux and also this integral of Camadot, I'm going to use Poisey-flow analogy. Analogy: although this channel is not straight and the height is changing, but so in the leading order, so there is no dissipation basically in the core on yielded region, right? The dissipation is happening in these two sheared regions. So, in the leading order, I'm going to use the linear profile so. So Gabben dot will be UCH, which is the velocity in the channel, or if you reach the core unguilded region, times the lengths of the channel. Since the shear regions are like delta, which is smaller than the lengths of the channel. Okay, so this is the scaling for gamma dot. So let's look at the flux. So flux is like the length of the domain times the flow rate. And the flow rate in this scale was equal to the length of the inlet. So I can write it instead of this, like u, which is the velocity in the channel, times the height. Okay, so this is. So, this is the height of the channel, which is changing definitely, and this is the length of the channel. Okay, so let's put back these scalings in the equation. So, it's saying that the critical pressure gradient will be equal to the h of the channel over the non-well, the length of the channel over the length of the domain. Lengths of the domain, and we know this as tortuosity in purse media, right? So if I find the average height of the first channel and average length of the first channel, so I'm gonna find the critical pressure gradient. So to find these scalings, we rather implemented a different model. A different model. So you are using poor network model to get statistical data. So here is the porous media. You can convert it to network of small channels connecting the pores. And we use maximum ball algorithm to convert the porous media to the network. And here you see the results. You see the results. So, this is the first channel, these are the DNS data. So, you see that the first channel is pretty much the same in both. And we validated the critical pressure gradient in both as well, so there is a good match. So, with this method, which is just like a couple of minutes, you can get a lot of You can get a lot of data, a lot of simulations, but for this with the adaptive mesh in the core scale, so it's like a couple of days each simulation. So you can get like many simulations with this method and get the statistical height and lengths of the channel. So here we go. So the scale of the height is Height is basically the height scales with probosity and the tortuosity scales with solid volume fraction. So if you want to look at the basically physical meaning of this, so when you want to find the age, if you are dealing with a condensed system like this, so system like this so you see that the the heights of the channel basically the fluid path is squeezed between the obstacles right so it will be less in this system for example rather than a dilute system so that's um that's the scaling for the age and for the length of the channel here you see that it's pretty much a zigzag shaped channel but here you have a rather direct Rather direct direct channel, so the length will increase in such a system. So, if I put back these scalings here, so it will give me the critical pressure gradient scales with the void space over the obstructed space. So, it means that the critical pressure gradient Scale is just geometrical. So if you scan your first value, if you get the void space or the obstructed space, you can easily find the critical pressure gradient or at least the scaling rather than doing the expensive computations. Okay, so let's look at this scaling, how it works. This is scaling how it works. So, this is the orange line here, okay? And these are the core network simulations. So you see that it predicts it very well, not surprising because we extracted the scale from the poor network model. And here are the TNS simulations with these six geometries. So you see that. Six geometries, so you see that these are sitting on this scaling as well. So there is a recent paper by Pedro who basically derived an upper bound from a different perspective, let's say, a homogenization method. And it's interesting that this is. That this is linear with this scaling as well, but definitely with a different pre-factor because that's an alphabet. Okay, so let's, so we addressed the yield limit. Now let's look at the neotomian limit and then try to combine this. So for the 2D flows in neotomian Newtonian 2D flows. We have a lot of models describing the flow, but for these kind of nice arrangements of the obstacles, the very nice model, which is based on Fourier-Series solution, which is describing the force on each cylinder as a drag coefficient for the Coefficient for the drag force for a cylinder in Scots flow. So here we have a randomized case, right? So you need perhaps to rearrange things. So the pressure gradient will be a function like this. And here, for example, for the 0.2, I think the solid volume fraction. Solid volume fraction and 0.5, you see the two samples of the computation. So we can extract applied pressure gradient in this kind of simulation and feed this function and get the A and B and C and other factors. Okay? So here is the statistical data. I think more than twenty or 20 or if I can remember simulations. So, for a square arrangement, so when the solid volume fraction is low, so you don't have much uncertainty in the results, right? But when you go to higher solid modeling fraction, definitely you have larger uncertainty. So these are the average, the symbols showing the average. The symbols showing the average. So you can feed this kind of model into the DNS data. But just before that, so here is the upper bound with the triangular shape of the arranged obstacle, square obstacle, and this is the square arrangement. So you see the lower bound and upper bound for the DN statement. Okay? So if So if I feed this kind of model on the numerical data, so I can extract A and B and C, and so this is going to be my Niltonian limit describing the pressure gradient in the Binkam zero limit. Okay, so I have a model for the yield limit, I have a model for the Newtonian limit. Now let's combine. Limit. Now let's combine these two to see if I can get a Darcy type now that is working for the whole range of B. So definitely there could be like different options for combining these two models together. Here I'm using just linear combination, and that's simple, right? So when Bin can go to infinity, these income goes to infinity, these term dominates, which is the universal scale for the yield limit that we drive. If pincerm goes to zero, this term dominates. So we are looking at the Niltonian limit and this term dominates which is describing the Niltonian pressure gradient. Okay, so this oxytar block can be plotted as a function Can be plotted as a function of wing gamma, right? Solid volume fraction, and nothing surprising. So when we go to large Wingham, so definitely the pressure gradient will increase. If you go to high solid volume fraction, that will increase as well. Okay, so let's look if we can validate this model with DNS data. DNS data. So here you see point one, and this is the propels now, right? And this is the best fit that you can get, just forgetting about all the model that we drive, just the best fit on the numerical data. So you see that they are very close. For 0.3, that's even better. Um that's even better for 0.5 um same story and for 0.55. Okay, so the symbols are the DNS data and the pro and the curve is the solid curve, is basically the Darcy type model that we just draw. Okay, so let's wrap up. So Wrap up. So, I introduced a framework for looking at somehow driving a Darcy type now for yieldless risk fluids. So, I drive the universal scale for the yield limit of the problem and adopted the 2D flow model from the previous Newtonian investigation, basically. So, I combine these two linearly. Linearly to get Darcy type Lyle, and we have validated this with the DNS data. Though for the square arrangement or a square obstacle, only these term, this is universal, right? We validated with different geometries, but this one just for the square. Just for the square obstacles. So if you go to a more complex rheology, like Herschel-Bockley, for example, so definitely we will have N in this, we should have N, which is a shear thinning index in this kind of model. Different topologies, so as I said, these terms will be again the same. These terms will be again the same, no matter which trilogy, as long as you are working with simple gilded stress flows, ignoring elasticity and these kind of things. So you will get again the same term, but for different topologies you need the data, right? For example, for circular case, you can get the data feed these. The data feed this kind of model on the data, get the A and B, C, and combine these again. So you see that for the circular case, for example, when the solid volume fraction is low, so the square and circular obstacles are the same, we will get the same data. But when you are working on a dense system, then from the system then from the circular case to the square case there is a difference and it's not surprising because the the interaction of different obstacles the not the hydrodynamic interaction I mean the flow interaction of different obstacles are are sort of doing something when the flow is when the when the system is dense okay so thank you so much Uh so thank you so much uh for for your attention and and happy to continue. I just have a question regarding the ingility of the forest video, if you have a high confidence. Yeah, so so the cases that we uh we we did, uh we just randomly distributed the the obstacles. At the obstacles. So we don't impose the position of the obstacles. So these kind of data is sort of independent of what you are saying. But definitely when you have like this kind of system which is not dense, you can get like different. Well, you can get like different arrangements, right? The obstacles can be collect k um can be can be here, for example, in the system. So so basically you have more in this kind of uncertainty, you may get some uncertainty, I should say. I guess more generally, if you're dealing with poor media, typically you've got Dealing with porous medium, typically if you've got a porous medium, you might know some empirical measurement of permeability. I think more likely to know that than some detailed measurement of comparisons. So, typically, your Newtonian limit, you have Darcy's law with a permeability function in it. Do you expect, in such a scenario, that the, I mean, I guess, can you generalise this to that scenario? And do you expect in that scenario that nevertheless the plastic limit still is given by your file or mouse file rather than some function more generally? Rather than some function more generally, well we we did our best to sort of validate the universal scale, right? With different kind of geometries and these kind of things. Well, at least it seems that in 2D it works. I mean, for 5D spares cases, mono dispersed. Maybe, I don't know, if you go to much more complex systems like I don't know. Well, Well, like overlapping, you know, obstacles and these kind of things may break. I don't know. But for 3D, definitely we need to think about. So building off the first question, you showed that at the yield limit, you get this really stark preferential path at once. Presumably, that's due to just include this little geometry, and that's what's preferred. But what happens if you Right. But what happens if we have like ordered system? Do you still get such start channeling? Well, well, you will. So if you have if you have these kind of this so basically you will get multiple channels in the critical limit, right? But the thing is that the flow rate is divided in like three, four channels, and again the scaling will be. And again, the scaling will be the same, right? So the height and the length that I drive from the four network model is still valid, but definitely it's not just one single channel because, as you said, it's very well arranged. You will get multiple channels, but with less flow rate. Great, great talking. Very, very excellent. So So there's no surprise that for the plastic model, for the B-Com model, everything works and you have any Attonian lineage. But I'm very a little surprised that how good the comparison is at intermediate B-com model.
