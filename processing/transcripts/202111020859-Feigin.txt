  Yes, I'm here. And can you see my screen? Yes, we can see your screen. So, okay. And so it means that I can start. Yes? Yes. Thank you very much for willing to give a talk, and we're very excited. So your talk is on vertex algebras with big centers, logarithmic theories, and bundles over vector or vertex algebras. So please. Yes, yes. Okay. So say. Okay, so thank you for the invitation and what I want to talk. Maybe I want to concentrate about main things which are important for me about such kind of logarithmic series and related vertex separator algebra. And also I formulate some problems. Formulate some problems which I think has to be think about. Well, and I one thing before that on this conference, many people with whom I talked a lot, and it's Tomaskrocig and Tamayuki and other people who, and also Gaiota, who are working in some things about this subject. This subject and also part of this story is discussing. I discuss a lot with Sirozha Gukov and Kole Rishitihian, and we are working about application of such kind of series to different things, topology of walls and things like that. Therefore, let me start. No, first of all, about terminology. All about terminology. Logarithmic theory, it is usually people talking about this. There are some vertex operator algebra or conformal field series where we have logarithm in operator product and so on. And other, maybe conceptually more important story. Important story elements are algebras with big centers, which explain what I mean, and algebra equipped by continuous symmetries. And I think what is really people need is something like this, or something like this. First of all, algebra is the big center. Usually, this big Usually, this big center is an object like abelian vertex separator algebra. Abelian vertex separator algebra, I will use this, but it is not maybe good terminology anyway. The main example of this, it is just abelian algebra, so it means it is also in algebra with big center, but center is just all algebra. Anyway, if we take If we take a vertex separator algebra related with some g hat, then if parameter k go to infinity, this is what is calling the quasi-classical limit. And in a limit, if you do it properly, the corresponding algebra become Algebra becomes community. And it will be a vertex-separated algebra if in some wide sense. It means Virasora survive or not, it depends. But at least the object become the functions on a connection D plus A. And such connections are A connection related with G. With G and such kind of connection is living on a small punctured disk. Yes, and just operators from vertex operator algebra are differential polynomials in A. Yes, and similar story is going on if we take, for example, Virasora algebra, where central church is going to infinity. In this case, In this case, we recover the functions on or people calling this projected connection. It is basically, I better to say, d square plus q, dz square. It is like this. Yes. Or we can talk about different vertex separator algebra depending on parameter. It can be C, for example, if I take W. See, for example, if I take wn, that it goes on to the functions on the object like this. And or this is a function of what people are calling operas. Yes, and more interesting, no, interest. No, well, if you take a conformal vertex-separator algebra, you even can consider. Even can consider something like conformal blocks, but they all will be abelian. Maybe I say something about this later. But a standard example of algebraic center is situation, what is calling situation on the critical level. It means that if we have, again, you know. Have again a universal enveloping of G hat, but we consider this on a critical level, which is minus dual construct Coxter numbers, then this algebra has a big center. Center a function on something which is calling oper for the dual Langeland group. Lenz group. Yes, well, I want to say that examples of algebra with big center, we can construct it using the Cassiat type construction when some parameters go to infinity and so. So it also gives us some interesting examples. Yes, and then maybe let me say a few words how the algebras with big centers are using. Consider the examples SL2 head, where parameter T is equal to minus two. Then center itself. Center itself is function as I said on such things. And no, here, just we are living on a punctured disk, and Q is Laurent series, or better to say Laurent quadratic differentials. And inside the universal enveloping, it is standard things. We have just operator LI, which are just Sugarwar operators. Which are just Sugarwara operators, but in this special value of level. Then, and so we have such kind, so if we fix a number kappa i, and because it is center, we can factorize it by this way, using, so we take the value of central character. Value of central character. As a result, we get some algebra because we factorize by the ideal. And these algebra labeled by some quadratic differential. No, not quadratic differential, but oper. And this oper is a projective connection and so on. So what kind of structure we have here? Have here so we can fix this order here, and because we have this, we can construct some kind of algebra. No, it is not precisely the vertex separator algebra, but this object is not far, it is just algebra, and this algebra has some categories. This algebra has some category of representation. Yes, and this category of representation, and in this case, and in general also, so the category of representation which we get depends surely on what order we take and the corresponding and the corresponding category is naturally isomorphic if we make change of variables and for example if this opera is regular so if q is regular then a corresponding category no show it's does not depend on what occur with regular singularity we take We take, and this category is actually very close to the center block for the baby quantum group. So this, I think, this fact is maybe Serum now and Tamayuke probably knows better. Is it proved or not? I mean, in general. But anyway, But anyway, the situation is like this. Now I want to talk about the following. Well, no, because we have such kind of structure and no, no, here it is written, I discuss it a little bit later, but the interesting story is that if we consider the author with singularity, With singularity, and this singularity can be regular, or this singularity can be wild, but still, in principle, we can correspond to some algebra and category of representation of this algebra. And one of important point in all this part of science, try to describe this category. To describe this category of representation and more precisely as it possible. Anyway, a structure which we have is following. If we have a conformal field theory, usually we can put a representation in a point. Presentation in a point on a curve, maybe to CP1, like it is written here. Yes. And so, and in our case, representation depending on a value of central character, so it means that we have to choose three orders. No, I'm talking only in SL2 case. I'm talking only in SL2 case. In general, it is more or less the same. Anyway, in this puncture disk, we need to fix this. This is D square always. Plus Q, something here, something here, something here. And the question is what The question is: What is the correlator? What is conformal block? And can we make play to the standard gay? And the answer is surely known. And first of all, we need that this element of central characters here, here, and here can talk with each other. talk with each other. At talk, it means the following: that we have order, T square plus Q, which is living on my curve, on CP1 in this case, which is regular outside these three points. And if we expand this opera here, here and here, then as a result, In this case, no, the questions surely, answer surely depends what representation of the corresponding category we choose. But at least in this case, it can be some vector space, which we can call a conformal block. It can be finite dimensional or not, it depends, but at least it But at least it is some kind of correlation functions. So it means that it is map from the tensor product of this three to this dimensional space, which satisfy the property which is familiar and on for correlation functions. So the situation is that in this Is that in this for such kind of algebra, we have notion of a correlation function in presence of some structure on the curve. And this structure on the curve, it can be either oper like this, or oper for more generic things, or what we expect. What we expect and want, just connection B plus E. And this is structure which does not appear in this example. I mean a critical level. But in principle, it is important that they are some vertex separator algebra where such kind of center function on this. Center function on this actually appear. And now I wanted to say, I wrote here that actually on the curve, it is some this. If you want to understand it as a geometric structure, it is some maps from locally, there's some maps from this. Locally, there's a map from disk to flag manifold with some property, or in Jalen case, it is mapped from the small, no, locally it is mapped from the disk to CPN, so to projective space. So no, some kind of question. Some kind of question: What kind of structure on a curve can appear? Or so now let me discuss this equation by the following way. Well, no, first of all, again, as I said, that if we I said that if we have a structure of such sort, it means that we have some center. Center is a function on something, and we have a family of algebras labeled by the point of this spectrum of a center, and the operator product or some kind of things is related with this property of this monadro. Property of this manadro of this. No, I explained what kind of such things. No, because this is a construction like this. So it means what? That if I have R1 and R2, which are sitting here, what appear here, this is some counterpart of operator product. Part of operator product. And such kind of story saying us in what case and what we can central a character we can choose such that operator product exists. Yes. And anyway, algebra with big center, this can be This can be understood as a sheaf of vertex operator algebra. Actually, it is a coherent sheaf of maybe not vertex operator algebra precisely. It is not like that, but in some sense. Anyway, we have some collection of algebras labeled by some manifold or coherent sheaf of vertex operator algebra. Of vertex separator algebra with some ways. And algebra appear by this, no, can be described by this way. And what kind of idea and for that let be is some. Is some algebra, maybe it is vertex separator algebra, and group H acting on B by symmetries. Suppose also that group G is bigger group and we have map or maybe in the simplest case is embedding of this group H to G and G over H. And G over H is corresponding homogeneous space. If we have such kind of structure, then we can make the construct something like induced algebra. Anyway, if we have something, some object where H is acting, then as a result by As a result, by more or less standard way from beginning of topology, that we can construct the bundle over this space, homogeneous space, and each fiber is there our isomorphic to our algebra. B where fixed point Fixed point group on this homogeneous space is acting. And then, no, by the way, and by this way construction, we get a family of vertex operator algebra or bundle of vector operator algebra living over the. No, such kind of construction looks rather stupid. Looks rather stupid or maybe too simple. But not all, but many examples which we know of logarithmic or triplet like algebra appear by this way. Let us look to this example. That gamma is one-dimensional letters. This guy. This guy is lattice vertex separator algebra. What does it mean? It means that it means that in this algebra we have two generators like this and like this. And parameter p is some integer. It's more convenient if this integer is even, but in principle. integer is even but in principle not necessary and operator pro no these are generators are corresponding to generators of these letters operator products are looking like this this this and this and uh no if you describe a vertex lettuce vertex separated algebra you can Vertex separator algebra, you can understand this as describing in terms of generators and relations. Well, now here we have inside this algebra, we have this Heisenberg, and we have this standard commutation relation, and we have A plus Z S. Plus Z as generators. Well, and if our P is bigger than zero, then just this current give us Lie algebra. No, because this is Lie algebra, A plus Z. In this case, it is commutative current. A A H with A commute like this with some constant. Yes, and as a result, the corresponding algebra is just current on C1 with value in Barel-Simple algebra. Yes, and here we can consider the zero Uriah components. So it So it is H0 and A0 from here. And this is just Barel for SL2. And because of this, we see that Barel subalgebra for SL2 is acting by symmetries on our algebra and by this And by this way, we can form the bundle of our lettuce vertex separator algebra on CP1, because CP1, this is flag manifold in this case. And it occurred in general, it was proved by some. Was proved by some student of Dr. Mayuki and maybe some other people also. But in this case, at least it is very easy to see that such a bundle of vertex separator algebra have not higher gammology. And H0, it is just what is calling triplet algebra and by evident reason group SL2. Group SL2 is acting on this algebra by symmetries. No, no, such kind of construction looking what actually we are doing. We start with vertex separator algebra where our Borel algebra is acting, our vertex separator algebra depending in P because let us. Because lettuce vertex operator, we get a bundle of vertex operator algebra over CP1, and we can take zero sections, and zero sections give us triplet algebra. But we know very well that representation theory of triplet algebra is corresponding category, and now we know similar about tensor category. Category is isomorphic to a representation of baby quantum group. So surely it is not clear at all how baby quantum group is related to such kind of construction, but nevertheless it is true. What is maybe more interesting and not examined that we know That we know that this lettuce vertex separator algebra has bigger symmetry. And bigger symmetry means that a current from the circle to B is acting by symmetries. Therefore, if we want to proceed by a similar way, then we get a bundle over the quotient through this guy. The quotient. So this guy is current from SO2, and this is smaller algebra. This is current to B. No, better to say that it is zero here and it is connected component of current. And the corresponding quotient is calling semi-infinite flag manifold, or it is looking like universal covering of this. Covering of these. Yes. And therefore, we can find out some bundle of vertex-separated algebra over that. And the question is no natural question: what to do with it? At least it is not studied at all. Yes, but at least I At least I think that it gives us also something like algebra with big center and the corresponding structure on the curve just maps from the curve to CP1, but it can be understood as a reliable or not conjecture. No, the point is what? That when we play on this. When we play on this game, we can use the different structure on algebraic curve to know it can be opieres or it can be connections or it can be something else. In principle, we expect many structures on a curve which play the same role. And we expect some vertex-separated algebra which involves in this process. Involved in this process. Unfortunately, there are some kind of speculation and conjectures, but it may be not for now. Well, about the construction which I describing, we have surely higher rank generalization which is going on more or less straightforward. Now, gamma is lettuce A1. A1 and AN can be simple roots. This here we have corresponding vertex operators, system of scalar products related with some Cartan metrics, and it can be coincide or close to this. Yes, and it can be generalized. And here I want to discuss only two. I here I want to discuss only two examples. SL3, for example, when we use this matrix, then in this case, A1 and A2. No, we also have to fix some P. And again, we have currents from C1 to Barel. And then we have Lie algebra of zero components. And by this way, we get bundle of a flag manual. Bundle of a flag manifold and for SL3. And by this way, we recover SL3 generalization of SL3. And such kind of construction examined, I think, in the case when we do it for semi-simple algebra, but a natural example we can talk about. We can talk about super algebra, not many things are known. Other things we can try to play with affine metrics and we can take zero Fourier components. Such zero Fourier components generate again for some P barrel. For some p barrel for sl2 head and now our bundle we can construct over a fine flag manifold. And if we want to ask some reasonable question, then no, for all affine plague manifold, it is not clear what to do with it. But we can restrict it to Schubert variety. Restricted to Schubert variety, and after that, the question becomes more reasonable. But it's not very much known what to do. Now, I want just to mention a very popular construction where many people here use. Thomas, specialist in this. We can example this following. If we take Example is following. If we take two SL2 head and two levels, and here we have such kind of relation, then we can take a product of 2SL2 and extend it with the help of a vertex separator. Here, I write down how. Here, I write down how to do it. That we have to take, for example, a vertex operator for the first and two-dimensional, this is second one, and then we make up some quadratic combination. So, I combine this vertex separator in the point Z and then a point W and then And then I combine it with by SHV to canceling monodromy. And after that, extended vertex separated algebra, it is possible to consider and work out with this current depending in two variables, but usually people are taking just AZZ, and also we can add the derivative of this in. Derivative of this in first or second variable, and then we get some vertex operator algebra extended, and such vertex operator algebra surely using very much. And I think it appears in many places. We use it with Serozha Gukov and And also, I think Thomas and Gaiot examine it in their work. But if we are talking about algebra with big center, what we have to do, we have to send one of these k to infinity. And in this case, second are going to some integer because n and as a result. And as a result, we get some algebra where this is going on to the abelian vertex separator algebra. And as a result, we have some analog of vertex of vertex separator algebra for no, it is in some sense. It is in some sense, it is similar to the situation which we have on a critical level. At least, for such vertex-separator algebra, in a limit, we have a function on connections, which are big center. And again, if we use this algebra. This algebra by the same way as, for example, USL2 on the critical level, again, we have to take connection here, connection here, connection here, and then a correlation function or conformal block appear if Appear if it is some connection which has globally defined with only singularities here and these elements which counterpart what I had before and they are central character again. Now we have the following situation that Situation that I have some algebra, I have a connection D plus A on a function disk, and to this D plus E, I want, no, I want, because the existence of such algebra, I can correspond some kind of category of representation in D plus E. Yes, and And the situation is following. If D plus A is regular, then the corresponding vertex separator algebra, no, just algebra, as I am setting, is SL2 version of triplet. So it means it contains SL2 head in such kind of construction, but it is very, very, very close to triple. Very, very, very close to triplet. And no, such kind of phenomena is fixed here. I want to say that triplet algebra can be constructed using as a section on a bundle, for example, on a flag manifold. Example on a flag manifold on CP1. And such algebra, what I am talking now, which is corresponding to zero, to non-single d plus A, can be constructed also by this way. Or we can, using this algebra with big center and construct that triplet algebra by this way. No, a situation why these two ways give us the same algebra, it is conceptually it is clear, but technically there are very many questions. Anyway, the situation is looking by the following way. If we have such kind of construction with Such kind of construction with big center, then we have a family of algebras over some base and in some special point on this base when this connection is not is regular, then we get triplet algebra and it is also It is also some way to go in the opposite direction, but it is not completely clear. But the way is following. Suppose you have some vertex separator algebra of triplet type where some continuous group is active. Then it has to be some functor or some way to construct the algebra with big center living on a spectrum. On spectrum of center connections are corresponding to this group and fiber over regular connection, just our algebra from which we start. It is not, it is almost theorem and it is almost correct, I think, but I think it has to be formulated and actually. Formulated and actually proved. Now I want soon. Yes, I have not much time and I want to describe a little bit, not in big details, what we can say about the Kazdan luistic correspondence. So maybe better. So maybe better I write. Cardalistic correspondence is what? That we have connection, D plus A. And as I said in many examples, which discussing on this conference also, if A is regular, then corresponding category is equivalent to this category. Equivalent to this category of baby quantum group in a root of unity, and this root of unity is hidden somewhere in construction of the algebra. It is something like P in triplet algebra and it can be hidden in some or n more or less in a construction of this. This extension. Yes, and if we take D plus alpha minus one, G plus so on, then if alpha minus one, so suppose this is a connection with a regular singularity, but even more than that. But even more than that, this alpha minus one is simple. It is looking, suppose SL2 case, it is looking like this. Then from the point of view of vertex separator algebra, we get what is calling on the twisted category of twisted representation. But from the point of view of baby quantum Of baby quantum group, it means that here appear the algebra which surely discuss or will discuss on this conference. So it means that we have to take baby quantum group E F K and E n is zero and also it is same F n but K maybe to n n is some number which appears. n is some number which appears here it is equal to exponent 2 pi i mu yes and uh so such kind of algebra appear here yes and then if you uh no in so it is surely the question and it it is easy to guess Is easy to guess what we have to do if corresponding metrics here is not necessarily semi-simple or something like that. And this is also interesting story. But in principle, it is doable or done. But more interesting story that we can take D plus more complicated things. For example, More complicated things. For example, alpha minus two, z square plus so on. But at least we, anyway, what we expect that to any connection on the function disk, we can corresponding to some category. Yes, a category of some representation. Yes, and Yes, and the natural question is: what is this category, at least what we expect? I think many people on this conference, more or less on a level on conjecture, maybe somebody on Ethereum knows the answer. So anyway, the object is so. Object is so the interesting from the many points. So we have connections, and to any connection we want to correspond, or the construction of algebra automatically correspond to the connection, some kind of category. Yes, and if we want to, and this category have to depend in P and maybe on some other data, but And maybe on some other data, but at least on some of P, and the question is: what is this? And I think that I cannot formulate even the conjecture in full details, but at least it is possible. The way to do it more or less is following. So if we have the connection, we have something like We have something like stocks zones and stocks data. It is like that. So, or many, it depends on what we have here and so on. We have many zones. And from these zones, the monadromy of such kind of equation describing by what. So we have. So we have on each sector, we have space of solutions. Yes, and in usual, and this stocks business, each space of solution equipped with flex structure. So on V, we have On V, we have some filtration of zero, F2, which determine how solutions are going on to zero. Yes, and also we have the map from so this through the wall. So we have maps like The wall, so we have maps like this, like this, and like this. Yes, and if we want to describe this object, we have keyword like this, and we have to write down home v1 v2 plus home v2 v3 plus so on. But we have to factorize it by action of Of Barel group, which is acting here, here, here, here, and here. And if we make up such factorization in principle, we get something which can be understood as a monadromy data or such kind of story. Of story again, it is slightly approximate, but it is very close, it is rather close to the reality. But first, what we can do after that? We can, first of all, it is a standard story. But people who studied the Poisson structure in terms of quantum group, they studied the Poisson version of this. So they just So they just saying that everywhere we have Poisson structure, and after such kind of reduction, we get Poisson manifold. But we also can do it for quantum group. So it means that we can fix Q and V will be a representation of some quantum group, say UQ of G of SL2, for example, or in GSL2. Two, for example, or in G, as you like, J Lien. Yes. And in this case, we have such kind of home where our quantum groups, just product here, here, here, and here are acting, and we can factorize by action of Barrel or Nilpatent and so on. And so on. So, and by this way, we get some kind of algebra. And now, this algebra is also interesting, but for our purpose, we need to use Q take limit for this in the root of unity when it is one. And such kind of construction give you some else. Give you some algebra which looking like cuts. No, cuts a group actually is a version of this. Cuts group is just G itself, but on the root of unity and it has a big center, which is just E n F. E n f n and k to n or even n. Yes, but here we have similar construction on a different language. So we get some algebra which has a big center and quotient by this center seems to be some finite dimensional algebra which cooked out from several quotes of baby quantum group. Yes. Yes, and so here it is a sort of conjecture, but it is actually this is a collection of conjecture because to make some steps, what we need to know. First, maybe not in general, but for some D plus A, explicit construction of a corresponding algebra. Maybe we can use confluence construction because for regular things we know the answer. Maybe we can use some other way to do it. But it is, at least for any people who are working, we need some kind of algebra explicitly describing by set of generators, maybe, and so on. And if we have some kind of algebra, it can be. Have some kind of algebra. It can be theorem or conjecture or something like that, that it has to be some algebra such that representation, so which some kind of algebra which play a role of cart's quantum group used big center, when if we put this center equal to something, then the corresponding quotient. Then corresponding quotient describes their representation of algebra which corresponding to the connection. Yes. And I think that more or less precisely it is known in a case when corresponding quantum group, corresponding object is cuts quantum group and The most simplest case when the corresponding central character belonged to Cartan. This case I think studied a lot and maybe it is known very well. Even if you, but at least the corresponding algebra. Corresponding algebra is known, and we can factorize by some other element and also find out connection and so on. For me, question is open even in this case. Yes, but in general, this is a big challenge to say something. Okay, so thank you, maybe it is time to finish. Thank you. Okay, let's like to skip it. Let's take the speaker. Thank you. Are there any questions? Tutor? Oh, that was a clap. Sorry. Okay, so no questions. So, Boria, can you say a little bit more this case where you have a while singularity with set square in the denominator? How would you see this or how would you conjecture to see this on this coset side? I mean, on the coset side, you only have regular connections if you do it naively, right? You have to take bigger algebra or something. If you take bigger algebra or something, Verma module. But not necessarily a regular connection. We can surely consider the biggest things. And it is easy to see if you have SL2 on a critical level. And corresponding representation, you can easily see. And no, you can just take universal envelope. Just take universal enveloping, and you can say that Li are acting by some constant, and such Li can be any numbers. And then in principle, you get some kind of representation, which can be reducible or not. I mean, representation of SL2 hat, depending on the property of this coefficient. And so irregular A connection appears as an explanation. Are there any other questions? Well, then let's please thank our speaker again. And we'll start again at 10:30 with Kashayev giving a talk.
