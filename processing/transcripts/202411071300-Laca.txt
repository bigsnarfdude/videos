That if you need a confirmation letter of attendance, it will not depend on compliance with the title containing the word full group or carton. However, I will report that compliance is high. Full group six. Barton seven and a half for a total of twelve and a half better than half a half. I just counted you for a half. Thank you. Nobody's complaining about my arithmetic. I did. Julian? Julian? Yeah. When you explain the arithmetic. When you explain the six plus seven is 12. So I, because I missed out some charts. Your title contains both. Oh, oh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now that I have your attention. So I want to talk about this result. These are relatively recent results and it's the beginning of something, maybe something that is worth looking into. It's joint work with my colleague Chris Eagle from the University of Victoria and my former student Gavin Berkeley. So I will give motivation. It exists and it is not unique. So, the first situation that arose called my attention is in the context when you have a monoid, a sub-monoid of a group, and you can see the left-radular representation. Those are isometries because the monoid is cancellative, getting inside the group. And then you look at the product of those isometries and the ladder, and you collect the terms that you can collect because the representation is multiplicative, and you get this. Multiplicative, and you get this automating product. And you take it closer and you're spanning, you get the reduced Tupitz algebra. And that's an object of interest. Among those products, there are the ones that I reproduce backwards, taking the adjoint. So these are even. They're balanced. What it is that they are invariant under the co-action of group G. But the point is that those are projections that generate the community system. That community system. In that community, the sister algebra has an action of the group, in fact, a partial action of the group, and the partial action, the continuous functions on omega embedded in the cross product by the partial action. And that is a theorem of the general case of X and D, that that partial cross-product is reduced. And it's also a theorem of XND that when that monoid does not have any invertible relevance, Monoid does not have any invertible elements, so they all push forward, nothing loops back into itself. Then this is the takes idea. This has ideal restriction code. So the motivation was a result that Camilla and I approved a couple of years ago and started studying this histological generality. But when we hit that result, we said, what if there are any verticals? What's happening? But if there are any verticals, what's happening? Well, if there are any verticals, then you get an actual three-probable action of invertibles on the spectrum of that other. And we were able to prove that the ideal intersection property actually holds, not for the community in part, but the community part cross-product with this little group of invertible, little or big. Nothing prevented you from putting E equal to G here. Put a whole group in there. And that's an intriguing result because now we have, in principle, non-commutative system algebraic playing the role of that metal action. Of course, if this action itself is topologically free, then the task of result, you can drop down to the community part by the standard result. But the logic libertine community party takes The community part detects ideas. So this one will detect ideas in the cross product, and the cross product will detect ideas in the community. So the first result is this one. And the question is, what if there is no gene? So, for example, scribbers are left canceled into small categories. You still have this first construction, but there's no group. And this partial action techniques don't work. The second motivation. The second motivation is, as everybody knows, the ideal intersection property corresponds to a condition for faithfulness of representations. So you can check that representation of B is faithful if only the sub-algebra is faithful. And here you can see that I'm not an expert because I write the A and the B backwards. So, and here I have very basic examples of that, where you have the C starts with a U-later shift with the With the continuous functions of the integers, on the positive integers, with a limit. And similarly, if you have this gamma here, this is a group of the reals, the gamma plus is a positive part. And again, you have projections that give you a communities of algebra. And all those detect ideas. The techniques consult about this. This is a sort of AF core, and this is a community diagram diagram core. All these detect ideas. ON, this detects ideas. Of course, there's not much to be detected. Of course, there's no mice to be detected here, but they are detected. And then put it up, and only we're going up to this is too basic. But if you have, let's be careful a reason. If you have M2 plus M2, then the two diagonals, if you have them up, they detect ideas. But we want to minimize verification. This is something that arises in practice when we're working with sister algorithms, for which you can maybe identify a representation because you see generators and relations, but you And relations, but you don't know if what you have is a faithful copy of your algebra. And you want to have a quick and efficient way of verifying whether you have a faithful representation. And it's good to have those things in your pocket because sometimes you're working on something you need to know now if that algebra is faithful. If that representation is faithful. And it is not always clear. Sometimes you get into complicated proof in the middle of another complicated proof. So you have this in your pocket. But it's better than. But it's better than this because in the C-serves of the shift, it's enough to check one projection. So if we put the complex number there to have an algebra, so that algebra, the one projection on the minimal detects ideals. And so that diagrams can take any isomer. And if that one is non-unitary, then representation is facial. Say similar for current funds, one projector. Similar for complex funds, one projection. I put the complex numbers here because I'm talking about verifying faithfulness on an algebra, but you're really verifying faithfulness on one element, and that's enough. So, one element detects ideas. Kunzalgebra identity detects ideas. I mean, that's kind of half a joke. But you need to know that the representation is non-zero, okay, verify it at the identity. And in this one, the economy is relative, but you don't need to check on d2 plus d2. You can check on the one component, the identity. On the one component, the identity of one component, and on the identity of the other component. So there's two things to check. And you can take that direct sample or you can think independently. I don't care if I have one algebra or two algebras that detect ideas. You may need... There's a balance between having one big thing or two small things. Sometimes it's easier to have two small things and one big thing. Okay, so those are the motivations. And what we came up a bit roundabout was this definition of relative topological principle. This definition of relative topological principality. So let's say that an entire group is topologically principal relative to a family of open subgroups. If the set of units such that their isotopically can be conjugated into one of the elements of the family is dense. And the conjugation is by a open bisotopic, open bisection. So somehow these H's in the family, they control the Family, they control the isotopy on a dense subset. We can reciprocally, we can say what H does to G. This is what G does to H, but H constrains the isotopy. Maybe it's a more suggestive name for it. So this family H is witnessing this isotopy happening and it controls isotropy. If you have one of the end cells, so it's a bit of a complicated definition, but most of the time. Definition, but most of the time the family only has one element. We don't really have, this is the beginning, we don't have examples where the family is very big. Most of the time, one element is anymore. So this gamma here does not necessarily intersect the unit space? Gamma? So this bisection does not necessarily intersect the unit space? No. It it goes from the unit space to the unit space. Yeah, it's also. Space is a unit space, right? Yeah, sure, sure, sure. But it doesn't have to be. I mean, it could, it could be moving inside the unit space. But, okay, so I'm baffled by your question, Jason. I don't understand, but this is kind of worded unit space over two years, right? Okay, so two things to check for reality to check. What is topological imprints? What does topological principle mean? Well, it means topological principle relative to the unit space. So we contain, do the unit space, you know, this is just one group of. And everything, we read the definition of topological principle in the green. And the other one is a result of John, Gabby, Sarah, Aiden, and William, and Daniel. And Daniel. A second cantal has a retired group, which is always topological in principle with respect to the family singleton, the isotropy, the interior of the isotropy. So the interior of the isotropy controls the isotope, but that's not saying much, really. But it does. And it's not a trivial result. And the reason is that the isotropy is containing the points from which isotopy is containing interiors is a dense. This is a demo or a theorem or proposition of okay. So what? Theorem. If you have a house of eta group that is topologically principal relative to a family, then the family has the ideal intersection property. So in a way, what you're doing is when the ideal intersection property fails for the unit space, it's because there is isotopy. So this turns the So this turns the problem into part of the solution. So it puts the isotropy into the thing to be checked. And then to phrase it a little bit differently or explain what a family having their IIP means, well, if it's favorable, if the presentation is favorable, each of those restrictions is favorable. The idea of the proof is to go along the result of the uniqueness theorem of Uniqueness theorem of John, Gabby, Zara, Aiden, and Dana, which proves unique extension of states and the ideal integration property for the inclusion of a problem proving that this is an inclusion technical for that inclusion. So, but we have to move from the interior isotopy to this family, and for that we again borrow without intention to return, the results of math. Results of Matthew, Zheng Chi, Xin, Ven, and Dan, they have a construction in which the action, there's an action of inverse semi-group projections by algebra-Savalsev isomorphisms. Not a partial action by Stavalzev isomorphisms. So we adapt those results to this family. And there's a punch line that we need to extend states from the subgroup points to the group points, just to have them. To the group, or it's just a lot of, and we relied on a recent, relatively recent result of Becking on extension, unique extension. Okay, so that's the idea of the proof. I'll give you another proof in a minute. So, there are recent related results that people who are not here, but relevant anyway. So, Charles Stanley has a generalization of the uniqueness theorem that I mentioned of John and et al. And et al that uses a refinement. So he has already gone a bit inside the interior of the sort of improved idea of intersection property. And more recently, and perhaps very importantly, there's a result of Christensen and Nefer, they develop a whole theory of isotopic fibers. So what they prove is very technical, but they show that if you have an idea and you Have an ideal and you intersect with the isotopy at every point, you get some sort of field of isotropy ideas. And those isotropy ideas are well defined, it's not complicated to define them, but they exist, they are there, and you can reconstruct the original ideal from the files. So with that, you can have a proof of our theorem that roughly goes like this. If you take an ideal such that it has the intersection with the family, then Then the isotropy fibers are trivial for every U. You know, if it's trivial here, then it's, you know, when they are the same, okay, that's not saying much. But because of the topological principality and the conjugacy invariance, these ideals are now dense, zero for a dense subset, by relative topological principality. And then you can reconstruct from the isotopy fiber, so the whole idea was zero to the mu. So, the whole idea was ruined. So, that sketch of a proof, this is an easy proof using a hard result, but it is also conceptual. It tells you, even if you're not going to use this method, it tells you the method is there, you can use it to think about things, and you can prove things some other way. But you get the intuition from imagining that your ideals are constructed from isotopy fibers. So, okay. Sergei told me, and I believe entirely, that Hauser information is not needed, you can adapt the proof to the sister, the essential sister, with the same relative principle assumption. Okay, so the original application corresponding to the first motivation, we apply this to the locally, sorry, left cancellative small category of. Left cancelative small category of Jack Spielberg, and we get that if you have inverses, then the idea of the selection property holds. This is a generalization, a direct generalization of the theorem of Camila and I put. I call it a little cross paragraph, it may not be so general, but the very cross-parallel captures the ideas in the turplets algebra. And the idea is: you look at the group of not the type. And not the tight one, but the topist version of the group. And it's just this guy here constrains this object. So it's a divert result, corollary of both view. And again, you can apply the same corollary. If the global action is targeted, then by the results to mem, I can go all the way down. There we go. Okay. So now I like to compare because there's the two motivations kind of intersect in the sense that if you have if you now have the cases where with the cross-parallel by the units acting on the sorry, this is confusing. The units in the mono C star or the invertible, let's say invertible, in the mono C star are acting on the units in the group oil. So you have that as your detection. As your detection machine, or you can have the interior isotopy as your detection machine. I want to compare those two. So, round one, detect this semi-group here. This arises in an arithmetic origin, but arises from studying k-m-states or C-star algebra in number theory. But this mono, where the multiplication goes on the left, here's the rule: AKBL, these are classes modular N. You multiply A and B and then the other one, you do K B plus L. And that's well defined, so that's your monoid. That mono is left cancellative and right L C M, but it's not right cancellative. So it doesn't embed in the group. Nevertheless, you can compute the Turbus algebra and the corresponding diagonal or finite space or vector diagonal. You say the group of the The group point associated with highest household is taken countable. And the little cross product is strictly smaller than the interior esoteric. So as a detection machine, it's more efficient to look at that little cross product. It's not so little, smaller than the big one. And the esoteric is too big. Or there is redundancy. If you were to test here, If you were to ta if you were to test here, you would be testing there and that would will be enough. So round one goes to cross product. Round two, you flip the, yeah, I took the whole integers. I don't think it makes any difference. You took Z mod M A. We had the computation from different papers for this one, so we included this example. So now multiplication goes to the other side. This looks trickier, but it costs enormous. Trigger, but it's because it's enormous difference. Now the A and the B are on the right, they multiply, and now the additive part was A plus A K L. K plus A L. So that's the multiplication. It looks the same, but it's not. The ideal structure is very different. And if you take G omega V unit space of the group associated with that semi-group, then now the isotropy is strictly smaller than the cross part. They cross plot. The the sorry, the yep, they crossbow. So the point here is that by computation that Sergeia and I did a long time ago, this action is topologically free. So if you apply the result of Camila and my partial action of the group generated by the semi-group is also topologically free, and then. And danger down to the diagonal. So the interior isotope in this case is as small as it can be. So it wins in the round two was the isotope more efficient. Now, it's subtle, there's a trade-off. If there are lots of ideals, there is just isotropy. And therefore, chances are that the theory of isotope is going to be smaller and more efficient. Smaller and more efficient. If there are few ideas and things pile up, the interior sort of gets big, but the other cross-products kind of is smaller. I do not understand this in general, but I look at examples and I kind of see what's happening. I think it's interesting. So there are things that I'm not going to say. This is the end. But there are questions to be asked. There are questions to be asked. To be asked. One of them is what is this little cross part of the is we have if the action is topologically free, the initial functions on the unit space detect ideals. It's also a MASA or one of those things, Cartan. And then it doesn't work if the action is not topologically free. You can throw that away then, but you're going to say, well, we can fix it. Way then, but you're going to say, Well, we can fix it. We've introduced some of the isotopy into the detection. Now it's not a billion anymore. Is it a non-community carton in some sense? In the same half, I don't know. But it seems to be useful. Add for the detection of ideas. Of course, we want more. We want reconstruction of ideas and we want classification of ideas, all that. But at least this is the first step that sounds like it's interesting. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
