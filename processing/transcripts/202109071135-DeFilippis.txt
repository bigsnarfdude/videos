Perturbations beyond shauder. You're welcome. Thanks, and above all, thanks for the invitation. My talk will cover Schauder estimates for local minimizers of non-uniformly elliptic variational integral and solution of non-uniformly elliptic equations. Now, let me start from the basics. Consider a linear equation of this type if we Of this type. So, if we want to measure residicity, well, we have to consider this ratio between the highest eigenvalue of A of X and over the lowest eigenvalue of A of X. And we can say that this equation is uniformly elliptic if this quantity is uniformly bounded, otherwise it is non-uniformly elliptic. These concepts are strongly related to the regularity of solutions. Of solutions. Now, if I want to translate these concepts into the non-linear setting, well, I can look at a non-linear elliptic equation minus divergence of A of du. And as it is natural, if I want to recover some gradient estimates, I need to differentiate the equation. Therefore, if I want to measure its ellipticity, I can consider the linear i. I can consider the linearized equation, okay, which is of this form again, minus divergence of a of x d of ds u equals zero, with a of x given by the derivative with respect to the gradient variable of a evaluated in u. Then, just keeping in mind the definition that I gave before, I can consider the lowest second value of the z of a and Of the Z of A and the highest second value of the Z of A, which are to non-negative functions, and define the ellipticity ratio, which is given by precisely the ratio of G2 and G1. This was already said by Lisa. Of course, since our main point of interest will be Lipschitz regularity for solution, then we are interested in the uniform boundedness of this quantity on large gradients. Large gradients. Now, some examples of uniformly elliptic equations. Well, we have the most famous Laplace equation, the P-Laplace equation, which is degenerate but still uniformly elliptic. And more general, we can consider non-linear equations verifying the assumptions of Vladijanskaya and Durhamseva, which means that the derivative in the gradient variable of A behaves as Behaves as the derivative of the Pilar-Blazian of the Pilar-Blashen equation. In all these cases, the ellipticity ratio is uniformly bounded. Now, one could think that uniform ellipticity is related to some homogeneous structure as the Pilablacian. This is not precisely the case. Indeed, we can consider general equations of this form. Of this form, where et riddle verifies this boundedness condition, which is strictly related to the uniform boundedness of the ellipticity ratio. And this allows us to give up on homogeneity and consider more general structure, okay, which are uniformly elliptic. For instance, sum of powers. And what is relevant about this condition? Relevant about this condition is that it rules out, it forces some balance polynomial growth from above and below. It grows as two different powers, but it essentially rules out, for instance, exponentials. Those are not considered, but I mean, the regularity theory for solution of this equation is very well very much investigated by now. You can see the work of Baroni, Becaminjon, and Bjun, Jean-Kimaziadi, and Lieberman just. Jeanque Mazial, Dean Lieberman, just forgiven an incomplete list of authors that work on this. Now, for defining the concept of uniform or non-uniform ellipticity in the non-autonomous case, well, this is a more delicate issue. Indeed, if we have a look to equation of this type, minus divergence of A of x du equals f, with the, I mean, you could even put f equals zero, then we need to. Then we need a more flexible condition. For instance, the eigenvalues, the lowest eigenvalue and the highest eigenvalue of the z of a are two again two non-negative functions that this time are allowed to depend also on x. Then we are led to the definition this time of two quantities that play a crucial role when dealing with the regularity of solution of this equation. The first one is elitated in a sense Helidated in a sense from the autonomous case, which is the point-wise ellipticity ratio. Okay, it worked nicely in the autonomous case by throwing it away. However, this ratio fails in detecting certain particular structures that are pointwise uniformly elliptic, but still they are not uniformly elliptic and they owe the non-uniform ellipticity to a possible pathological behavior of coefficients. This is, for instance, Coefficients. This is, for instance, detected by the non-local ellipticity ratio, which is this time defined as the ratio between the supremum over a fixed ball of G2 over the infimum of G1. This will allow to detect particular structure, as I will show you in a few slides. Indeed, this is the case, for instance, of the double phase energy. This is the equation, the Euler-Lagrange equation of the Euler. Equation of the Euler D of the double phase functional. Now, notice that here, whenever I freeze, I get a perfectly uniformly elliptic structure. However, the coefficient is allowed to vanish. Here, A is bounded and elder continues. So, his zero level set is as bad as you like. So, there is essentially no control on the LQ part. On the LQ part of the energy. And this causes the non-uniform ellipticity of the double phase energy. Indeed, here it happens that the point-wise ellipticity ratio is beautifully bounded, while the non-local one behaves as a positive, if Q is larger than P, of course, as a positive power of the modulus of Z, which of course blows up on large gradients. And this And this points out to what is the real pathological behavior of the coefficient in the double phase energy. Now, let me turn back to the case of linear equation. And it is very well known that solution of minus Laplacian of u equals zero are smooth. Therefore, if I plug in a matrix coefficient, plug in coefficients, then it is Coefficients, then it is reasonable to expect that solution of this equation retains as much regularity as the regularity of A allows, where A of course is bounded and elliptic. So the matter of shoulder estimates in the linear case is classical, and it is, of course, very well known that if A is ender continuous, then the gradient is ender continuous. That's it. And these kind of results have Of results are very classical in the sense that they dates back to the work of Hoch, Katropoly, and Schauder. Indeed, they are known as Schauder or Schauder-Katropoli estimates. And they heavily relies on potential theory. These estimates have substantially been simplified by Campanato, Trudinger, and Leon-Simon, which realize that if I'm assuming that coefficients are render continuous, this means that their oscillation is very much under control. Is very much under control. Therefore, it is possible to proceed using perturbation methods, which can be summarized in comparing a solution to this equation, okay, to its harmonic lifting, which is the solution of the Dirichlet problem defined by means of this frozen equation, and which on the boundary, this will happen, of course, on a ball, on the boundary of the ball, B and U coincide. Okay? Side. Okay, since the regularity theory for this equation is very well known, then it is possible to transfer part of this regularity to solutions of our original equation. Now, this circle of idea can be reproduced also in the non-linear setting. Indeed, the story of non-linear shoulder estimates dates back to the beginning of the 80s. A model example is given by the Pilar Brash. Example is given by the Pilar-Brashan equation, which is the minus divergence Cx modulus du to T minus 2 equals zero, where C is either continuous and bounded away from zero. And the fact that we are allowed to proceed via comparison arguments, perturbation arguments for getting regularity on our equation, is that the corresponding frauds and equation, the p-harmonic lifting, has good regulation. Is has good regularity properties, in particular homogeneous reference estimates. And it is, of course, C1 beta 0 locally regular, not more because of a very famous conterexample due to RALCA. And again, it is possible to apply a perturbative argument in order to transfer this regularity to U. Of course, here we will get that U is C1 beta 0 for some beta 0, depending in particular on the Depending in particular on the end of the continuity exponent of the coefficient. Now, these results can be extended, of course, to more general equations, which are still uniformly elliptic, but satisfy the standard classical assumptions of Ladyjevsky and Duraltseva. And this can be final in by now classical works of Jacqueminte and Rustima, Fredi, Benedetto, Louis, Tolstorff. However, if we are only interested However, if we are only interested in the boundedness of the gradient or in the continuity of the gradient, then the end-continuity assumption can be relaxed for the coefficient by requiring Dini continuity. And this is available in a paper by Kulsen in Glona. Other conditional coefficients guaranteeing regularity can be found also in a recent work by Mazele and Cobon. Okay, so let me summarize what we have. So, let me summarize what we have so far. In both the linear and the non-linear case, perturbation methods are the basic for regularity. And the main idea is to couple two crucial ingredients. First, you want to compare your equation with a frozen one, which is its harmonic lifting that agrees, the solution agrees on the boundary of a ball with the original solution. Then measure the distance in every. Measure the distance in average of those two functions by means of comparison arguments, and moreover, exploit homogeneous reference estimates that are available for solution of the frozen problems. Those two ingredients will behave under iteration, and this will render in a by now classical way the under continuity of the gradient. Okay, shadow estimates, of course, hold also in the variational setting. Also, in the variational setting, here think to F as it was just the Pilaplacian, I mean, they can be transferred per bottom from the theory available for equations, because for this kind of integrals, the Euler-Lagrange equation is available. Therefore, since this equation falls into the realm of those described before, then shoulder estimates also in this case. Now, the situation gets correspondingly slightly more Gets correspondingly slightly more complicated when dealing with non-differentiable functional. Again, f think to f as the Pilaplacian, but now h is measurable in x. Elder continues with respect to w. Therefore, h is not differentiable in the w variable. Therefore, the Euler-Lagrange equation does not exist. Now, these issues are treated in papers by Frieset, Jogminten, Justi, Wertman, Frey, and still relies on perturbation. Ready and still relies on perturbation arguments that this time make use of the minimality, which is an important information given by the fact that we are dealing with functions. There are also new more recent results by Christensen and Minglon on this matter. Okay, another type of non-differentiable functional is this model here, where this time C is can no longer be considered as a lower order term as it multiplies. Lower order term as it multiplies the principal operator. And here the matter is a little more delicate because for running a perturbative approach here, you need to have a control on the oscillation of W. Now, if F has standard P growth, this is given by standard de Georgie theory. Bid minimizer of this kind of integrals are L the. are elder continuous and therefore this coefficient decomposition of C with u of x behaves as it was just an elder continuous function and this allows to run the usual perturbation arguments now non-uniform ellipticity is quite classical and has been studied a lot before the 70s by a series of important authors coming from Russian school from From it was studied by Serne Leon, Simon, Lady Jenska, Yoral, Seva, and lots of important mathematicians. It also received important contribution after the 80s. We remember in particular the contribution of Marcellini and Jikhov, which give a substantial contribution to this theory. Now, in general, In general, for dealing with the non-uniform reality setting, it is more convenient to treat it into the variational framework. So as minimizers of a certain energy. Again, if we want to... This is more appropriate because we also have the minimality as an additional information, and this sometimes can help in using directly the minimizer as a computer. Minimizer as a comparison map, which is not always the case. Now, Euler-Lagrange equation reads in this way. Therefore, we can define also in this case an ellipticity ratio. Now, if you call the Z of F A, we can recover the definition that I gave before by considering the ratio between the highest second values of the second derivative of F over the lowest second value of the second derivative of F. A second value of the second derivative of f. And of course, we have in we are in the real in the realm of non-uniform elliptistic when this quantity blows up on large gradients. Now, it received lots of attention, the matter of polynomial non-uniform ellipticity, which means that the ellipticity ratio behaves as a positive power of the modulus of Z, which means that it blows up on large gradients. Such a condition is usually Such a condition is usually given by prescribing this ellipticity proton second derivative, which is of pq type according to the terminology introduced by Marcellini. And the ellipticity ratio now behaves as modules of Z to Q minus P. Therefore, it is evident that its blow-up is strongly related to the closeness of these two quantities. So it is a So, it is likely that for having hopes of regularity for the minimizer of this kind of energies, it is required that Q and P must be quite close to each other, precisely to slow down the blow-up of R. Indeed, a condition of this target has been proven by Marcellini and Jacquinta that it is a necessary and sufficient condition for regularity. Okay, let me turn back a second. Me turn back a second to the uniform reality case. Now we have two classical facts. First, one, we consider that this Pila-Plashan type equation C Z elder implies that the gradient is elder for solutions. Classical fact two is that when we have a non-differentiable functional and we assume that C is elder, h is elder in w, then we have that the gradient is elder. So this So, this has been classically by now, this has been classically established. Then, we can try to reformulate this kind of problems in the realm of non-uniform ellipticity. We have solutions of non-uniform elliptic equations of this type, with ellipticity ratio behaving as a power of the modulus of the gradient, or more general equations with the polynomial non-uniform ellipticity. And we wonder if. Ellipticity, and we wonder if the undercontinuity of C implies the undercontinuity of the gradient. And a second open problem can be formulated in terms of non-differentiable functionals with f with polynomial non-uniform ellipticity and h measurable in x and their continuous in b. Is this condition sufficient for getting that the gradient is zero? Well, so far there was nothing about this. Indeed, we can see About this, indeed, we can see a comment of Lieberman below the paper of Giacnita Justi, which says that their theory perfectly works in the uniform realistic setting. However, it fails in the non-uniform realistic one unless there are very strong assumptions in force on your functional, for instance. Those are, indeed, in that case, there are needed barriers or differentiability with respect to all the possible languages. With respect to all the possible entries, which means that the natural assumptions, which are elder continuity with respect to coefficients, are immediately ruled out. There is also this observation in Ivanus' book, which stressed the importance of having gradient bounded when dealing with, when willing to obtain shadow estimates. Indeed, above all, for the case of However, for the case of non-uniform elasticity, the boundedness of the gradient is something crucial, as already Lisa said, for carrying on with the regularity theory. Indeed, once the gradient is proven to be bounded, then uniform ellipticity in some sense disappears, because it is a matter of a blow-up of the ellipticity ratio. But if the gradient doesn't blow up, then indeed, for instance, have a look to this theorem by Lady Dishanskaya and Gurafseva. Here, there are very, very strong assumptions required on the non-linear tense array, including differentiability with respect to the X variable and the U variable. Moreover, it is also required the use of barriers. So there are very strong assumptions. And analogous comments have been made by Jocnint and Lucy on their papers. Again, boundedness of the gradient is. Boundedness of the gradient is crucial for carrying on the shoulder estimates. Now, in this talk, I will propose a solution to those open issues given by myself and Mingjohn. We are able to give an answer both to the case of shoulder estimates for solution of non-uniform elliptic equations and for minimizer of non-uniform elliptic variational integrals. We can treat also non-differentiable functions. We can treat also non-differentiable functionals and introduce an hybrid perturbation approach which does not directly rely on freeze and compare. And of course, also in our case, what is crucial is to recovering L infinity bounds for the gradient. Okay, now if you remember what I said about the findings of Marcellini and Giacominta, for polynomial non-uniform ellipticity, For polynomial non-uniform ellipticity, we need to slow down the blow-up of the ellipticity ratio. Indeed, shoulder estimates do not always solve already for, in some sense, privileged structure such as the double phase one. Indeed, remember that this is point-wise uniformly elliptic. But still, a constraint linking the exponent to the space dimension and the alpha-Elder continuity exponent of A is required for getting regularity. For getting regularity, otherwise, there are counterexamples. Indeed, it is possible to produce a violating the bound, it is possible to produce minimizers that do not belong to W1Q. And moreover, it is also possible to construct minimizers that have quite a pathological behavior under the point of view of non-lebec points. Indeed, the observed dimension of the non-lebeck points of such minimizer may be maximal in the sense that. Maybe maximal in the sense that it's larger than n minus p minus epsilon, you know, something. And of course, those maps belong to w1p, so it is less than n minus p, so it is almost maximal, which means that those minimizers do not behave better than any of their competitors. Okay, but on the other hand, we have also regularity. This theory by Colombia Minjone shows that minimizers have enjoyed optimal C1 bit. Have enjoyed the optimal C1 beta zero local regularity once the exponents satisfy this bound. There are also further results by Barrow-in-Bolomenjo involving more general conditions. Okay, now what is the peculiarity of this double-phase energy? It is pointwisely uniformly elliptic, which means that in the light of what I said before on how to get the continuity of the gradient, you have two weeks. Comparison estimates and reference estimates for Estimates and reference estimates for frozen problems. Now, since here the frozen problem see the frozen problem is uniformly elliptic, the problem for sure is not on the comparison estimate. However, recall that the coefficient may vanish. So the pathological point of the double phase relies precisely in getting suitable comparison estimates. Now, this special structure have been investigated a lot. Have been investigated a lot. And using the fact that they are pointwise uniformly elliptic, quite wide regularity theory has been developed so far. In particular, shadow estimates are available for this kind of structures. Now, this cannot be, of course, transferred for functionals with polynomial non-uniform ellipticity. Ellipticity already in this simplified model, indeed, whenever we freeze, we get an eliticity ratio that blows up as a positive power again of the gradient variable. So the theory available for those special structures is no longer available in this case. So far. Indeed, we have shadow estimates for the solution of this Dirichlet problem with the Pauline. With the polynomial non-uniform multiplicity, and of course, a boundary datum which is quite regular, and this is classical in this setting. Indeed, if Q over P satisfies this constraint and keep an eye on this quantity, which is, I mean, recall that this was already visible for the double phase, then we can find a solution of this Dirichlet problem whose gradient is locally intercontinuous. Local intercontinues. Analogous result called in the variational setting. Of course, also here I'm showing a model, but I can consider general non-autonomous functionals with the polynomial non-uniform ellipticity. The coefficient needs to be entertain continuous. We need again to impose a suitable constraint between the exponent, then the gradient is locally intercontinuous again. Now, I will list now some results concerning non-differential. Some result concerning non-differentiable functions will be an increasing level of difficulty. First, I consider a lower-order term involving only x and u. Okay, f has polynomial non-uniform ellipticity, and h is measurable in x and l there in b. Again, we need to impose a new constraint linking exponents to alpha over n, which is again present. Which is again present, and here we are we see that this constraint in some sense reflects the structure of the integral that we are looking at. The gradient is a Galilean that continues. Now, non-differentiable function level two. Here we are introducing a lower order term that depends on the gradient, where f while f and h are the same as theorem one, g is convex, has a certain growth with respect to the gradient variable, either with respect to the gradient gradient. Elder with respect to X and V, we need to relate both this elder continuity exponent and the gradient in the gradient and the growth in the gradient variable to the ellipticity exponent provide a suitable bound that accounts for this restriction. And then we have again that the gradient is locally intercontinuous. Third level, this time C is no longer, cannot longer be considered Can no longer be considered as a lower-order tel. Indeed, it multiplies the principal operator, which is again, which has again a polynomial non-uniform ellipticity. C is held there. We need to assume that P is larger than N, and this will be seen in the bound. Impose a bound on Q over P, notice that this quantity is always present, alpha over N, and then we have that the gradient is locally under continuous. That the gradient is locally undercontinuous. Now, let me comment a bit about this assumption P larger than n. Indeed, if you remember when I commented about this kind of integral, well, if F were of the Pilaplacian type, then by standard de Georgi theory, minimizer would be already intercontinuous. Therefore, C behaves exactly on the minimizer. It behaves as a usual coefficient, except as a continuous coefficient. Continuous coefficient. This is no longer available for functionals that have polynomial non-uniform ellipticity. Therefore, the assumption P larger than N is an compensates the lack of standard de George theory. So I suspect that this assumption may be optimal. Now I will list some borderline regularity results starting from Starting from the one that Lisa presented, indeed recall this classical result by Stain, which says that a function that has its gradient in Ln1 is continuous with definition of Lorentz space. Now, if we combine the Sten's theorem with standard Calderon-Sigmund theory, we have that minus Laplace of U equal to something belonging to L1 implies that the gradient is continuous. And this is optimal. Is optimal. Moreover, this result holds in a way more general framework. Indeed, it holds also for integrals with PQ growth, with Sobolev differentiable coefficients. This was proven by myself and Minjon, and also in the autonomous case by Lis and Rosario. And it also for way more general functional structure than just the PQ for exponentials and similar. It's similar. Now, recall our result about non-differentiable functions. Okay. Well, we have a result involving a borderline condition on this oscillation. Indeed, if we measure the oscillation of H, not only by the distance between V1 and V2 to the alpha, but also by means of a function f that belongs to ln over alpha, one over two. ln over alpha one over two impose again a suitable bound linking the exponent to alpha and then we can prove that the gradient is locally bounded now these borderline regularity results can be in some sense some sense translated at a partial regularity level indeed if we consider quasi convex integrand integrands with pq growth which are defined by means of an integrand that grows in this way That grows in this way, that satisfies strict degenerate W1P plus a convexity as controlled growth on second derivative control at oscillation and behaves as a degenerate Pilar-Brashani integral in zero. Then we can prove, can consider local minimizers of this variational integral, and then can prove the existence of a set of full n-dimensional Lebesgue measure whose complementary has zero and dimensional Lebesgue measure on which Lebeck measure on which I can control the regularity of minimizer by means of the regularity of f. Precisely, if f is in Lm1, then the gradient is continuous on omega u. While if f belongs to some L D larger than N, then I can prove that the gradient is locally under continuous on omega U. Of course, all this happens on the regular set. Okay, I think that I finished. I leave you with some references. Many thanks. Some references. Many thanks. Thank you very much for your great talk. Questions, comments, please? Any questions or comments? Maybe just one question. So everything here was put in the scalar framework, right? Yes. Right? Yes. Except for the quasi-convex. Of course. Yes. But so I got the impression that you also had some result maybe for radial insequence in the vectorial. Yes, yes, yes. The matter is the same provided that you have radial structure, of course. Yes. So I have another question. So that you might help me with, or someone else, another participant might be able to say something. Might be able to say something. Imagine that you replace the Euclidean norm in this radial structure with a p-norm. P is not true. So you are thinking to something non-local. No, no, just the p-norm. Just think in terms of that you replace the Euclidean norm by the p-norm. I mean, I'm not saying that we should replace it by something very violent and general, just the p-norm, say p equals to 4. So it's not a Euclidean. So, it's not a Euclidean norm anymore. And also, Choice Dogs has some nice works, but he always assumes some kind of quadratic form, which is essentially like Euclidean norm. So, I never saw any works in the vectorial case where you replace the Euclidean norm with some other nice norm, say the four norm. Okay, so you're essentially want to replace the modulus, which is the square root. Replace the modulus, which is the square root of whatever it is, with another power. Yeah, yeah, with the phonon. Yes, no, no, it should be doable, but I mean, the proof is not that straightforward to modify. At least I couldn't do it. Yes, I think you're right, because it becomes there an issue, more more a technical issue in how to. Technical issue in how to, in a sense, recover catchopol inequality of the type that Lisa showed, right? This grandstand trick and so on. Yeah, there are some issues. I mean, okay. Definitely, definitely. But maybe changing this function, something could be done because the conditions on the ellipticity ratio wouldn't change, right? I mean, the balance would be more or less the same. So, yes, I believe that something can be done. So yes, I I believe that something can be done in this direction. Yes. That's yeah, okay. Yeah, that was also my impression, but it's not that straightforward, I think. Yes, yes, and no, but I totally agree, yes. Thank you. Thank you very much. Any other questions, comments? If not, let us thank the speaker again. And we will meet in about Will meet in about 10 minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Okay.
