And so particularly elegant your position of sine manifolds is as a set of affine complex manifolds. So a particular complex manifold is fine if it emits a proper holomorphic embedding into some sufficiently large complex embedding space. Okay. So maybe as a picture, what comes from the Picture becomes closer than that. So here we have a picture of some wild-like looking complex manifold M sitting in some large complex affiliate space. And the first thing to notice is if it begins to set M here, then when we take the map of Wars functions, the square of the distance from a point. The square of the distance from a point, then generically almost any choice of p, we'll get a nice Morse function. So automatically we get a nice class of Morse functions, and these functions have certain properties, in particular, they read J from FX. So here J is the seriously almost complex structure coming from the underlying complex structure. And again, here there's another sort of more analytic. Condition, which is going to involve some form being positive. But there's another sort of more geometric implication we can have, this notion of J convexity, which is that this condition on the function, the Morse function, is equivalent to being summarized on all J-hommoritic curves through a given point. You can sort of certify, test your function, whether or not it has this condition of J-complexity, depending on whether it's a function on your J1. On gambling curves. But there's another sort of more geometric, or at least for me as a lower-dimensional person feeling perspective, which is if you instead look at the actual level sets of the function, then we know that away from critical points, well, what we'll have is on the level sets of this function, we'll have contact structures, which are confused by the field of complex potential lines. This is where we get to see contact geometry popping up into the picture. So continuing this, we have another characterization of it, especially through JPEG speed. So now working with sort of the world of Morse functions and no longer intrinsically thinking about it as being implemented necessarily, but now just. Intended necessarily, but now just abstractly the existence of an exhausting Morse job function. We're going to get exhausting, exhausting is going to be embedded upper and bounded below. So if you read the nice book, I think it's all science. Nice book called Sein Spaces and their Mappings. There's a discussion of sort of there's a moral here that Sein manifolds are special and that analytic problems and spine manifolds emit analytic solutions as long as there are no topological obstructions. For some reason, I'm reminded of a statement that I heard that any administrative problem you have Administrative problem you have in academia, we have the benefit of any administrative problem you have eventually goes away if you ignore it for long enough. And that's true as long as you include your actual job as an existence of your job as a responsibility. And this statement reminds me of that. It's the sleeping statement, analytic problems on significant volumes and the analytic solutions, as long as there's not a basic pop-up instruction. Top-up instruction. But what about the existence of the time mantle itself? What about the basic input? Well, indeed, the statement is true in a more suitable sense, but Eliopsburg's principles say that indeed the existence of a time structure at all we're working with exists as long as there's no topological obstruction. Okay, so what is that statement? So let m be an almost complex 2n manifold and To n manifold. And for this first part of the talk, we're going to have to be delicate when we're talking about dimensions 4 versus greater than 4. So here this is just referred to even dimensional manifolds that are not four dimensional. By theorem, says that your almost complex manifold can be turned into a sign manifold with a sine structure homotopic to your initial almost complex structure. Almost complex structure, if and only if M has an exhausting borse function whose critical points have indexed at most n, half the dimension of the manifold. So again, just reminding you exhausting these properties down in the load. And part of what I'll try to be setting up a little bit towards what we'll talk about later, is that there's also an Andrean version of this, which is So that's going to say that an open subset of your complex manifold, that that's going to be smoothly is topic to a defined open subset, which you can think of being some sort of appropriately convex subset, if not only if it admits of exhausting more functions, whose critical points have the proper index. So the ambient version statement holds as well. Okay, so we will get to n equals to 2, and because that's actually where we're going to try to spend the most time. And in that situation, what we need to provide is some extra sort of framing conditions to be satisfied associated with the curved points of index n equals 2, in particular, associated ability of the techniques and behind this. Please do make sure to um ah great. So one thing before we move into just the top-level perspective, I do just want to mention, you know, if it's uh early in the morning, beginning of the week, maybe we want to start off for a formup. It's wh where is this condition of Where is this condition of index less than or equal to n and half the dimensional dimension coming from? It's really an inclination of a maximum modulus principle. So in particular, we said one way to think about this geometric way is we said that being J convex was going to be equivalent to being subharmodic on J hollow curves. And so what you can imagine is, well suppose I had a critical. is, well, suppose I had a critical point of my Morris function, which had index greater than n, so n plus 1 or greater. Now, as a subspace of the total tangent space, it has greater than half the total dimension. And so if you take that tangent space, I'm sorry, not it, what I meant to say is if we're looking at finite has index greater than n, the negative definite, this is the subspace, it's based on which the hash. This is a subspace. It's based on which the Hessian of the function, negative definite, will be strictly greater than half dimensional. So if you rotate it by j, it'll have to intersect itself in a positive dimensional subset, and so there'll have to be some complex tangent line that is in that negative definite space. But that means that when you restrict your Morse function to that negative space, you could choose a homogeneous curve through it which is exhibiting. Through it, which is exhibiting the tangent minus complex tangent vector, and therefore get a local max on your homework curve. So we're just getting the maximum modulus principle to determine the index or the Ramblin' index. Okay. So obviously there's a lot of geometry and topology to unpack from the Morse functions. And what I wanted to do now for the next little bit is talk. Now for the next little bit is talk about how to turn course functions, which a lot of data, you know, drive content out of data in some sense, versus something more commentatorial, particular handling compositions. What we have here is a schematic of some pair of pads, some two-dimensional surface, some worse function. And on the left, we're seeing there's some lines where There are some lines to indicate the gradient low lines. There's a red subset, which is going to be our critical level set right in the middle. And then we have the regular level sets at top and bottom at the regular values, c plus epsilon and c minus epsilon. And so standard results from Morse theory tell us that if we have some worse function, or a space of spoof function, Function, or just basic food function, and it has a critical L set with a unique non-congenitive critical point, and the index, so again, dimension of the negative definite subspace for subspace of which with definite. Then the sub-level set, so everything just up until just before the critical level set, if we vote past the critical point, sorry, the critical level set, then that will have the effect. Then that will have the effect of adding a K handle. Where a K handle is just, an n-dimensional K-handle is just a copy of a thickened, an n-dimensional disk separated to a K-dimensional disk, cross-width, and N minus K complementary disc. So we should really think about these as thickenings of cells. In particular, we're really thinking about the decay cross the point, the origin inside of the second factor. Inside of the second factor as sort of a core cell, and then we're thickening it to the upper dimension. And the equivalence between these two worlds, working with Morse functions and counting compositions, is sort of easy to take for granted. Easy to sort of take for granted, but it is just worth staring at this picture for a moment. Because what we're saying is. Because what we're saying is this space on the left is, in some appropriate sense, equivalent to the space on the right, which is just cutting off the 40th critical level set and attaching, in this case, an index one, equivalent index one, having a two-dimensional one handle. And so this, what precisely the equivalence is, in terms of flattening out, in some sense, the flow lines is non-trivial and does lead to. Trivial and does lead to some delicate, you know, some subtlety, especially multi-centuries in the case of infinitely many critical points. But nonetheless, there we go. Let's look some more at handles. So just to get us internalizing these in a way that's going to be useful. In a way, it's going to be useful. Here's a three-dimensional cartoonish version of a zero handle, a one-handle, and a two-handle. What's a three-dimensional zero handle going to be? It's going to be a V0 cross V3. And so that's just going to be, I think, Paul, V1 cross V2 for one handle. And I might as well go ahead and bring up the second part, actually ball here. And then the two-handle, three-dimensional disk, technically one-dimensionally. Three-dimensional disc one-dimensionally. And part of the key thing when we're thinking about these is obviously if you're just looking at these, you know, we're supposed to see these as the same types of objects. The question is, how are we identifying their boundaries, more divided up? So here's our attaching regions. I've played with the pictures of the handles in order to emphasize how we should think about these being attached. So a A zero handle of any dimension, both its attaching region and the boundary of the first factor is just a point, so the boundary of that is the empty set. So our zero handles are the unique handles that attach nothing. For our one-dimensional handles, we have the attaching regions being zero-dimensional spheres, so a pair of points across a two-dimensional disk. And so these in general are going to be pairs of n-dimensional disks. n-dimensional disks that we're sticking down into our boundary of our lower dimensional boundary of the sub-local set or sub-handle body and joining them by this loop. And then for two handle here, we're seeing that the attaching region, at least in the three-dimensional case, should be an S1 cross an interval, so just an annulus. And we'll mainly think about higher dimensions, but just to sort of repeat. But just to sort of be getting a feel for what we're doing here, immediately we can note a couple things. For example, it's clear that the generators of Pi 1 are going to be contributed by one handles. The loops are going to join, or formed by loops which will be passing alongside these one handles. And we can see that the attaching regions of two handles can swallow up and kill curves that have not been switching. I have a copy and source and those are going to be used for later. So I'm not going to expect people who aren't used to working with diagrams of paleo compositions to internalize this on the fly. But what I do want to do is give some feel for how when we're using uh an expression. Name and express and evolve this way. And so now, jumping up to four dimensions, of course, the simplest thing we can do after having just a zero handle would be a zero handle and a one handle. And in this case, the attaching region is going to be a S0 cross P3, sort of a pair of three walls. And these will be identified. We no longer can see the sort of workable that joins them, but even though I'm not there in person, I found out that the And I found out that the spring snail is an endangered species that you guys have trouble looking out for. And fortunately, it can help us see how this will travel over the spheres and identify their boundaries through a mirror through the goal. I I think it's a spring snail. Is it? I'm not a um etymologist. So as we're sort of thinking through what the solids are, one thing I want to notice is that you can reduce the data that you cracked out to some extent. Of data that you cracked out to some extent. So instead of thinking about the entire caching region and embedding that entire n-dimensional region, what you really need to know is where does the core, essentially the boundary of the cell part of the first k-factor, is going, where is that going? And then how do I kick in it? So we really need to know where is this sphere going, this k-1-dimensional sphere, and what data do we need in order to specify? Do we need in order to specify how we're going to extend that value of that sphere across a n-k-dimensional disk? And in general, that's going to have a natural action by the certain Johnny group or the Aunt group on it to change these framing data once you have a fixed one. And again, we won't really need to get fussy with that, but this will matter when we're thinking about what goes into the polychromatics construction. So just a few more examples just to start to illustrate the flavor of things. So here, sticking in four dimensions, just 0, 1, and 2 handles, because we're aiming to put spine manifolds, we don't think about higher dimensional handles. In the first example, A, this is a familiar manifold. In fact, this is. This is a familiar handle. In fact, this is SQ prop V2. What is this picture telling me to do? This is representing a two-handled attaching sphere. So that should be the boundary of V2, so it should be S1. And so I need to tell you both where my S1 should go. And in this case, the underlying assumption is that by drawing it in the plane, we want it to be attached to the boundary of the four wall. And then this integer here is going to tell us. And then this integer here is going to tell us the framing data. So we're having some frames before in this context. In general, just by looking at the relevant remote groups here, we're going to see that for two handles. For what's called two handles, there's going to be integers worth of framings. And when you're in theorem in general, when you have a multomologous, not responsive surface, there will be. Surface, there will be a not quite identified zero framing once you have a choice of normal surface. So, in this case, the other thing to point out is, and I'll try to emphasize this later, we should think about this framing data as also controlling the self-intersection of the surface that we get by taking, for example, a surface bounded by this, let's say, this disk, and capping off with a core B2 cross. Core E2 cross zero of the two handle. And so this framing data is precisely giving us an Euler number for this neighborhood bundle, basically, or the bundle for the neighborhood. And so here we see that in fact, it's like a trivial product. What's going on in part B, again, you don't need to parse the entire thing, but one thing I want to point out is here we have some tube handle which is traveling once. Handle, which is traveling once, much like a snail, over the one handle, and the fact that it intersects geometrically once would mean it can cancel the pair of handles. So, indeed, that's a sort of artificially complicated little diagram that could be reduced. What's going on in cup C, something a bit more interesting than what was going on in A, but the same principle. In general, these are useful classes of manifolds when we take a two-handle attached to the fourth ball, all these not forces, and we can choose whatever integer framing we want. Choose whatever integer framing we want and get a format for the boundary of being surgery and so not. Here is the highest point of view surgery on the right-hand treboil. Okay, and then the only reason I'm drawing this diagram is that this is an example of where you can get an interesting metaphor that's contractible, even though it's far from being. You know, it's far from being, let's say, the poor model or a familiar animal. So here we can check that it's correctable by saying, using what we were saying before, the generators are going to be determined by the one handle, so there's one generator. They're going to be over later, given by a two-handle, there's one two-handle. And we can see that this two-handle is homotopic to being a curve which goes over the one handle exactly one time. Because after homotopy, you can pass this strands through each other to undo that class. Other to under that class. And so this will be simply connected and won't have any I have multiple groups and anything built to white edge really indeed trackable. So this is well I'm going to pause my just for a second, but this is just, again, just give a flavor of what kinds of things we want to be able to see in theory from HLP composition. Okay, so what happens to the geometry? Oh, actually, no geometry yet. I forgot if you have to eat our vegetables. So a couple more constraints, especially want to think about infinite setting. So we're going to require handle bodies to be locally finite. So it's only finitely many handles attached to a given handle, and more scored. So k handles have to be attached to sub-handle bodies whose Whose handles have no higher or have index really less than the gateway handle? So these are just some minus conditions, and these can be achieved easily when you have a finite type sign, or sorry, handle by decomposition. But if you have infinitely many handles, this can actually become non-trivial. So for example, one of the basic principles is that you'll have to have infinitely many zero handles if you want to have infinitely many handles. If you want to have infinitely handles in general, if we had infinitely many manifold point handles attached to some of these zero handle here, we can see we're going to converge and get a non-manifold point. So the fix is to allow us to have ourselves to still have infinite genus, for example, but we need to increase the number of zero angles as well. So, um, a few more bookkeeping things to think about while we're thinking about handling compositions. Uh one of the things that's nice about this perspective is that we get natural CW complexes inside of our manifolds. In particular, by assuming this Morse ordering, we can make sure that you can extend the cells, or sorry, the core cells of the Or sorry, the core cells of these handles down further into the lower dimensional handles and produce the natural CW complex. So here are the cores of standard piece of solid core. And I want to point out that these are typically very singular. Even if you have a very nice manifold, the complex, which cares its homotopy type and that basic information, will generally be fairly non-regular. So here's another example going back to not. So here's another example, going back to knock traces. Here we have a schematic depicting the four wall and a two handle, D2 cross V2, attached to the truck oil. And that's what happens. You just pick it on and it turns into a perval. And inside there, there's a natural piecewise linear two-sphere, which is formed by a core disc inside the two-handle BQ cross zero, inside Bq cross V2, and just the And just the cone on the attaching sphere, which naturally flows down to the core point inside the zero handle. And this will be true in general. If I take a single zero handle and a collection of two handles, I'll always have this unbelievable complex, which is made of wedge of spheres with some. spheres but some uh not a link to scalaries so back to the geometry what's going on there so in this picture uh if we were to go all the way back to jconvex functions there we can use the force theory extract the natural handle decompositions and in those cases the geometry of course that hoards which in this case will Which case will be the critical points and or descending manifolds to be totally real. So no complex change of lines. Think about this is going to force the core disks and their attaching series to be isotrophic for the natural symplectic and contact structures, respectively. So we said that the regular level sets of this sine manifold are going to be contact manifold hypersurfaces and overhead and the symplectic structure and the Structure and the decent manifolds which essentially form these cores of these samples are going to be totally valuable to data isotopes. So one thing we immediately noticed that sort of is in line with noticing the extra subtlety for top initial handles, at least in that mention before, is that the attaching spheres will have to be logometrient. And so, in a offensively short summary, what's going on in Iasberg's work, establishing the result at the beginning, you need to show that you can modify, if I have some example that I modify with a sign structure, and I have some worse function which has no topological obstruction, so it has the correct indices. Obstruction so it has the correct indices. I want to show that I can modify it, modify the attaching spheres, reassociate canopy composition, modify the geometry and extent of J-convex function, adapt it to an almost complex structure, homotopic for initial one, and extend it over the handles inductively. And so that's a fundamental challenge. Output transcript. And so that's the fundamental challenge, that extension problem. But the conclusion is that the instructions are topological, at least in high dimensions. So for a second, before we move into core dimensions for the rest of the time, I'm just saying there's questions about the basic setup. Okay. So, so what's going on to mention 4? Well, there we have analogous theory, but with pretty much the subtlety. Particularly I've shot that, according to format X, I guess we'd say almost complex format of X, it's a sine structure that economically fits. X is diffomorphic. Only if X is diffomorphic to interior handle bodies coherent, why do we distinguish from the fact that our sign angles are those both be open, but our handle bodies are naturally packed, or at least they're finitely packed. And so you have a proper index. This should also say we don't need to say all the multiple buttons. And each two handle is fooded along the Legendrean, so that's our appropriately isentropic atmosphere. Appropriately isotropic attachment sphere. And there's this framing condition that the information for extending from the attachment sphere to the attaching region, that framing is associated with the contact framing minus one. So here's a figure sort of borrowed and then tricked out from the JavaScript. So here's not a very interesting knot, the unknown, but we have it. We have the standard front projection on one side, and then the double transverse projector on the bottom. And so when we want to think about what is going on with this frame, we're going to look for, in the case of S3, we can simply push off in a direction that is normal to be, or negative to be, I'll say, possibly transverse. Say positively transverse to the contact planes. And in this case, because we're working with a standard contact structure, we can just take out the vertical direction. And with these oriented, whenever we have a homologous not for grading for match identified with C. And so what's this identification with C? It's basically telling us how many copies Copies, how many points of copies of the meridian going on is the push-off when they're doing homology. So here we take a push-off, and then we sort of ice cope a little bit simpler. And now we can see here, here's the copy.pushoff, and this is, with orientation, minus one copies of the origin. So it goes around once, but it goes around with the orientation that's opposite of each way handling. So in this case, we'll see that the contact framing is going to be minus one, and so the best we could do about Haddish Steinhandle here is framing negative two or less for all stabilizers. So part of the benefit of this context is that in working with a standard context structure on S3, we have such a simple diagrammatic way to express this frame. So under the not that application of the C. Under the identification we could see that we can use because this sort of is my theory about any quality class. We see that we can identify the contact timing, there's an identity number, which is just to be computed by the weight or the projection, which is, which is going to be the number of positive crossing plus the negative crossing, and minus the number of weight classes. So if we check it combinatorially, we see that again we get T equals. You can see that again, we got t equals minus 1, of course, the third one. So now that the basic structure laid out, part of what Knopf did in the 90s was to flesh out a diagrammatic and handle-theoretic framework for all these instructions, which really opens the door to building lots of explicit examples. Through lots of explicit examples. So, this requires some precision that I will mostly sweep under the rug, but one handle should still be attached along S0 across D3s, but now you have to take some care with what the precise contact structure on those regions are. And so there's a particular choice of sphere associated with what type of characteristic correlation we want induced by the contact structure. Correlation we want induced by the contact structure. But again, sort of isolating things in this position is not obstructed. And then for two handles, in order to have a theory that maintains the counteratorial formulas for the production number, rotation number, and these quantities, their analogs outside of S3, you want to assume things are in a standard position. Assume things are in a standard position. So the handles are all of the outermost horizontal edges, and all of the two handles are attached along the dropping curves that have a format shown here. And so if we do this, then we get reply LIS for some instructions and get some shine formatable. So, part of the shifting now more towards applications, part of the power of this framework is not only do you get a lot of explicit constructions and examples of stein manifolds, but you also can compute their basic invariance, which can have some sweeping applications. So, in particular, the first Turing class is determined by the generalization of classical objective variance application number. Invariance rotation number. And so, again, to stick with this sort of simple world of just taking a two-handle and attaching it to the four-ball to get not trace, we said before that in this case, there's a natural PL2 sphere and D that generates the second homology. And so if I want to understand what the churn class is, I just need to say what value it takes when I evaluate it on a generator of H2. And so in this simple setting of just a formal. Simple setting of just a 4-volt of a 2-handle, the parent cost valuation is simply the rotation number of the link. And I'll mention the while I'll say it now. In order to make sense of this, we need this to be oriented. And that also makes sense because in order to actually have a true generator of H2, we need to be working with an oriented surface, so we're going to have a natural orientation on our knot, which is the attachment sphere. So we have some orientation. Here. So we have some oriented Legendre and now at L. And here we've taken a picture of it from before. And what we've drawn is the tangent vectors to the curve with orientation. And now we've done two things. We've sort of thought about what the implication is in the front projection. If we follow these around, the projection is basically pointing up here and down here. And then in the projection to the xy plane, we can see Can see the relative rotation of these arrows. And the rotation number is going to give us the relative winding number of the tangent vector to a vector field, which gives us a section of this contact plane as a sample of realization. And so in this case, we can just take. And so in this case, we can just take that to be the dpy direction. And combinatorially, translating back to the up direction, the rotation number is just expressed as one half number of down costs minus the up number of upcasts. So in this case, we say the rotation number here is zero. So part of the reason why you'd want to know information like the turn class of X is to start to understand, for example, the associated constraints on complex curves or smooth surfaces in your animal. So what's the adjunction inequality? Well, this takes root in the classical adjunction formula, which says that the turn class of a complex surface is going to determine the genus of any non-singular connected. Genus of any non-singular connected complex curve in your complex surface. So two times the genus minus two is going to be the self-intersection as a homology class. This is smooth, it's not singular, it doesn't have intrinsic self-intersection, but this is whatever it's probable minus the evaluation class on the Polygon platform. And so while this is an equality here, if the junction of pinequality is going to say that if x is a quarter-dension stein hole, then surfaces are going to satisfy the version of this as a pinequality. So in the sense that complex curves are going to be sort of efficient, there's a minimal genus here, and it's the best you can do. So if the sigma x is a four-dimensional Stein manifold, and sigma and x is a close. And sigma x is a closed, connected, oriented, smoothly embedded surface, then twice in genus minus 2 is at least founded below by this self-intersection of the square of the surface minus the absolute value of the turn cost evaluation. And that's true unless a milk model is too spherical. Or I guess. Perhaps I should say there are anything careful in it for negative self-intersection, it must be positive genus. Okay. So how does this work? One of the nice properties about sign domains is that here I should say I switched up my terminology into here. I'm really I'm really starting to segue into thinking about compact versus finite manifold. So, this is going to be true for phinotype manifolds. Well, I guess the special truth. But what's the idea? If it was a compact time manifold, or if we had only to consider a surface, which is going to lie in some compact subduction domain, then not only can you size surface highly fed into the. where you can appeal to the huge option inequality proving that complex rate common. So really the key inputs into this theorem are means really the embedding construction, the hammer which gives us the genus of constraint reliable. Because the genus plays a lot of great generality. So some applications, immediate applications of the adjunction equality, one is that through cross R2, this emits a complex structure that's just apparent because it's a one across C, but it does. A simple one across C, but it does admit a Stein structure. So we're really seeing the difference here between Stein and this complex in the way that convexity plays into that. Why is that? Well, just because S2 cross a point is going to be homologically essential. It's going to generate H2, but it is going to have squared zero. And here's a different direction of our application. So here we have a Legendre Nat, which is the Did not, which is the white-headed double, so you can tell it sort of looks like a trek oil, but doubled up and with the little glass. And it's the genuine white double, the right-handed trek oil. And the deprecation that we want to make note of is that the adjunction inequality implies that this cannot found a smooth slice as before. So you remember from the pictures before that you can always bound a linear disk just by picking from But in this case, you can't smooth that out. And so, what's the proof there? Well, the point is that the photo-vacing number, if we check this, is 1. And so that's going to tell us that if we attach a two-handle with framing less than 1 minus 1, so start with less than 1, or less or to 1 minus 1, so 0 or less, then we can. So, zero or less, that we can get this fine structure. In particular, if we have a commandle with zero framing, it'll be a spine structure. And therefore, it can't contain a smooth two-sphere of square zero. I should say that's homologically essential. And indeed, that means it would generate H2 because it is homologous to Yellow Speed, which was the CDOT complex, which was period on the topic. So what I want to do is I'll leave. Let's see. I'm going to leave this out for a second. I'm not thinking you just. But I'm going to pause for a second and switch my tablet so I'm going to finish the application I have in mind on there. But while I'm doing so, I'll maybe miss this opportunity if there's any questions I want to. What's your favorite Stein manifold? My favorite one? It's a huge question. I think my favorite spinning of both is uh I'm gonna call the I'm just gonna be able to know the right thing I would say it's that's the minus two tricks and yeah but but maybe it's actually the one workable yeah or the one we're actually looking at right now or the feed um over um Double check that original enough if I'm wrong about assumptions that this is but wrong just take the thing out like I made default. So the claim that I want to just wrap up with Is that this eigenvalue can be used to construct exotic to construct your own hardcore? So claim proven, but there exists exonic, smooth rooms on our board. On our port. And so, how do we use what we've already seen so far to prove this? So, here's the idea. The first thing is a sort of observation, which is that The zero frame trace of an off smoothly effectively topologically by which I mean By which I mean fiercely and locally flatly. In R chord, if and only if K bounds smooth, secondly topological place disk. So let's say a disk, we can define a place disk. And what's the very, very quick sketch? Well, the point is that if I have some not K and I put it inside of S3, it bounds four ball on top and four ball on the bottom to give me altogether S4. Well then, writing this Well then, writing this very puncture little point to get R chord, then now in one direction, if I do bound this like this, the idea is just to say that I can thicken this up. If I have a spoon embedding or a topologically locally flat embedding, I can thicken this up into Up into a two-handle. And in that case, what I've done is I take the lower copy, the four ball, and add on this d2 cross d2 that's attached along k. I get my copy of my not traceable x. My not trace, I'll call it x, 0k, just venues. And alternatively, if my not trace does embed, so that's one direction, this direction. The forward direction, well, if we have our not trace, then we said before that there's this natural two-sphere that sits in there. Sits in there. And so if this embeds into R4, then what that just means is we can just learn these lines to say this is sitting out inside of our core. And now we can just look at a small ball around that singular point. Singular point, we said that that's going to be the conon K. And so what's in the complement of it is going to be, it's a little bit poorly drawn, but that's going to be a slice of disc per k. Okay, so that's just a painfully brief sketch of why this limit is true. But the combination of this with This with the adjunct equality, well, and premise zero, give us the exotic R4s. So I'll just quickly now sketch the construction exotic R4s so the the first thing is the first time. So the first step is that for simplicity, I'll just say the wipe at double, by which I really mean the zero twisted wipe at double of any knob bounds a topological disk in the core. In D4. That's algorithmic freedom. So that implies that the zero trace of the wave head double of the trefoil that's topologically Narfour. So in this Okay. So in this sketch above, I was headed up not whether I was in the smooth or topological category. So this searchable and topological category, so now we've got a copy of our not trace. Into our form. Now, we know that that embedding can be smooth because if it was smooth, then I would have to be smoothly sliced by the lemon fog. So, this embedding is continuous but not smooth. But nonetheless, that doesn't stop us from building a nice smooth manifold. So, work with. Manifold. So, work with Win implies that in generality, appropriate open four manifold. In this case, I'll simply say Paul referred to this. Sorry to say I'm a little overrupt, but for the sake of time, I'm trying to be pretty cool. R core minus the interior of this embedding of this knot trace. Because now there is window IOTA X. It means a smooth structure. So indeed, really the point here is that open four manifolds are smooth. So it's a smooth structure. It's a simple structure. And to describe some details from the book, this system structure is unique along the boundary of x. It has to be basically pre-manifold across the small interval. And so to find a new summary manifold To be R4 minus the interior of this quinn smooth structure, the actual fluid The actual smooth structure defined intrinsically on the knot base. And so what's the point here? We said that this not trace, because the not was not slice, couldn't embed it in R4 smoothly. So what we're going to do is take the region that it mapped onto and just Get math onto, and just define the spoon structure to be the spoon structures we get from the natural handling composition coming from one to your handle and one to handle. And then when this work says we can extend it to the rest of our core, and so we get some smooth core manifold, we haven't changed our topological space, it's still our core, and so we've gotten some smooth structure on our core which contains this knot, this not trace smoothly, but it contains. not trace smoothly. But if it contains a snot trace smoothly, then it can't be regular or this. It's not a snap slice. So I'll wrap it there and thanks guys. Questions for Kyle?
