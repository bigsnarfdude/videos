Okay, well, thank you very much for the invitation and for putting together this very nice workshop. And so, as announced, I want to talk today about the joint work with David Jerrison and Erik Shagulian about global minimizers to the so-called one-phase free boundary problem. And well, given the brevity of the talk, Well, given the brevity of the talk and the fact that I'm one of the last speakers, so my audience is a little tired, I'll try not to go too much into the technical details, but mostly say something about the background literature and how our result fits in all of that. Okay, so first of all, I'm going to remind everybody or tell everybody what is the one face or sometimes called also the Bernoulli. Sometimes called also the Bernoulli free boundary problem. It arises from the minimization of an energy functional, here it is, and which has here the gradient of u squared, the integral of the gradient of u squared, and then the measure of the set where the function is strictly positive. And we are looking at minimizers which are greater or equal than zero, and that's why I refer to this as a Why I refer to this as a one-phase problem. And known in the mathematical physics, it was first investigated mathematically, systematically in the pioneer work of Alten Caffarelli at the beginning of the 80s. And so to see that really this minimization generates what we call a free boundary problem, of course we want to write the Euler-Lagrange equation associated. Range equation associated to it. And you know, if we do our homework, this is, let me choose another color here to highlight. So, this is the problem that we obtain. Our function has to be harmonic in the set where it is strictly positive, as expected. And on the free boundary of this unknown set, that on the boundary of this unknown set, that for that reason is called the free boundary, we have a Free boundary, we have a side condition, the Bernoulli condition, which tells us that the gradient of u has to be constant, has to be one. Now, of course, we could look also directly at this free boundary problem, not necessarily from the variational point of view. So think about the notion of weak or viscosity solutions to this problem. And this was done by Caffarelli in three beautiful. Three beautiful papers, which really opened the way for a very wide literature on these and related problems, so breakthrough work of Caffarelli on this problem. Now, whenever we have a free boundary problem, what are the questions that we want to answer? Well, clearly, this is a weak formulation. U is in it's just a weak function. It's just a weak function, a weak solution. So, how good can it be? How regular can the function u is? Clearly, in the set where it is positive, it's as good as it gets according to the PDE that governs the free boundary problem, but across omega, in the whole omega, so what's the regularity, the best regularity for you? And then, from a first glance at the equations, we realize that the best thing that can happen is. That the best thing that can happen is that the function u is leaped is continuous, given that we have a jump in the gradient across the free boundary. So that's exactly the case. So this is the first question that we want to address, the regularity, which is rather easy to get in this one-phase problem, although things are more complicated once we allow the function u to change sign, but that's a different. New to change sign, but that's a different story. And I also want to mention a property of minimizers, which we refer to as non-degeneracy. Somehow, that's the distinguishing property between being minimizers and being a discosined solution. And that's why minimizers are somewhat better behaved than discosing solutions. And together, basically, these two properties tell us that the function. Properties tell us that the function u is really comparable to the distance to the boundary, to the free boundary. And this is a property which is important when we ask the really difficult question about the regularity of the free boundary. Clearly, if I go back to the previous slides, I'm writing that the gradient of U has to be one on the free boundary, but then this is only Free boundary, but then this is only satisfied in some discourse in this sense. But the true question is: how nice is this free boundary? Is it nice enough that the free boundary condition can be understood in a really point-wise sense? For instance, in this case, I would like the free boundary to be C1 alpha, and then by standard elliptic theory, I would get that the free boundary condition is satisfied in a point-wise sense. So the real big question in the free boundary big question in the free boundary in many free boundary problems is the regularity of the free boundary sometimes the regularity of the functions itself is challenging already um and i have tried to summarize maybe i should use uh i've tried to summarize the what's known about the regularity of the free boundary in this yellow now pink box um and it's not all contained the result is not fully contained The result is not fully contained in the work of Alten Caffarelli, but contributions of many authors led to this regularity results, and I'm going to try to say something about it. So the free boundary is nice, it's analytic outside the singular set, which has Hausdorff dimension n minus five. So what are the tools which we need to prove such a regularity result? How do we investigate the regularity? Out, how do we investigate the regularity of the flip boundary? And you know, classically, we want to use some sort of blow-up analysis, which I'm going to explain in a second. And the key tool, I mean, for the blow-up analysis to somehow work and tell us some information about the free boundary of this one-phase problems are the flatness results, which I have in this other box. I have in this other box. So I have this condition here, which tells me that if the free boundary is flat, and I'm going to say in a second what I mean by flat, then automatically it's C1 alpha. And that's exactly the regularity that I said would be nice to get. Not only that, once that you actually get C one alpha regularity, you automatically get analyticity of the free bound. In this particular case, things are rather straightforward because Rather straightforward because once that you know that the free boundary is C1α, you can do a hodograph transform and change the problem into a fixed boundary problem, which is manageable. And you can somehow obtain the full regularity, analyticity of the free boundary for this one-phase problem right away. And otherwise, there is the whole theory developed by Hinder Lere and Nirenberg, and then also Hinder Lere, Niedemberg, and Sprague. Then also Hinder, Lerr, Niedenberg, and Sprague for two face problems. So, again, I owe you what it means to be flat, but I guess that pretty much the word says it all. So, what it means for the free boundary to be flat is means that you have two very close by parallel hyperplanes. So, you have a tiny strip, and you know that on one side of the strip your function is fully positive, and on the other side, your function is identically zero, and the free boundary is trapped in there. And the free boundary is trapped in there. And then, as long, let's see, as you know, this in the ball B1, as long as you go in the ball B1 half, you get C1α. So, this is like a very important result, which was already in the original paper of Alten Caffarelli that I mentioned before, and in the papers of Caffarelli about viscosity solutions, which I also already mentioned before. Now, that we have at our disposal this flatness results. Flatness results, we can see a little bit how the blow-up analysis works. Well, so we are lucky, of course, we want to exploit. What we want to exploit is the fact that our problem has a scaling invariance. So, we are going to take a point on the free boundary for convenience, just zero, and let's rescale in a Leach's fashion around that point. So, here is my rescale. And let's look at what happens as we take a family of. As we take a family of radii, a sequence of radii that goes to zero. And that's where the fact that my function is Litches continuous plays a role. So I can pass to the limit up to extracting a sub-sequence. And in the limit, I obtain something which I call the blow-up limit. And as expected, that something preserves the property of being a minimizer. So that's what I have. That's what I have on my second, on my third slide. So, I have now a global minimizer. So, what it means to be a global minimizer means that U0 minimizes the energy over every ball in RN among, of course, competitors with the same boundary, among competitors with the same boundary data. And so, the fact that U10 is just global is not too helpful in itself, but we Helpful in itself, but we have, in fact, again as expected, if you are familiar with these sorts of topics, we have a monotonicity formula that accompanies our problem, which is due to bias, a little bit end of the 90s or something like that. And this monotonicity formula guarantees that the blow-up limit, any blow-up limit, has to be homogeneous of degree one. So this means. One. So this means that now our blow-up solution, our blow-up global minimizer is also homogeneous of degree one. And so the job, our job, consists in classifying, if possible, all global minimizers which are homogeneous of degree one. So this is basically the heart of the matter when we use like a blow-up analysis. And of course, if I go back for a second. I go back for a second only to the problem, to the free boundary problem, and you think about a global solution, critical point. So, a solution for this problem, the first thing that comes to mind is just the plane XM plus, right? I mean, that clearly is harmonic in the set where it is positive and satisfies the free boundary condition. The question is whether that is the only possibility that we have. That we have. Okay. And indeed, this was proved in low dimensions, so in dimensions two, three, and four. It was shown that this is the only homogeneous global minimizer X10 plus. And this was known already in the work of Alton Caffarelli that into D there is nothing else. And then it was shown in three dimensions by Caffarelli-Jefferson Kennig. Mechanic and more recently by Jerryson and Savin in dimension four. So, while the paper of Caffarelli is pretty much in the 80s, Caffarelli, Gerison and Kenning 2000, Gerison and Savin maybe 2010 or something like that. So it's been a long way from the paper of Alten Caffarelli in order to establish that in low dimension, these are the only These are the only one homogeneous global medium. This is the only one homogeneous global minimizer. And now, so we were asking the question of the regularity of the free boundary, and I said that we want to carry on a blow-up analysis, and that in this blow-up analysis, the main role is going to be played by the flatness result. And now it's clear why the flatness results play an important. Play an important role because now we can go back. Now we know that the blow-up limit is as a free boundary which is plane, which is a hyperplane, and then through the flatness result, we can go back and we can conclude that our function u, that our energy minimizer u, as a smooth free boundary, as an analytic free boundary in dimension. And we can do this in dimensions two, three, and four. So in low dimension, one phase free boundary. One phase free boundaries, minimizing free boundaries have to be smooth. Okay, so what, so let's see, let's think with the next question then. What else is out there that we want to rule out, right? I mean, so this would be our favorite candidate if we like everything to be smooth, right? Otherwise, if we like to have singularity, this is not our favorite candidate, but if we like But if we like things to be smooth, this is our candidate. So the question is: what else is out there? I mean, what are we trying to rule out when we're proving smoothness? And so here I'm trying to describe a little bit what are the natural solutions that we want to consider, which are like this sort of Lawson cones, right? So I'm going to describe like the axisymmetric cone here, gamma, which xn smaller than a constant. x n smaller than a constant x prime, I can choose the constant in just in a unique way so that the function which is harmonic, the positive function which is harmonic in the cone and vanishes on the boundary of the cone is going to be homogeneous of degree one. And then by symmetry, it's also going to have constant normal derivative on the boundary, which is the same as saying that it's going to have constant normal of the gradient, norm of the gradient. So up to the normal So, up to renormalizing, up to dividing by the appropriate constant, we have obtained U0, which is exactly a global critical point of our free boundary problem. And the question is whether U0 is a minimizer or not. And so, that's exactly so. Already Altencaffarelli figured out, I mean, proved that this is not the case in 3D. And that's what happens. That's what happens in the paper of Caffarelli, Jerison, and Kennig that I mentioned before. They rule out this, that is like their worst enemy somehow, that in dimension smaller or equal than six, this is not a minimizer. And then a little bit later, we showed with David Jerrison that, in fact, in dimension seven, this does become a minimizer, making things more interesting. And of course, there are other candidates, right? I chose this particular axisymmetric cone. I mean, so we can construct several other types of Lawson cones. I mean, just basically the problem boils down to solving an ODE. I mean, and so that's there are possibly out there things which become minimizers before dimension seven. Before dimension seven, so it's not clear that this is necessarily the dimension where things somehow go wrong, if you want. But one little evidence that there is towards that, towards the fact that seven is possibly the best, the optimal dimension, is if we look at the notion of stability, right? So if we think a little bit, so what it means to be stable. So, what it means to be stable, so in this case, I mean, since this is in this case for this free boundary problem, usually what we do is we look at the second variation with respect to what we call domain variations. I see I didn't write that, but this is what's supposed to be, this is a domain variation deformation. And so we look at the second variation with respect to domain deformations, and we request that the capsule. And we request that at epsilon equal to zero, this is greater or equal than zero. And if you work out the detail in the case when u is a cone, for example, then you will obtain what we call a stability inequality. So for every smooth phi compactly supported, this is vector value, this is not, for every smooth phi compactly supported in you, we want. Compactly supported in you, we want this stability inequality to be satisfied. And so there is a paper of Hong which investigates all, but all is written in quotation marks, because it's not so easy to obtain explicitly all of them. So, all the ones which have been computed explicitly, they are all unstable. Explicitly, they are all unstable in dimensions smaller than six. So, if you want, at least this is a little bit more evidence towards the fact that this could be like the right optimal dimension. And in dimension seven, so there are, there is, of course, the one that I have just already described for you that will prove to be a minimizer. And then you can also, there is also another stable column that can be built. Let's say if I look at this two-dimensional picture and I need to add five more. Picture and I need to add five more dimensions, so I'm going to rotate four times around the t-axis and six and one dimension only around the s-axis, while our the axis symmetric one that I described before is five times around the t-axis. In any case, so let me uh say something else about stability, which is going to connect. So, this is all literally. Going to connect. So, this is all literature, a background, and things which were known. So, let me try to head towards the new result that we proved. I'll just drink a little water. And again, I'm going to connect again to the notion of stability. Okay, so of course, the notion of stability naturally, the way that I Naturally, the way that I defined it several slides back as something to do. I sometimes point with my hands at the screen and then I forget that you cannot really see what I'm pointing to. Sorry. So anyway, so it has something to do with the variational structure of the problem, right? So that's the notion of stability for a variational problem. But we can also think about stability. Think about stability of viscosity solution. We can also just think about the viscosity approach and then think about the notion of stability for our free boundary problem independent of the variational formulation. So what we would do in that case, rather than do a domain variation than domain deformation, then we would just add, just do vertical, so add to our solution u. Our solution perturbation epsilon w. And well, maybe we have to take the positive part because we are considering the one-phase case, which makes things a little bit more annoying. But anyway, morally speaking, I mean, we can think of looking at the linearized equation that has to be satisfied by w if we request that u plus epsilon w positive part is still a solution to our problem up to order. To our problem up to order epsilon, let's say. And so this would be the associated linearized equation. And we say that things are stable basically when this equation has a maximum principle, or equivalently, when there is a positive super solutions for this problem. And then, of course, if your problem also has a variational structure, which is our case, is the case of the one-phase problem. Is the case of the one-phase problem, the two notions of stability are equivalent. So, either thinking about satisfying the stability inequality or the validity of the maximum principle, it's the same thing, or the existence of a positive solution is the same thing. Now, why do I like this interpretation of stability? Because when I think that there is a maximum principle, then I think that Then I think that if I'm looking, so here I am in a region u where everything is nice. The function u is smooth, little u is smooth, so I'm in a region, compact region where my free boundary is smooth. I'm looking there. And so since there is, you know, there is a positive super solution and there is a maximum principle, I can imagine that basically I confoliate this neighborhood, this chunk, this neighborhood of my freebound. Neighborhood of my free boundary with actual critical points with solutions, with stable solutions. I mean, that's what the stability is really telling me. And this is a picture that, though I see locally, right, I see it away from the singularity because I'm looking at a region where everything is smooth. But also, I don't know what happens as my neighbor, if the neighborhood is very small, well, these are obvious things, but even the neighbor can be large. But what happens as the neighborhood gets larger? As the neighborhood gets larger and larger and larger, I mean, what's the picture in case I'm starting with a global minimizer of solution that it can be? So this is basically the question that we asked. I mean, so what's the global picture? I mean, can somehow can we foliate, I mean, can we foliate the space with energy minimizers, which are perturbation? Perturbation of a singular one, somehow, can we perturb away the singularity? And so, that's finally, I can finally state the theorem, which once again is in collaboration with David Jeris and Henrik Chavolien. So, we start with one of these one-homogeneous global solutions, global minimizers, which are smooth outside of the origin. So, one, the minimizer in seven dimensions, which I built with David. Seven dimensions, which I built with David, would be an example of this. And before I state the theorem, a little bit of just a tiny bit of notation. So these are always the dilations. So u sub t is always the Lich free scaling or dilations of u. And in the statement of the theorem, this gamma of ut is just a graph of ut. It just didn't fit everything in one page. So I have In one page. So I have this very brief slide with notation, and now I can tell you the theorem. So the theorem says what's to be expected from my talking. I can take your zero and I can trap it between two minimizers, your lower bar and your upper bar, your upper bar, which are a distance one from the origin. And the heart of the matter is that they are. matter is that they are smooth, the free boundaries. So these minimizers are analytic. And when I look at the graphs, so when I look at the graphs of all the dilations of both your upper bar and your lower bar, put them together, I'm foliating the full upper space. And I have some sort of uniqueness, meaning that if I have any other minimizer which is on top, obviously zero and does not coincide. Up of U0 and does not coincide with U0, then it's going to be one of this dilation, one of the guys, and same on the other side, obviously. Okay, so I still have time. So this is the theorem, but in reality, so the heart of the matter here, in order to prove analyticity, which is the hard part clearly, of the Clearly, of the free boundaries of your lower bar and your upper bar is we really want to understand once that we build these global minimizers, which are close to our U0, how close they are. I mean, we really want to understand how they approximate precisely U0. So, we need like a real asymptotic expansion. And so, in order to state the theorem with the asymptotic. State the theorem with the asymptotic expansion. I need just a tiny bit more notation background, something of this sort. So, once again, this is I'm working at this point. I also asked like another thing that's not a recording. Calculus of variations and partial definition. Calculator and V. Probably Camilo is hijacking my seminar. I think he's the one who's not muted. Thank you. Okay, so going back to the problem. So this is the linearized equation. So now this is the linearized equation where I'm working with this u0. Once again, u0 is global minimized mutinous of degree one is our single. Of degree one is our single with the singularity at the origins, not otherwise. So, this is the associated linearized equation which I mentioned before. And so, what do I want to do? I want to look at homogeneous solutions of this equation. So, I'm going to look at, I'm going to go to the next slide, and I'm going to look at solutions which look like I'm going to separate variables as to be expected, and there is Be expected, and there is the radial part x to the minus gamma, and then there is a d bar, the spherical part. And what happens? What do they have to satisfy? And so I have on one side the gamma for the radial part, it just boils down basically to a quadratic equation that has to be satisfied by gamma. And on the spherical side, I get basically this eigenvalue problem. Eigenvalue problem with a Neumann type boundary condition, and also we have a sign for this thing here, so that's important. I mean, so this is going to be a negative number. So since we are U0, we know that is a minimizer in particularly stable. So we want stability. We are looking at a lambda which is positive. We want to have Positive, we want to have the lambda as large as possible, which is going to force our basically having a first eigenfunction which is strictly positive, the lambda positive. And then for our gamma, we are going to have real roots because we want stability. And this, let's say, of course, they are real. Now they could coincide or they could be one bigger than the other one. The statement of the theorem just looks uglier. Of the theorem just looks uglier when they coincide. So it's not much, it's just technically more annoying. But so let's just focus on this. So this is your, so these objects here right now, they give us our positive model solutions to the linearized equation, call them V gamma plus, V gamma minus. So why are they important? Well, they are important because Because here is the main theorem, which is the one that then puts the analyticity of the free boundary, really. If, let's say that I have built already this U bar, and the way that I built U bar is such that when I dilate, the U bar T will approach U0 at infinity. So I've done that part. But now I want to know precisely how that happens, how they approach each other. So I look at the difference. Other. So I look at the difference between u bar and u zero, and I check what is the equation which is satisfied by them, by this v, by the difference. And the equation that is satisfied by the difference is not exactly obviously the linearized equation, but it's just a perturbation of the linearized equation, a small perturbation of the linearized equation, because we know that v is going to zero as x goes as absolute value of x goes to infinity. Absolute value of x goes to infinity. So, what I obtain is that when I look at this v, it looks pretty much like either v gamma plus or v gamma minus with an a positive, one of the two, and an error of order minus gamma plus minus alpha, plus or minus, minus alpha. So that's the precise asymptotic expansion that has to be satisfied by d. I'm looking at the Satisfied by D. I'm looking at the time. So, how much time do I still have? I lost track. Five more minutes? Yes, you do have five more minutes. Yeah, I'll wrap it up at five minutes, in five minutes. So, very well. So, once again, so let me, since I have only five minutes, I'm just gonna, so once again, this is the crucial important ingredient. Once that I can prove that, well, the difference as expected is going to satisfy. Is going to satisfy some sort of perturbation of the linearized equation. Once I can get the asymptotic function, that's what's going to help me obtain the regularity of the free boundary. Now, I have four minutes, so I owe you absolutely, I mean, this slide on the analogy between the theory of this one-phase problem and the minimal surface theory. So, even if you heard nothing ever about the one which I doubt with this. About the one which I doubt with this audience, about the one-phase free boundary problem, you might have recognized that all of the results which I mentioned, they have an analog in the theory of minimal surface, the flatness result of the Georgi, which the flatness result of Attencaffarelli, which parallels the one of the Georgi, the existence of the Simon's cone, which parallels almost because we don't know optimality of the dimension, but parallels the The singular minimizer that exists in dimension seven for this one phase. And so, also, this result which I just mentioned, this new result that we have with David and Henrik, parallels a result which is known for the theory of minimal services, a result of Hart and Simon. And the strategy, I would say, I mean, it's what the statement is just the same, just has to be formulated in the language. Formulated in the language of minimal surfaces, and the approach is also the same, I would say. There is another interesting result which I want to mention, which also parallels what happens in the case of minimal surface, which is the uniqueness of blow-ups at points where one blow-up is an isolated singularity, which in the case of minimal surface is a famous result of Leon Simon, and that in the case of the one In the case of the one-phase problem, it was obtained by Engelstin, Spolauer, and Velichkov. And actually, once we posted our paper on the archive, I heard from Max and the collaborators that they were also thinking about the Harth enzyme. And so they are expert in it. So that was unfortunate. So it's good when more people are interested in what you're doing. Interested in what you're doing, but in any case, so let's see if I can say I will mention since I have two more minutes and I have absolutely no time to tell you anything about the proof, I will mention something about critical points, right? What happens if now I'm looking at unstable critical points and I'm trying to build these families of inhomogeneous global solutions? So, this is related to the So, this is related to the quest for what are called exceptional domains. And so, I think it's important to mention this important result of Hausworth, Helen, and Packard in 2D, where they found this beautiful family of unstable critical points with which they can foliate the whole space. This sometimes we refer to this as Herpine solutions. So, I attempted a drawing here, and so there is a whole other. And so there is a whole other story about trying to classify to the grower critical points, and there are many other authors which are working in that direction while our interest was mostly on minimizers. And of course, I had like a few words on the proof, but I can absolutely stop it here and stay within the 35 minutes time limit. And that's for an It and that's for another time. I leave you rather than with a thank you, I leave you with a question mark on how we proved all of this. And I thank you verbally for your attention. Thank you very much, Daniela. Is there any question from the audience? Apparently, I guess I was painting by not going in the details of the proof. No, all right. Well, if no question, let me thank very much, Danila, for this very nice talk. You're welcome. And we then have a few minutes break. A few minutes break. We'll come back for the next
