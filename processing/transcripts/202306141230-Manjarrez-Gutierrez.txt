This is joint work with Ken Baker. And well, if you were here yesterday during his talk, he mentioned some of the concepts. I'm going to just remind you very quickly. So we are considering suture manifolds and well recall that this is an oriented connected tree manifold with the joint pair of surfaces. With this joint pair of surfaces in its boundary, so that the orientation of R plus is consistent with the orientation of the boundary of M and the other piece of the boundary, the orientation is reversed. And we have this other condition that the boundary of when you remove R plus and R minus is a collection of. remove R plus and R minus is a collection of annuli. So I'm just considering suture manifolds with annulite sutures. And well here are some examples and the notation I will be using. So well so the nice pictures you will see in my talk are due to Ken Baker and the not too beauty pictures are mine. So here is another thing that he mentioned is Another thing that he mentioned is a special well, it's a see the compression bodies as suture manifold. So we start with a compact surface and we add, well, we cross it with I and we add one handles. And so that is a compression body and we call the dualized compression body if we do the other construction. And so the handler. And so the handle number of these compression bodies is just the minimum number of one and zero handles you need or the two and three the two and three handles you need. And well, the Higger splitting of a suture manifold is obtained by taking the R plus piece of the Souture manifold at a bunch of one and zero handles. Of one and zero handles, and then a bunch of two and three handles, and you count those handles. Well, here is what is the handle number of the sutor manifold is given by taking the minimum of the handle numbers among all its possible Higger splittings. Another ingredient we need is what is a decomposing surface for a suture manifold. You just take an oriented properly embedded surface that intersects the Surface that intersects the annular suture in either circles or essential arcs. So, in some pictures, well, sometimes I'm calling the sutur just, like in this picture, the sutur is just the core of the annuli. Sometimes I draw the sutur annuli. So, when we have the composing surface, we can chop the manifold along that the composing. Along that the composing surface, and we get a new manifold that will inherit a suture structure. And we say that this manifold is obtained by suture manifold decomposition along S. So we are interested in a special decomposing surface, which are called product Ds and Which are called product dis and annuli, and product annuli. So the product dis is just a properly embedded disk that intersects the suture in two points and it's essential. And product annulus is an annulus is properly embedded so that the boundary, one boundary of the annulus lies in the R plus piece of the sutur manifold and the other lies in the R minus component. Well, here are some just definitions. What I mean by essential and annual and annulus, sorry, by product annulus or product is to be essential if they are not parallel to the suture, to the suture. And so if we have a decomposing surface that consists of product disk and product annually, we call that a product decomposing surface. Okay, so now what are the dots of a suture manifold? So, first, a reduced suture manifold is a suture manifold, which is not a product. So, a product suture manifold is just take a compact surface and cross it with I. And that is so a lot, a reduced manifold is not that. And also, that suture manifold does not contain any product or essential product disk or product. Sension product disk or product annulus. And okay, so when we have a product decomposition surface for a suture manifold, it's going to be known as reducing if it decomposes the suture manifold into probably a bunch of product suture manifolds and a reduced suture manifold. So that reduced suture manifold is what is Is what is known as the guts of the sutur manifold. So the guts can be seen as the maximal piece of the sutur manifold, which is not a product. Okay, so we have this other concept of this product decomposition to be minimal if it doesn't properly contain any other reducing product decomposition surface. So, for instance, in this picture, this is a Picture: This is a schematic picture of a suture manifold where the blue lines represent a product decomposition. So the labels with G are the dots of this decomposition, and the pieces labeled with P are the product pieces. Okay, okay, for instance, well, if we have a link in a If we have a link in a closed-oriented three-manifold, so it naturally inherits a suture, well, I mean, the exterior of a cipher surface has a natural suture manifold structure. And we call that the complementary, the exterior of that surface is called the complementary, like here, suture manifold of the cipher surface. And so the associated guts of that complementary suture manifold will be called the guts of the cipher surface. Well, we say that a product annulus of one of these minimal reducing product decomposition is isolated if the interior of any path in the sutram manifold from that annulus. From that annulus to the suture annulus intersects the gaps. So, for instance, in this picture, all these here, if they represent product annuli, all of them are isolated annuli. But this one is non-isolated. Okay. So we say that it goes to substitute manifold. That the gods of sutural manifold are non-isolating if the product decomposition surface does not contain any isolated anodes. And the goats are isolating if they contain some isolated. So, well, one key point for considering this kind of non-isolating product annuli is that we Is that we can change a product non-isolating annuli in a product decomposition to a product disk. And this is a key point in the things I will say. Another concept is for an utter manifold is to be incompressibly horizontally prime. So first, we say that the We say that a decomposing surface is incompressible horizontally surfaced. First, if the surface is incompressible, the boundary of the surface is containing the suture, and that can be isotopic to the boundary of the R plus component. And while it is homologous to the surface, its boundary is homologous to this pair. And well, if in case that that surface contains Surface contains closed components, we request it to be not null homologous. Okay, so that is an incompressible horizontal surface. And so we say that a suture manifold is incompressible horizontally prime if any of these incompressible horizontal surfaces can be isotoped to a color of R plus or R minus. or R minus. So this is one of our first results. And so if we have a suture manifold with non-empty dots, then the handle number of the suture manifold is the handle number of the dots. If the handle number of the dots is two or the dots are non-isolating. So this is a sketch of the very quick sketch of the proof. So we have Sketch of the proof. So we have this product decomposition. Well, that decomposes the suture manifold into a product and into its gods. So we have this, well, because the manifold is non-fiber, we know that the handle number is going to be greater or equal to two. And so we have this inequality. Well, this is by a previous result. Result of another paper of joint with Ken. And so this is just the handle number of the product piece and the guts, but this is a product, so it has zero handle number. So we have this first inequality. If the guts have handle number two, so we are done. So, but if the guts are non-isolating, we can switch this product the composition. The composition, this products, surface decomposition into a collection of that contains only product disks. And so when we do that, the composition, we get, well, a new decomposition, but the thing is that the guts obtained by this decomposition along product this, the guts are homeomorphic to the old ones. So the trick here is to interface. Intersect as a Higger surface that realizes the handle number of the suture manifold with the product disk. And so what happens is that that surface, that Higar surface, intersects each of these product discs exactly in one arc. And that led us to have this lower bound. And again, this is zero, and this is the handle number of this. The handle number of these gods, which is homeomorphic to this one, so we have the equality. Another theorem, so well, so this is the like the that we can pull the handle number of the gods to our sutur man, to the handle number of our sutur manufacturing with the hypothesis of the gods being non-isolated. So in this So, this theorem states that if we have, again, a suture manifold with dots that are connected, incompressible, horizontally prime, and non-isolating, then the suture manifold has the property to be incompressible horizontally prime. So, again, the property of being incompressible horizontally prime from the guts can be. From the gods, can be pulled back to the sutur manifold. Well, and so the again, this is an idea of the proof. So since we know that the goats are non-isolating, we can start with a product decomposition consisting of only product disks. And so suppose we have an incompressible horizontally surface for the suture manifold. Horizontally surface for the suture manifold. Then again, this surface intersects each component of this product disk in horizontal arcs. So now, like in this picture, we can consider, so this is the incompressible horizontal surface for the, for the manifold, for the entire manifold. So we look at the pieces of F intersecting the product pieces and the dots. And so we show that those pieces. We show that those pieces are again incompressible horizontally surfaces in the products and in the guts. And then, since the guts are incompressible horizontally prime, then this surface, the piece here, can be isotoped to a color of the R plus of the dots, so say, or R minus of the dots. So, say we isotope it. So say we isotope to a color of R plus of the guts. And on the other hand, the pieces in the product is just a fiber of the product. So we can push it to a color of the R plus of the product or R minus. So we pull it to the R plus. And when we glue the surface back, these colors glue back nicely. And so the surface is isotopic into a color of the R plus of the original manifesto. Of the R plus of the original math. Okay. Okay, so this has an application to cipher surfaces. So say we have an incompressible cipher surface over a knot. And so the guts, if the guts of the cipher surface are connected, incompressible, horizontally prime, and non-isolating, then the cipher surface is the unique incompressible cipher surface, and the handle number of the knot is. And the handle number of the node is the handle number of the bottles of F. Okay, so this is just apply the previous theorem to this special situation. Okay, now I'm going to consider three types of suture manifolds with torus boundary. So the first type is a solid torus with four longitudinal sutors. The type two is again a solid torus. type two is again a solitorus but with two sutors with winding number greater than two and the type three are exteriors of non what is that are exteriors of a non-trivial not uh with sutors uh with two sutors that are not um slope of an essential anode so we have these three types of sutures Of suture manifolds with Touros boundary, with either with four with four sutters, with two sutors. So we have this property of this type of gods. So if we have this, suppose that the gods of a cipher surface of a not Of a node. So we have the complementary sutur manifold of a cipher surface, and suppose that the gods we obtain have torus boundary, then we show that the gut has to be one of these three types. And furthermore, we can say if they if the And say if the goats are incompressible, horizontally prime, or non-ansculating, and the handle number. So for type one, they are, well, for most of the, I'm going to say for all of the types of gods, they are all incompressible horizontally prime. It is a condition that we need to add. But so that type one goals may be or not be non-isolating, and we can compute the handle number for the type one and type two, and we can give a lower bound for the handle number of type three. So I'm not going to say sketch the proof of this, but okay, and we have more information about Uh, information about the type 3 goats when the node we are considering is a torus node. So, there we can prove that the handle number of those gods is two if the sutus meets a regular fiber once and four otherwise. And well, if we have this other condition on the slope. We have this other condition on the slope, and so we can say that these dots are incompressible horizontally framed. So, this is important for when I talk about nearly fiber nuts. So, now I'm going to say what is a nearly fiber node. So, this comes from the Instanton and Higger-Floor theories. So, it is known that a nut So it is known that a knot is fiber if and only of the top gradings have rank one. And so when the not when the top grading of has ranked two, it is said that the knot is nearly five. So this is by valuing a TVEC. And so later, Li and J showed that nearly five Show that nearly fiber nodes have unique minimal genus typher surface. And they show the type of gut for these nearly fiber nodes. So they have these three models that the first one is a solid torus with four longitudinal sutures. M2 is a solid torus with two sutors, each of winding number two. And M3 is a positive tri-foil stereo with two sutors of slope two. With two sutures of a slope two. So the type three, the three types of what I mentioned before, they are just a well generalization of these three models. So now if we have a nearly, sorry for my typos, if we have a nearly fiber knot. Nearly five or not. So, by the work of Liangier, we know which type of goats they have. And so by our results, we can compute the handle number of those goats. So the first two models have handle number two. And otherwise, K has if K has lots of the three models, it has handle number one. Of the three model, it has handle number four, and moreover, um, K has an incompressible cipher surface of non-minimal genus if and only if the gods are of the first model and non-isolated. So, for the other type of models, the cipher uh incom the cipher surface that is incompressible is is just the minimal, the one of minimal genius. Minimal, the one of minimal genus. So, well, so the first part of this statement follows basically from the properties of type 1, 2, and 3 dots. And the second part, so here is a picture of, well, a cartoon picture of the first type model. So here you can see the gods and you can see. And you can see these are the four, this represents like the four sutors, which are longitudinal. So this product decomposition is isolating because remember that for being non-isolating, you can go from here to any of the of the product annulite. The product annuli without intersecting the guts. So, for this one, you cannot, well, you have to go through the guts. So, this is a non-ansclarating guts of type of model one. And so, how do we get the incompressible cipher surface of non-minimal genus? So, what we do is we take three copies, three annuli in the goods, like this annuli here. In the product piece that belongs to the non-isolating annuli, we just take a copy of the fiber of the fiber of the product and in the isolating part we just take three copies of the fiber and we glue this. Glue these surfaces together, and well, we show that this surface is incompressible. It's an incompressible siphon surface for the law. And well, because its Euler characteristic is, well, it's higher, it's lower than the minimum one. So this Eilford surface is non-minimal genus. And finally, Oh, and finally, we give explicit examples of nearly fiber nodes with this kind of type 1 non-isolating nodes. So, well, here is a picture of the node. So, this is here you can see the minimal genus cipher surface, which is a genus. Which is a genus to cipher surface, and the one that we construct from our theorem is a genus for incompressible cipher surface. Yeah. Well, here is the construction. Well, I'm going to spend time. And thank you for your attention. And well, this is a nice place where you might be interested to go and take a picture of yourself. So this is in. Of yourself. So, this is in downtown Oaxaca, is the Centro Cultural San Parlo in Calla Yidalgo Noveciento Siete. So, in the nut table what's the like lowest? I think, well, they appear like the Morse noveltop number. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So for not exteriors, the handle number is the most notified number. So there are, I think there are some of these values. Some of these values, I think, in the not info website, there are some. Yeah, but thanks. Any other questions? Well, if the goats are non-isolating, what happens, you mean like Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, like you can pull back the handle number. Yes. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well, my answer will be like if you know the handle number of the boats is three and it is non-isolating, so you can pull back the handle number to the sutur men. The suture manifold, but I don't probably not understand the question. It's even the number is even, right? Because we count, yeah, we count one. So, like, maybe you are seeing like an explicit example of a box with handle number four or something like that. Yeah, I so I guess you can have hand uh got with handle number four both all right uh Scott has a question If you have your original sutured manifold and you find the guts. And you find the guts, and then like you do some product, you do some decomposition on the say on the guts. You could then find guts of that, right? Can you find guts of guts of guts? But so the definition of guts is that you cannot find they don't have any other but after decomposition, you get a new sutured manifold. Like if you decompose along a certain Like, if you decompose along a surface, that's not product annulus or disk. Okay, so, right. Like, so decomposing along any incomplete products, okay, annual ion disks, right? Do you know anything about like how handle numbers can kind of say pull back through a hierarchy or anything like that? All right, so let's thank the speaker again.
