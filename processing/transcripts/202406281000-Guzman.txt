Okay, sorry, thank you. Yeah, so and then just thinking in co-algebra objects in this in this category. So I think for this audience, I need to say like maybe I want to identify these simplicial models with models over in spectra and then the connective. And then the connective part of it. So, this thinking it as an infinity category. So, otherwise, I think I want to be a fellow of the community, and I don't want to. So, and okay, so yeah, uh Okay, so this construction of course it's very simple. Like we are just thinking in the category of spaces or simplicial sets. And then so we want to go to the category of simplicial commutative. To the category of simplicial computative co-algebras over k and uh can I ask you a quick question? Yeah, sure. Well, you say remove the finite removes both, then they'll probably say, Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, at least at least when the field is algebraically closed. I'm gonna, yeah, I'm gonna say it more later on. But at least when the field is algebraically closed, then you can remove the final and the potential. Can remove the final and the defaulting condition. But if the field is not algebraically closed, then things are different. And so, okay, so I mean, the model is very simple. It's like we just assigned the co-algebra structure inducing by the diagonal map, also. So, just induced by the by the diagonal map. And from here, so we have this forgetful founder and this co-free algebra font, which goes in the other direction, right? Usually the forgetful founder is a right or John. So in this case, it goes in the other direction. Okay, so I think I took four black holes for the motivation. I didn't want to take so much. But yeah, so the question now. Yeah, so so the question now is that uh if it is possible to extend the results uh to the um so the question is what what happens in A1OMotopico? We want to move there and um So we are going to consider now, so we're going to consider k a perfect field. Sorry, I forgot to mention that, which is also the condition that we need in Gaut's result. And I'm going to consider another field, F, also a perfect field. Also, a perfect view. So, I'm going to take the category of motivic spaces, and we know that this is the A1 localization, the Nisnevich localization and the A1 localization of the category of reshapes and smooth schemes over F with values in the infinity category of spaces. So, sorry, sometimes I will maybe I will confuse. Sometimes maybe I will confuse which one is my field F and which portion is my field K, but F is going to be my basis field for the category of smooth schemes and K is going to be my coefficients where I'm going to localize the commodity theories. So again, we want the same game. We want to have, so we want to construct a filter. We have not really a Moot over F simplicial models over K and we want to take the co-algebra objects over here so yes No, no, no, sorry. Yeah, I want the simplicial commutative co-algebra objects in this in this in this guide. So I'm gonna denote as the A1 coalgebras with the over the field k in the category of smooth schemes over k. And from here I have the co-free contour and from here I have the And from here, I have the forgetful. The forgetful font. I wanted to graduate in the order. Okay, that wasn't. I wanted to graduate in the other direction. And then I have here the adjustment. Co-commutative co-algebra. Co-commutative co-algebra. Yeah, there were too many codes. A contributative algebra object in the opposite category of this shape. And so we are going to say that. So we're going to say that two motiva spaces motivism between motiva spaces is an A H A one F no sorry K equivalence If the A1 homology, the morphism induced in the A1 homology is an isomorphism. Which is, this is just defined as the homology of the chain complex associated to the A1. To the A1 early stage localization of the free model. And okay, I need F coefficients. Okay, sorry, thank you. Yeah, sorry. Okay. Okay, no, yeah, and Kay is here. Thank you. Thank you. And so, mammy, we know that an object Know that an object, a motiva space is a HA1 local if for everyone local, it's and for every HK HA1K with equivalence, so the mapping spaces from Y to From y to z induces a Wig equivalence. The mapping space of X to sorry to Y, yeah, X to say is a Wiggle equivalent. And also, we say that the localization, a map is a localization. So let's say X. So let's say x to x h a one k is a h a one k localization if this map p is a h a one k with equivalence and also we have that this space is The space is H1 log. So we just translate the things. So here, I mean, just the free model, the free vector space generated on the, I mean, let's. Generated on the, I mean, like we have to do it section-wise, like this is a actual sheet. So we take the free model on sections over this set. I mean, this is a simple shot set, so we take level-wise the free model generator by so say it again that's real y. Uh, here, yes. Here, yes. Yes, thank you. Sorry. This should be, I mean, and it's the same definition. Any space. And so, yeah, just the pre-model. And this is, and so then we're taking localization for A1 homology in this case. So the result, which is, I mean So we just extend a core result and we have that the funder K Delta H want a K. H1K to the localization of spaces that goes to the simplicial co-commutative co-algebras k1f is fully faithful for k the for k algebraically close This one here is fully fable. And in fact, we can provide a right adjoint, an explicitly write adjoint for this font. And we're going to call that the group-like objects in the co-algebra. But this right adjoint is just a mapping space using simplification commutative co-algebras. Community for algebra of the coalge given by the field K to a general coal. K just algebraically close. No, you don't need any characteristic assumption. Assumption. It's just algebraically close, and it is important that the field is algebraically close. So mainly the proof, which leads from Gore's theorem is that we need to prove that this group-like contour preserves quasi-isomorphisms in Quasi-isomorphisms in the category of co-algebras. I'm just going to say co-algebras to say all the adjectives. So the sense quasi-isomorphisms in these co-algebras, which are our weak equivalences here, because actually we are so when we have here a model structure where the wave equivalents are the quasi isomorphisms, we are just isomorphisms we are just uh um um so so we we are just transferring the the quasi isomorphisms to the to the computative coaljects at the same so so the the main the main part is that we want to prove that this this uh thing uh sends uh these quasi isomorphisms to uh h a1 A A1 K with equivalences. And the main ingredient for making this to work is that for every co-algebra, we can't define, so let's suppose that we have just a coalgebra object, a commuted coalgebra object in vector spaces. Vector spaces over our field K. So for each of these ones, we can define the etal part of the coalgebra as a direct sum of all the simple subcoalgebras. But I mean that we don't have any We don't have any proper container subcoalgebra in C alpha. And then we have that, so this embeds, we have the dietal part embeds in our original co-algebra and it embeds naturally. So every time that we have amorphism between two coalgebrases, we have a We have this commutative diagram. But actually, this morphism, this embedding splits for every co-algebra. And in the case when K is algebraically close, so this is exactly the coalgebra, the diagonal coalgebra generated by the group-like By the group like objects in the quad. So this is a quasi. So this is isomorphic to the so every time that we have here a quasi isomorphism, like if we would now change to these simplicial co-algebras and we're using shifts, we have a quasi-isomorphism here. Isomorphism here. So it's only saying that this founder is sending quasi-isomorphisms to this A1 Wig equivalences. And if we chase our field, if our field is not algebraically closed, well, the story is completely different because we have a more rich structures of the co-algebra sovereign field. I mean, this only follows when the field is. When the field is algebraically close. But for instance, if our field is not algebraically close, we can take any extension of our field and then the dual as a k-vector space is defined in a quad. So then it becomes more a bit more interesting somehow. Here we go. I have like a talking state. I have like a philosophical question just as people understand. I'm returning to this idea that a co-algebra is really like a commutative algebra object in the category of F schemes or some derived version of this or something. Yeah. And so from this, like you start with one of your spaces and then you get this ring object. And this is like a contravariant functor. So I'm sort of imagining that this is. So, I'm sort of imagining that this is like some cohomology, but it's like sort of conservative in the sense that it reflects isomorphisms. Is that a completely wrong way to think about what, like, it just happens to be in a different, it's not in the category of rings, it's in the category of like ring objects in some other category? Because these spaces are sort of in the category of like space objects of some other category. Is it, am I completely off? Yeah, I don't know. I haven't thought about that, but yeah, probably. Linear this s coalge thing is like linear over a field, whereas the left-hand side, so this s-co-elge is like linear over a field. I mean, it's a it's it's uh some something like a shape module, right? Whereas the left-hand side is like a spacing. You made it more simple, but somehow what you say is simplify because I think what I'm just asking, like, I'm imagining like I want like a ring-like thing to come out, but I have to do it in. thing to come out. But I have to do it in some other category than the category of ring. So the necklace way to say that is just algebra. Is that some way to interpret what's happening? Yeah, I mean I think I think so. Yeah yeah. Like I mean like the philosophy is also that like for example homotopy groups, homology groups and homology groups doesn't detect completely the homotopy type. But if you add this, for example, in But if you add this, for example, in homology, if you add the algebra structure, then you detect the homotopy type. So then, in this case, you are going dually because we're working with homology and avoiding the final condition. And then the co-algebra is the one that has to reflect the homotopy type. Yeah. This is like, yeah, probably. So, so, I mean, like, things get more, like, more interesting somehow if we. interesting somehow if we if we work on a non-algebraically closed field and for that we need to define a category of removal so do you have a nice um description of the essential ah yeah and then actually the yeah thank you for the question so if we if we take uh the composition of uh The composition of, so let's say the group-like part of the soft. So, here we have to take the fibrant replacement to make it correctly of this co-algebra. And then we take the group-like fontor. So, this one here is actually detecting the scale localization. The k localization, the A1k localization of the space. So explicitly give us the local space. And yeah. So then if we have now again, so let the same characteristic. We have a perfect field, which is not necessarily algebraically close. So we are going to take the Galois group of the Of the algebraically closure. Just look at the note by G. And among many things, G, we know this is a finite group. And so we have the category of discrete spaces. So yeah. Yeah, probably I didn't want to erase all of this, but okay. So, so another. So, so for many things, we have the discrete spaces. So, we have uh so we have uh G or Galoa group, and then we have uh We have, first of all, discrete sets, which is just a continuous action of the group, of the profinite group with the X with the discrete topology. And we know that we can see, we can look at discrete set, G-discrete sets. As a shift in the etal site, spec of K, et al side. And also, we can look at this as a shift on the side of orbits, of finite orbits of G, and which is just the. And which is just the Kaloa correspondence in there. So we can define the category of discrete motiv spaces, which is going to be so we will say that we will say that the category of districts That the category of discrete motiv spaces, G-discrete motival spaces is going to be the NISNAVICA-1 localization of the category of ships on the smooth scheme solar Earth. So I'm going to just explain what I'm meaning with all of this. With all of these, so the orbits, uh, the finite orbits and the category of spaces. So, so with this analogy that the discrete spaces are precisely the shift over these two sides, equivalence, so we define the category of discrete uh spaces, the infinity category of discrete spaces, as the uh shiftification of the shifts with values in in in the infinity category of the spaces. In the beginning category of spaces. And then now we want this as a motivic space. So we take shifts with values precisely in this category of G-discrete spaces. And so, I mean, we declare this as the category of so let's say it's one wanna put a key raid G of a G descript. Of G-discrete spaces. So then we can extend this theorem to say that now we want to avoid this algebraically closed field. We don't need it anymore. And we will say that there is a fully faithful functor. Fontour. So now we want this font to go from the category of okay, I think probably I wanted to reuse, but probably it's not a good idea. So, we want this to be the font K. I'm going to note like this. And I'm going to explain now what I think with this. So, I'm going to take the HK localization, A1K localization of the category of disk motivic spaces, which goes to goes to simplicial commutative co-algebras over it is not necessarily algebraically close to so actually what what we need to care is uh to which uh uh values we are sending the the the finite orbits so we take a coset of a subgroup Of a subgroup of finite index. So we are sending this one here to the co-algebra definite byte. First, we take the fixed points of the algebraically closed, and then we take the dual of this thing, and we just left-right extend this font to be properly defined over all this gadget. And this font has a right adjoint. This motor has a right adjoint, which is much more complicated because, I mean, this detail part becomes way more complicated over non-algebraically closed fields, but also we can say that when we compose this, we could compose it to these two filters. So this exhibit, this space, this. This space is the HA1K localization in the category of this red space. So somehow, I mean, we can give this fully faithful pointer to this co-algebra to a non-necessarily algebraically closed field, but that the price that the localization that we get is only in the carpet. Is only in the category of discrete spaces. We still have in this action of the group. And as a consequence of this result, we have that, so this is now that many people have come out about the results that are not very written there, but that are there and from. Are there from previous use? So, one of the consequences that on a claim that I have is that if we have that a motivic space is A1 important and Y is the HM The H A1Q localization in G-discrete spaces. So we can conclude that the homotopy fixed set points of this HQ localization is the H. Is the HA1AQ localization? So, somehow, I mean, this treatment of the co-algebra give us a localization in discrete spaces, but we also actually want the localization in the category of spaces, of T-Veg spaces, we need to go to take the fixed points of these things. So, I haven't said what is, so this result. what is uh so this this result i i i have put it in my in my phd thesis but i never wrote it properly and send it for publication so um but then so i want to to focus now in this part of the a1 hypothesis so at the same time that i was uh defending my thesis this uh there was this paper uh almost the same day i guess or two days uh after there was this paper After there was this paper by Hopkins Fassell and Assak when they discuss precisely nilpotent spaces in any one omat objecture. Be to yours. Anyone want to talk? So, I'm going to take a chance to talk about this, this milpotent spaces. So, I mean, the definition is as we expect. So, let's say that we have H and G to prevent the H. To pre-shifts of groups, and we will say that G acts on H if there exists an homomorphism of pre-shifts from G to the automorphisms of H. So this this this this will be So this this this this will be uh exactly that and then uh we will say that um that um that we have a central series a central serial for the action Leon H If we can find the following sequence as in topology. So we will find a sequence of subgroups, H1, HN of it's a sequence of shifts of groups. The ships, sorry. The shifts, sorry, the shifts of groups which are normal subgroups. And also, we want that our GS reaction is stable on these subgroups. And we want that the cohesion HI mod HI plus one is per shift of a billion groups. And also, we want that the action of G in the quotients as in topology is strict. So, the same that is if instead of shifts, we have actually shifts on our grotendic site here. So, we say that we have an action if we have an action at the level of pre-shift. If we have an action at the level of preceipt, and we have a central series for this action, if we have a central series at the level of proceeds. And there is another concept that is important that we can just consider. So we're going to say that the action is locally, sorry, if the action is. Important if there exists this finite central view. Right? So we say that the action is milking if exists the central series. So there is another action that we can naturally work. Another direction that we can naturally work on, and we can say that we will have the notion of locally need potent. And we say that something is locally potent if there exists a central decrease in central series. Serious, let's say H0 H1, not necessarily finite, but if we take the spoke over a point and we act it, how many times do I have? Like, okay. 15. Okay, it's okay. So we take the action over the stocks over a point. So we want this to be, so it is not a nilpoteny if there exists the central series and the action is nilpoten as a group, as just as groups, not not ships here. Chips here. And in this paper of Aso Pose and Hopkins, so they exhibit an example that locally nil potent doesn't necessarily imply nil potent as a shift. And so nobody wasn't installed wise, I know what is exactly. Exactly, exactly. Yeah, I didn't say anything more than that. Yeah. So the locally important doesn't imply an important thing. And they exhibit a very beautiful example. And I think it's very beautiful because it's very root to the theory of a1omotopy theory. So they prove that the growth indeed did shift with the action of GM. Of GM on the Glotten DB chip. I'm going to use this just to denote that I'm thinking about the Glotten DB chip. So, usually, what you say is we define the Glotted Dbit ring for a field, and then we define the unramified shape to define the rotated sheet. Just to remind that Max already told us about the unramified stuff. And so, this So this so when we consider the grotended bit ring over a over a field L, so let's say that L is a finite extension of K, which are the ones that we're going to care about. So this Gautengbit shift is filtrated by the fundamental idea of the field. So The field. So very precisely, this m plus one L defines the powers of the fundamental idea that are going to define the central series that we need. But we need conditions over the two homological dimensions of the field in order to make it finite. It's not always finite. It's not always finite, and it really gonna depends on the field case. It's not gonna be locally finite. And so as we will expect, we also would like to have this notion in the A1 amotopic side, right? So instead of just taking So instead of just taking sheaves of groups, we're going to take sheaves of groups which are strongly A1 invariant. This only means that there are A1 invariant as a sections and the first comology, the first homology group in the Niger neighborhood site is also A1 invariant. invariant and and then we uh so so we will say that um if we take two strongly a one invariant so we have an action it will have this uh automorphism it's this this homomorphism uh and uh and we will have a central series in the a1 invariance setting if we have this central series of uh shifts of groups uh which are going to Uh, which are gonna again take this H white strongly A1 invariant, and these reshifts of abelian groups are going to be strongly A1 invariant. But actually, if we have something that it's an abelian shift and shift abelian groups and it's strongly invariant, then And it's strongly invariant, then it is strictly invariant, which means that all the homology groups of the sheep in the Nisnevich site are A1 invariant. So we have again like the definitions of something to be A1 import, an A1 important action, right? So here just we have this thing as a one important. And an example that also they exist. And an example that also they exhibit as an example of something that is of something that is locally is precisely the Is precisely the M minus 1 A1 homotopy group of the affine space of dimension N minus 0, which is precisely by a computation of morel the Miller-bit K-theory. So at least I'm saying that I mentioned at least the word K-theory. And so again, like So again, like the action that we want is that we want to GM act in the sorry, here is N, precisely N. It's precisely N because this A N minus zero is equivalent in the category of motival spaces to the smash product of the simplicial sphere with Egm. With Egm smash n times. This is n minus one times, and this is n smash n times. So again, we have an action of GM over the Miller-Brit K theory. So for those that haven't seen the Miller-British K theory, it's also generated by elements of the Miller-K theory, and there is a specific and special element, the Yet element, which Element the eta element, which portion out by eta, we recover the Miller K-theory. And again, the filtration is given by the fundamental ideals on here. So we said that an emotivity space is a Is important, say one important if, as we expect, we want that the action of the A1 fundamental group acts in the higher A1 homotopy group acts nil potentially. And so, yeah, and another nice example that ASOC, Wascella and Hopkins, provide is that precisely The projective space is a one important. So, this result is not totally empty. Like, I mean, we have important examples of spaces that are one important, and somehow we can recover the rational model. And I think probably I'm gonna stop here. And I think probably I'm gonna stop here. And probably was a short talk. I have one. So I could also imagine the definition of NICOM focus. I think I need to work the details here. Like, I mean, like the first details that I have is what yours was giving the. I just was giving the notion A1 nil button only using like this A1 nil buttoning condition, but yeah, I have to be careful with the locally part. So we have a break now until 11 or 30. It looks like a
