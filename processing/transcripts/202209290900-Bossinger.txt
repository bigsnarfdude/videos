Bolsinger, our first speaker for the day. She's joining us all the way from Unam, Unira Bahaka, and she's going to tell us about tropical totally positive cluster varieties. Thank you, Lai. Thank you, team. Thank you for the organizers for the invitation. Thank you, Bernal Le Clare, for giving us the opportunity. Giving us the opportunity to this workshop. I'm going to be talking about something that I really feel should have been part of my PhD thesis, but it somewhat took me six years rather than three to see what's going on. So I can present it now. If you have other suggestions regarding the title, actually, also I'm happy to take them. So I'm going to just tell you what I want to tell, and then we can discuss if the title was appropriate or not. So my Or not. So, my talk is really going to be about some aspects of tropical geometry. And I'm going to tell you what kind of tropical geometry I mean in the next few slides. But more generally, in tropical algebraic geometry, we have the fundamental theorem that tells us that different notions of tropicalization are related. In the context of cluster algebras, it is more appropriate to think of certain positive. Appropriate to think about certain positive notions of tropicalization, and there's an analogue of this fundamental theorem for total positivity that relates at least two notions of what the positive part of the tropicalization of a variety could be. But if you are, well, me at least when I started to work with cluster algebras and cluster varieties, very soon you come along this notion of tropicalizing a cluster variety or more generally, A variety, or more generally, a scheme with a positive atlas that Fok and Gonshov introduced. And my very naive question as a PhD student was like, well, there's all these notions of tropicalization. How are they really related? Because at first sight, the way how to tropicalize a cluster variety is, well, it's a functor of points kind of construction that we will see also, we'll revise in a second. And it seems really different from the ways to tropicalize an ideal that is. Ways to tropicalize an idea that is quite naive, some sub-fan of the Grubner fan of this idea. So, my question was: how are these related? And people asked me also because I work kind of with both notions and I could never really give the answer. My aim is to kind of give some insight now on how these two are actually related. So, I'm going to be reviewing the tropicalization of an idea, which is really very close to Really, very close to these monomial valuations that Greg told us about yesterday. So, the idea here is that I take a polynomial, a certain finite sum of monomials, and some weight vector w in r to the end, where I have like one real number as weight for every variable. And the initial form of some polynomial with respect to a weight is really just all the terms in the polynomial that achieved maximal weight with respect to this vector. With respect to the specter. And then similarly, I go ahead and I construct an initial idea by just taking the idea generated by all its initial forms. So the tropicalization then is this kind of weird subspace of r to the n, where I just look at all those weight vectors that would achieve, would achieve that initial idea does not contain any monomial. And the idea here is also similar to the maybe. Similar to the maybe more classic notion of in tropical geometry that the minimum should be achieved twice. So if you think about a polynomial and two terms achieve the minimum or the maximum in my convention, that would not be a monomial. So it would kind of count in this set. And then I take the closure of this and I take it as a fan. So I'm always thinking of the Gr√ºbner fan of the idea sitting in the background where I group together all. Background where I group together all the weight vectors that give me the same initial idea. And then the tropicalization for me is a sub-fan that has the fan structure imposed by the Grepna fan. So here's an example to just kind of get maybe used to the notion. This is a, well, there's my ideal. It's two variables. So the Grubner fan lives in R2. The Grubner fan. The Grubner fan itself consists of all those cones that have intersection with the positive orthant for some reason. So, here you can see what it looks like. If you focus on a point along this ray, that would be like multiples of 1, 1. You can see that the first two terms of my polynomial would have the same weight, and the last one gets kicked out. So, this is the initial ideal along this ray. This ray. And then similarly, you can, yeah, you can construct all the other initial ideas, and this is my Grebner fan. The tropicalization then consists of all those parts of this fan where the idea is not just about monomial. So I have three rays in the tropicalization. And this is actually the normal fan or this is the codimension one locus of the normal fan of the Newton polytope of my polynomial. On okay, so this is like a notion of tropicalization I like a lot for its simplicity. It's uh, I think it's very natural to consider. And yeah, so that's that's my first notion of tropicalization. Any questions? Maybe does everyone, did everyone see this in their bachelor's? No, yeah. Okay, great. So anyone with any doubts and questions, let me know throughout the talk. Also, in Zoom, I don't see the Talk also in Zoom. I don't see the chat, but you can just unmute yourself and interrupt me. I'm happy to take questions. Okay, so now, I'm sorry, this might not be too well motivated at this point, but soon you will see how I get to positivity from the cluster point of view. I guess most of you might already kind of have like a natural intuition why positivity should come up in the cluster setting. In the cluster setting, but if I'm just working with ideals, I can also have this notion of the positive part of the tropicalization. So, in this case, I mean, I would want to start with an idea with real coefficients over the reals. And it's called totally positive if it does not contain any non-zero element of this semi-ring where I'm just allowing real positive coefficients. So, the intuition, the intuition, but this is a wrong statement. But this is a wrong statement: is that the elements of my idea should be able to vanish along the positive orthant, but that's not the same thing. It's just that how I remind myself why this does not contain any non-zero element, how it makes sense. I could make this statement precise if you're interested. We can talk about it, but for now, I just want to get to this definition of the positive part of the tropicalization, where really I'm restricting inside the tropicalization of an ideal, I'm restricting my Of an ideal, I'm restricting my attention to only those weight vectors that give me a totally positive initial idea. Yes, this idea could be contained in a polynomial ring with complex coefficients? I mean, if it is generated by polynomials that are that only have real coefficients, yes. But really, I mean, this definition only makes sense over the reals. Only makes sense over the reals. Maybe you could generalize and I don't know, put some order on the complex number and say you only want so, but yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, thank you for the question. It is closed, but that's a result, yeah. And actually, it's a consequence of the next slide. But before I get there, I wanted to wake up the people. Wanted to wake up the people that don't like tropicalization but like cluster algebras to kind of get you back into the conversation. So, how can I think of this if I'm just coming from cluster algebras, where maybe you have like your favorite cluster algebra that's finitely generated? And inside that, you can take a set of cluster variables that are also algebra generators, right? And as soon as we have that, like our favorite choice of generators for the algebra. Choice of generators for the algebra, we can present our cluster algebra as a quotient by some ideal. Where this ideal is really easy to compute, I just take a polynomial ring and as many variables as I have elements in my generating set, and I send each variable to the algebra element in A. And then the kernel of this algebra homomorphism is an idea I prime inside a polynomial ring, and it presents my cluster algebra. So I will be interested in studying the positive part. In studying the positive part of the tropicalization of an idea that I got from a cluster algebra. And my naive question is: what does this fan know about the cluster structure? Okay, so to see it's a closed subfan, I think what you need is the following theorem. Yeah, so this is what I call the fundamental theorem of totally positive charge. Theorem of totally positive tropical geometries and generalization of the original fundamental theorem in tropical geometry to the positive case. And it tells us that two ways to think about tropicalization of an affine variety or an ideal are the same. So the first one is the one that I gave you as a definition, the positive part of the tropicalization in this ideal sense. And the second one is a bit more geometric maybe. One is a bit more geometric, maybe, where I take my idea I now considered inside a polynomial ring whose coefficients are the Pirsur series. So, up here I put the definition of Persia series, just the series with rational, in one variable with rational exponents, and I come with a natural valuation where I can send a Pusser series to the lowest exponent appearing when I write it down as a series. Okay, so inside there. Okay, so inside there, so inside the Pure Sur series, I will then restrict my attention to a certain like positive subring, maybe, that are all series where really the coefficient of the lowest term is a positive real number. Okay, so then I will do the following, maybe, yeah, odd thing, but from a geometric point of view, maybe more natural. I take the intersection of Natural, I take the intersection of the vanishing set of my ideas with this. Yeah, you should really think about it maybe as a torus, r plus to the n. Okay, and I take then pointwise valuation. Oh, sorry, my capital X is the same as the vanishing set of I. And the theorem tells me that these two ways to compute a set in R to the N really are the same. These are two ways to compute the tropicalization. Tropicalization. Okay. Yeah. So that was everything I wanted to say about the tropicalization of an ideal. Are there any questions? Otherwise, I will move on and recall the Falkonchov tropicalization of a cluster, which is another way to tropicalize. And for me, as a PhD student, really, it was not clear at all how this should be related. So to To just briefly recall my notation for cluster varieties, I am considering some fixed data gamma, which is this collection of lattices, and a saturated sublattice and circ, they're dual lattices, and the spousymetric form going to the rationals. I should really also put the multipliers in here because I don't assume it's a spousymetric case. And then I have the Langlands dual data, which are, well, these lattices where D These lattices where D is the least common multiple of my multipliers. And I have associated cluster varieties, right? A and X for each side that are glued out of these tori. So S0 will commonly denote my initial seed, and S is some other seed obtained from it by mutations. And just to recall, there are several ways to see the local patches of my A variety, which are these tori. Variety, which are these tori associated to n3, where this is just the definition of the same torus, tensoring by C star. I can also take the spectrum of the ring of characters of the torus. And this ring has, if I choose a seed, the A variables or Fomin Zelvinsky X's as local coordinates. Okay, so the capital A's will be my cluster variables and the capital X's. Variables in the capital X's will be my Y variables, if you like. Okay, so then now, what's the Fokkon of tropicalization? Remember, these tori of the cluster variety, they're now just glued by Fomins-Zalewinsky mutation formulas. So in the A case, they look like this. The BI's come from my B matrix. And first, very easy observations that I don't need any minus signs in this formula. So I can really pass to a So, I can really pass to a semi-field, and the semi-fields of choice for me will be the integers with addition and maximum, or the reals. I mean, I put the rationals in there as a way, but really the integers and the reals are enough. And then I just pass to the semi-field. So, in a functor of points kind of way, I take the zt points of my torus, which turns out to be something of this form that I can identify with the lattice itself, but really, this z. itself but really this zt well it has this max it has this tropical structure um still if i consider my mutation formula now over zt well i just do as in greg's talk i replace the uh the times for pluses and the pluses for maximum so i get a formula of this way and i realize that it's really a bijection of sets in this setting so it's a bijection from the lattice to the lattice um but it does But it does not preserve the tropical structure that I have on the T. So I can then go ahead and define the tropicalization for control of tropicalization of my cluster variety. It's the union of these tori that are all in bijection throughout this map. So really a point in the cluster variety is the class of an element that I get if I pick it in some torus and trace it through all these tropical mutations. And I kind of identify it with the lattice because each patch is identified. With the lattice, because each patch is identified with the lattice, but I should be a bit careful about this because the tropicalization itself does not have the structure of a lattice. Okay, so that's it. That's what I read about as a PhD student in my first or second year. And I was like, okay, this is weird. I understand you can do it, but I really did not see how to relate it to the tropicalizations I learned about before. So let's get one or two more ingredients before I can start. Ingredients before I can state the first result. We've seen g vectors before, and actually, a lot of Greg's talk yesterday was about this duality that I have, well, for theta functions, but as theta functions are indexed by tropical points, I can really think about it this way as well. So I have the tropical space of my A variety A gamma has its natural dual, which is the tropical space of the X. Space of the X gamma check. So it's cluster dual variety, because that one is identified with the dual lattice. And then I have a pairing, a duality pairing between these two spaces. And as soon as I fix a seed, I can, it's really just a pairing between lattices. Now, in particular, I want to hint your attention to the following fact. If I take a point in the X gamma check tropical space, I really have a map given by this pairing from A gamma to A gamma tropical points to Z. And here's one of two assumptions that I will impose. The first one is that my cluster algebra is positively graded. That one is really just to simplify my life. It's not that necessary. But what is necessary that I have a theta basis. Okay, so I'm in the same setting as Ben yesterday and also as Greg. So yeah, if my cluster out was. Yeah, if my cluster out was a finite type, the theta basis is the basis of cluster monomials, so that's my favorite example. And these indexing, these tropical points that are indexing the theta functions are just the G vectors of the cluster monomials. Okay, so why are G vectors interesting to me? Because in this case, they define the evaluation on all of the cluster algebra. So now with my assumptions. Now, with my assumptions, A of gamma is really just a direct sum of theta functions. So I have this natural map that goes to, well, the subset of the tropical space indexing my theta functions, but then I can identify it with the lattice. So I have a map really going from the cluster algebra to the lattice. And it turns out that this map is not just any map, but it is actually a full rank valuation on my cluster algebra. And its image, that is just by definition of valuation, the image is going to be a semi-group. Image is going to be a semi-group, which I call the value semi-group, and it turns out to be finitely generated in this case. So these are the kind of objects that I like to study valuations on certain algebras. And yeah, so in the context of valuations, there's one piece of data that I will use later on. It's the one of a Kowansky basis. I'm getting back to the idea that I really want to present my cluster algebra by some. Cluster algebra by some ideal. And the generating set of the algebra is called a Kwonsky basis if its images generate the value simple. Again, in finite type, an example of a Kwonsky basis for any G-vector valuation is the set of all cluster variables. Okay. So, yeah, any questions? Comments? Great. Okay. Great. Okay, so I think then the next slide. So, okay, one more assumptions, and then we come to the result. Okay, so one assumption that I needed, and it is the same assumption that Greg had in its talk, and it's a very popular assumption, is that the exchange matrix is a full rank. So I'm, so my exchange matrix, I think of it as this rectangular matrix here. It's in z to the n plus m, where n is the number of. n plus m where n is the number of mutables and m is the number of frozens. So if this one is of full rank then I have chances to complete it to an even bigger matrix that I want to be square and n plus m square and invertible over the integers. So really I just do the natural thing for these three matrices. Here I have my extended exchange matrix and this block up here Bs prime is determined by the one below in the schuzometric In the school symmetric case, you can forget about the diagonals, and it's really just the minus transpose of the block I have down here. But then I have to adopt with multipliers in the symmetrizable case. And for star, I can choose any integral m times m matrix that makes this matrix invertible. These matrices are great because they define several lattice isomorphisms that extend to maps between the cluster algebras. Between the cluster algebras, the cluster varieties are also the cluster algebra. So, yeah, there's just a list of all these cluster ensemble maps that are determined by just choosing one such matrix that is invertible. Okay, so now we can come to the construction. So, what I'm going to do now is I'm going to use this matrix with these assumptions, the cluster algebra with theta base. The cluster algebra with theta basis and the invertible fully extended exchange matrix to construct a map that gets me from the cluster complex to the tropicalization of an ideal. And before I can tell you the result, we're going to go through this construction of a piecewise linear map on the cluster complex. So for this construction, I will fix a generating set of the cluster algebra, B. Of the cluster algebra B and some C to just realize the cluster complex. My mutation for the cluster complex is delta S, and it's this union of cones that are indexed by S prime seeds mutation equivalent to S. And it naturally sits inside this real vector space M circ R or MR. And then I define on every cone, on every maximal cone, I will define a map that goes to R to the capital V. And remember, like capital V. And remember, like capital B, if I think of the idea, this is indexing my polynomial ring, so it's also indexing the real vector space where the tropicalization of my ideal lives. And then I do the following. I want to pair here. I mean, I'm starting in this lettuce or the vector space MR. And what I would really like to do is just take pairings with G vectors, but they live in the same space. So I apply this inverse matrix. So I apply this inverse matrix of my fully extended exchange matrix to get to a dual lattice. Well, not exactly a dual lattice, but over the reals, I'm in the dual vector space. And then I can pair. So I consider these pairings for all cluster variables that I had in my set. And that's what I do on the positive orthant, on the positive orthant of my cluster complex. If I go to another seed S prime. Another seed S prime, I really am going to do the same thing, just that I have to compose with the sequence of mutations to get my point to a positive orthant and then do the same trick, right? So if I start with some element u that lies in a cone sigma s prime s, I find a mutation sequence from s to s prime. I apply all the tropical mutations to u according to my sequence. So the image of this. So, the image of this element here lies now in the positive orth and of some cluster complex realized with respect to S prime. And then I just apply the same map. I take the G vectors with respect to the C S prime and the B matrix with respect to C. So I get like a piecewise linear map. And this is actually very close to a map that Kavier and Manon studied in a paper on tropical geometry over the semifit of piecewise linear functions on the lattice. Linear functions on the lattice, but the new thing say is this twisting with the B matrix. That turns out to be very important. Okay, so let's look at an example to get a bit familiar with this map. In A2, everyone's favorite example. I choose as my set B all cluster variables, as I would always do in finite time. So this is my realization of the cluster complex or the G-fan with respect to my initial C. With respect to my initial seed. And then I do the construction. So, what does that mean? If I have a point in the positive orthodont, I consider the inverse of the minus inverse of my V matrix, and I apply it to all the G vectors. So really, this is the matrix afterwards. This is a 2 times 5 matrix. No, 5 times 2, right? 5 times 2 matrix that represents the linear piece of my map that goes from R to the 2 to R to the 5. 2r to the 5. Right, so these are all my g vectors: 1, 0, 0, 1, minus 1, 0, 0, minus 1. These are the ray generators of my g fun. If I go to another cone, as one say, and I want to compute the linear map in this cone, I have to first pass, well, apply my mutation sequence, realize all the cluster complex with respect to the seed S one, and then I just really do the same thing. One and then I just really do the same thing. Now, here's again the collection of all g vectors, and I apply the inverse of the exchange matrix of this seed. So, these are the images that I get for these two cones. And if I continue with the game, what I get out is the following. So, this picture is a cartoon of the image of my map, where the vectors in R5 are the The vectors in R5 are the images of the ray generators that are indexed by the dots. And I get five cones in R5, each of dimension two, generated by these vectors that you see here. Okay. Is it clear what the map does? Right, so okay, so then let's see how this relates to the tropicalization. We're going to need a few ingredients for this theorem. We're going to fix, well, first recall we have the G vector valuations for every seed. I have this map G evaluation that goes to the lattice. And I have some presentation of the cluster algebra by IN. Representation of the cluster algebra by an idea that I get from my algebra generators. And now I'm going to fix a seed, S, my initial seed, and for B, I'm going to take a Kowansky basis, not just for one G vector valuation, but really for several at the same time. And in this case, I choose to take it for G and all the G vector valuations that are adjacent. And further, I'm going to assume that all the cluster variables. To assume that all the cluster variables of the seed S and its adjacencies are contained in my set. In this case, I have the following result. If I take any seed S prime that is now either S or a neighbor of it, and I apply the map phi B to the corresponding cone in the cluster complex, what I get is a cone in the tropicalization of the ideal, in the positive part of the tropicalization. Tropicalization. And moreover, it's really a map of fans. If I consider the union of these sigma s prime s as a subfan of the cluster complex, this map sends it into a subfan of the positive part that has the nice property that the initial ideals on the right-hand side that are associated are prime and they present the images. Present the images of the values, the value semi-groups of the G vectors. So I have this isomorphism where on the right-hand side, I take the semi-group algebra corresponding to the semi-group generated by G vectors with respect to my C. And on the right-hand side, I have the quotient of my polynomial ring in B variables by the initial ideal. Okay, so really, this is a result about the fan structures. About the fan structures, but also about the geometric data, the data of degenerations I get from both sides. Okay, so let me maybe comment just like one minute on the proof. The fact that we land in the tropicalization without the plus is not too hard to see. To see. No, actually, no, no, no, no, sorry, that we are adjacent maximal cones is not too hard to see, because really what happened in the example by composing with the inverse of this B matrix, really you can think of already comparing these two matrices, you see that they only differ in the column that corresponds to the mutation direction passing from one C to the other. Passing from one sea to the other. So you can already, I mean, maybe you can believe me that first of all, the cones that I get, they are of full dimension, like because I have a submatrix that is the identity matrix, when I start with G vectors, then I just impose some lattice isomorphism. So this is going to be a full dimensional cone, full dimensional endotropicalization. And they're going to be adjacent because I just change one column passing from one to the other. To prove the part about the initial ideals, I really need to consider these degeneration constructions of Grassekinki-Konsevich and some other results that relate the valuations on some algebra. On some algebra to a point in the tropicalization of the ideal presenting the algebra. And yeah, so the positivity part comes from this GHKK degeneration that works even over a semi-field. Before you were considering initial ideas with respect to weights, thank you. Ah, oh, sorry. Yes, very good point. So you can choose any point in the interior of this cone, and that would be the same. Of this cone, and that would be the same initial ideal because, in my fan structure is really defined that way, like all points in the interior of a cone with the same initial ideas. Okay. Great. Any questions or comments? Did I lose everyone already? Okay, well, let's do an example. So, here in A2 is what happens? Here in A2 is what happens. My ideal is generated simply by the exchange relations in this case. So A1 and A2 are my initial variables. Three, four, five are non-initial variables. And I choose one cone. Like, remember, this is a cartoon in R5 of five cones. I choose one cone, just the one coming from the initial seed, and a point in its interior. So the point I choose. point in its interior. So the point I chose here is just the sum of the two rays, the ray generators. And then I construct the initial ideal. So I, according to my weight vector, for example, one is the weight of A1, minus 1 is the weight of A3, just in order, 2 has weight minus 1, etc. So the blue numbers are just the weights of all the variables. And then I compute the initial ideal, which really means I just cancel out terms that. Just cancel out terms that don't achieve maximal weight. So, if you consider all these monomials without the cancelled out terms, we get binomials. And it's not hard to see that these generate a binomial, well, binomial ideas, yes, because it's generated by binomials. It's prime, that's not hard to check as well, and it is totally positive. So, these observations tell me already that the image of the positive orthon here really lies in the maximal cone of the tropicalization of the idea, in the positive part. Okay. Yeah. Great. So, for the rest of the talk, I'm gonna talk about Gonna talk about another map that has been constructed. Yeah, sure. So, would choose a different W would get the same as long as the W is in the same moment. Yeah, exactly. So, as long as I choose, that's the definition of the pan structure on the tropicalization that I choose is exactly that one. That's if I pick two points in the relative interior of the same cone. The relative interior of the same cone, they will give me the same initial idea, right? So maybe it's quite intuitive to see this for multiples. If I just take a point on the same ray, then the proportions don't change and I get the initial idea, but it's true moreover for every point in the interior of the cone. When I swap the cone though, I would get a different initial idea. Yeah, thank you. Okay. Okay. Cool. Yeah. So then I will use the rest of my time to talk about another way to construct a map really from the cluster complex to the tropicalization of an ideal in finite type that has been considered or that or more generally, I mean, I will do it in finite type, but it's not necessary even. That has been considered, I think, the first way where I've seen it was this paper by Seen it was this paper by Speier and Williams on the tropical positive Grossmannian, where they use a positive parametrization of a space and tropicalize it, essentially, said naively. We will check how it goes now. And I had some discussions with Lauren and her collaborators that also recently posted a paper on the positive part of the tropicalization of flag varieties about all these different ways to construct such maps. To well, get constructed such maps and all the different fan structures usually you can put on the right-hand side. So, those discussions got me thinking about the relation of this map, this 5B map, and the one obtained from a positive parametrization. So let's see what I mean by that. First of all, let's recall that the cluster algebra is contained in this ring of Laurent polynomials. So, all my cluster variables are positive Laurent polynomials in the variables of one seed. Now, if I have a lattice isomorphism from this lattice N to M CERC, so M CERC is the lattice generating the ring of Laurent polynomials here, then due to the positivity of the Laurent phenomenon, I get what I call a positive parametrization. And by that, I mean a map from the cluster algebra to some other Laurent polynomial ring. Some other Laurent polynomial ring so that all the images of cluster variables are Laurent polynomials with non-negative coefficients. So, well, as here, every cluster variable is a positive Laurent polynomial in my initial variables. If I go through this map that is now the inverse of my lattice isomorphism that just sends monomials to monomials, well, that would also be a positive Laurent polynomial. Laurent polynomial. Great, so if I have that, I can define a map from a seed torus TM, or I'm not sure if there's a typo. I think it should not be TM. I think this should be a seed in the A variety. Anyway, I go to the Taurus, a big Taurus, again, who's Again, whose dimension is given by the number of cluster variables in my generating set, and I send an element in the small torus to evaluating all these positive Laurent polynomials on it on the right-hand side. Okay. And that's a map that I can tropicalize. So it would give me a map from MR to R to the B, where a point U is just sent to the tropicalization of all these Laurent polynomials and then evaluated. Laurent polynomials and then evaluated in U, where the tropicalization is again like we saw yesterday, replacing the sums by maximum and the multiplication by addition. So really, I'm just taking a maximum of all these dot products or dual product between u, the point I plug in, and n, an exponent vector appearing in the support of this Laurent polynomial. Okay, so. Okay, so let's check the example. This is what I'm what I, this is the map of the tori, if you like, or the image of the map of the tori. Well, here I start with the full list of all cluster variables. I already expressed them in my seed, my initial seed in A1, A2. These are the Laurent polynomials. And the images here is what I get on the right-hand side from the inverse of the B matrix or the inverse. The B matrix or the inverse of the P star map. And then I tropicalize it. So this is what I get. If I take a point in R2, its tropicalization will be this vector in R5, where I just take, for example, this one, x1, x2 plus x2, boils down to the maximum of b and a plus b. Okay. And then we can we can check, I mean. Check, I mean, this is a piecewise linear map, and we can compute its linear regions in R2. The linear regions turn out to be the cones of the cluster complex. And this essentially follows from the work of Della and collaborators that show the polytopality of the G fans. And yeah, so these are the linear regions of my map. I mean, in this case, you don't need to evoke any results. You can really just sit down and compute the linear regions. And on the rays, the dots on the rays, these are the images of the rays again. Okay, so again, I have like a cartoon of what the image is in R5. And then I can compare to my map that I constructed before. And if you look closely, if you just consider the rays, then you see the collection of rays I get is the same. So the image of all, of both maps is really the same fan in R5 in this case, but there's some weird swapping going on in the cone. So for example, if I started with a point in the positive orthant here, then its image went Then its image, well, was some combination of these two ray generators. And I will find the same point in the image, but on the left-hand side, but coming from a point where that light in the negative orcents. And it's unfortunately not just the all-over sign that I picked wrong at some point, but there's really this shift of the cones where if I pass to the second cone as one, then I will find it. Then I will find it as the image of this cone under the other piecewise in your map. Okay, good. But so then here's what I can say in general, in finite type about these different ways of constructing maps onto the tropicalization of an ideal. So there I will start again with a positive degraded cluster algebra of finite type, and I will assume it's exchange. Type and I will assume its exchange matrix is of full rank so that I can have a lattice isomorphism, which is really necessary to construct this positive parametrization map, at least the way I did it. And then the following three simplicial fans are realizations of the cluster complex in R to the number of all cluster variables. So the first one is the image of the cluster complex. The really of the cluster complex under my piece wise linear map œÜb. The second one is the image of this tropicalized positive parametrization. And the third one is the positive part of the tropicalization of the idea. So yeah, so the other theorem I've the first theorem I've showed you realize establish the connection between one and three in general, but I lose the property that I I lose the property that I can talk about all the positive part because, in general, well, I mean, it always just works for a finite collection of seeds, the connection. The second one is the one where I really need the full rank assumption on the B matrix, or where I need that it is an isomorphism. And yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. I wanted to say some more things. Okay, yeah, okay, okay. Sorry. So, one comment that actually I realized Melissa asked me yesterday, like, okay, but so this, the tropicalization of an ideal, it was known already here that it has the structure of a cluster complex. So, there was this work of Jan Lew Vestun, Barkani, Hamid, Hell, and Lam, where they showed that the positive part of the tropicalization of an ideal of this. Of the tropicalization of an ideal of this form has a fan structure that is the one of the cluster complex. But this fan really has, or this set has several fan structures. And this theorem adds on to that and says that the structure of the cluster complex that you have here is the one that of the G-fan as well. So these are in general two ways how you can put a fan structure on the positive part of a tropicalization, and they coincide. And they coincide. Then, yeah, so that two and three agree is also something that is somewhat already present in the literature in the work of Ben Le Boehm, Ren and Schritter. And yeah, so then maybe my last comment is on the corollary I written. Is on the corollary I've written in the top that is work of Ilten Negera, Chavez, and Treffinger that tell us in the case of a finite type cluster algebra, this idea that I'm considering in its Gruebnerfender, there's one unique maximal cone who which has several very good properties. One of them is that the Stanley-Reisner complex of this cone or of its monomial initial ideal. Or of its monomial initial ideal coincides with the cluster complex. That one consequence of that is that the standard monomial basis I get from the Grubner cone coincides with the basis of cluster monomials. And this result now adds on to that the rays of the positive part of the tropicalization are exactly the rays of this one unique maximal cone in the Gribner fan. And yeah, I think that's. And yeah, I think that's all I wanted to say. I thank you a lot for your attention. Happy birthday to Bernard. And I leave you with some references. Thank you very much for that lovely talk, Lara. So I guess we'll open up for questions now. We'll open up for questions now. First, if there's anyone in Zoom who has a question for Lara, if you could just unmute yourself and ask. Okay, in that case, let's open up questions to the room. So, maybe can you elaborate a little bit more? Maybe can you elaborate a little bit more what can one expect in the infinite cluster cases? I mean, the Grosvenor fan is always like a finite fan, and the cluster complex, it's an infinite fan. And yeah, so you said this, but maybe can you elaborate a little bit more? Yeah, thank you for the question. I think actually I have this last comment on the slide and I just forgot to say it. Yeah, so it's like you said. So, yeah, it's like you said, no, the Grebner fan and the tropicalization of an idea will always be a finite fan. So, in infinite type, we can not expect to have a map between, or at least not a map of fans between the cluster complex and whatever subfan of the Grebner fan we choose. These results allow to always kind of approximate by taking finite collections of seeds and still getting a map of fans. But beyond that, Um but beyond that, um I don't know. Maybe if yeah, it would I the only thing that comes to my mind would be like to take some limits to to study um a limit of a collection of Grubner fans or a limit of the of a collection of tropicalizations. But I haven't done that. So if anyone is interested, that would be great. I'm somewhat scared of limits still. I don't know something that I didn't get rid of since my undergrad studies. Up since my undergrad studies. Yeah, thank you. Anyone else? Okay, well, I guess if not, let's thank Laura again.
