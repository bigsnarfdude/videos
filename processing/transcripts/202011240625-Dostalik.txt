Some results on thermodynamically consistent derivation of micro-macro model for dilute polymeric fluids. And this is a joint work together with Josef Malek, Biet Prussia, and Andrea Sule. So first, I'm going to give a short introduction into micro-macro models. Second, I'm going to present a thermodynamically consistent derivation of a simple kinetic type model for Simple kinetic type model for non-isothermal flows of compressible dilute polymeric fluids. And third, we shall investigate the stability of the steady-state solution considering a thermodynamically closed system. And lastly, I'm going to finish my talk with conclusions. So, first of all, we are concerned with modeling polymeric fluids, which are non-Newtonian fluids in nature, and there are several effects. In nature, and there are several effects which demonstrate the difference between polymeric or say viscoelastic fluids and the standard viscous fluids. And these are probably all known to the audience. So let me just remind you here the fact that viscoelastic fluids are very sensitive to temperature variations. So it is of great interest to model their temperature evolution as well. Now, to describe the behavior of these complex fluids, we of course These complex fluids, we of course use the standard balance laws of continuum mechanics. So, here we have the balance of mass, the balance of linear momentum, where we do not consider any external forces, and the evolution equation for the internal energy, where J e is an energy flux. But since the Newtonian approach is incapable of describing the flow of polymeric fluids, we add an Of polymeric fluids, we add an extra stress tensorial quantity to the Cauchy stress tensor. And the central object of study in rheology is finding an expression for this tensorial quantity. So we can adopt a macroscopic approach and design an evolution equation for the extra stress tensor itself. The constitutive relation can be also given by an integral differential equation. And an alternative approach consists in finding The alternative approach consists in finding an expression for the extra stress tensor in terms of the microscopic dynamics of the polymer chains which make up the liquid. Polymer molecules differ from the small molecules treated in the usual kinetic theory of gases and liquids in several ways. They have great diversity in structure and molecular weight, and they also have a large number of internal degrees of freedom. And these photographs of molecular weight And these photographs of molecular models show the various conformations which a single polymer can attain. And of course, the pictures show only what the molecules look like at one instant of time. And through system, all of the molecules will be in a continual state of motion. Now, the kinetic theory offers several levels of description of the given fluid. A dilute solution of polymers in a Newtonian solvent can be described by a free Can be described by a freely jointed bead rot chain, which is made of a number of beads connected linearly by rigid segments. A coarser model of the same polymer is the freely jointed bead spring chain made of a smaller number of beads connected linearly by springs. And finally, a coarser model still is the single dumbbell that is two beads connected by a rod or a spring. And for the sake of simplicity, And for the sake of simplicity, in the rest of the talk, we shall concentrate on the simplest case of a Dumbbell spring model. Using classical mechanics and classical statistical mechanics, one can derive an evolution equation referred to as the Fokker-Planck equation for a probability density function phi. And this distribution function gives the probability of finding the dumbbell in the conformation given by the vector q. The vector q, while all the admissible configuration vectors are contained in a ball in R3, and there are two unknown flux terms, j phi x and j phiq, for which we shall derive the constitutive relations. And concerning the boundary conditions, we prescribe a no-flux boundary condition on the boundary of D, which has in fact two implications. The distribution function. The distribution function vanishes on the boundary of d, as well as the gradient of the distribution function. And this is related to the fact that we would have to spend an infinite amount of energy to stretch the dumbbell to the largest possible conformation. Now, in the following, we shall derive a simple kinetic type model for non-isothermal flows of compressible dilute polymeric fluids using only elementary arguments from continuum mechanics. From continuum mechanics and thermodynamics. And the proposed method is based on the identification of two scalar quantities: the first one being thermodynamic potential. In our case, the Helmholtz free energy, which is given by the following formula. Here, psi S corresponds to the Helmholtz free energy of the compressible solvent, which shall be specified later, while P is described by this formula. formula where kb is the Boltzmann constant and k is some positive scaling constant which shall be specified later and the symbol u denotes the so-called spring potential which is uh which is a function of the configuration vector q as well as of temperature and specifically for the dumbbell model a popular choice is the one proposed by varnish The one proposed by Warner, and it reads as follows. And we can know that the potential blows up to infinity, approaching some finite distance, which is related to the fact that we allow only finite extensions of the Dumbbell spring. Also note that we use the subscript S to denote the quantities corresponding to the solvent part of the fluid. And in fact, we assume that we are dealing with an infinitely diluted solution of polymer. An infinitely diluted solution of polymers, meaning the polymeric chains have no mass and hence no kinetic energy, and they do not change the density of the mixture. The second scalar quantity required for the successful derivation of the model is the entropy production, which we postulate in the following form. The entropy production should be a non negative quantity in order to guarantee the validity of the second law of thermodynamics. Of the second law of thermodynamics. And as we can see, this is indeed the case provided that all the constants appearing in the formula are positive. And recall that the entropy production appears on the right-hand side of the evolution equation for entropy eta, where J eta is an entropy flux. Our goal now is to find the constitutive relations for the unknown fluxes. For the unknown fluxes as well as for the Gauchy stress tensor. So the energy flux, entropy flux, and the fluxes appearing in the Fokker-Planck equation. And we are going to make use of simple phenomenological thermodynamic approach, which can be traced back to Rajakopal and Sunenevaza and their derivation of macroscopic scholastic models. So first we recall the standard thermodynamic. We recall the standard thermodynamic formulae relating the Helmholtz free energy, the internal energy, and the entropy. And taking the material derivative of this first formula yields the following equation. Multiplying by the solvent density and using the balances of mass and internal energy, we arrive at this equation. And finally, we recall the definition of our Helmholtz frequency. The definition of our Helmholtz free energy, and we also define thermodynamic pressure corresponding to the solvent part of the fluid by the standard formula. And what remains is the manipulation of this last term. So we find an explicit formula for it, where the material derivative of the distribution function here is obtained from the Fokker-Planck equation. And to manipulate the term, we exploit. The term, we exploit the boundary conditions for the distribution function mentioned earlier. So, after some lengthy manipulations, we finally arrive at an expression which can be compared with the general evolution equation for entropy. So, here we have the symmetric tensor P, which is given by this formula, and it is referred to as the Grammar's expression, and it is normally derived in the And it is normally derived in the kinetic theory framework. However, we did not assume it a priori, and we derived it as a consequence of the choice of the energy storage mechanisms and entropy-producing mechanisms. Further, Np denotes the polymer number density, or in other words, an integral of NP over a subdomain of omega gives the number of polymers in that subdomain. And lastly, And lastly, m denotes the mean normal stress, which is given by this standard formula. Okay, so we are finally in a position to write down the constitutive relations for the Cauchy stress tensor and for the unknown fluxes by comparing the right-hand side of the derived formula with the postulated entropy production. And the final formula reads as follows, and we note here. And we note here that the same constitutive relations has been derived by Eettinger and Germela using the generic formalism. The added value of our work is the simplicity of the phenomenological approach, which uses only basic concepts from thermodynamics. And from the derived constitutive relations, we can obtain explicit formulae of the balance laws. Moreover, we can also express the evolution. We can also express the evolution equation for temperature using the evolution equation for entropy and the standard thermodynamic relations where C V is the specific heat capacity at constant volume for the solvent part of the liquid. So after some manipulations, we can derive this evolution equation for the temperature. Okay, so in the last part of Okay, so in the last part of my talk, we shall investigate the stability of the steady-state solution of the derived governing equations in the special case of a thermodynamically closed system. So let us consider that the polymeric liquid occupies a mechanically and thermally isolated vessel. And in such a case, the steady state denoted by hat is spatially how much. Is a spatially homogeneous solution of the governing equations, and we refer to the steady state as an equilibrium rest state, as there is no energy flux through the boundary, and thus the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, phi hat is the steady-state solution of the Fokker-Planck equation, and Np hat is the spatially homogeneous polymer number density. So, it's the total number of polymeric changes. The total number of polymeric chains in the container divided by the volume of the container. Now, the expected behavior is that if the fluid is subject to some kind of perturbation, it will reach the steady state in the course of time. And to prove this, we can again exploit thermodynamic concepts. So, indeed, the elementary thermodynamic considerations lead us to a natural candidate for the Lapunov functional. Candidate for the Lapunov functional that can be used for obtaining the stability of the spatially homogeneous equilibrium resting. And the candidate reads as follows, where S beta hat denotes the scaled net entropy given by this formula, and eta denotes the net total energy of the system. And using again the well-known thermodynamic relations, the functional can be The functional can be rewritten in terms of the postulated Helmholtz free energy. And moreover, we split the functional into three parts corresponding to the kinetic energy of the fluid and then to the solvent part and polymeric parts whose formulae read as follows. Concerning the solvent part, remember that up until now we did not need to specify the explicit formula. To specify the explicit formula for the Hermold's free energy, we could use the polytropic gas equation of state, but since it is not a suitable choice for the polymeric fluids, we consider the so-called Noble-Abelstas-Stiffen equation of state, which was proposed quite recently. This is a generalization of the polytropic gas equation of state, which is capable of describing gases as well as liquid phases by As liquid phases by a suitable choice of the three parameters. And now to derive the explicit formula for the solvent part of the Lapunov functional, we make use of the fact that the temperature and density fields are spatially homogeneous in the equilibrium rest state and can be chosen as the reference values in the formula for the free energy, the solvent part of the free energy. Moreover, we expect. Moreover, we exploit the fact that we are dealing with a mechanically isolated system, which, in other words, means that the mass of the system is conserved. So we can add this term to the resulting formula freely, and by a suitable choice of the reference pressure and the parameter R, we arrive at this formula for the solvent part of the proposed functional. Now we take a closer look at the expressions in the brackets, and a simple analysis yields that both functions in the brackets are non-negative and vanish if and only if the corresponding field attains its equilibrium value. We thus obtain that the solvent part of the functional is non-negative and vanishes if and only if the temperature and the density relax to the equilibrium. The equilibrium. Concerning the polymeric part, we already know the expression for the quantity φp, which is related to the Helmholtz free energy of the polymeric part of the liquid. And since, again, we are dealing with a mechanically closed system, the number of polymeric chains is conserved, so we can add this term freely and adjust the three parameters K and S accordingly. Accordingly, and for the sake of easier manipulation, we also define an auxiliary quantity, which is in fact the stationary solution of the Fokker-Planck equation at a given temperature and a given polymeric number density. So finally, we can express the polymeric part of the functional in the following form. And closer inspection of the integrands again yields that the functional is non-negative. The functional is non-negative and vanishes if and only if the probability density of probability distribution relaxes to its equilibrium value. And finally, put all together, we managed to prove that the constructed functional is non-negative and vanishes if and only if the temperature, the density, and the distribution function all attain their equilibrium values. Moreover, using the fact that we are The fact that we are dealing with a thermodynamically closed system and that the net total energy is conserved, one can easily show that the time derivative of the proposed functional is non-positive. We are using here the fact that the entropy production is non-negative. Let me just stress here that we do not discuss here the relation between the Lapunov functional and the norm in the corresponding functional. And the norm in the corresponding function space, which is required for characterization of the convergence of the perturbations to zero. So the constructed functional has not been shown to be a Lyapunov functional in the strict sense of the word, but we still conclude that the perturbations decay to zero as time goes to infinity. In conclusion, we have derived a simple kinetic theory-type model for non-existent. Kinetic theory-type model for non-isothermal flows of compressible dilute polymeric liquids using a phenomenological thermodynamic approach. And the covering equations are not new, but the method of their derivation is, and the chosen approach can be seen as a simpler alternative to the generic framework approach. Lastly, we have successfully investigated the stability of the equilibrium rest state corresponding to the derived fluid model. To the derived fluid model. And the added value of this result lies in the fact that we did not use the polytropic gas equation of state for describing the solvent part of the liquid, but instead considered the more sophisticated and realistic Noble-Abel Stiffen gas equation of state.
