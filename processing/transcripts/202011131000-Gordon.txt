So I work for the Center for Health Genomics and Informatics, and we are the main sequencing center in Alberta, Canada, which is where BAMF is located. So a little bit of local content in there as well. When we're looking at Alberta specifically versus other contexts, Versus other contexts, we actually had quite deep sequencing, sorry, quite deep testing compared to a lot of other jurisdictions. And so we'd be able to look at some of this information and make some conclusions that might be a little more difficult otherwise. And so when we're making phylogenetic trees and so forth, we have a few assumptions that we're randomly subsampling the actual diversity, that you have somewhat discrete changes in the reproduction rate that can be modeled, and that you have high population mixing. You have high population mixing, and that you can effectively estimate the population size. And some of those assumptions might be a little tricky for SARS-CoV-2 and the outbreak that we have right now. And so we also have to consider if we're going to look at the depth of sampling that you've been doing from the population, are you doing a constant sampling effort the whole way along? And is there a constant lag between the data of reporting, which is what we get, and when the actual infection happened? And so those are considerations. Infection happened. And so, those are considerations that I've been trying to take into account here. And so, if you use lots, there's lots of existing packages for doing various kinds of estimates of reproduction rate at the STEM. For example, if you take that one and then do some estimates for Alberta, you get this kind of graph on the second line there with the estimates of reproduction number, instantaneous reproduction number. But it seemed to me that the 95% confidence interval on those was actually really pretty tight, tighter than what I can. Pretty tight, tighter than what I can justify from the data that I see. And so I think maybe the model could do some improvement in terms of the confidence intervals for these reproduction numbers. And this was using a serial interval, as you see on the bottom line there, under the assumption that most transmission is going to be happening asymptomatically. And so this is the transmission line as has been come out in a few publications, such as from the NBA study on asymptomatic. NBA study on asymptomatic transmission. And the issue is that we haven't done constant testing, right? If we look at the earliest testing that happened and starting in March, you have a few samples that you're testing. Obviously, you expect there's fewer cases, but then we just have this huge increase going up, which is good for us for lab purposes. But also, you'll see that the number of cases almost exactly tracks that. And so the question is: if you're just using the raw numbers, are you really getting a good estimate of RT? Estimate of RT. So I, if you actually look at each of these dots, represents an instantaneous RT estimate just based on the ratios over the sliding window. And then you've actually got huge variation. In some places, it looks kind of Gaussian. In some places, and it does pass your standard test for normal distribution. In other places, it's more of a Poisson process. And so, trying to combine those two aspects together, depending on Together, depending on how deeply we're actually sampling the population compared to the number of cases, and so we end up with some plots like this that we're generating. What you'll see is that we actually divide Alberta into different health zones, and you'll see that the trend within Alberta even is quite different in different areas. Here, we had a large meat packing plant outbreak in southern Alberta, and so a lot of things that we might do in terms of just doing an overall estimate for Alberta doesn't necessarily make sense, and so I'm Doesn't necessarily make sense. And so I'm trying to use multi-type birth-death models where you get migration between different districts, but mostly things are staying within a district or deem for doing the modeling. And so that software, in terms of taking the raw case information and the testing depth information straight off of the government websites, is going to allow you to generate these kinds of curves and then also create a kind of beast to configuration that is appropriate for a multi-programme. That is appropriate for a multi-type birth death model that incorporates some of this data. So you get better estimates of RT going into those analyses to break some of those or make less strong those assumptions that we had in the first slide about when we're doing phylogenetic analyses in these kinds of outbreak situations. You'll see it tried to combine just two aspects of the information here. One is the rate and then also the total number of cases, which we've got as a heat map. Number of cases, which we've got as a heat map on the bottom of the display. And I kind of found that that was the best visual representation to try to get that information out. So the one interesting thing here is that Edmonton zone, which is the green line, is pretty steady all the way along, whereas in all the other districts, we have larger changes in RT that happen over time. And so these kinds of things in terms of explicitly modeling migration are easier to do once you have these kinds of estimates. Thank you. Thank you. Excellent. Thanks very much. Maybe one quick question if anybody has one. Otherwise, we'll save them for the discussion session.
