So, to construct observables, they have to be diffeomorphism invariant. And so, usually this is done with a so-called relational approach where we define the locations of things relative to physical features of the state. So, in cosmology, that's very subtle and confusing, but in theories with an asymptotic boundary, it's relatively easy because we can locate observables relative to the asymptotic boundary. Okay, and that's not so bad. So, for example, we could. So, for example, we could fire a geodesic into the bulk of ADS CFT at some fixed, you know, firing the geodesic from some fixed boundary time at some fixed angle relative to the boundary, and then we could measure the bulk scalar at some fixed renormalized proper distance along the geodesic. So in addition to just generally being important in gravity, I would say diff invariance is also important specifically for this question of the black hole interior. For this question of the black hole interior, which is something many of us are interested in. So, you know, sometimes people say a little cavalierly that boundary time evolution can be used to evolve into the interior. But this is really a gauge-dependent statement, which is not literally true. So, for example, if you look at these pictures, right, this is the thermophil double, you might, or just the Schwarzschild geometry, you might like to evolve up into the interior here. But you see, if I start with some bulk Cauchy slide. see if I start with some bulk cauchy slice and I and I pull the endpoints up well you could say I evolved to this green slice but you could easily equally say that I evolved to this red slice right like the the difference between the green slice and the red slice and which is what I show here has nothing to do with boundary time evolution right and this evolution this difference between the red slice and the green slice that's what we really care about okay but um but that's generated by the Hamiltonian constraint right not by the boundary Hamiltonian so so think Boundary Hamiltonian. So, so thinking that evolution by the boundary Hamiltonians is telling about you about going into the interior is, in general, not a correct statement. It's only correct insofar as it's correlated with this statement. So that's one reason why diff invariance is important for the interior. Another reason is that if firewalls exist, so I don't know if they exist or not, I guess I still maybe think that they don't. But if they do, then they have to form some. Then they have to form somewhere. And I would say that in general, the event horizon is not a very reasonable place to expect firewalls to form, right? The event horizon is teleologically defined, right? There could be some big shell very far away, which changes the location of the event horizon, but hopefully has nothing to do with the dynamics of the black hole. So if you do want to have a theory of firewalls, you need to have some answer other than the event horizon for where firewalls form, and your answer needs to be a very important point. For where firewalls form, and your answer needs to be diff invariant. And then finally, and this is the one that I'll get at the most in this talk. So, in the so-called typicality arguments for firewalls, a key part of the argument is that you say that you can create matter near the horizon without a substantial cost in asymptotic energy, right? If that were not true, then you wouldn't be able to argue that firewalls are generic in the thermal ensemble because if you make In the thermal ensemble, because if you made one, it would increase the energy by too much to be typical in the thermal ensemble. But in gravity, the relationship between the asymptotic energy, you know, which is the thing which is related to this evolution at the boundary, and the local energy as observed by somebody living in the interior of the space is complicated, right? I mean, especially once you break the boost symmetry. So Schwarzdale has a boost symmetry that makes it a little easier to keep track of how energy in the bulk is related to energy in the bulk. Energy in the bulk is related to energy in the boundary. But once you break the boost symmetry, which we think, which a typical state it probably should, right, then it's not so clear how these energies should be related. And so really it was this understanding this third point was the motivation for us to study this question in detail in JT gravity. So indeed, in this talk, I'm going to talk about a paper from last August with Die Chang Wu, who's now at Santa Barbara, which studies Which studies bifeomorphism invariant observables in JT gravity in quite a bit of detail. Unfortunately, the paper is like 100 pages or something, although it's usually you don't have to read all of it. And so the basic idea is that we're going to use this thing called the parallels bracket, which I'll review in a minute, to compute the brackets, meaning puss-on brackets, of a large variety of different variant observables in classical J-tree gravity. In classical J-tree gravity coupled to matter. And we'll see that many of the interesting results about this theory that people have been excited about over the last few years, you can sort of recast as immediate consequences of this algebra once you have it. So by constructing this algebra of different variant observables, you really sort of capture a lot of the interesting dynamics of the theory. In particular, for example, this idea of traversable wormholes, the calculus. Wormholes, the calculation of the scrambling time, the existence of these families of SL2R charges implementing the ADS2 isometries on the matter fields. All that will come very naturally out of this algebra. And then we'll also see that we can really systematically study this question of how much does the boundary energy change if we create an excitation somewhere in the bulk in a diff invariant way, which allows us to study what you might call the firewall. Allows us to study what you might call the firewall energetics in the model. Now, for the most part, I'll just be doing JT gravity. That's one plus one dimensions. But actually, the methods that we use here all can be used in higher dimensions as well. So, you know, we don't use any of this stuff that's special to 2D like the Schwartzian. So, we can use the same technique to study higher dimensions. And I'll talk about a few examples at the end. Examples at the end, which will sort of indicate that what happens in JT gravity is sort of pretty robust. It's a reliable indicator of what's going to happen in higher dimensions. Okay, so let me first start by reminding you, or in most cases, probably introducing you to this idea of the Perels bracket. So when I learned about the Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity, it was awful. Everything was not covariant. You had to do this 3 plus 1 ADM decomposition. This three plus one ADM decomposition. If you wanted to compute a Poisson bracket, you had to do it using the Dirac bracket. So you had to pick a gauge, and it was awful. But in fact, there is this amazing alternative, which was invented by Perels long ago, which is called the Perels bracket, which is a completely covariant and Lorenzian way of computing the bracket of any two different variant observables, or actually in any field theory, computing any brackets you want in a covariant way. Covariant way. So here's the idea of the Perls bracket. So say you have some field theory, it may or may not be gravitational, and you have two observables, f and g, which are both gauge invariant. And so when you compute their bracket, you want to compute their bracket in some solution of the equations of motion, right? So the bracket is a function on phase space. So you have to say what point you're at in phase space. So in the covariant phase space, that's a solution, okay? And so here's how you compute the bracket. And so here's how you compute the bracket. So you want to compute the bracket of f and g. So the idea is you evaluate f on a deformed solution where this delta g is a is a solution of the linearized equations of motion about phi. And I'll tell you what delta g is in a minute. And then you just see how much f changes sort of in this direction of deforming the solution that you want to compute the bracket at. So it's kind of a linear response. Response interpretation of the Poisson bracket, which is actually what you want, right? I mean, the Poisson bracket should be a statement about linear response, and Perel's just kind of distilled out what the statement really is. Okay, but to interpret this, I have to tell you which linearized solution, delta G, do I use here, right? Okay, so let's go through that. So, delta G is a solution of the linearized equations of motion, and you construct it like this. So, first you take the action of the theory, and you deform it by minus kg, where just k is some infinitesimal. Kg, where just k is some infinitesimal parameter. And so this is how g, the bracket has to depend on both f and g, right? So here's where the g dependence comes from. We deform the action by minus kg. And then we construct advanced and retarded solutions. So the retarded solution I'll call delta phi r, the advanced solution delta phi A, which are solutions of the deformed equations of motion where this G is acting as a source. And so as usual, the retarded solution has to vanish at early times. Has to vanish at early times, the advanced solution has to vanish at late times, and that uniquely specifies it, at least if the initial value problem is well posed. And then finally, this delta G is just defined to be the difference. So it's the retarded solution minus the advanced solution. And so by using this algorithm, you see that we can compute the bracket of any two observables. And the only skill, technical skill that we need to have is we need to be able to solve the linearized equations of motion, right, which is something we can do. Of motion, right, which is something we can do completely covariantly. Okay, so I think it's actually quite nice, actually. It's sort of it's sad I didn't learn about it earlier, but anyways, I know about it now. Now, it's not obvious that this bracket coincides with the usual Poisson bracket that you define in the non-covariant way by introducing canonical momenta and so on. In Peralz's original paper, he showed that it does coincide for Tudor of his theories. For Tudor of his theories, he was a bit hand-wavy about gauge symmetries and so on. Because, as you know, the Hamiltonian formulation of gauge theories in the non-covariant method is pretty inconvenient. But in fact, you can show for general Lagrangian field theories that this does coincide with the Poisson bracket if you're willing to use this sort of fancier covariant phase space technology. And actually, that's something Jae Chang and I explained a couple of years ago. Go. It's been discussed in the literature before, but I would say more not so not well, neglecting some subtleties which can be important. So, okay, so this proof is kind of technical, and I don't want to have to explain covariant phase-space in this talk. So, instead, let me just explain an example where you can kind of see how the equivalence between these two works. So, sorry for dumping all the equations. I'll just go through them quickly. So, my example will be a free particle. The Lagrangian is x dot squared over 2. Is x dot squared over 2. And then I'll take my g, the thing I deform the action by, to just be some arbitrary function of x of 0 and x dot of 0. Okay, so just some deformation like this. So if you work out the equation of motion, there's two kinds of sources. There's a delta function source from dg dx, and there's a derivative of a delta function source from dg dx dot, okay, because you have to integrate by parts when you derive the equations of motion. Equations of motion. So then, when you look and see what the retarded and advanced solutions look like, so the retarded solution, there's a theta function. So it's zero below t equals zero. And then above it, you know, well, the solutions of this are always linear functions of t, right? So there's some kick. So there's a kick both of x, which is dg dx dot, and there's a kick of x dot, which is dg proportional to minus dg dx naught. There's the same kick going the other way gives you the advanced solution. So the gives you the advanced solution. So the the um the the delta gx, the linearized solution of the undeformed equations used in the Perls bracket is the difference of these two, which is just this. So this is indeed a solution of the linearized equations of motion. And then if you now use Perls' rule, you can just see indeed that the bracket of x with g is dg dx dot, and the bracket of x dot with g is minus dgx dot, dg dx, which is what you want from the Poisson bracket. Okay, so this is the Okay, so this is the simple situation where you can see that they coincide. All right. That's it for the Perels bracket. Now let's go on to JT gravity. So our goal today is to use this Perels bracket to study the algebra of diff-invariant observables in JT gravity in a way where we can actually compute them without having to pick a gauge or do anything else annoying. So this is JT gravity, I guess, if you made it this far in this. Gravity, I guess if you made it this far in this conference, you probably know what it is, but just in case you don't, it's a 2D gravity theory. There's a so-called dilettant phi, there's a dynamical metric g. There's this phi times r plus two term, and then I'm going to allow some matter Lagrangian, and then also there has to be some Gibbons Hawking type term here. You can also add a topological term, but since I'm doing everything classically here, it doesn't have any effect on the physics. So I'll just ignore the Einstein term. And then the boundary. term and then the boundary conditions are Diracle boundary conditions on the dilaton like this and then also on the metric so here gamma is the spatial boundary i'm always going to take gamma so i'm always going to be in lorenzian signature and i'll take gamma to have two components so there'll be two asymptotic boundaries zero plus one dimensional boundaries and then the asymptotic limit where the boundaries are infinitely far away is when i take this parameter epsilon appearing in the boundary conditions to zero which removes the infrared cutoff Which removes the infrared cutoff. The matter fields also have to obey boundary conditions. We don't really need to assume much about them, but just to be concrete, if you want, you can think of the matter as being a free scalar obeying some Diraclet boundary condition, pi equals zero. You don't have to think that if you don't want to. All right, so now let's introduce the set of diffeomorphism invariant observables that we're going to study. There's two kinds we can consider. They're observables that are Consider, there are observables that are defined with respect to one boundary, and then there are observables that are defined with respect to two boundaries. So, one obvious one boundary observable is the Hamiltonian. So in JT gravity, this is what the ADM Hamiltonian looks like. It's expressed in terms of the dilett and its normal derivative at the boundary. There's plus minus here because since there's two boundaries, I can have there's a Hamiltonian at the left boundary, which is the minus sign, and a Hamiltonian at the right boundary. sine and a Hamiltonian at the right boundary, which is the plus sign. And n mu here is the normal vector to the boundary. And we take epsilon to zero, like I said, in the infinite volume limit. And this is clearly gauge invariant, diff invariant. Another sort of more interesting maybe observable we can consider is this one I mentioned before. So here's some asymptotic, here's the asymptotic boundary here embedded into ADS2. We can just pick some time on the regulated boundary. We can fire a geodesic. Boundary, we can fire a geodesic into the bulk at some relative boost eta for some distance s, proper time distance s along the geodesic, and then we can evaluate a scalar matter operator at the end point of the geodesic. Okay, and so that's clearly diff-invariant, just constructed geometrically. So those are one boundary observables. We can also consider two boundary observables. So here are two boundaries. These dotted lines are the regulated boundaries at finite epsilon. Regulated boundaries at finite epsilon. So we can pick two boundary times, T minus and T plus, and then we can look at the geodesic that connects them. And the unlikely event that there's more than one such geodesic, we'll pick the shortest one. So one diff-invariant observables, we just take the length of this geodesic. That's diff-invariant, the length of the geodesic between time t minus and time t plus. Another diff-invariant observable is we can look at the relative Observables, we can look at the relative boost of this geodesic compared to the rest frame of the asymptotic boundaries. So there'll be two of those, right? There'll be some rest frame over here. The geodesic will arrive, and we can look at the angle, the relative boost between this and the normal to the boundary, and the same over here. So there will be an eta plus and an eta minus. Here I've just labeled the various, you know, n mu is the normal to the boundary, u mu is the tangent to the boundary, e mu and tau. To the boundary. Eμ and tau mu are the normal and the tangent and normal to this geodesic. And then finally, we can also, you know, at any point along this geodesic, so let's label this geodesic by an affine parameter lambda, which is zero at the left boundary and one at the right boundary. Then we can just evaluate a scalar matter field at some fixed affine parameter lambda along this geodesic, and that's also diff-invariant. And that's also diff invariant. So that's our list of observables. Now, that list is actually not quite good enough because in the epsilon goes to zero limit, some of these observables have divergences. So we have to renormalize them a little bit. So as we take epsilon to zero, we should define a renormalized length, which removes some logarithmic divergence in the length of this. And we should also rescale eta, the relative boost, by this, again, this boundary value. By this again, this boundary value of the deltons. Remember, the boundary value of the delta has this epsilon in it, right? So that's just a way of saying it in a very different, you know, in a very sort of physical way. We just rescale by the boundary value of the delta to define some renormalized length, some renormalized boost, relative boost. Okay, now here's the, so I'm not going to, so then we use the parallels bracket. We can compute all the, we can compute the bracket of any two of these. Okay, so here are all the brackets. Two of these. Okay, so here are all the brackets. I'm not going to walk you through all of the answers in general. I'll just say that we worked really hard to compute all of these brackets using the Perels method. I mean, we worked hard because there's a lot of them. Any one of them, it's not that bad. Basically, you're always just solving the equation of geodesic deviation. So if you can solve the equation of geodesic deviation, then you can compute these brackets, you know, because you want a linear response. You know, because you want a linear response, right? So the geodesic gets deformed a little bit when you deform the action, and you see how it deforms, and that tells you how the operator responds. Okay, so that's the calculation that you do. We did it a whole bunch of times. In fact, we did it twice this many times because each of these brackets, you can compute it either way by picking which one to deform the action by. And then you can check that you get the same answer up to a minus sign. So I'm pretty sure they're all right because we got the same answer every time. The only comment I'll make about these results is that. The only comment I'll make about these results is that the first six of these are kind of interesting because they show that L tilde, the length of the geodesic connecting the two boundaries, and then these two relative boosts and also the two Hamiltonians, generate a closed algebra. So you see, if you look at these six, that's the, these are the brackets of L with eta and L with H and eta with H and H with H and eta with eta, right? And you see on the right-hand side here, we only get L's and etas and H's. Okay, so this is some interesting. Okay, so this is some interesting infinite-dimensional algebra, which we call the gravitational algebra, that captures a lot of the dynamics of this theory. And in fact, you can actually solve the time dependence of this gravitational algebra in close form. So that's kind of interesting. Then there are also also all these ones that involve the matter fields, which I'll comment on occasionally below, but I won't try to walk you through the details of them now. So, okay, so that's the computation of the algebra. Now let's do some of the applications. So it's easy to check that if you don't have any matter fields, then this algebra is compatible with the one you get just from studying the phase space of pure JT gravity, which Dan Jefferson and I showed a couple of years ago, is a theory where the two boundary Hamiltonians are always equal because of the constraints, the two etas are always equal because of the constraints. And the Hamiltonian is just And the Hamiltonian is just the Hamiltonian of a quantum mechanical particle moving in an exponential potential. So, remember, L and eta are canonical conjugates, right? That's what this equation says. So this is the Hamiltonian for a particle moving in an exponential potential. And so if you, in this theory, you can compute the brackets. You can check that you get the same brackets here, although I emphasize that these brackets hold even when the matter fields are present, whereas this is only true if there's no matter. So, moreover, when there is matter, you can construct a two-parameter family of SL2R2R charges that all live within this gravitational algebra. So the gravitational algebra, remind you, is the algebra generated by eta and L and H. So within that big infinite dimensional algebra, I can construct a two-parameter family of SL2R charges, which implement the ADS2 isometries on the matter fields. Two isometries on the matter fields. And so here's what the SL2R generators look like in terms of this eta and L and H. So the basic idea to guess these generators is you want things that are zero when there aren't any matter fields. And so for example, P0 is eta plus minus eta minus, but you see those are equal if there's no matter fields. Or p plus minus is something times this difference of the Hamiltonian with the with the exponent particle and the exponential potential Hamiltonian, right? So this is again zero if there are no matter Again, zero if there are no matter fields. But in general, they're not zero if they're matter fields. You can check that they obey the SL2R algebra, and you can also show that they act on the matter fields like the ADS isometries. So you can match onto the action which was constructed by Henry, Huan, and Ying a couple of years ago. Somehow I, you know, for my money, I find it a little bit nicer to focus on the gravitational algebra because that's one big consistent thing. It includes the Hamiltonian. Whereas here, you have Hamiltonian. Whereas here you have a bunch of different SL2Rs because this algebra doesn't contain the Hamiltonian. And so the way you get the two-parameter family is you evolve this with the left and right Hamiltonians, and that kind of moves you around within this gravitational algebra. So the gravitational algebra is like sort of the bigger thing. Okay, so that's one application. Another application, so you can think about this traversable wormhole story. Several people already mentioned it. So Gao Jaffrits and Wall explained how you can make a Explained how you can make a two-boundary wormhole a little bit traversable. One feature of their construction, which I found a bit annoying, I think it also puzzled some other people, is that although this traversability is a purely geometric thing, right, you're just making the wormhole a little bit shorter, the constructions that were done had to use manner fields. And okay, maybe that's fine, but moreover, the manner fields had to obey all these weird constraints. So like in the Gau Jaffris Walpole. Constraints. So, like in the Gal Jaffrist wallpaper, there was some bound on the mass of the matter field that had to be obeyed. In later papers, for example, you needed a large number of species, something like, you know, things that seem too specific for a phenomenon as general as this. Okay. So let me try to explain how to think about that from the algebra point of view. So in JT gravity, so there was this nice paper by Juan and Douglas and Jenby. And Douglas and Jenbein from 2017, where they showed that how you should really think about this traversable wormhole in JT is just that you give the boundaries a little kick at t equals zero. You give them a little inwards kick. So here's the wormhole prior to the kick. You know, if you send a signal through, it doesn't make it through the wormhole. But now if you kick the blue lines both inward a little bit, then it takes them longer to get back to the boundary. And then now this signal has time to get out. So you can think of this kick of the boundaries as a Think of this kick of the boundaries as a kick in the relative boost of the geodesic connecting these two points, right? If you think about the geodesic connecting these two, when I turn on this kick, okay, the eta, the relative boost, jumps. And if you sort through our conventions, it jumps in the negative direction. But you see, this first line of the gravitational algebra told us that L and eta are, well, L tilde and eta tilde are canonical conjugates. So in other words, they generate trans. So in other words, they generate translations of each other. And so thus, if you deform the action by L tilde with the right sign, you'll generate exactly these kicks where both of the boundaries jump inwards. And in fact, the retarded solution that you use in computing the Perels bracket, where you turn on L tilde, is exactly this solution here where the boundaries jump in. This picture here is the retarded solution, and the retarded solution has a traversal. And the retarded solution has a traversable wormhole. So, in other words, what you can say is that the real mechanism, the real power behind the scenes in the traversable wormhole story is that there's a deformation of the action by L tilde, which is indeed a purely geometric thing, right? Which makes sense because you're trying to get a geometric result. So you turn on a geometric deformation. Okay, now on the other hand, okay, so why in the previous story did we need to have? Why in the previous story did we need to have matter fields obeying these funny requirements? So, the reason is because although this L tilde is really the thing that's really driving what's going on, it's kind of hard to represent this L tilde directly in the CFT if you want to think about this from a dual CFT point of view. So, I'm doing everything in the bulk, so I don't care, but if I want to do it in the dual CFT, then I have to, how do I deform the dual CFT action by L tilde, right? So, in fact, this is closely. This is closely related to this issue of the factorization problem between the two boundaries, which lots of people have been talking about in this conference. So, I had a paper back in 2015 where I thought about the gauge version of this, where you can have a Wilson line that goes from one boundary to the other. And I argued for the existence of such Wilson lines to be consistent with the tensor product nature of the boundary Hilbert space, you need to be allowed to split the Wilson line into charges in half by using charge matter fields. Using charge matter fields. And so, what's really going on in this story of the traversable wormhole is that this L tilde is basically a gravitational Wilson line. And to fit it into the CFT description, you have to split it using matter fields. And so that split, like these two charges here, is this double trace deformation that couples the two sides. And then moreover, you don't, to do the split from the bulk point of view, you really want these two points to be near each other so that you can do the OPE and replace it by L. And replace it by L. But then, in the, you know, then if they're near each other, this operator is pretty non-local in time from the boundary point of view. So, actually, you'd like to pull these operators all the way back to the boundary, you know, which will mean that the projection onto this L will in general be quite small. And then you have to fiddle around with the matter fields to sort of try to blow back up the contribution of this L. And that's the origin of these funny constraints on the matter fields. Okay. Daniel, here's our five-minute warning. Daniel, here's a five-minute warning. Okay, thanks. Um, so finally, um, so okay, so another application, the story of scrambling, this will just be one slide. So, I mentioned already, so the time dependence of this gravitational algebra is solvable. So, when I wrote down all the brackets before, I computed them at equal times, but actually, every bracket that I wrote down, we can compute it at unequal times too, by using the solution of the gravitational algebra. So, I won't write out the details, but in particular, But in particular, you can take the thermofield double state with some fixed horizon value h for the delta and some inverse temperature beta. And then you can show that if you look at this L tilde operator at two different boundary times, you know, plus t minus t, and you compute its algebra with the deformation, you know, with the perturbation on one side, which is a one-sided dressed operator. Then as you change these times, this commutator grows exponentially with t, but is suppressed by. With T, but is suppressed by 1 over phi h. And so then this commutator becomes large precisely at a time, which, if you look at this exponential growth, is beta over 2 pi times log of phi h. Phi h is basically the near extremal entropy. And so if you go read the collected works of Stephen Douglas, you'll learn that this is sort of precisely a diagnostic of scrambling, right? And this phi H is this entropy above. Phi H is this entropy above externality, which is so this is the correct scrambling time for near extremal black holes, as was explained in a paper by Leichenauer. Okay, so that just comes again right out of this algebra. All right, finally, I want to get to this question of the firewall energetics. So that's the question of if I use a matter field to create a particle somewhere in the middle of the bulk, how much does the boundary energy change? Okay, so that can be answered using this bracket. Can be answered using this bracket of the Hamiltonian with the one-sided dressed matter operator. So it looks like a mess in general, but if you smear it against a wave packet to give it some definite momentum and really create a particle, then you get some fully general formula here, true in any state of JT gravity plus matter, which tells you how much the boundary energy changes if you create a particle of local momentum k in its rest frame, in the rest frame of the geodesic. The rest frame of the geodesic. Plus or minus tells you whether it's a left or right moving particle. And then these other parameters, eta tilde, s tilde, are just the parameters of the dressing geodesic that told you where to put the particle. Okay, so this is a completely general formula. Maybe it's a little hard to parse. So let me first tell you how it works in a thermofield double. This case was already studied by Ahmed. So here, blue means that the energy change is positive, red means that the energy change is negative. So here I should in my geodesic. Negative. So here I shoot in my geodesic, I can create a particle either going to the right or to the left. So if the particle is in the left exterior, then the left energy increases whichever way the particle is going. If I shoot it into the interior, then the left energy increases if the particle is going to the right, but it decreases if the particle is going to the left. And then finally, if I shoot it all the way through, then the left energy of the particle decreases whether the particle is moving to the left or to the right. And I should say the right energy is. And I should say the right energy is zero because the particle energy, this operator addressed to the left always commutes with the right Hamiltonian. Okay. So this is kind of natural from a quasi-particle point of view. This is also kind of trivial though, because there's a boost isometry. So you don't have to do this Perels bracket to study this state. You can just compute the derivative of psi with respect to the killing vector since you have one. And that agrees with what you get from the Perels bracket. But what you really want are states with matter, right? That's what's interesting. With matter, right? That's what's interesting. Then you break this isometry, but this formula I wrote didn't use the isometry at all, right? So this formula is true in any state. So in particular, if we restrict to conformal matter, then any state can always be interpreted as some, at least the stress tensor for any state is always just some superposition of some null shock waves that are bouncing around like this. So these solutions don't have a boosted isometry. So now you really need the Perels bracket if you want to compute the energy. Compute the energy. What we found, however, though, is that there's a kind of funny property of these solutions, which is that the delton solution exterior to all the shock waves is the same before and after the shock reflects off the boundary. And so when you compute the excitation energy, you can actually always just replace it by a computation where you throw away all the shells and you just use the solution to the kind of to the left of all the shells. You just kind of extend that in. And then because the shells don't back react on the metric, this On the metric, this guy ends up, it's the location of this point relative to the horizon is the same in this sort of effective geometry as it would have been in this geometry with the shells. So in other words, what you learn is that you indeed can, there's one diff invariant operator which you can use to create negative energy just behind the horizon in any of the states with the fixed energy h, which is just what you want for the firewall typicality argument. So in other words, the energetics here work out in the way that Merlin Polch. Here work out in the way that Mariloff and Polchinski would have hoped that they would have worked out. To say that even if there are these various shells floating around and so on, you still have a different variant operator that can create negative energy particles going to the left just inside the horizon. Okay. Now, the last thing I say, and then I'll stop. So you could say, what about higher dimensions? Well, so far in this talk, we only studied JT gravity, but we can also apply the method, just geodesic deviation and so on, right, to higher dimensions as well. So a first example we can do. So, a first example we can do are these multi-shockwave solutions on the BTZ black hole that Stephen Douglas studied back in 2014. So, these are solutions where the 3D metric has some, there's some effective 2D metric, there's some piece that multiplies the angular coordinate on the circle, and then there's some stress tensor that only has legs in the two dimensions, the radial and the time directions. But actually, if you just take this onsatz and you make the replacement where you take the radius and replay, call it 16 pi. And replace, call it 16π g phi, and you replace t tilde by 1 over f times, right, times t, then the three-dimensional Einstein equations just become the JT gravity equations, including the stress tensor. And so this gives you a machine to translate between the JT solutions and 3D solutions that have this form. And in fact, the Schenker-Stanford geometries are just the images of the JT shockwave solutions I just discussed, but past. Solutions I just discussed that passed through this map. And since the two-dimensional metric is the same on both sides of the map, the energies work out the same. So, in these shockwave solutions, it's still true. There's a diff invariant operator that in any of these states creates something of negative energy moving to the left of the horizon, regardless of how many shocks there are, where they are, et cetera. Okay. Now, that clearly is too much to ask for in general. And in particular, so to get something where the story is more interesting, you can turn. The story is more interesting. You can turn on what I'll call transverse pressure. So, you instead of setting the stress tensor to look like that, I can add a little bit of T on the sphere. Okay, and this is not a crazy thing to do. In fact, if you have like some S-wave particle, you know, like a Hawking quanta, then that does have non-zero T hat. So the shells that Douglas and Steve studied are sort of, are not coherent shells. They're shells where you just have a bunch of massless particles that are all localized next to each other going out. Next to each other, going out. They're not like an S wave of a coherent wave of a wave of a field. They're a bunch of little particles all going out. So, and just to do one concrete calculation, and then I'll stop, right? So here's a fun little setup. We can say we start with the BTZ black hole, but then we say at some very late time there's some shell coming out, but it's one of these shells with transverse pressure. So it's like a Hawking particle instead of a dust shell. Instead of a dust shell, a massless dust shell. And then I can ask, what's the, you know, okay, and so then now that as this is going to come out at very late times, right? So I mean, in a typical state, there might be some probability that this happens, right? You know, at some late time, some thermal scale shell comes out, thermal scale Hawking particle. And then I ask, how much effect does that have on the excitation energy of acting with the dress matter operator here to create a particle, say, going to the left just inside the horizon? Okay, so now that's, so that's a non-trivial. Okay, so now that's so that's a non-trivial calculation. Now it took us several months to figure out how to do it, but we eventually figured out how to do it. There is now a non-zero change in the excitation energy, so it's not just what you have from JT, and in particular, it doesn't change sign right at the horizon anymore. There are corrections. But in fact, the corrections are small. So we went back and forth for a while because they're terms that look like it'll degrow exponentially with T, but in the end, those are all gauge artifacts. And you're left with something that decays exponentially. That decays exponentially with t. So there's a shift in the expectation in the excitation energy, which is of order g newton, the three-dimensional g newton, times e to the minus rst. So at very large t, the shell has almost no effect on the energetics of this particle, which is kind of interesting. There's probably some interpretation about that, about high-energy gravitational scattering, but I haven't figured it out. Okay, so conclusions. So we've seen the algebra that we can compute this algebra in many cases. Cases. In particular, we can compute this excitation energy of the particle in JT, for any state of JT coupled to conformal matter, and the conclusions are compatible with Meroff and Polchinski's typicality argument. In higher dimensions, it's more complicated. There's no non-trivial back reaction once we include this transverse pressure. But the results are still compatible with Merrill Finn-Polchinsky because the corrections are small. At least they're suppressed by G. Noonan. And if you go to this large time separation, then, okay, you think there's a large relative boost. Then, okay, you think there's a large relative boost, it might give you a big effect, but everything that grows exponentially is a gauge artifact, and so you're left with the physical part actually decreases with T instead of increasing with T. Okay, so you know, so at least for these states that, you know, maybe are a little more typical than the thermofield double, Marov-Polchinsky looks good. You know, on the other hand, I don't know what a typical state looks like, so I can't claim that this decisively settles the validity of Miroff-Polchinsky, the status of the energetic part of Mero-Cz. The status of the energetic part of Maril's Polchinski, but you know, probably it looks fine to me. All right, that's it. Thank you. Sorry for going a little bit over. Thanks very much. I see we have a question from Henry in the chat. Go ahead, Henry. Hi, thanks. The nice talk, Daniel. I wondered if you considered any thought about any operators that are really not dressed to the boundary, but just dressed relationally. Boundary, but just dressed relationally to, I don't know. So you could say we turn on a source for some matter field in a region where the dilaton takes some particular value, and maybe some other matter field takes a value. So, you know, this is the kind of thing we want to have as a local operator that's excited in a, at least around some state, it's going to be a local operator supported in some confident region. You need more details, I guess. Yeah, it's a little bit hard to be fully. Yeah, I mean, it's hard to come up with rules like that. It's hard to come up with rules like that that make sense in all the states. One thing we tried, actually, mostly Jaechang, at some point he computed some brackets where instead of dressing to the two boundaries, you have a geodesic where one edge is on a boundary and the other edge is on the quantum, is on the extremal surface for the dilaton. And so those are computable also. I guess in the end, we sort of, the paper was 100 pages already, and we didn't want to, we got to, at some point, we. And we didn't want to, we got at some point, we got tired of doing geodesic deviation. Yeah, but certainly things like that you can compute. I guess if you if you try to just dress with respect to the quantum extremal surface, you've got to have a problem because you don't know what's the rest frame of the quantum extremal surface. So if you have to somehow find a way to pick a rest frame for the quantum extremal surface, that's kind of what this firing geodesic to the boundary does. But if you can think of, yeah, if you can think of a way to do it, then we can compute. If you can think of a way to do it, then we can compute it. Yeah. Yeah, a specific example is if you've got enough matter fields to make a clock field, then you can just, or you know, a clock field and a location field, you can make local coordinates based on things, and then you can just turn on sources for matter where the strength of the source depends on the values of the background fields. But that's sort of a kind of thing that you need to get, yeah, gets into messy details. Yeah, I mean, I mean, I think any in JT, I think any situation. think any in jt i think any such thing can be done because the only skill you need to have is being able to solve the equations of motion and in jt that's a skill that we have so uh yeah let's take one more quick question maybe yeah i have a question uh uh what's the uh what's the interpretation of this gravitational algebra in the boundary theory is there something you can say um i'm not sure I'm not sure. I mean, some of it I know, right? Like, I certainly know what the Hamiltonians mean. Yeah, but the interpretation of L and eta is more subtle because it gets into this question, right, from the CFT point of view, how are we supposed to think about L? So I think L, you know, this L is really, I mean, this is right, right. So I guess in 2015, I called this the factorization problem. It's actually kind of. Factorization problem. It's actually kind of the same as the factorization problem of Malta Sena and Maois, but it didn't realize, I didn't know so much about that in 2015. But these things that are defined relationally from one boundary to the other can't really make sense in all the states. Because if they did, then the Hilbert space wouldn't factorize. And so that makes it hard to just give an obvious CFT expression for what this L is, you know, just the same as the Wilson line for a gauge field going from one boundary to the other. Boundary to the other. It has to somehow be emergent. So there probably should be some nice story about sort of how this algebra emerges from the dual CFT. I think it should be a pretty sort of generic phenomenon, but I can't say I have anything too brilliant to say about it at the moment. It might be related to your hydro story, actually. Yeah, this is not a symmetry. This is not a symmetry algebra, right? Is this a symmetry algebra? Well, I guess it depends what we mean by symmetry. So it's an algebra of operators which contains the Hamiltonian. So in some sense, it's a symmetry algebra, right? You know, it's, but it's, yeah, it's not, but it's, it's only a pro, but I mean, it's approximate, right? Like, I mean, it's exact in the bulk description, but in the dual description, it's approximate because you've really got to be able to split. Really got to be able to split sure because it's not compatible, it's factorization. Yeah, I mean, this quantity L, which is, I mean, this distance between two boundaries, right, is what Leni and company want to define in terms of complexity. Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right, yeah. And so this is like sort of the classical mechanics of complexity might be one way to try to talk about it. Yeah. Well, it's some observable that is clearly a reasonable observable from the Reasonable observable from the point of view of perturbative gravity, right? Right. But it's hard to define. Yeah, well, right. So, in this paper with Jaffris, where we kind of introduced this L, yeah, we indeed observed that, you know, from the point of view of this quantum mechanics with an exponential potential, right, this L is non-compact, right? It can get as big as you want. But that's, you know, that's really intention with, you know, if you think that the Hilbert space is a product of two things. The Hilbert space is a product of two things with finite entropy, then that can't really be true. You know, the continuous density of states of this model must be fake. And one way you can think about that is that there's an IR cutoff on the size of L. And so that's kind of the way we tried to talk about it in this paper. You know, that it's somehow that it's introduced by the same physics that allows the partition function to factorize. You know, because in this two-boundary theory, the partition function. because in this two boundary theory the partition function doesn't factorize so right i mean it's the usual i mean yeah it's the usual issue so somehow l needs to be regulated to allow it to factorize yeah i guess i was just commenting on the fact that they have a more radical proposal there somehow saying that l somehow is something weird there that yeah it cannot be uh i think i think a question is whether a question is whether A question is whether L is something we can define within the standard framework of classical limits and so on, right? It's something that seems to apply to emerging a classical limit. Yeah, so the way I think about this is it's a bit like the relationship between entropy and area, right? So, you know, area is a nice bulk linear operator and so on, but sometimes we like to say it's equal to entropy, but that's true in some restricted, you know, that's only. That's true in some restricted, you know, that's only true in some states and, you know, I mean, all the usual, right? So you can have a bunch of states where it's true that entropy equals area. And I think also you can have a bunch of states where it's true that complexity equals length. But it can't be true in all the states, right? Yeah, I'm not advocating for complexity, but I'm just saying that this is something that makes sense in some classical limit, right? Yeah, yeah. And we would like to understand. We would like to understand what is that sense and what I mean it's a bit like the phase of a superconductor, right? And then, yeah, yeah, in you know, if you have a system with a finite number of particles and so on, the phase of a superconductor is not quite well defined. Yeah, yeah. And I think we're facing something similar here. Yeah, I mean, absolutely. Yeah. And that was certainly, I mean, to me, this, you know, the way that Daniel and I got into this was that we were trying to think about the gravity analog of this story with the Wilson line, and it was exactly there. Wilson line, and it was exactly there again. You have this emergent gauge field that somehow you know is there in the bulk, but not really there in the boundary. And yeah, how can we think about that? Well, this one is literally the phase of superconductor. Yeah, this one is literally the phase of the superconductor. That's right, exactly. Sorry, since it's running late, let me suggest that we move the discussion on to remove either Mark or I will put the link in the chat. So. So let's thank Daniel one more time. So we can keep discussing over coffee. And I guess I'll see everyone tomorrow morning. Thanks.
