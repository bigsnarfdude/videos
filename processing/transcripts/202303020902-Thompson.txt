I like the idea. Um, okay, cool. So, what's what's the uh you know this is very much a work in progress talk, and there's more questions than answers, but there are some answers. So, that's the first disclaimer. So, where did this kind of start from when, you know, why should you care about this kind of thing? I mean, you know, type 2 degenerations are somehow the sort of neglected sibling of degenerations of K3 surfaces, right? There's lots of energy that's been put into studying type 3s and, you know. And especially from sort of a mirror symmetry standpoint, type 3 degenerations show up a lot because these are where you sort of have your maximum unit prototype points, where you do your mirror symmetry. And, you know, type 2 degenerations, there's the Kulikov classification. The Kulikov classification sort of says, I mean, maybe I'll draw. This is not really the style at all. It's just sort of a bit of spoken motivation. They sort of look like accordions, right? And on the two ends, you've got rational surfaces. Rational surfaces, and in the middle you've got elliptic ruled surfaces, and they're all glued along elliptic curves. And so, you know, Kulikov came up with this, and everyone said, Well, okay, you know, we understand rational surfaces, we understand elliptic ruled surfaces, they're smooth elliptic curves, fine, you know, nothing really to do. So part of this is, you know, like revisiting these, trying to see if we can get something. And it turns out that if you look at the sort of, you know, everything for K3 surfaces, lattices, if you look at the lattice theory, each one of these things has got a lattice or so. Lattice theory, each one of these things has got a lattice associated to it. If you play around with examples, you very quickly notice that these lattices seem to predict something about the structure of these degenerations, in particular the types of surfaces that are appearing. And this is, you know, part of this work is trying to sort of understand can we make that formal? Can we figure out how that actually works? And in particular, this sort of leads into some stuff in mirror symmetry. So that's the motivation. Let's get started. Let's get started. So, I've got this word pseudo-lattices up here. And somehow, you know, I think this is the right way of extending. So, for K3 surfaces, you're looking at lattice theory. I think if you want to look at type 2 degenerations, they're really pseudo lattices of the thing you want to care about. References for this section, the main one is Kuznetsov. I had a paper in 2017. That's where most of what I'm going to say here comes from. What I'm going to say here comes from it's based on some earlier work by some other people who I don't have written on my piece of paper. And then I have a paper with Andrew Harder in 2020 where some more of this stuff was done. Okay, so what are these things? What are pseudo-lattices? So a pseudo-lattice G, it's effectively Zn along with a bilinear form. Along with a bilinear form, I'm going to assume non-degenerate for the bilinear form. What am I not going to assume? Why is it a pseudo lattice, not a lattice? I'm not going to assume that the bilinear form is symmetric. So, not symmetric. Okay, so now there's going to be a kind of sort of wall of death. Of sort of wall of definitions, and I'll motivate where the definitions come from when I've told you what the definitions are. So, G is called surface-like if the following things happen, if there exists a point P in G, P is called a point-like element, such that. So, effectively, this is saying, so I have the following set of things. Set of things. I want P to be isotropic. I want P to commute with everything. So the bilinear form should be symmetric for P, and this is for any U in G. And finally, I want if U and V are both orthogonal to P. Orthogonal to P. So if these satisfy UP and VP are both zero, because of condition two, it doesn't matter which order I'm doing this in, they're u and v commute. Okay, so I'll sort of tell you where these come from in a little bit when I've given bit when I've given a few more definitions sort of get through get through the background stuff first so if I've got a surface like pseudo lattice then I call p perp over p this is again well defined because of property two this is called the neuron severi lattice N S and G okay and because of condition three Nelson is actually a lattice. This is not a pseudo lattice. The bilinear form is symmetric on here. So this extracts a lattice out of your surface. There is, and I'm not going to say how you define it. Is, and I'm not going to say how you define it. NSG contains a canonical class. So is this P that's in G unique, or there could be a bunch of stuff? There could be more than one of them. And then in this construction, do you have to sort of do all of them, or you can do them one at a time like that? So, in the case we're going to care about, okay, I'll give you the example now. The case we care about, and I'll The case we care about, and I'll tell you the first bit. So here is the example. If X is non-singular, rational with minus K of X smooth, or containing a smooth, you know, I've got a smooth anti-conformative item. Then if I take the numerical growth and deep group of the derived category of Group of the derived category of coherent sheaves on X, dB co of X. Let's get the notation right. So if I take this thing, this, along with the Euler form, is a surface-like pseudo lattice. And what's the point-like element P? The point-like element P is just the class of a point. And what's the narrowness of area lattice? The narrow severity is just exactly the narrow severity of X. Exactly the narrative value of X. And what's the canonical class? The canonical class is the canonical class of X. So what makes a class a canonical class? You are about to define what the canonical class is. I'm not going to give the definition because it's kind of fiddly and technical and requires me to define some extra stuff. But effectively, there's sort of a rank operator on here, and then there's an equation saying a class that satisfies this equation is called a canonical class, and then because Netsoft proves this is unique. You know, because Netsor proves this is unique. But the way to think of it is, you know, it's sort of a new point. So is it the thing that does, is it related to a surfactor? Yeah. I am about to, well, okay, sorry. Yeah. So in this case, you're all getting ahead of me. This is all going well off the rails. So in this case, the narrative vary up. This thing, I call this big G. G. Neil's varies is Neil's variety of G. K of G is K of X. So it all works. So X is a dimension of two ways. Yes, yeah, yeah. So ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is a surface. How does the parent work in this example? Is it not too hard to describe? Yeah, so this is the. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. You are the variant. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. You weren't bearing on the derived category of coherency, it's this thing. I should really have printed out the papers or bought my laptop or something so I could give the official definitions of all this. But all I have is these four sheets of paper in it. All the things written on it. Okay, cool. So, we also in these cases we have there is a SERE operator. Is a Ser operator. What's a Ser operator? A Ser operator is an automorphism SG of G such that the following condition holds. The form of U and V is the same as the form of V and the Ser operator of U. The Ser operator of U. In my example, the Ser operator is just exactly the Ser operator you think it's going to be. So maybe I'll do running example raiser. So maybe in my running example, we'll say in the example, SG is utensil. You tensor with omega x and then twist by n. So that's just the usual set operator. But the point is, like, all of this is sort of defined abstractly on the lattices, right? We don't have to necessarily do this. So give me the example n plus 2. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes. I mean, this is yeah. This this the the sound operator doesn't need your thing to be surface like. So this is just on surf on on general pseudo analysis you can do this. General pseudo-lana systems you can do this. Okay, next one: spherical homomorphism. What's a spherical homomorphism? This is a homomorphism of three abelian groups. I want to satisfy two conditions. There's a right adjoint. There's a right adjoint. What's the right adjoint do? The right adjoint is a map that goes back R from H back to G, and it satisfies the following property. If I take F of U with V in H, that's the same as U with R of V in G. And secondly, we have what are called twist and co-twist. twist and these are given by the twist is the identity on H minus get them around FR and the co-twist on F this is the identity on G minus R F and we want these to be invertible And these show up in a bit. Okay, and we call this relative, this is a bit of a strange name, relative minus 1 to the n Cy if the co-twist is minus 1 to the n times the set operator. Okay, where does this show up in our example? Where does this show up in our example? Show up in our example. If I take C in anti-canonical and I want this to be smooth, so I've got a smooth elliptic curve on a rational surface anti-canonical divisor. Anticonomical divisor, and I can take the embedding I from C to X. Then I can take I upper star mapping from G to E. What is E? A? E is the numerical growth and deep group on the derived category of coherent sheaves on C. This is going to show up a few times. This is called the elliptic curve pseudo lattice. It's very easy. Curved pseudolattice. It's very easy to write down. E is Z2, and the matrix of the pairing is 0 minus 110. Okay, so this map, this is a minus one to the, I should use the word relative. Relative minus one to the zero. Minus 1 to the 0 CY spherical homomorphism. Okay, so somehow this is sort of encoding the fact that we've got some sort of log collabi-al property going on. Okay, is that the end of all the and he was what giving up? He was so good to us. He was in group of the drive category. Of the derived category of coherent sheets on X. So that varies according to what the X is. Okay, so I'm now going to say something very vague in the interest of time. This is, I think, the last definition. No, it's not. Sorry, there's a lot of sort of technical stuff here. So a spherical hong G to E, E is the same E, G is some G. The same E, G is some G. This is called quasi-delpezzo. I'm not going to give a full definition, but if it, in some sense, one coming from this example. So, the condition for this is quite technical. There's four conditions. The condition for this is quite technical. There's four conditions to check. There's conditions on the rank of the Neron Severi. There's conditions on the existence of exceptional bases that I don't want to describe. There's conditions on what the right adjuent does. So I don't want to give a full definition of this because it would take too long. But effectively, think quasi-del Petzo means it looks like it comes from a smooth divisor on a smooth rational surface under. Smooth rational surface under this kind of picture. So, Alan, can I just ask, just to make sure I'm understanding the running example? Yes. So, on a rational surface, the pairing was the Euler pairing. Yes, the Euler pairing was symmetric. It's not symmetric. Not symmetric, and then the thing, the P, was the class of the point. The P is the class of the point. I thought you were supposed to, if you took orthogonal to P and then divided by P, you were going to get something symmetric, and I was having a hard time seeing. Get something symmetric, and I was having a hard time seeing this case. Well, if you take sort of p perf over p, that effectively gives you like the h2 part. So it just gives you the narrative area of your rational surface. But why isn't the pairing there still the Euler pairing, which would still not be symmetric? I think it's fine, because I think it's okay, because it's there. It feels like you have to be. You've got two curves. I think it's fine. I think it's fine. Is it varying on the line levels or the curves or? Aaron, on the line levels or the curves, or does it matter? Let's see, six. Maybe it's okay on the curves, right? Okay, on the sheets. So does anybody see why I'm confused? If it's two line bundles that you stick in into your Euler pairing, it's not going to be symmetric. Right? Isn't it the Euler pairing is the interval of the dual of one? Maybe maybe we could work through it. Maybe we could work through it afterwards. But this is sort of Kuznetsov stuff. And I think it just restricts the announcement of area with the normal sort of intersection pairing at that point. Yes. Okay, right. So what I want to do now, so this is, you know, somehow, okay, running, like, let's catch up, see where we are. If I have. If I have a smooth rational surface with a smooth anti-canonical divisor on it, I get one of these structures. I get a pseudo-lattice, it has a spherical homomorphism, the spherical homomorphism is given by this pullback. You know, that's sort of the picture. Now, what I want to do now is if I want to make something that looks like a type 2 degeneration of K3 surfaces, what can I do? Well, I can take two of these things and I can glue them together along the elliptic curve. And so that makes something that looks like a type 2. And so that makes something that looks like a type 2 degeneration of a K3 surface. And so what I want to do is I now want to talk about how can I glue these things together in a way, you know, how can I sort of glue the pseudo-lattices together in a way that sort of is going to replicate this, but just in a sort of purely pseudo-lattice theory way rather than. So if I've got F from F from G to E and G from H to E. These are spherical ones. Do you need them to be quasi-diagnosed, actually? Do I need them to be which, sorry? Don't you need F and G to be quasi-diapeter, or is that only? No, okay, so for this definition, I don't, but I'm going to assume that in a bit. Okay. So I can look at I can look at the direct sum of G and H, and the pairing I can put on here is I can put U and V, I can do this in sort of block form. So I can do, they're both in G, I do the pairing in G. If they're both in H, I do the pairing in H. If I have something there, then there's zero. And if I have something here, I apply my F. I apply my F and my G and do the pairing in E. So this puts a pseudo-lattice structure on the direct sum G plus H as the pairing is given by this thing. And the result is denoted as follows. It is denoted by F and then I do this sort of spunny semi-direct product, G and G and it maps from G and H to E. Right. So this gives me a pseudo lattice which corresponds to somehow the gluing of G and H along E. Right, now I'm going to apply this to my class. So this traxum is no longer commutative anymore, right? So Pashu. Well, they weren't commutative in the first place. G and H aren't commutative either. So, um, but is there a release animal minus there? Um, I mean, okay, I'm I am going to do that in a moment, but this was the way that we defined it in the first place. There's you can there's some sign choice things you can do here. And it works somehow. This works for This works for it sort of depends on how you want to be it's it's a question of orientations, I guess is the the way my question was how can it steal the receivable? Why is he there? Somehow this works quite nicely because if you've got exceptional bases of G and H then you get an exceptional based on threat cell. Right, so if I've got F1, let's say FI from GI to E, and I'm now going to assume that these are quasi-dopens. So these are things coming from rational elliptic surfaces with smooth anti-canonical devices on them. I'm further going to assume that if I take the canonical class of G1 and intersect itself, that's the same as the canonical. With itself, that's the same as the canoe class of G2 intersective with itself. Minus, minus, minus, minus. So this is the sort of semi-stability gluing condition of Friedman, basically. Then, what do we get? Then I could take, I'm going to glue F1 to minus F2. This is taking G17. G1 semi-direct sign G2 to E. This is relative minus 1 to the 0 collabial. Can I ask a question? Yeah, go for it. If I think very stupidly and just take two copies of the same thing, I can glue it along an electric curve, right? But... Well, no, no, but that doesn't give something that will smooth to a case. That doesn't give something that will smooth to a K3. Because you'll covered on my. No, I know. Okay, I see. I remember. So I'm going to call this F, I'm going to call this G, this sum. And R is the right adjoint of F. Question? So if Gi is actually the direct categories of Categories of numerical growth and the groups of derived categories, yeah. I see. So I guess I got curious in the sense of that minus sign looks like if geo and G to come from geometric setting, you're sort of putting offsetting by sign of all the intersection forms, right? Yeah, I mean this is the minus sign is just sort of the thing that makes this work, I guess. And I'm not, it sort of feels like some kind of choice of orientation for the gluing. So on the mirror side, So, on the mirror side, which I will say a little something about, this really corresponds to the fact that you're gluing a pair of vibrations and you need the orientations or the boundaries to be opposite when you do the gluing. So I'm still there, right? Do you care for the majority of the majority of the it's all the the there's about to be well I'm going to tell you how this all fits with type 2 degenerations in a in a mode. So In a mode. So let's actually say some things. So I'm going to let K be the kernel of F and I'm going to take E bar. This is going to be the saturation. F is this. This is F. E is the saturation. E is the saturation of the right adjoint of E in G. Then what do we get? And this is just a little bit of relatively easy algebra. The form is symmetric on K. So K is a lattice, and what's more, E bar is a totally degenerate sub-lattice. Okay, E is a totally degenerate sublattice. That means I can quotient K by E and get another lattice. So the upshot is from this whole sort of abstract picture that currently has no bearing on reality. Yes. Yeah, E bar is rank two. Ah, so you mean E bar is essentially isotropic with respect to this bilinear form, right? Yeah, yeah, so I've got it, so the bilinear form on K, the restriction of the bilinear form to K is symmetric. And then with respect to this bilinear form on K, E bar, and I should actually say like E bar is a subset of K. E bar is contained in K and it's totally isopropic. Oh, totally degenerate, totally right there. Oh, totally degenerate. Totally, anyway. It's all zeros, right? Okay. So then what I can do, I can build an exact sequence. E bar goes to k, goes to a new thing that I'm going to call m, goes to 0. So m is just the quotient of k by e bar, because this is totally degenerate, that quotient is well defined and is a lattice. Okay, let's talk about type 2 degenerations. And then you will see where all this hopefully comes from. Right, so I'm going to take pi mapping curly V, broken chalk. Where's another one? Pi mapping curly V to, let's just say delta, some disk. This is semi-stable. Type 2. Type 2, degeneration of K3s. I'm going to take V in V, this is the general fiber, or a general fiber, and V0 in V is the central fiber. Okay, so I'm going to assume, so I can make this work, and I'm hoping one day I'll be able to get rid of this assumption, but let's assume. But let's assume that V0 is just a union of two components. So I'm going to write x, differ x1, glued to x2. So it looks like a pair of rational surfaces glued along a smooth elliptic curve. So this is x1, this is x2. There's some C, C is elliptic curve, these are both rational surfaces. It's a smooth anticonical in both. So, yeah, C smooth. Smooth elliptic as you can. Right. Right, right, right, right, right. So, somehow, I mean, like, this is a little bit of a special assumption, but it's not as special as you might think. Results of Friedman sort of somehow say that, like, up to base change, kind of all type 2 degeneration can sort of be reduced to this. So, if you've got a type 2 degeneration with more stuff in it, in some sense, you can see it as a base change of. You can see it as a base change of one of these. So these are sort of somehow primitive type 2 degenerations. And actually, I think Friedman calls them primitive type 2 degenerations. Okay, so my G i's now are the numerical Griffin deep group of the bounded derived category of covariant sheaves on X I and F. And Fi are the maps from Gi to this thing C, and these are just the pullbacks. Right, so here is the lemma. So, you know, obviously now I've got G1 and G2. These are quasi-delpetic. These are quasi-delpezzo, they're quasi-delpezzo, sort of almost by definition. And the question is: can we identify all this stuff? So over Q, and I'm going to say something about Z in a minute, I can take the Chern character. This gives an isomorphism of Q modules. Of Q modules. GQ is isomorphic to G1 semi-direct sum G2 and this is isomorphic to H even X1Q direct sum H The red sum h even x2. I'm not saying anything about bilinear forms here. I'm just saying these things are just isomorphic to Q modules. If I restrict to K, so I have this thing K, I get KQ is isomorphic to H naught. isomorphic to H naught of V naught Q direct sum the second weight graded piece of H2 V naught Q direct sum H4 V naught Q okay so that sort of identifies these things it doesn't say anything about what these intersections are intersections are but it does say something about it does say something about this and here is the kind of interesting here is the kind of interesting lever there is a lattice isomorphism so preserving the force between this lattice that we get M which was the quotient of K by this isotropic thing E. The E. This is limiting mixed host structure on here. Second weight graded piece, limiting mixed host structure on here. Yes. So this is the limiting mixed hole structure in the OK three circles. Second white gradient piece there. So on the left, M is given the lattice structure by this whole pseudo lattice. The lattice structure by this whole pseudo-lattice picture. On the right, this is given the Maccabatt, this is the Macai lattice. Well, it's given the intersection from the Macai lattice. So, what does this give us? This gives us a commutative diagram of Q modules. So, what have I got? I've got zero goes to E bark. E bar Q. Do I want to do this on a bigger board? I think I should be fine. Zero goes to E bar Q, goes to K Q, goes to MQ, goes to zero. This thing is isomorphic to what I had up there, H0 limb, direct sum, second weight gradient piece, H2 limb, direct sum H4 limb. Everybody is going to recognize. Everybody is going to recognize the exact sequence in a second. What's this thing? This is H0 V0 direct sum second weight graded piece. I'll give this one around. 2W space. H2V0 direct sum. H4V0 mapping there. And this thing is, I can identify this as. I can identify this as q psi direct sum q eta, and I can tell you what those are in a second. This is isomorphic. This is isomorphic. This is the Clemens-Mixed sequence. But what is B0? B0 is the central fiber of the degeneration. So this is the Delete's mixed hole structure on the normal crossing degeneration. I'll tell you what xi and eta are. So xi is the class curve minus curve in H2 X1Z, the red sum H2X2z. So it's the class of curve minus curve in there. So xi lives in the H2, eta. The H2 eta lives in the H4, and this is the class minus point point in big force X1Z. Direct sign H2Z is thank you. Okay, so now the interesting thing is: okay, all of this is over queue. Now, Friedman has told us. Has told us in New Proof of the Global Tyranny Theorem paper, isn't that one? One of the papers, one of the papers he wrote in the 80s, one of these big sort of. So he says that actually Clement Schmidt, so his lower sequence is exact over Z. So Clement Schmidt's exact over Z. So Clemens Schmidt's exact over Z. So the question is: to what extent does this thing actually become an isomorphism of Z modules, or other Q modules? So this isomorphism holds over Z. This one, it turns out, doesn't. So KQ isomorphic to blah, this does not hold over Z. But the But but the failure is confined to H4. So in particular, if we restrict to, so you know, this thing, remember, is sitting inside a pseudo lattice. I can restrict everything to the, and it's a surface-like pseudo lattice. I can restrict everything to the neurons of Aari. So if I restrict the neurons of variant, what do I get? What do I get? So restricted errors variable forgive me. I get zero goes to Z Psi, goes to second weight graded piece of H2 V0 over Z, goes to second weight graded piece of H2 limiting its hole structure over V goes to zero. This is in exact signals over Z and Exact sequence over Z, and this is isomorphic over Z to the sequence of lattices above. And this sequence is, this was, the exactness of this sequence was proved by Friedman. Okay. Freeze. Just a quick question. The type of generation when you have this isotropic rental sublattice in more classical settings, does that In more classical setting, does that matches with the E bar in subsets, right? Here is your isotropic rank two sub lattice. I see. It's just what I'm curious, confused is that the kernel is one ranked one, not ranked two. Well, in this picture, the kernel is effectively so the kernel here is effectively in here you've got the class which is the anti canonical curve minus the anti canonical curve. And when you smooth out that that class gets killed. You smooth out that class gets killed. So that's what this is. This is like curve minus curve when you've got the two components here. Oh, I was looking at the wrong sequence. Thank you. Okay, that makes sense. Okay. And now for something completely different. Elliptic vibrations on K3s. Right, I'm going to take pi from y to p1. This is a K3 fibered by genus 1 curves. Why do I not say elliptic curves? I'm not necessarily assuming this has a section. I'm not necessarily assuming this has a section. I'm just saying fiber by genus 1 curves. Let's say F is a fiber. I'm going to pick a loop dividing P1 into two disks. Let's call them like delta 1, delta 2. Into two disks. And then I'll say pi i mapping y i to delta i, these are the restrictions. These are the restrictions. Chalk, chalk, chalk, chalk, chalk. That looks decent. I didn't bring my chalk holder with me. I normally have a chalk holder, which makes it very comfortable to use small pieces of chalk. But every time I take it on a plane, it gets pulled up by the TSA and they go like, what on earth is this? It's some sort of. And they're like, what on earth is this? It's some sort of weird mechanical cylinder device, and we don't like it. And so now I don't bring it, but then I don't have blackballs in Lafayette, so it never gets used. Okay, so what I'm going to do, I'm going to assume, so I need this loop to satisfy the following property. And this property is kind of like the gluing of the two pieces in the type 2 degeneration. This is the sort of like the smooth. Uh this is this is the sort of the like the smoothing property for the gluing of the two pieces so that like you know the uh the squares of the anti-cononicals the square of the anti-conical in one is negative the square of the anti-conical in the other. This is the equivalent statement. So I'm going to assume there exists a symplectic basis AB for the first integral homology of F such that Uh such that anticlockwise monogramy around did I give this loop a name? Gamma. I should probably assume, well, I should assume that the point that f lies over a point in gamma acts as the following matrix. Anti-clockwise in which this I mean does it mean one? I mean the step by one, but that's monotony. I mean it doesn't. The loop is the loop oriented at the So what I should be I should be sort of careful here maybe there's okay let me just write the thing and then we'll we'll we'll try and then we'll try and think about anti-computer please. I think well what this means I think is if you take each of the two means I think is if you take each of the two disks and you look at the anti-clockwise multi around the boundary of each one yeah yeah but there's a minus sign in the gluing and that solves it right so I want one E of yi minus twelve zero one so E of YI this is the Euler number Euler number of the vibrations yi as computed from the singular finals. And I also want two technical conditions. This might be, I might, I don't know if I can get rid of this one or not. If R is the right adjoint, angle, right adjoint. I haven't told you, you know, I haven't given you a pseudo-attacks or anything like that, right? I can take the following map. Relative second homology of each of these things relative to the fiber to H1. So, this is the boundary map from the exact sequence of a pair. Then, R of A is primitive. And I should really have. Did I miss saying that? I did miss saying that. Did miss saying that. I can equip this. There is a pairing on here. And I won't write down there's a pairing on here. And what is the pairing called? I mean, wait, wait. Is this somehow the second deconvert of the existence of a section or not? Possibly. I haven't I I haven't really sort of thought very carefully about this statement yet. All of this is in flux and might get weakened. What the heck is this pairing called? What the heck is this pairing called? I might as well. There's a pairing on here that you can define. You can think of the objects on here as thimbles. And what you do is if you've got your disk and you've got sort of two paths that have thimbles lying over them, then what you do is you take one of the paths and you rotate it round 180 degrees. So you sort of disconnect it from the edge and take it round 180 degrees. 180 degrees. And that makes the pairing non-symmetric. Because if you take the left-hand one and take it around 180 degrees, then it doesn't hit the right-hand one. If you take the right-hand one and take it around 180 degrees, then it does. So I'll remember what the pairing is called halfway through this, but I didn't write it down. It's amazing how your mind goes blank when everyone's looking at you, right? Cipher pairing. This thing has the cipher pairing on it. So, again, I'm not going to define it. I've only got 10 minutes left. I'm getting on alright for time. So, if I take these two assumptions, and this one is the main one, I think, this is the sort of tricky one to achieve, then if I take phi i, this of course has a symmetric pairing on it. Phi i from Phi i from H two Y I F relative to Z to H one F relative to Z. I call this thing G I in a wonderful piece of foreshadowing. This is a quasi-del Pezzo homomorphism of tuple lattice. Okay, so, so, so, so, so, so, now I've got this. Well, you know, I've got these two pseudo lattices, G1 and G2. This is the same sort of picture I had before. I've got this machinery of gluing these together and writing down some various exact sequences and things. And so, let's have a, I think it's a, oh no, this mine, this is a proposition. Basically, like everything in this. This is a proposition. Basically, like everything in this talk is a level, there's no actual theorems. If I take G to be this in the way that we did before, this is isomorphic to H2YRY1FZ direct sum H2Y2F. F Z. This is just the Z modules, of course. If I take K, K is the kernel of, yeah, let's call it phi, which is the adding together phi 1 and phi 2. This thing is isomorphic to the second compactly supported cohomology of y with f removed over z. Over Z quotiented by the class of F. And M is isomorphic to F per over Z F. Where does that live? This lives in H2 of YZ. Remember, Y is a K3 surface, so this is the orthogonal complement of a fiber in the K3 surface quotiented by itself. Motive by itself. Okay, then we get a diagram of Z modules. So we get zero goes to E bar, goes to K, goes to M, goes to zero. This thing is isomorphic to this F perp over Z F goes to zero. So this thing, I mean, this is a sub-lattice of the K3 lattice, right? So this is a sub-lattice of your K3. Right, so this is the sub-lattice of your K3 lattice. This thing is the compactly supported cohort gene, there's a way of putting a bilinear form on this. And I've not left myself enough space again. Y less fz quotiented by z f. This goes to here. And over here, I have h1 of f relative to z. This doesn't have the standard symplectic thing, or this is just equipped with the zero bilinear form. So, this. Right, so what's this sequence? This sequence is what Charles Durand and I called the Mirror-Clemen Schmidt sequence. So, this is actually the second perverse graded piece in what we call the Mirror-Klemenschmitt sequence. And this is our paper for 2020. From 2020. So it is kind of a known, known kind of sequence. So is this monodromey up here that condition that you wrote down these conditions enough to guarantee there's a degeneration that collapses that move? Is that what we're supposed to have in the head? I assume. I mean, is the mirror over to like the hypercular rotation or something? So this is the way of thinking about this. The way of thinking about this. The way of thinking about this is, and I'm about to, well, I'll say this in a moment anyway, but like, if you take your two pieces of your type 2 degeneration, they're del Petzo surfaces with a smooth anti-canonical divisor. If you go over to the other side, so if you take the mirror of that, those are LG models. They're, you know, because you're taking the smooth anti-canonical, your LG models are elliptic vibrations. Now, okay, these rational surfaces might not be del petos, they might be bigger. If they are del Petzos, They might be bigger. If they are del petzos, this is the condition on the Landau-Ginsburg model that the fiber you glue in at affinity is ion-type. I mean, the point is that for K-free and stuff like that, you can do it purely with theoretic. I mean, if you do a hyper-K, I mean, the SYZ vibration for K-free, you get it by the hyper-K1 rotation. That's kind of the point. And whatever the this is, the mirror. This is the mural ever generation circuit. And this is this is, you know, I'm where did I just go on there? This is what I'm gonna sort of I'm gonna sort of finish off with a section that could probably be called speculation, which is and there's some sort of we get some sort of interesting We get some sort of interesting but then you still I mean in all in all your talk you kind of only use k which is magic I mean so you you still haven't justified the zero for the I would bet that's a minus minus when when you do the direct sum I mean my experience is that you have whatever the pairing on the right formula and Perim on the right formula, and instead of zero, it should be minus the pairing. Anyway, continue. I mean, yeah, maybe you'll not, you, I mean, in what you said, you'll never see that because you always take the terminal. Yeah, maybe this is yeah, I'm just trying to. I mean, you know, the reason that we define it this way is that, um, well, okay, I would. Well, okay. I was using a pre-existing definition of gluing spherical homomorphisms, and the reason for doing this is: well, one of the reasons for doing this is if you've got a fibration over a disc, if you've got a bunch of singular fibers knocking around, what you can do is you can sort of split this up into smaller discs. Then you can take the pseudo-lattice corresponding to each of the vibrations over each of these pieces, and then you glue that. This gluing is the right thing. This gluing is the right thing to sort of glue these together so that you get a single one over the whole thing. Okay, so this section is called speculation. I say this is work in progress, and we've sort of got to the end of the progress. So, what's sort of So, what's sort of some of the motivation here? This is a conjecture. Well, this is some variant of a conjecture that was never really written down, but that sort of I made with Chuck Luran and Andrew Harder a while ago. This was like 2016 or something. So, if x and x check are a mirror pair of k3s, and the statement of the thing is more general, then Type 2 degenerations correspond to genus 1 vibrations, type 2 degenerations of X, I should say. Let's get my signs right. Correspond to genus 1 vibrations on X. That's not a conjecture. That's easy. The conjecture part is that if you take a Kulikov model here, and I'm really And I'm really thinking like a Kudakov model with two components, but actually, you could extend this relatively easily to more general Kudakov models, extra stuff. These correspond to splittings of P1. And your components here in your Kulikov models, these correspond to LG models over here. L G models over here. At least, you know, when in the situation where if your components are del petzo surfaces, on the other side you get exactly the L G models. If your components are bigger than del peto surfaces, there's a sort of way of defining these LG models where you, rather than doing them over A1, you shrink your thing to a disguise. I'm probably a few decades behind, but is the notion of a mirror pair of K3s well defined? Okay, so. Okay, so I'm going to. So, okay, so what do I assume? I assume if I've got, you know, if I've got a K3 surface X, I have some type 2 boundary component in Bailey-Burrell. I assume that type 2 boundary component has on it a type 3 point, which has the necessary stuff, and I do the mirror symmetry for that type 3 point in the sort of Dolbachev Nikulin sense. You know, this gives a, you know, it gives a mirror lattice power. You know, it gives a mirror lattice polarization, and then you take a general K3 surface with that lattice polarization on it. I mean, these splittings of P1 are like type 3 degenerations of the elliptic K3 surface, where the elliptic vibration breaks over a chain. Yes, but I want to talk to you specifically about this stuff. Isn't that type 2 about type 3 if you have elliptic surface over motor curves? So, you know, if this, you know, this is ultimately sort of what we're trying to prove, but what's the what are some of the upshots of this? You know, some of the upshots of getting out of this, I mean, firstly, this potentially gives a, so this last correspondence gives a sort of lattice theoretic enhancement of the Fano-LG correspondence. So, you know, you have in the same sort of In the same sort of way as you have lattice polarized mirror symmetry for K3 surfaces, there should be a version of lattice polarized mirror symmetry for del peto surfaces. So, by this, I mean a sort of thing of like, well, okay, if you take your del peto surface and you degenerate it by colliding some of the points you've blown up so that it becomes a weak del petzo surface, then you know on your mirror side this should correspond to doing something with the singular fibers in your LGBTOR. So we're hoping you know over here we've got on both of these we've got pseudo lattices, right? Least we've got pseudo lattices, right? So we're hoping that we can make some pseudo-lattice statement of what this mirror symmetry is doing on the pseudo-lattices. I mean, in this picture, you know, the pseudo lattice on both sides are exactly the same. So we're hoping we can say something about this from the pseudolattices. There's also something sort of, you know, going back to what does this tell us about degenerations, you know, if we've got genus one vibrations, you can say a lot from the lattice theory, right? I mean, you know, if you look at stuff, you know, you've got exact sequences. You've got exact sequences in lattice theory giving your More L V lattice and your lattice supported on singular fibers and these kinds of things. And those kind of results should be possible if we get this to work. We should be able to port those over to the type 2 degeneration side. And that will then give you some statements, hopefully along lines of, well, okay, you know, if you have a K3 surface that has the following lattice polarization on it, you know, here are the possible generalized lattice polarizations that you Generalized lattice polarizations that you can get on the components of the type 2 degeneration, and that then gives you a way to construct sort of candidate type 2 degenerations for this thing, which is something that I currently don't know how to do. I know how to figure out lattice theoretically what the type 2 degenerations are, but I don't know how to write down stable models for them, for instance, if you give me some lattice polarization. So, the sort of hope is that that will give us some lead into doing that kind of thing as well. Okay, it's 10 o'clock, so I'm going to call it a day. Yes. A little like you didn't something in the proposition. You said this is a mirror Clement Schmidt, but Clemens Schmidt is usually one step too long, so you truncated something. Okay, so this is specifically the second weight-graded piece, second perverse weight-graded piece of the Mirror-Clemensvet sequence. So what you Sequence. So, what you would normally have here, and this is defined to be the kernel of, is so in here you're looking at H2 of y, and you have the map from H2 of Y to H2 of Y given by, well, actually, it's not H2, it's all the even cohomology, and you're taking cut products with fiber. And so, this thing is the kernel of cut products. So, this thing is the kernel of cut product of the fiber. So, this gives us the relevant sort of perverse graded piece. So, there is, I mean, this is coming from a, you know, there is a four-term exact sequence which this fits into, which is, and somehow, you know, there's sort of what's the what's the kind of aim of doing some of this is that, you know, I mean, this gives us this, this sort of seems to be. I mean, this gives us this sort of pseudo-lattice picture, gives us some sort of lattice theory we could use here where there's not such a sort of natural lattice theory that comes about from the geometry, right? And so, you know, I mean, there's things of on the on the Del Petzo surface type 2 degeneration side, what did I do from here? What I did from here was took Naur and Severi, right? And so if I took Nouren Severi on that side, then I got this very nice. Nounsavarion that side, then I got this very nice sequence which is all about sort of divisors on type 2 degenerations. If I take nouns of variant here, and there's a reason I haven't done it, and the reason is the noun to vary on here is, I mean, it's kind of a mess and it has pieces from all the different cohomology layers. And so it's sort of, it's, you know, sort of one of the questions is sort of really understanding what, if I take neuro and severity of these things, what the neuron severis are doing down here. And that's some sort of quite complicated statement in these things. But on the other side, it's a very simple statement. But on the other side, it's a very simple statement that devices often type 2 generations. Yes? Another question is that for your elliptic vibrations on P1, when you choose a loop, can you have a way to directly connect it to the previous disposition, like saying that I contract that loop to a point that gives a break degeneration of the base P1 into a nodal union of two P1s, and it looks like you're doing this more topological construction by. Topological construction, right? Maybe I'm too naive about this, but it sounds like you have a way to relate that to that. Yeah, I don't know. I'm not elliptic. I'm sort of not so, yeah, I mean, I see what you're saying. I'm saying, you're saying, you know, you've got your elliptic vibration and you want to take a type 2 degeneration that kind of breaks it in the middle, right? Breaks it along a fiber. Is it necessarily clear that such a thing is always going to exist? Right, I guess that's part. Right, I guess that's part of the trust. Yeah, you can sort of only do it with a type 3 degeneration, I think. Like if you have multiple loops, you want to collapse them. There's this one N01 monogram, and the N changes. And so essentially it says that there has to be some non-toric components between the two. I guess the situation that I'm thinking is special enough that this works. enough that this works this seems to work but yeah i mean i i know of examples where that works but i don't know if it's something that that would have i don't know if it's something that can be done in general sort of you know i mean the type 2d generations you get doing this are sort of quite special because they're they're you know you've got a square zero on both sides right um and is that uh maybe that it maybe there is some sort of slightly automatic miss there. I guess if if such construction works then I um they're really same same thing but in different discomfort yeah yeah yeah so you know it's it's but that also I mean I suppose now hang on but this I don't know this can work right because this this would sort of suggest that there's a mirror symmetry sort of style correspondence between type 2 degenerations on each side and you know there's definitely And you know, there's definitely different numbers of type 2 degenerations between, you know, if you take two polarized K3 surfaces on a two-polarized K3 surface, there are four type two degenerations, which correspond to on a mirror, sorry, degree 2K3. On a mirror degree 2K3, there are four elliptic vibrations. But a mirror degree 2K3 doesn't actually have any type 2 generators at all. So in that case, I guess you can't do something like this. Is you can't do something like this at least as a sort of algebraic generation. I think, I think. Any more questions? I'm going to get that 30.
