And we'll start things off with Vatican to tell us about Finance and Practical and Works and Super Singular K3 services. Thank you very much for the introduction and the organizers for the kind invitation to speak. I'm very happy to present you some of almost finished work with Donobio Rashi from Tokyo, which is on super singular K3 surfaces, but I mean it could. K3 surfaces, but I mean, if you prefer much of this, you can also kind of just think about K3 surfaces. There will be also applications to complex K3 surfaces sitting in the background. And most of it we'll do by using lattice theory anyway, which is kind of characteristic free almost. So, I mean, we've had this before in the talks. Parklow's work, for instance, so we want to consider. And then we have a group G acting, and we want that G acts synclectically, which means for every, which means G acts trivially on the two form, so G on the space of the two phone has a trivial action. Examples, we've seen some of them before during this workshop. If you have an elliptic vibration, then translation by the sections will give you a symplectic action. This way you can hook up also infinite or automorphisms acting symplectically. Or if you have a linear action on some K3, like the ones from Pausla's talk yesterday, which were called Fermat and Fermat-Klein, then you can sort out which subgroup acts syntactically. So this is kind of Practically. So, this is kind of all pretty much standard. If we work over the complex numbers, then the natural thing is to consider the action on the second homology, let's say with integer coefficients. And of course, in there, we have the transcendental letters and the narrows and vary. And on the transcendental letters, G acts trivially just by assumption because this is the smallest structure. Smallest structure whose complexification contains the two-form. So here G as an induced trivial action. Here on the Meron Severi, it may well act non-trivially, but if you want to glue these things together, this implies that on the discriminant group, G also acts trivially. This is one of the kind of recurring themes throughout this talk. This is crucial and will come up again. And the main other important property is that the co-variant letters, so the perp of the invariant letters, this is completely contained in the neurons de vary. This contains no roots. And I mean, if you want to play the converse game, To play the converse game and DAO some k3 with a group function, these two things are also the main ingredients if you want to apply Turkey theorems. Just read off abstractly that some g actually exists. And well, who was the first key player contributing to this problem? This was Nicolin in the late 70s, maybe. And what was the idea? Now let's fix all this. Throughout this talk, let's make G finite. What was written so far also works for infinite groups? Now we pick an element G and G, and then the number of fixed points just depend on the order of G. So if G has order 2, there are eight fixed points. Has ordered two, there are eight fixed points. They probably showed up during Adria's talk. And Avier's talk this morning, it's related to having three, six point fixed points for order three. Then for order four and five, there are four fixed points each. And then the only missing orders, remaining orders are six, seven, eight with two, three, and two fixed points. Fixed points. And if you want to see examples of elliptic vibrations with torsion sections, you can see these things kind of directly or hook up some nice linear actions on K3 surfaces, on quartics or so, and you can also find examples for this. Okay, so that's kind of the situation. You can also try to sort out what is this lattice. Alija and Alessandra have done some computations. Sundar have done some computations, he did some previous things. So, for abelian groups, it was all pretty much clear. And then Mukai entered the picture and kind of gave a classification of all these finite groups, which already kind of came up in Pablo's talk on Tuesday, I guess. And his main observation was that this is exactly consistent with elements in the group N23. So, if you take M23. So if you take an element of order 2 in M23, then it has exactly eight fixed points if you consider the action on 24 letters. And this is kind of, I believe, the multi-base multi-base theorem. This is from 88. So G. So G acts symplectically, to put this up on K3 over C symplectically, if and only if G is a subgroup of M23 acting with at least five orbits on. On the set of 25 points. I mean, the proof is quite complicated. It's a really genuine group analysis with zero groups and so on. But I mean, this is kind of the beautiful picture resulting in the end. And now What's next? Well, it's not my fault. It was Isandori suggesting that we should try to sort out what happens in characteristic B. And your expectation was it was my idea, but he came up with this idea. So what's the difference in characteristic P? First of all, we have to distinguish whether we work with the tank. We have to distinguish whether we work with the tank case, where the characteristic does not work the group order, or with the wild case. And let's stick to the tank case first. And this is because then most things still behave the way you're used to it. I mean, you can consider quotients and things. I will kind of do this throughout this talk. And the idea of the And the idea, or the main advantage, is that there's already work by Dorger, Jeff, and Koop. I don't know whether Igor is watching though. I think he was on the list of online participants. And first of all, they proved that kind of the corollary of this, namely that the order of G is at most eight, this is still valid. So the table and this kind of bound is still valid for every chain finite group action characteristic P. So this makes our life much easier and then you have to start distinguishing. Distinguishing the characteristic P, okay, 3x can either have height finite or infinite, or the Picard number, one is Picard number at most 20, and the other one is Picard number 20. And the message is that the finite highest case usually behaves very similar to the case over the complex number that we used to. Number that we used to. This is because there are canonical liftings and all kinds of things. But what Borger just proved is that Lucas theorem is okay for the finite high case. So this is why we'll concentrate on the other case and this is what's called the supersymmetric case. Super signal. So these are the K3 surfaces from the title with the car number 22. And I mean, since the betting number is 22, regardless what characteristic we are in, this means that all of H2, at least if you tensor with QL, will be isomorphic. Okay, so what should I tell you about these supersingular K3s? K3s, if x is super singular, then this means that the Picard number is 22, that we can say more, namely the discriminant group of Neuron Sevieri is a vector space over Fp. This is Z mod P Z to the 2 sigma for some sigma between 1 and 10. And this is what's called the idea. And this is what's called the Artinen variable. And one of the important things are that these surfaces move in families. So from characteristic zero, we may be used to the dimension going down further and further when the Pican number goes up. And here somehow it's the opposite. So they move in. So they move in strict minus one dimensional families. So if you consider all the supersingular ones, they form a nine-dimensional family. But the one with sigma equal one is unique. So this is quite complicated. This is something proved by August in the 70s and early 80s. And what's also true is by Budakov and Shafarevich and Shafarievich. Very much the letters is always determined, the nouns, the very letters is always determined by sigma. And of course by so we have all this kind of information and now comes the kind of next result from of Dargojev and Kuhn to bail proof. They prove that if G acts on X symplectically and G is not from Muttai's list, then it belongs to a is in a set of twenty-seven groups. Groups. I'll tell you a bit more about these groups in a second. And G acts on the K3 surface with sigma equal to 1. Let's call it execut. So all the exceptions. X0 is this unique supersingular K3 surface with sigma equal 1. Sorry, I squeezed in the X0 here. What are the authors of it? What if FK stands for if I'm reading right? The authors of this result I'm sorry. DK. Still dollars F and 2. So that's a paper on the archive in 2004 published in 2005. So all the exceptions amount to So, all the exceptions amount to studying this single surface. And I mean, if you want to know what it is, for instance, if you take the Fermat and P is Premi mod 4, then you can take the Fermat. And if you take, I guess, any for every kind of for many K3C over C, you can kind of determine it gives rise to this guy, but the Ferma kind of gives a good picture. Ferma kind of gives a good picture for many characteristics. And what's left open is, of course, the existence. But before we get there, let me give you a little idea of where kind of this criterion comes from. And I already mentioned quotients before. So what's the idea? The idea is that locally we can still understand how G acts. Still understand how g acts. So, this is like in the complex situation, and we can consider the quotient. So, this will be a singular K3 in the sense of surface with trivial canonical bundle and isolated regional doublet points. So, it will have a resolution y, which is K3. This is the kind of approach that Shao did when he gave an alternative proof of Mukai's theorem. But in here, we have And in here we have some configuration of A D E configuration of minus two curves above the singularities. And now the fun thing is that they prove that in the exceptional cases here this A This ADE letters, let's call it, well, let's call it L, has rank 20. So this will kind of stand for the cohenvariant lattice upstairs. And what we know now is that it has to embed into Into the Nevins of varieties of y. And this is first of all where this sigma equal one comes from, which is hidden, which is x naught, because what is the point? G having order relatively prime to p, we know that p. P, we know that P does not divide the determinant of L. And then this means that the discriminant group of neurons has to be supported completely on the complement of L, because here we only get prime divisors dividing the group order appearing in the discriminant group. So, you are not here to make projective or educative. In the beginning of the complex numbers, there was no projective needed. So everything also worked for analytic K3 surfaces. But characteristic B, I have no clue what a non-projective K3 would be. So let's stick to projective sense. And here we are assuming the Picanumba is big anyway, so there's no short of this. So what does this mean? This implies that This implies that the discriminant group of Y is supported on the discriminant group of the orthogonal complement. We have L in here, we have the orthogonal complement, as rank two, and of course the length of this is bound. Is bounded now by the rank. So this is why the length of this thing is at most two, and this explains why the length of this thing is at most two length, meaning minimum number of generators. And this was exactly two sigma. So this means this is where two sigma at most two is coming from in that field. It also in Theorem. It also implies that Y is again the same supersingular K3 surface we started with, but this is something that we will not need. Okay, so this was kind of the end of what Dolgar Chef and Kum did, at least for our viewpoint now, except that I could write down the 27 groups. And now, of course, the question is: can you really realize these groups? And the problem is that. And the problem is that nobody ever has seen a model. So we went on. So nobody approached me with this problem. I was quite skeptical. Nobody has ever seen a what? An explicit action of one of these exceptional groups on a supersingular K3. So usually with Mukai's result, I should have said this before, and we could turn it back. I mean, what was the statement? It's a subgroup of L23, and then it follows that it's a subgroup of L23. And it follows that it's a subgroup of one of the 11 maximal groups. And for each of them, he wrote down a projective K3 surface like Fermat or a Fermat-Klein with this group action. So he was able to prove everything without even using Turelli theorems. It was all completely explicit in the end. And here the situation is the opposite because we don't have any, we know what this K3 should be, but we have no clue what the group actually could be. Which is why I was quite. Which is why I was quite skeptical in the beginning that there might be anything we can prove here. And the first thing I would like to show you is something exactly going in this direction, because now the question can be realized and let's first try to rule out these. And what do I mean? Well, let's use this embedding, or let's be a bit more careful. Let's take the primitive closure. So this is L tensor Q intersected with the near-sided area. And it turns out this is also. And it turns out this is always unique, determined by L. And now the question is: does L' admit a primitive embedding? Let's open up a new color. This embedding of L was not necessarily primitive, but now we have to wonder whether this thing embeds primitively in here. And this is, in the end, not such a hard problem because the perm. Not such a hard problem because the perp we have here L perb L perb is the same as L prime perb. This is a lattice of rank 2 written up there, signature 1, 1. So it's hyperbolic. And I can also predict the deter determinant. The determinant should be P squared up to sine, I guess, minus P squared times the determinant of L prime. Determinant of L prime. And I even have some compatibilities because between the discriminant of group of this and the discriminant group of L prime. And that is this hyperbolic. I mean, I can just enumerate them. So I can just go through the list and do a case-by-case analysis. And the result is that I can rule out. And the result is that I can rule out half of the primes for each g I can rule out half of the primes because then I can show that no hyperbolic letters with these properties kind of lose together with L prime inside the L. It's just some tedious letters computations. Some tedious letters computations. And now you wonder what to do with the other half. Sorry, I'm so where I lost. I got lost. You have the L prime and it's L can secure the second neurons. Yes. How can that be not primitive in S? Is that the second of the S bar? So we have L, which is a sub-lettus of colouring 2, but it's not necessarily primitive. Yes, and now I take the primitive closure of L inside neurons. So this is primitive, by the way. This is primitive, exactly. Which is why the perm has to have the same determinant up to this factor of p squared, which kind of comes from the fact that Nehru and Severi is not unimodular at P. So this is where kind of this condition comes in, and which you can just use to kind of go through. To kind of go through the whole list and try to sort everything out. So, the question now is what to do with the other half of the primes. And in the end, it's quite funny because there was a third proof of Mukai's theorem, which goes back to Condo and Mukai, where they really To Condor and Mukai, where they really prove every of these groups exist using Touli theorems. And we can mimic this in characteristic P because there is a crystalline Touli theorem due to August, which exactly does the same job of endowing a K3 surface with a suitable projection. Exactly the same kind of conditions, root-free. Conditions wrote free invariant letters. One subtlety is this is only available if the characteristic is greater than three. For characteristic three, there is a preprint by Brack and Lieblich, which would have crystalline from Ready as a consequence, but this is so far only available as a treatment, not published yet. So maybe soon we can just soon we'll just have links to people two here. With people too here. So, what is the idea? We want to play the same game as over C, and the idea is use this thing and use that all 27G are subgroups of M23. Subgroups of M23 acting with four orbits. What does this mean? This means that G comes with an actual. That G comes with an action on a certain Niemeyer lattice. So Niemeyer lattices are the unimodulated even positive or negative, let's say negative definite lattices in dimension 24. One of them has moved lattice A1 to the 24. So this is a Niemeyer. And I mean the automorphism of the Niemeyer lattices is M23 times all the sign changes you can think of. All the sign changes you can think of. And now N24, I guess. But certainly N23 does also act. And now G will also act. And we can consider in here the invariant letters and the covariant letters. And by construction, this will be a rank 20 letters without roots. So this is the ideal candidate. For Narrown's theory of x naught for the invariant letters. And the only thing you have to do is in the previous kind of on the previous part, we tried to glue L prime into Mernsey vary. And now we try to do the same thing with this guy and try to see whether it. This guy and try to see whether it embeds now we really want primitively into neurons. And it's the same problem, we just have to find the hyperbolic letters of signature one and so on. So such that the two things do together. Except that now we want to find things that work out. Previously, we wanted to rule out things and what turned out. And what turns out is this works for the other half of the primes. So for one half you can rule out the group action and for the other half of the primes you can show that on the lattice level it makes perfect sense. There's something that you're saying. There's something that differentiates the two lists of primes? Yes! We'll come there in a second. I mean, this is what we realized only afterwards, that how you can characterize them, and I'll get there in a second. So what's the idea now? So by the Westlink-Reni theorem, we can deduce that G. We can deduce that G acts on the supersingular K3 of Atin variant one in these suitable characteristics. The only thing missing is the simple acting action. And now you can say, okay, I just consider the simple groups, among them the perfect groups. For them, the actions automatically simple, and I'm happier. Automatically simply, and I'm happy that I'm turning to a different problem. But one can improve the situation a bit because there's also work by Niger from 1980, which implies for any group not only finite, but GX practically and on any super singular K3, in fact, if and only if the action. If the action on the discriminant group is trivial, so this is exactly what we use in characteristic zero, and it also works here. And I mean, the trivial action is, of course, automatic because ng is the perp of the invariant lattice. So if we glue them together, the actions on the discriminant groups automatically are trivial. True. So from this here, I can deduce G x. Okay. So now you have your case by case analysis, 27 groups. For each you have your primes. And then Jimmy asks for something better. And the answer is part of it is already written here. M23 is already quite good, so we're kind of close to what. So we're kind of close to what Mukai had in his theorem. And forgive me if I now steer you which way he was it. It was better this way. Because now we can turn this into super singular K3, not only super singular, anything. not only supersyng, you have anything in characteristic p and the condition is either g acts with at least 205 orbits, with at least five orbits, or g is a subgroup of n23 that stays with four orbits and I write down the orbit lengths. As L1 up to L4, and then the condition is that the product of the orbit length is a non-square mod P. In terms of the genre symbol, it means like this. And this was a much more satisfactory answer than just having case by case results about half of it. Results about half of the times. So, this is kind of the situation in the 10 case. In the 10 case, where we can use the characteristic zero quotient methods, for instance. Okay, any questions so far? You might not like case-by-case analysis, particularly if they involve 27 groups. I also kind of was happy with the result, but it was kind of unpleasant. And also, Isa Nori kept pushing that we should also cover the wild case. So let me tell you about the wildcase. We have a description. So the 27 groups, you have a description. 27 groups, you have a description? Oh, yes, I have a list. So let's write some examples. I am not writing the whole list, but I mean, the kind of canonical examples here for Mukai, the key examples are M20 and A6 and S5. And then there are eight more maximal groups. And for each of them, you can write down kind of projective models. And here, Models and here the main examples are M21, A7, and S6. So, in this sense, there are 10 maximal groups with four orbits, but still there are no projective models. So, it's only abstract theory. Yeah, there are models nothing. Nothing really so now let's try to do the wild case. Wild means p divides the two order and we have no clue. I mean we cannot use quotients anymore. This is kind of the key problem here. Of course you can also see it as a good thing because in order P See it as a good thing because an order P automorphism automatically symplectic. So you also win something because it cannot act non-trivially on the two-form. So some things even get simple. And what I would like to present you is an approach that kind of allows you also unifiedly to prove all the other theories. So you get an independent proof of Mukai's result, you get a proof of the same result without having to rely on the Having to rely on the specification of Neugevscherf and Kum. Of course, of course, luckily, everything is also kind of confirmed. What was stated before? So, what is the idea? Where to start? First thing is we know G always acts faithfully on the cohomology, so this is kind of a good starting point. And let me see how I wanted to continue from here. We see how I wanted to continue from here. Yes, the first thing to do is to check the orders. Burger chef could enter once again, although we don't strictly need it. Another paper of theirs. The characteristic is at most electric. So if you don't want to deal with the valid case, start from characteristic thirteen and you don't have to worry about anything. If you don't have to worry about it, and then first thing we want to reduce to we only consider supersync RK3s That's because we don't have a clear idea how to treat the finite height case yet, and then we want to reduce to the case with sigma. To the case with sigma equal to 1. So we want to reduce to the same surface x0 again. And how to do this? The idea is quite easy. What is the idea? So let's assume that g acts on some k3x, super singular, with r invariant sigma graph. with R is sigma greater than one. And then we claim is that Xg also acts on the supersingular k-free's X prime with Artin invariant sigma minus 1. Strictly speaking, this is only valid when B is greater than 3, and otherwise we have a for For P at most three G acts nicely on the narrative. Nicely meaning with trivial action on the discriminant. So now maybe it's safe to erase this part. So how do you go between these k3s? The idea is quite simple. The idea is that X admits an elliptic vibration with outsection and then usually. And then usually you would want to take the Jacobian of the complex numbers. You would know what this does on the Neuro-Severi lattice. And here, this is, I think, nowhere really written down, but the idea is just that if we enhance Neuro-Severi by the fiber divided by T, then this gives me a new integral even matrix. even get it. And the reason is F is isotropic, of course, and if I divide F by P, this is an element in the discriminant group. Because if there's no section, that means there are only so here there is only P sections meeting F in P points or a multiple of P. Points are a multiple of p, and this is why I basically can divide f by p without destroying the integrality. But then the g action extends to this new letter n prime, just because the action is trivial and the discriminant. And we know that this is the Meronsevary of X. The vary of x prime just by looking at the invariance of it. So here you use that this thing is always uniquely determined by its invariance. So this way you get a nice action and find that furthermore by construction the co-invariant lattice stays the same because this is a negative definite lattice so the isotropic vector cannot contribute to it. Cannot contribute to it. And this is where kind of the nice G-action on the over-lattice comes from. And then applying the crystal intermediate theorem, you get the G-action on the K3. And otherwise, you can at least try to work with the lattice realization. So this way, we reduced again to considering the single surface. And now we play a trick. Play a trick, namely we can bet the element theory of X naught relatively into the even only modulal that is hyperbolic of rank 26. And because G acts typically on the discriminant group, we get an induced G action on this hyperbolic lattice. And now what you Well what you can prove ideas can be found such that this cont so the hyperbolic the hyperbolic case now our favorite lettuce with outputs this is Lattice with outputs, this is the reach vectors. And when we have this, this implies that G acts on the leech lattice. And what's even better, that the invariant lattice, the co-invariant lattice of Nelson is exactly the co-invariant lattice inside the Dutch letters. Now the leech letters for me is something quite scary, but luckily Bernard Mason, who came up in Pablo's talk, classified all the possible finite group actions on the leech letters. So again, you can just go through all the cases. Case by case onto some cases and now we're left with sorting out For instance, from the beginning we know that the length of this thing cannot be so high in general. In general, it's bounded by the rank of the perk, but it has to better narrow severity, so this gives a severe restriction. You know also that the rank of this thing is at least at most 21. So some cases can be ruled out right from the beginning. In the 21 case, we know the purpose, just a single positive vector. So that you can really do by hand and see what vectors embed. vectors embed well which embeddings work into neurons of theory. So here assume it embeds, then it's a simple vector. Now you only have to determine whether these two lattices of ring 1 and ring 21 glue, and the result is this. And the result is this thing. So for every possible characteristic, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11, you get 1, 2, or 3 groups that work. So here we have Mature 21, we correct 2 and 7, each time extended by Z mod 2 Z. We have the automorphism group of S6. Group of S6, unitary group 4 by 4 matrices, characteristic 3. This you may kind of may sound familiar because this acts on the Fermar quartic. Same here, unitarian characteristic 5 acts on the double cover of P2 branch of the Fermar sextic. So funny enough, in the wild case, we have some explanations A8 and then some other groups in the standard. In the standard notation from ATLAS, also M22 and M11. So, this you get basically by going through the whole list. Some of these groups appeared before in work of Condo, where he proved that one can really realize them. So, the real novelty is to prove that there is nothing else in ring 21. And what's next is that one goes through all the other. That one goes through all the other kinds of ranks, and the kind of nice result is that these groups are basically the only groups. I mean, every other group has to be a subgroup of these groups, except for two exceptions. Here we have 2, 4 times S3 times S3 and 2 squared.a44. 4, 4, and here we also have 2, 4 times 3 times x3. So these are groups appearing in regular 20, which unfortunately are not contained in the maximum one. But if we throw in these three extra groups, then we really get a completely uniform picture for all characteristics. And for instance, this instance this condition about the about the orbit lengths this also appears very naturally from this construction when you use convoy sloan's genus symbols because they guarantee the existence of a lattice with given invariance just depending on some congruence conditions and on determinant conditions. This orbit length is exactly a determinant condition coming from Determining the condition coming from Congress. All right. Maybe that's a good question. Thank you.
