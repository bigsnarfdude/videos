Capsule and then Okay, thank you for the introduction. Hello, everyone. My name is Emily Chen. I'm a grad student at Princeton working with CG Data, and today I'm excited to be telling you about how we can use experimental access to pore scale flow fields to learn more about the physics governing viscelastic flow instabilities in porescopia. Flow instabilities in horse opium. So, I don't think I need to motivate why these flows are relevant. I think that's been really well introduced over the last few sessions. But some of sort of the questions that my research is focused on answering is how do the core geometry and fluid rheology influence the features of these flow instabilities? And then, can we translate this more fundamental knowledge to then ask: can we use these instabilities as sort of transport mechanisms to Mechanisms to, in particular, remediate soiled pores via here. So, in my talk today, I'll focus on two vignettes related to each of these questions. The first will be on using or relating these local pore-scale flow fields to actually understand the mechanisms driving the macroscopic flow behavior. And then the second will be a more applied question: then, asking: Can we use these flow instabilities to clean a model microplastic container with quartz medium? So, polymer solutions, the flow of these polymer solutions in Poros Pia has been widely used in enhanced oil and recovery since the 1960s and 70s. And when they were first being implemented, there was this surprising phenomenon whereby the flow resistance would drastically increase if almost a threshold flow rate. And this was surprising because these polymer species are typically shear-thinning in nature, so you could naively expect that their flow resistance would decrease relative to a Newtonian fluid. Decrease relative to a Newtonian fluid. But this anomalous flow-thickening behavior was observed across a range of different polymer solutions and pores medium geometries, and it's still not well understood as to what are the pores-scale physics driving this macroscopic phenomenon. And so in this part of the talk, I hope to show you how we can use access to these local flow fields to sort of elucidate and rationalize this macroscopic behavior. So a number of mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to explain this phenomenon. The literature to explain this phenomenon, the first class sort of relates to either the mechanical retention or physical absorption of these polymers to the solid matrix. Now, for the purposes of the experiments that I'll be talking about today, we don't think this is a big factor because the molecular dimension of our polymer is much smaller than the characteristic fourth road size. And so we're instead going to focus on other contributions to the resistance. The first being the onset of an elastic flow of stability, whereby these flows. Elastic flow instability, whereby these flow fluctuations generate added sort of like turbulent-like kinetic energy, and this was really done by Chris, who's here today. But then we can also think about adding in resistances from apparent extensional viscosity, because you have these highly flexible polymers that can stretch and orient under these strong field conditions, which can give rise to large extensional viscosity relative to sheer viscosity. And then we can also think about, sort of at the macromolecular scale, the lack. About the macromolecular scale, the elastic energy that's being irreversibly dissipated as these polymer chains are relaxing from these non-equilibrium configurations. And so, what I hope to show you is how we can use our coarse-scale flow field to directly evaluate these three resistances here. So, experimentally, what we do, I'm going to use for the rest of this talk, this near-boger fluid, which is a hydrolyzed polychromide and a very viscous background solvent. This solvent is refractive index matched to our. The solvent is refractive index match to our model porous medium. This allows us to use confocal microscopy to now directly peer inside the pore space and visualize and quantify what's going on at the pore scale. In all of these, in most of these applications, in all the experiments, the Reynolds number is much less than one, so we neglect any effects of inertia, and we instead use the Weisenberg number. And here I'm just showing some examples of streak line imaging for this polymer solution in the laminar stable state at low Weisenberg numbers and then the above Heisenberg numbers, and then the above the opposite of instability, where you get these chaotic patch-like fluctuations. Alright, so now to quantify our measure of the flow resistance, we're going to convert our pressure drop into an apparent viscosity using Darcy's law, and we're going to normalize this by the bulk shear viscosity of the fluid from rheology. So, this gives us a dimensionless measure of our flow resistance that we can look at as a function of the Weisenberg number, where you observe this strong flow-fading behavior. Behavior. Alright, so now we can think about how to devise a framework to quantify these resistance contributions. And I'll briefly recap what Chris did nicely, looking at specifically flow of the Polymer solution in this disordered sintered feed packing. And so what you can do is you start with this macroscopic power balance where you have the pressure work done by the fluid being equal to the viscous dissipation in the fluid. And because the flow is unstable, And because the flow is unstable, what you can do is this sort of Reynolds-like decomposition to extract out the fluctuating components of the flow field. And we end up with this resistance model, whereby the purple term here, it captures the added viscous dissipation from the flow fluctuations. And an interesting thing here is that this model can be directly evaluated using our local flow fields and the fluid rheology without any additional fitting parameters. And what you'll see for this disordered bead packing was that. Disordered beef packing was that this model nicely captures the fluid thickening behavior. However, in this derivation, we use a power law of fluid. And so this nicely captures the non-Newtonian shear thinning effects of the fluid, but neglects any of the polymeric elasticity or eccentric stresses. So now we can think about how to incorporate the polymeric stresses via this apparent dysfunction term. So now to incorporate this into our power balance framework, we're going to return to our disability. Work, we're going to return to our dissipation term, and within our mean dissipation contribution, we're just going to separate the stresses, so our extensional stresses and the shear stresses, and we're going to assume that the shear stresses are adequately captured by the bolt shear viscosity. So then we can introduce our extensional viscosity and strain rate, and we end up with this modified power balance model where now you have this resistance term accounting for an apparent extensional viscosity. And so with the perpetual Viscosity. And so, with appropriate transient extensional rheology and access to the local strain rate field, we can now fully evaluate this modified framework to try to predict the macroscopic fluid here. And so first we went back to some more simple geometries here looking at flow in these 2D pillar arrays in two orientations, a staggered and an aligned array. You can see that this flow becomes unstable above a threshold flow rate. And we observe flow thickening. We observe flow thickening for this polymer solution in these geometries, as you can see by the discrete points. But interestingly, if you first look at the black curves, that is just the contribution from the elastic instability alone. So you see that this captures the onset of the thickening behavior, but under predicts at high Weisenberg numbers, suggesting that there may be an alternative mechanism that controls the slow resistance in these ordered geometries. And so now the purple and pink curves here show the results when we Curves here show the result when we add in the contribution from the extensional viscosity of the fluid, and we're nicely able to capture the full flow resistance in these 2D arrays now. And so another interesting thing with these pillar arrays was that there's some nice work from Jeff Buasto and Amy Schen's groups, where they showed that it's really the stagnation points governing the onset of elastic instabilities in these arrays. And so we then asked, can we develop a sort of extensional flow resistance per Sort of extensional flow resistance per stagnation point framework to account for the extensional flow resistance in these high-score geometries. And so to do that, we used a different type of extensional rheometer called the optimized cross-law rheometer. And essentially, we treat this as a model board, where you drive two opposing flows in these inlets. They meet at a stagnation point, and you have a strong extensional deformation gradient outwards. And so, what we can do with this device is measure the excess. Measure the excess pressure drop associated with extensional effects relative to the shear pressure drop as a function of the extensional Weisenberg number. And then, if we now go back to Darcy's law and decompose our pressure drop into the shear contribution and the extensional contribution, we can introduce this term here to account for the added extensional resistance. And we're also going to modulate this by the number of stagnation points per characteristic cell. And so putting Cell. And so, putting all of this together now, we can directly count the number of stagnation points in these nice ordered systems and fully evaluate this. And we also see that this framework nicely captures the flow resistance in these geometries. So then you can ask, well, what about some more complex 3D systems? So I've also studied the flow of the same polymer solution through these nice 3D ordered sphere packings that are consolidated. And sort of the punchline with what we found here was that you always We found here was that you always observe the elastic instability developing in the vicinity of grain contacts or near the consolidations between grains. And so this is because that these consolidations give rise to additional stagnation points, which generate strong extensional gradients, but also large normal stresses. And that leads to the flow destabilization locally near these consolidations. And we also see that in the simple cubic lattice, where instead the instability is characterized by sort of chaotic. Characterized by sort of chaotic fluctuating eddies. So then we can ask: can we apply the same resistance framework with the essential contribution to capture the flow resistance in these systems? And so again, we observe flow thickening and the pressure drop, and if we simply account for the resistance from the instability alone, it captures the onset nicely, but underpredicts at very high Weisenberg numbers. But then if we add in the role of the polymeric. If we add in the role of the polymeric stresses via this apparent extensional viscosity, we're nicely able to recapitulate the full flow resistance. And because we've also done characterization to show that the instabilities in these nice ordered 3D packings are really governed by stagnation points, we've also tested the sort of resistance per stagnation framework here, stagnation point framework, where we can also directly count the number of stagnation points in these results. Okay, so then what about even more complex systems? What about even more complex systems? So, we've also tested this in these crushed glass packings, introducing large heterogeneities in the pore space. And so, here I'm showing streakline imaging of the flow and the unstable state for different pores, all at the same imposed Weisenkur cover. And what you can see is that there's a large range of spatiotemporal features and instabilities. And what we find when we try to evaluate that modified power value. That modified power balance framework to these systems is large variability in accuracy from experiment to experiment. And we think that's because of this, what we call porous individualism, whereby using a pores-scale approach, you need to now adequately think about how many pores are sufficient enough to capture all of the statistics in order to translate that to the macroscopic scale. And you can see visually here that there's just large heterogeneity just due to the differences. To the differences in pore geometry alone. Alright, so now we can think about this last resistance term from the elastic energy being dissipated as these chains are relaxing. And so this relaxation process occurs over a certain time scale, which means that we need the flow history or the stretching history of the polymers. And this is challenging experimentally because we have 3D systems in very complex, unstable flows. So we've been really motivated. Unstable flows. And so we've been really motivated by work from Arzoo's group and Jeff Bosto's groups in this problem of trying to convert our experimental velocity field into the actual local stress field. And we haven't been able to do that, but what we have so far is the Lagrangian stretching field, which you can think of as sort of mirroring the polymeric stress field. And in principle, you can convert this stretching field into the conformation tensor and thereby the polymeric stress. And then if you Stress. And then, if you have these stress fields, then you can directly evaluate this full resistance model where you have a contribution from the solvent, the solvent viscous dissipation, and then the polymeric elastic dissipation. But we haven't been able to fully evaluate this yet. So what I've hoped to show you in this part of the talk is that we can use a poor-scale approach to understand the physics driving this macroscopic flow thickening phenomenon, and importantly, we. Phenomenon. And importantly, we find that the force-based geometry plays an important role in sort of mediating the different contributions leading to this thickening behavior. All right, so now we can switch gears and think about a more applied problem of using these viscoelastic flows to clean a contaminated porous media. And so fouling and soiling of porous media is detrimental to a number of applications from chemical processing to pollution of groundwater. To pollution of groundwater aquifers. So, the question we're asking here is: can a viscoelastic flow clean a soil porous medium more effectively than a viscous neutron flow? So, to do that experimentally, we're going to use a center glass feed packing and flow in these model microglasts, which are just fluorescent trace of particles. You can see the deposition profile here. And what we're going to do now is compare the flow of our polymers to. Compare the flow of our polymer solution at a low flow rate below the onset of instability and a high flow rate above the onset of instability, and compare the sort of cleaning efficacy and removal mechanisms to the viscous background control, which remains laminar. And so we can look at this problem across sort of three length scales. The first is just simply quantifying the macroscopic deposition and net cleaning efficacy. And then we can use skin focal microscopy to actually now visualize what's happening. Me to actually now visualize what's happening at the core scale and how are these deposits, and looking at how these deposits are being mobilized, and then guided by that intuition, then we can hypothesize mechanisms as to what are the local hydrodynamics influencing the cleaning behaviors. All right, so first I'll do a quick recap of what we see at the microscopic scale. So, here I'm just going to show you some confocal reconstructions of the deposition profiles for both this polymer and solvent case. Polymer and solvent case. And at the low flow rate, you see not much change qualitatively. At the high flow rate, you start to see more mobilization of these deposits. But you've also noticed that there's already a difference in sort of the morphologies of the deposits that are left. And then we've also tested just a bonus extra high flow rate case for the polymer to see what happens at high white salted polymers. But just to summarize what we see, we can look at the net reduction or the cleaning efficacy. The cleaning efficacy as a function of the flow rate. And I'm still working on trying to sort of fill in these intermediate points, but what we find preliminarily is that you get enhanced cleaning efficacy with the Polymer solution, whereby you get the same removal efficacy, but at an order of magnitude for refluority. And so now we really want to dive in to observe what's happening at the force scale to lead to this sort of enhanced paint efficacy. Alright, so first I'll show you. First, I'll show you some convocal videos of what happens at the low flow rate condition for both the solvent and the polymer. And what you'll see is not a lot is happening. And this is because the hydrodynamic stresses across the deposits are still lower than the critical yield stress of the deposit, so you don't get a lot of mobilization for both the polymer and solvent case. And so now, if we jump to the high flow rate case, I will show you the solvent control first. And this video is sped up, but what you'll see now is that you start. Up, but what you'll see now is that you start to remove things substantially. I'll replay this. But another important note is that you also build up these deposits in sort of the corners between the grades. And I think this is a sort of important tangential note in that the location of where the deposits are within this 3D matrix really impacts what hydrodynamics are sort of being impacted onto that. So that could change sort of spatially which deposits you're able. Spatially, which deposits you're able to remove in these 3D systems. And so now we can jump to the polymer cases, and I'll just walk through some cool observations that we see with the conflict. And the first is simply that you get enhanced, just like surface jiggling of the deposits at the surface at the high flow of case or high widening of the power case. Where here you see things that sort of moved along the surface, and this one is sort of jiggling back and forth in place before ultimately being mobilized. Or ultimately being mobilized. And then another interesting observation was that in all of these videos, the flow is being imposed from left to right, but we see instances of mobilization that occur sort of contrary to the imposed flow, where you see a deposit that was mobilized backwards and a deposit that did a little spin before being mobilized. And so these observations point to the fact that they're simply just the elastic instagram where you get now fluctuations in the surface. Get now fluctuations in the surface shear stress that allow you to access intermittent bursts of large shear stress to mobilize deposits. But also, this sort of jiggling induced by these fluctuations now can sort of reduce the contact area between the grain and the surface, which reduces the adhesive force. And then sort of another subtle note with the instability is that now you're simply able to access just more flow directions. So the hydrodynamics can act in more directions, and that's just quantified here. And that's just quantified here, looking at the distribution of velocity vectors as a function of the Weisenberg number, where with the Polymer solution, you see a nice broadening here. All right, so another interesting observation that we saw was that there was more preferential surface movement of the deposits before being mobilized. Whereas with the solvent case, we saw that deposits were mostly plucked off the surface. What we see with the polymer case is that you get rolling events and sort of Events and sort of mass sliding along the surfaces. And this relates to the fact that the food is now simply viscoelastic, right? You have additional polymeric stresses in addition to the viscous solvent stresses. And these additional stresses now can enhance the lift and drag forces. And so here I'm just showing you examples of the stretching field again, where you can think of this as a proxy for the stress. And you see large stretching events along surfaces and away from surfaces. So the addition of this fill. So, the addition of viscoelastic stresses now can provide additional lift and drag forces to aid in removal. And then, one final, just cool observation was that what we saw for the polymer solution was that it seems to be more effective in mobilizing the deposits that get stuck in the green context. But they do so in an interesting way, whereby you can see that these deposits sort of stretch and get eroded before ultimately being globalized. And this points to the fact that there is potentially now also. That there is potentially now also an interaction between the polymer and the colour. And so, what we learned from all of this microscopy and analyses is that there's now three potential mechanisms with these viscoelastic flows that can lead to enhance surface cleaning and forest media. And those are the elastic instability, the viscoelastic stresses, and potential polymer quality interactions. Alright, so what I hope to show you is that now we can think about translating these elastic. Think about translating these elastic instabilities to ask more applied transport questions. And Chris will also talk about mixing, mixing and speeding up chemical reactions in his talk. But what I've hoped to show you today is that these experimental coarse-scale flow fields can provide rich understanding of the physics governing these viscoelastic flows in coarse media. And I'll just end with a quick plug for something that I'm currently working on, and that is the flow of these worm-like. The flow of these worm-like micelles are living polymer surfactant solutions in porous media. And what we find is that there's actually three concurrent flow instabilities going on, all at low-level terms, which gives rise to very interesting spatio-temporal dynamics. And we've also just recently put a preprint up looking at the influence of shear thinning on a feature of inelastic instability. And we'll also have a preprint up probably tomorrow on a proof of concept of using. Proof of concept of using these elastic instabilities to improve the efficacy of liquid chromatography. So, with that, thank you all. And if you have time to take any questions, just a question on, I mean, you showed all those beautiful things.
