Recording in progress. Thanks for the introduction and thanks to all the organizers for the kind invitation. It is really a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here. There's some trouble with the audio, I think. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? There is echo. I hear some echo. I hear some echo. Now, now it's better, right? Yes, for me. Okay, great. So, thanks a lot again for the introduction. Thanks to all the organizers for inviting me. It is really a pleasure to have the opportunity to present this talk today. So, I'm gonna speak about, I'm gonna present the second part of the overview of RCD Spaces, and I apologize for not really touching from where Fabio left yesterday. Fabio left yesterday. I'm gonna assume some familiarity with the basic language of terminology about RCD spaces. So please feel free to interrupt me if questions if something is not clear or if I'm going too fast or too slow. So here is a rough outline of what I'm planning to discover today and this time with the minimum theorem for RCD spaces. Then I would like to illustrate how they enter in the way one cap one. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Daniel. There is still the echo. From what I can see, it comes from the Bears meeting room. Maybe if it's possible to put the microphone over there, it's really hard for me to follow, and I guess also for other participants. Yeah, thanks for pointing this out. So now is it better? Yes, for me, yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Please stop me if there is any trouble. Okay, so I would like to, as I was saying, I illustrate how the rigidity and normality, basic rigidity and normal rigidity theorems in the LCD setting enter into play when it comes to proving the structure, regularity theorem, regularity theorems. And I will first stick to the general case, the so-called case where the reference measure is arbitrary, and then I will cover a few. Then I will cover a few more final results in the so-called non-collapse case. And if time allows, in the end, I would like to cover to go through some implications between different notions of covator bouncing this setting in the non-smooth, in the smooth and in the non-smooth category. So here is a starting point at the backbone of the regularity theorem of the regularity theorem theory. As I was saying, there are a few basic rigidity theorems that are valid in the RCDCA theory. are valid in the RCD category. And the first one I would like to mention is the so-called splitting theorem, the variable null splitting theorem, which is in the present setting takes the following form. We consider an RCD 0n metric measure space. We suppose that it contains a line, which is an entire minimizing geodesic. And then the conclusion is that the space has to split in the sense of metric measure spaces as the Riemannian product between a Euclidean line and space and a metric matrix space, which is an RCD 0 and minus 1 metrometer space. So in the present Much space. So, in the present form for RCD spaces, this was proved by GEG back in 2013. Let me briefly remind for historical purposes: let's say that the Riemannian version, the case of smooth Riemannian manifolds with no negative rich curvature, was originally considered by Chiker and Romol back in 72. Then Chicar and Colding proved a version of the splitting theorem for rich limit spaces, and eventually G in 2014 proved it in the present form. A remark. For a remark about it is that if you're interested in going over the proof, let me point out that with the current RCD technology, a proof very much in the spirit of the original proof by Chigar and Gramol in the 70s in the Riemannian case can be given for the splitting theorem. So this is all about the splitting theorem. The second rigidity theorem that I would like to cover is called volume cong implies metric cone. And in order to do so, let me remind you of the definition of cone over a metric space. Of cone over a metric space. If you consider a metric space, which I assume for simplicity to have diameter less or equal than pi, then the con distance over the product zero plus infinity plus y is defined by requiring that the, let's say, the law of cosines holds true. And so for in the L C D setting and more in general, in the C D setting, as Fabio was pointing out yesterday, we are dealing with metric measure spaces. And so it is relevant also to Give the right definition for measure for the measure of the cong, and this is done as follows. So, you define the measure to be the work product measure between the measure r to the n minus 1 dr over the interval over the alf line and the measure on the base space. And given this terminology, the boring coming isometric theorem reads as follows. So, if you consider an R C D 0 M metric measure space and you assume that D0M matrix measured space and they assume that you have a reference point and two radii i, r into r, such that the Bishop-Gramo-volume ratio is constant between radius r and radius 2r. Then the conclusion is that there exists an RCD n minus 2n-1 metrimejure space, which plays the role of the cross-section of the cone, such that the ball of radius r is isomorphic, again in the sense of matri-major spaces, to the ball centered at the vertex of the matri-major cone over the base space Y. Space. Y. This was proved by Defritis and GG in 2016 for RCD spaces. And earlier, the result was proved for rich limit spaces by Chiger and Coltinbeck in 1966. So let me, may I add one reference? It's Nicola GD speaking. Thank you for this introduction. I just want to point out that the fact that the cross-section is RCD and my Is RCD n minus 2n minus 1 really goes back to the work of Christian Keterer. I mean, thank you for creating this to me, but I think it would be me and Wid, of course, to credit also Christian overria. So we prove that this original space has a constructure, precisely the way you say, and then we used as a sort of black box this earlier result of Christian that tells that if a cone is our CD, then the section Are CD, then the section must be as you mentioned. I think that, I mean, I think you should be credited even. Thanks for pointing this out completely. So, as Nicola was saying, so there was this early result by Christian Ketter who proved that the cone over a metric measure space is R C D 0 N if and only if the cross section is R C D L minus 2 N minus 1. Thanks for pointing this out. So, I would like to briefly pause with I would like to briefly pause with the make a pause with the rigidity theorems in order to illustrate the fundamental analytical tool in this theory, which is the so-called Bochner inequality with the Fession term. So as you are probably all aware of, in geometric analysis under lower retrieval button bounce, a fundamental role is played by Bochner's inequality. And it turns out more recently, this has played a fundamental role also in the development. A fundamental role also in the development of the RCB theory. So I won't be precise about this. Let me just remind you, let me just point out to you that a Bogne inequality with Hessian term holds true in the setting of RCD 0 infinity, RCDK infinity multiple spaces, where the main difference with respect to the Riemannian-Bochner identity is that at the right-hand side, you estimate the term Ricci with K times Graduate squared. Time scale to square. The inequality that would follow in the smooth setting from assuming a lower HTTP boundary bounded from below by k. So, this inequality in the form I stated, I presented it in the slide, was proved by Gigi in 2014, building on top of previous work by Sabare and by Ambrose Gi and Sabarem. Let me also point out previous work by Sturm, where format computations in the same spirit previously appear and the Appear and the much anticipated work by Macrid back in the 80s dealing with the smooth setting of the Richard Pops. So, building on top of the computer, one quick question from the previous slide. HS on the normal of the norm of the Haitian, what does it stand for? It stands for Hilbert Schmidt. Hilbert Schmidt. In the smooth category, this will be in the classical Riemannian-Bochner identity. At the right-hand side, what appears is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the Hessian of the function Q. And this can be given a meaning even in the setting of RCD spaces. And you get the very same Bogner's inequality that you would get in the smooth setting. Okay, thanks. Thanks for asking. Okay, so building on top of the rigidity theorems on the one hand, and on the other end, on top of the stability. And on the other end, off top of the stability of the RCD condition with respect to point that, let's say, measure Gromof also convergence and of Grom of compactness theorem in this setting, one can prove the so-called almost rigidity theorems. Let me mention two of them. The first one, I will just give a rough statement, is the almost splitting theorem, which amounts to say that a non-smooth space with the lower, almost non-negative Richie Cuverton and dimensional bounded from above, which contains a very long segment, is a very close. Long segment is a very close to product in the point-defined measure problem of other sense. And analogously, building on top of stability, compactness, and of the volume cone implies metric cone theorem, one can prove the so-called almost volume cone implies almost metrical theorem, which again, let me give just a rough statement. Amounts to say that if you on a non-smooth space, which is a Riemannian, has almost a negative redshift and dimension bounded from above by capital H, if you assume that the Bishop-Cromo-volume ratio is Assume that the Bishop chromo-volume ratio is almost content between two radii's, let's say for simplicity r equal to one and r equal to two, or some reference point p, then the ball of reduced one is close again in the measure gromophasor sense to a ball in a cone. Very well. So now I would like to come to the regularity theorem, to the regularity theory. And so as you all know, a very powerful tool and very common and very usually when you deal with the regularity theory in any region of any setting. In any setting, let's say, a very important tool to consider are blow-ups, so tangent cones. And I would like to start stressing a fundamental difference between the behavioral tangent cones, let's say blow-ups when you do tangent cones at finite scale and blowdowns when you consider tangent concept infinity, under lower-rich curvature bounds and in comparison with the theory of lower sectional curvature bounds. So, let me remind you a classical result which says that. Which says that under, let's say, for simplicity, non-negative sectional curve, but ur tangent cons in the electron set, so blow-ups in the electron of setting are always unique and they are metric cones. And the statement holds if you assume that you are dealing with the blowdowns, so tangent folks at infinity of manifolds or Alexander spaces with the negative sectional curl. The bad news here is that this is, in general, ugly falls under a lower recipe cooler bound. Let me mention a few examples of this, the general. A few examples of this degenerate behavior. So, the first examples, to the best of my knowledge, of non-uniqueness of tangent cause at infinity for manifolds with non-negative rich curvature and Euclidean volume growth, they back to work of Perelman in 97. Later, several examples, so building also on the intuition of Perelman, several examples of the general behaviors under lower rich bounds, so blowdowns of manifolds with non-negative reach and Of non-negative reach and blow-ups of rich limit spaces with very degenerate behavior were considered by Chicago and Colding in their seminal works. And in particular, they managed to build examples of rich limit spaces for which some tangent codes, so some blue ups, were not metric cons. And I would say one of the most degenerate behaviors one can think of comes from an example by Colding a Neighbor in 2000, a more recent example by Colding a Neighbor in 2000. More recent example by Collin Neber in 2013, which is sharp to some extent. And the reason is that they are able to build a three-dimensional manifold with non-negative reach, equilibrium volume growth, which means that the volume of balls grows like R to the third power, and such that the blowdowns, so tangent constant infinity, are not unique. And this is sharp in the sense that if you go to dimension two, then non-negative reach implies non-negative. Then non-negative rich implies non-negative sectional, and therefore, by the remarkable, the blowdowns are unique at infinity. So, this is sharper in the sense of dimension. So, that's all about bad news for now. So, let me start with the regularity theory. The first insight is to realize that on no-smooth spaces, on RCV spaces, for instance, with spaces with Riemannian behavior and lower rich bounds and dimensional bounds, at the very least, At the very least, there exists at almost every point a bridge and tangent. And the key insight in order for proving such a result is the following, quite innocent-looking remark that comes from the splitting theorem, which amounts to say that if you consider your RCDKM at dimensional space, you look at a point which is an interior point of any minimite in geodesic, then when you blow up, you get a full line, and therefore you can apply the splitting theorem, which tells you that the tangent, any tangent cong at that point splits a line. If you apply points split align. If you apply very rapidly speaking, if you apply itoreatively this splitting theorem and this principle, then what you get is the following result proved by Gigi Mondino Rayala in 2013, which says that if you consider any L C D K M measure space, then what you can prove is that for almost every point with respect to the reference measure M, there exists a dimension, liter k between one and capital N, the upper bound on the syntax dimensions. synthetic dimensions such that some tangent space at x is a k-dimensional Euclidean space. Very well. So the next natural question, of course, is to push existence of Euclidean tangents to uniqueness of Euclidean tangents. And moreover, one, in analogy with the regularity theory, let's say in geometric measure theory or in PDEs, one, for instance, would like to understand if these spaces have at least in a weak sense a Riemannian structure. The structure of a Riemannian manifold. Structure, the structure of the Riemannian manifold in a weak sense, in main, maybe in the sense of geometric measure theory. And again, for the sake of comparison with the theory of Alexander spaces, let me remind you the following classical result due to Buragov and Pereman in the Alexandro case, which amounts to say that on an Alexandro space, life is much easier. So in a neighborhood of any point with the Euclidean tangent cone, so for instance, you could apply the previous theorem to find many points with the Euclidean tangent cone. Many points with the pleading tangent cone, and then Burago Romo-Perelmann's theorem tells you that in a neighborhood of those points, you can find that by Lipschitz chart which maps with distance functions the neighborhood of the point into an open subset of the Oklahomian space. This is not known in general in the case of RCD spaces. Nevertheless, in 2013, Mondiro and Neighbor proved the following result, the following replicability result. So, first, they were able to improve the existence of the Euphrates. Able to improve the existence of the Euclidean tangent to existence and uniqueness of Euclidean tangents for almost every base point with respect to the reference mention. And moreover, denoted by R sub K, the set of points where the tangent comp is unique and K dimension Euclidean, they were able to prove that this set Rk is Mk rectifiable, which amounts to say that away from a set of reference measure zero, so away from a set of measure M So, away from a set of measure m equals zero, you can cover your three-dimensional regular set with a countable union of bilip of bore sets, which are bilip sheet images of bored subset of the obvious space of dimension k. And for the sake of for historical reasons, let me remind you also in this case that the analogous statement for rich limit spaces was proved back in 97 by Chicago Colding with a different proof. So, once you've got the So, once you've got the rectificability, so you understand quite well the structure of your metric space in the sense of geometric major theory, the next natural question, since you are dealing with the metric major spaces in this case, is to understand the behavior of the reference mesh. Here, a key insight came from work of the Philippines and Rindler back in 2016, and building on top of their work independently, Calmondino, the Philippines, Marquez-Rinder, and Gili Pascoleto proved. the R and G pascalito prove the following characterization the following structure result for the for the reference measure of little m on any alcidic measure space so by the previous result you can essentially split all your space in the into the union the definite union of the regular sets of dimension little k and what they were able to prove is that when you look at the measure the reference measure and you restrict it to the k-dimensional regular set then this measure is absolutely continuous This measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the k-dimensional house of measure. So, the relevant measure coming from the metric structure. And but, but still, it is not equal to the house of measure. This is false even for weighted Riemannian manifolds. And but you have to allow for a positive locally integrable multiple, for a negative locally integrable multiple of the relevant k-dimensional house of machine. And again, the analog statement, still with different proof, was obtained if With different proof was obtained earlier by Chigre and Colding in 2000 for the Chilean spaces. Now, so the picture is that you understand quite well the metric and dimension away from set of measure zero, but still the possibility that your space is a finite union of pieces of different rectifiable dimensions would be allowed. And back in 2000, she gave in conjecture uniqueness of the rectifiable dimension for rich limit spaces. And this was very much interpreted. Was very much intertwined also with something deeply connected with the topic of this workshop because they pointed out that the uniqueness of the rectifiable dimension could play a key role, for instance, in proving that the Lie group of rich limit spaces generally collapsed, generally collapsed at the rich limit spaces was the isometry group of any rich limit space should be L E group. And here is the theorem for. And here is the theorem for RCD spaces. If you consider the original conjecture of trigger encoding for each linear space is actually all true even in the RCD setting. So if you consider any R C D K M at Manchester space, then there exists a natural number between one and capital N, the upper synthetic bound on the dimension, which is called something called the essential dimension or the rectifiable dimension of the R C D K N space, such that the tangent cone is unique. Tangent comb is unique and n-dimensional Euclidean at almost every point with the spectral reference measure M. So, the history of this result: Kolding and Naber proved the original Chiger and Colding conjecture for Rich-Dimit spaces in 2012. Buram myself proved the version of the result for RCD spaces in 2019. And more recently, Deng, two years ago, gave a different proof of the result much more in the spirit. Proof of the result much more in the spirit of the original proof by Holding A paper. So I won't say anything about the proof we found in collaboration with Druer, but instead I would like to focus a little bit on a very powerful tool that Coding and Neighbor originally for smooth manifolds and their limits, and later subsequently Deng developed in the setting of RCV spaces in order to prove constancy of the dimension for spaces with synthetic lower channels. Spaces with synthetic lower chip bounds. Again, in a remark for the sake of comparison with the Alexandro theorem, so it is a theorem due to Petrunin dating back to 98 that on Alexandro spaces, if you look at the minimizing geodesic and you stay away from the endpoints, then the tangent cone is constant in the period of the minimizing geodesic. So bad news in this case is that this is false for RCDTS spaces and even for rich limit spaces. For reaching its spaces, calling a neighbor in the paper build the counterexamples, build the counterexample, but still you can prove that this is tangent codes, they are not unique, but they are changing continuously along minimizing zodisk. Here is a slightly more precise statement. So if you consider an R C D K Metro space, you look at the minimizing Judysic, let's say parameterize for simplicity on 0, 1, you stay away from the endpoint, then what they prove, what Then what they prove, what Cody and Neighbor prove for rich limit spaces and then and then generalize to RCD spaces, that if you look at the geometry of the ball of radius r, let's say that r is between zero and one, and you look at how it changes in the scale-invariant gram of outer sense along when you move along the geodesic, then what they are able to prove is that the geometry is changing in a scale-in variantly or the continuous way. So a study. Way. So, a straightforward corollary of this order continuity of the geometry of balls of a fixed radius by taking the blow up is that tangent cones along the same sequences of rescalings along a minimizing geodesic are changing in an older continuous sense in the interior of a geodesic. So, they are not constant as in the lower exceptional case, but still they are changing continuously. And a slightly so. a slightly so a quite more refined corollary pointed out obtained by Deng in his paper is that RCD spaces and hence in particular Richie Lin spaces are non-branching. So non-branching means that this was not clear at all a priori. Non-branching means that two minimizing geodesics that start the same must be the same for all times. Daniele, sorry, can I comment? So coding and name. Uh, so Coldian and Naber proved this not for all geodesics but for limit geodesics only. And this is why they couldn't obtain a similar corollary for Richie limits as a thing, right? Because that wasn't enough. You really need it for all Jedi's exercise. Thanks for this point this point in this out. Absolutely. Sorry, let me ask a question, given that I admittedly I still haven't studied all the details of Deng's work. The fact that the tangent Work. The fact that the tangent space varies in a holder-continuous way, per se, is it sufficient to imply that the space is non-branching, or is there some quantitative estimate to take into account in order to deduce this non-branching assumption? I mean, a priori, geodesics could branching in a sort of being tangent, I don't know how to say, right? Yes, indeed. Please, Vitali, correct me if I'm wrong, but in order to prove that the space is non-branching, you need the full strength of. non-branching you need the full strength of the older continuity result for goals of a fixed size so it's not enough to get to to to limit to the to the corollary you need the full strength of the other continuity statement for both of a positive fixed radius also of any positive radius right okay yes yes thank you thanks so before then uh moving to the structure theory in the novelabs case let me end this Collapse case. Let me end this section with a few remarks and questions about the general case of RCDK and major spaces possibly in though with the weight. So the first remark is the following. For long, it was an open question to determine whether the essential dimension, so the rectifiable dimension coincided or not with the outer dimension of the metric space XT. So forget about the measure. It was a long question. it was a long question whether extension dimension would be equal to asteroid dimension. In a recent example, probably you will hear more about this in Pan's talk. A recent example due to Pan and Wei shows that this is false in general. So the essential dimension may be strictly less than the outer dimension of the metric space X D. A remark also may be related to Nicolajigi's question is that, so even to nowadays we know that To nowadays, we know that acidic spaces are non-branching, then what cannot be prevented is the fact that geodesics could branch instantaneously. Let me clarify on this. So on Alexandra's basis, minimizing geodesics starting from a point, let's say they are uniquely determined by the angle, by the initial velocities, let's say. And an example due to Colti and Neighbor back in 2013 illustrates that this is false. Illustrates that this is false, even if you strengthen the assumption to having a non-collapse rich limit space. So geodesic might start tangent, let's say, and then branches entaneously. And the last point that I would like to make is related to an open question. So in this generality, it is unknown whether there exists. So consider a general RCDKI space. It is still unknown whether there exists. It is still unknown whether there exists points which omit a neighborhood which is homeomorphic to a topological value. Are there questions, comments? Okay, if not, I will switch to the second part of the talk where I would like to focus on a few more refined results and the additional so-called non-collapsing assumptions and non-collapsing assumptions. Let me start with a few motivations also for motivating the terminology. Motivated terminology. So it is nowadays classical that rich limit spaces, the reality theory of rich limit spaces is much better understood under the so-called non-collapsing assumption. What do I mean by this? So in general, when you speak about rich limit spaces, you consider a sequence of manifolds. Let's say that they have the same dimension for simplicity. The important point is that the dimension is uniformly bounded from above, and they are converging to a matrix space. You assume that along the sequence, they reach. That along the sequence, the rich equivalent is uniformly bounded from below by a real constant. The non-collapse theory is when you add to the lower rich occurvator bounded to the dimension upper bound, the requirement that the volume of ball centered at reference points converging along the sequence is uniformly bounded away from zero along the sequence. One of the motivations for the much better understood behavior of these non-collapse HD limit spaces is the following. Abstractly limit spaces is the following, known in the literature often as Colding's volume convergence theorem. So, under the assumptions above, so if you have a non-collapsing sequence of smooth Riemannian manifolds, or in general, of non-collapse rich limit spaces, then what you can prove is that the output dimension of the limit space is equal to capital N, so it does not drop along the sequence. And moreover, you can improve just by assuming that the convergence above is in the Grammo filters. Above in the Gramo-Falter sense, you can improve the convergence to measure Gromo-Falter sense. So you can prove that the volume measures of the smooth Riemannian manifold weakly converge along the sequence to the n-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the limit space, which is non-trivial because you already checked that the Hausdorff dimension of the limit is equal to capital N. So a few remarks about the terminology, the terminology. This motivates to pause. To focus a little bit more on the case of those RCDKM active measure spaces for which the reference measure, little M, which in general might be a weighted measure, let's say, is the n-dimensional pass-doff measure. So here notice that the dimension should coincide with the upper bound of the dimension in synthetic sense. And these spaces in the literature have been called nuclear-upstore n-dimension. And before then going into the core of the Before then going into the core of the business, let me point out this recent result by Brener GG on the blue improving upon earlier work by Hohn that will dealt with the compact case. So the result is the following, which is also a kind of motivation for the terminology above. The result is that if you consider any RCDKA multimeter space, then the essential dimension, little n, is equal to the upper bound on the synthetic dimension. upper bound on the synthetic dimension capital N, if and only if the reference measure is equal to the n-dimensional outlook measure up to multiplicative constants. And for the perspective, from the perspective, from a more analytical perspective, let me point out that in this class, from the viewpoint of geometric analysis, the equality Laplacian of the function equal to the trace of the action of the function holds for sufficiently regular functions and even to in general. Even two in general on RCDKN spaces, but even in the much more regular class of weighted remaining non-trivial, let's say, weighted Riemannian manifolds, here you have to add, you need to add in general an extra term depending on the gradient of the function and on the gradient of the weight. So this can be considered also as a characterization. And actually, it's one of the outcomes of these works that this space is also characterized by the identity between Laplacian and trace of the action of the function. The action of the function. So, a few results that were proved by the Philips and G in 2019 about the better regularity, the better behavior of RCDKN spaces with dimension equal to capital H. So first, the natural generalization of Colding's volume convergence theorem holds in this class. Moreover, building on top of the enhanced regularity of the reference measure and building on top of the volume Top of the volume coning plasmetric theorem, metric cone theorem, what they proved was that all iterated tangent cones, so in particular, all tangent cones at all points are really metric cones, which is false in general for RCD spaces, as I pointed out in one of these previous slides about the examples. Moreover, you have a stronger, let's say, epsilon regality theorem to the amount that if you are able to prove that one tangent kung is n-dimensional Epidemian sample. Is n-dimensional Euclidean at some point, then you also infer that the tangent Kong is unique at that point. And then, of course, the point must be regular in the sense that it has a unique tangent cone equal to the n-dimensional Euclidean space. And eventually, a result concerning the so-called stratification of the singular set. So, if you denote by S capital K the set of those points where there are not too many symmetries in the tangent close, which are more precise. matrix in the tangent cones, which more precisely means that you denote by S capital K the set of those points where no tangent con at the point splits a factor splits isometrically a factor, a Euclidean factor of dimension k plus one. Then building on top of the previous statement and building on top of the well-established Federer's dimension reduction, what is possible to prove is that you have a sharp out of dimension estimate for this k. Estimate for this k-dimensional singular structure. So, as I pointed out before, so basically nothing is known about the topological regularity, so the manifold topological regularity of RCD spaces in the general case. The picture is much better in the case of non-collapsed spaces. And let me start with the integer topological regularity theorem. So, Kapovico Mondino, three years ago, after work of after three After work of after previous work by Chiger and Kolding in the 90s, proved the following individual regulatory topological regulatory statement. So, consider an n-dimensional RCDKN multi-manage space. Then what you can check is that there is an open neighborhood of the regular set, which is by holder homomorphic to a smooth remarkable manifold. So, away from a set on a dense open set, you know that you have a manifold topological regularity. A remark about the technique of the proof. The technique of the proof. So, the proof builds in the original work of Bacher and Colding and also in the work by Kapovich and Mundino. The proof builds on a variant of the classical Reisenberg theorem, which was extended from a subset of Euclidean space to general metric spaces by Chigere and Folding for the reason of proving this theorem back in 97. Let me also point out for historical sake that are inside For historical sake, the earlier insights, deep earlier insights on the topological regularity under rich cuver bounds came from previous work by Anderson back in 1990 and by Perelman in 1994. So as I was mentioning, so in the classical Chigger Colding, in the classical proof by Chigger and Colding and in the proof by Kapovich and Mondino, so topological regularity comes from applying Reisenberg's technique. Reitenberg's technique. More recently, it has been realized that actually, if you consider a space with low rich bounds, and let's say with so a Riemannian space with low rich bounds, one can prove one can get the topological regularity in a much more intrinsic way, I would say. So, here the key insights come from work by Chigojang and Neighbor, which was later adapted in work by for this part, it was later adapted by work. It was later adapted by work in work by Bruin, Neber, and myself to the RCD setting. And the theorem is the following: to fix any parameter alpha, which is which plays the role of the older exponent, for any parameter alpha between 0 and 1, strictly smaller than 1, this is a key point, you can find a small parameter epsilon, such that if you have an R C D minus epsilon S space for which the grammar foul distance between the ball of radius 2 and the ball of radius 2 in the model, so the Of radius two in the model, so the flat equation space is smaller than epsilon, then the following ones, you can find a map between, so here the constants are not really relevant, of course, you can find a map between the ball of radius three over two and the Euclidean space with the following properties. So first property, the components of the map U are harmonic. In particular, they are locally shaped. The key point here is that the components are harmonic. And so this might lead you to. Might lead you to consider this statement as a statement about the existence of harmonic coordinates in a weak sense. Moreover, the second key property is that the map view is a half a bipolar homeomorphism with its image. And furthermore, this is so the image is not trivial. It is open and you can arrange things in such a way that it contains the Euclidean ball of radius one in the Euclidean space. So you have a bipolder homomorphism with Lipschitz coordinates. With Lipschitz coordinate and harmonic coordinate into an open subset of the applicant space. Let me again, for a second reason, let me point out that the construction of harmonic, so-called almost splitting maps under lower each balance in the smooth setting goes back to Chigar and Colding, but the improvement from almost splitting maps to bipolder or meomorphism and in the smooth setting, you can even push it further to the feomorphism that. The feomorphism dates is much more recent than is due to Chigashang and Nebury in 2018. So, I told you a few results about interior topological regularity for RCD spaces and for spaces with lower each bound. Let me mention a couple of examples related to the interior topological single, the simplest, let's say, interior topological singularities that might appear in this setting. So, the first example I would like to mention is classical. This is the so-called. Classical, this is the so-called Eguchi-Ansub metric, which is a Ricci-Flat metric on the cotangent bundle of paths S2, so a four-dimensional smoke-many manifold with a Ricci-Flat metric and the Euclidean volume growth. So at infinity, the volume of balls of reduced R grows like R to the power of 4. This is Richie-flat. If you take the blowdown, which in particular is a non-collapse rich limit space, it is much more, it is a non-collapsed limit of rich-flap manifolds. Of Richie Flat manifolds, then the glowdown is R4 modulo Z2, which in particular is not a topological manifold near to the origin. So what you get is an exact, in particular, what you get is an example of limit of richly plaque manifolds of dimension four, which is non-collapsed and develops a topological singularity. So this is a singularity of co-dimension four in the topological sense. And this is in the setting of limits of smooth manifolds with in this case. Smooth manifolds with, in this case, Ricci-Platmatrix, but in particular with the non-negative Ricci curvature. The second example that I would like to mention has already been mentioned yesterday and is to some extent it's simpler. You can consider in the RCD setting, where again, due to the result by Ketere that was mentioned before, you can always check that if you have an RCD one, two, let measures space, if you take the cone of If you take the cone over this cross-section, then what you get is an RCD 03, macromesh space. In particular, you can consider the real projective space of dimension 2. This is a smooth Riemannian manifold with the rich boundary from below by 1 and dimension 2. And by Ketterest result, the cone over this space is an R C D 0 3 space. And therefore, you get an example of a three-dimensional. You can endow it with the three-dimensional Hausa measure. And what you get is. Measure and what you get is an example of a three-dimensional RCD space with a topological singularity at the origin, so at the vertex point of the cone. In particular, this gives you an example of, I will comment more on this later, but this is reasonable to believe, this gives you an example of an RCD zero-free space, so three-dimensional with no boundaries and a topological singularity in four-dimensional free. That's all about I wanted to say about interior topological regularity and interior topological. Topological regularity and interior topological singularities, and let me pass to the case of boundary regularity, both in the rectifiable and in the topological sense. So, here the first remark is that in the case of so originally the set of the space which doesn't have topological singularities, is that like geodetically? Singularities is that like geodetically convex or something similar to this? I think this is true in the Alexandrov case, right? I'm not sure this is known. I'll think about it more carefully, but I'm not sure this is known in the RCV setting. Even in the non-collapse case. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Okay, great. So let me pass from interior topological irregularity and the interior topological singularities to the case of boundary irregularity. To the case of boundary regularity and singularities, of course. So, here the starting point of the business is that the observation that even in the setting of in the in the much more regular setting of non-collapsed or n-dimensional CDKL multimeter spaces, so boundary type singularities are allowed. And the key observation here is that the observation that the convex subset of an RCDK young space. Subset of an R C D K N space is still an R C D K N matri measure space. In particular, you can think of a convex polygon in R2. And this is an example of R C D 0 2 space. And if you stare at that example, you realize that this might be at least a reasonable definition. So the definition is the following. You define the boundary of an R C D, an n-dimensional R C D K M at major space to be the topological closure of the set Topological closure of the set of the so-called top-dimensional singular structures. So you take s n minus one, you subtract off s n minus two, and you take the topological closure. So let me illustrate in this very elementary example what this means. So consider, for instance, a square in R2. So the interior of a square in R2. Then the top-dimensional singular stratum in that case will be the set of interior points of the edges. So you're looking at all those. At all those points for which one tangent cone is the n-dimensional flat tile space, which corresponds in this silly example to the case of interior points of the edges. And if you take the topological closure, then you really get the boundary of your convex body. And this is also consistent with the definition of boundary in the Alexander theorem. So, a theorem due to Brouel, Nebraska and myself is the following about the record. About the rectifiable measure-theoretic regularity of the boundary of n-dimensional RCDKM at measure spaces. So, the theorem says that if you take as definition of the boundary the one that I pointed out above, then the boundary inherits the same regularity of the space in codimension one. So, in particular, the boundary is n minus one rectifiable and it has locally finite outer measure of dimension n minus one. And moreover, you can push the integer. you can push the interior epsilon regularity theorem that I mentioned before to the extent that a point where the tangent one tangent is flat Euclidean has unique tangent up to the boundary so if you have a point for which one tangent cone is flat Euclidean half space then the tangent cone is unique at the point and so it is reasonable to call it a boundary regular point and moreover in the same joint work with Brian Naber we extended the original sugar coding argument to so the original argument So the original arc result result due to Chigger and Colding to the amount that limits non-collapsed limits of manifolds with lower each bounds and empty boundary have empty boundary in the sense that the top dimensional single astratomy is empty will extend that they are the result of the case of non-collapse limits of n-dimensional RCDKN matrix spaces. So if you have a sequence of R C D K N matri meso spaces which are n-dimensional which converges in the non-collapsed in It converges in the gromofout sense without collapsing, then the limit has empty boundary. Okay, and about topological boundary regularity, we can improve the interior topological regularity up to a boundary regularity statement, which is the following. So remember, I told you that Kapovich and Mundino extended the original trigger encoding result to prove that away from That away from a set of dimensions one, any L C D Kn space is a topological biodiversity topological manifold. In the joint work with Bre and Neber, we proved that there exists an open set whose complement has alpha dimension less or equal than M minus 2, such that this open set is bi-holder homomorphic to a smooth manifold, possibly with boundary. Of course, you need to include boundary if you want to push the statement away from coordination two. And moreover, if you look at the boundary of a space intersected with At the boundary of the space intersected with this open regular neighborhood, then what you get is an n-minus one-dimensional manifold without boundary. And let me remark that the key step for establishing such a regularity theorem is proving that something which is a priori, not trivial at all, which is the statement that if you have an RCD Kn space with the essential dimension equal to capital N, which is close at some location scale in the Grammo-Fausal sense to the ball of radius 1. Of outer sense to the ball of predicted one in the half space, then you actually have many boundary points. This is not trivial at all, every other way. Okay, great. Let me conclude this part about the regularity of non-collapse spaces with synthetic rich bounds by mentioning a few open questions. So the first one that I would like to mention is the following conjecture, sometimes attributed to Anderson, Tiger, Coding, and Young, which is the conjecture motivated by the Aguchi-Anson example. Aguchi-Anson example that non-collapse at the rich limit spaces should be homeomorphic to topological manifolds away from set of co-dimensional four. So, if you remember, the Aguchi-Anson example is the limit of four-dimensional manifolds which develops a topological singularity in codimension four. And to the best of my knowledge, nothing is known about this validity in arbitrary dimension, but still the conjecture is true in dimension three. In dimension three. This is a result due to Simon and Topping in 2017, who proved that any three-dimensional non-collapse directly limit space is a topological manifold. That's confirming the conjecture, the Anderson chigger called the Intian conjecture in dimension free. And Kapovich and Mundino explicitly stated a version of this topological regularity conjecture away from small set in the paper. And of course, motivated by the example of the cone over the projective plane, you Over the projective plane, you have to slightly modify the conjecture. And in the RCD setting, the conjecture reads as follows: the conjecture that an RCDKN space with essential dimension equal to capital H with empty boundary, so with empty boundaries homeomorphic to a topological manifold away from a set of co-dimensional three. This would be sharp in view of the example of the conop RP2 that we discussed before. In the last few minutes, I would like to briefly I would like to briefly point out a few results and a few open questions concerning the relationship between. So, of course, in the smooth category, there is a natural relationship between sectional curvature, rich curvature, and scalar curvature. And I would like to briefly outline some developments and questions related to the analogous problem in the synaptic case. So, as I was mentioning, in the smooth case, lower sectional corrode about clearly imply lower reciprocal bounds, and on the other end, Bounds. And on the other end, if you are in dimension two, there's not enough space to have a difference between sectional and rich, and in particular, rich curvature and sectional curvature coincide in dimension two. So addressing the first remark, Petruning in 2009, you can also refer to the subsequent work by Tang and Du, who considered the proof, who wrote the proof also in the case of arbitrary lower receptional cobalt bounds. So Petruni's statement is the following. Bound. So, Petruni's statement is the following. If you consider an Alexandro space of dimension n and with curvature, sectional curvature bounded from below by liter k, then if you endorse it with the n-dimensional house that measure, what you get is S C D k times L minus one and maximizer space, and then it is easy to check that this is also an L C D space. So, this confirms the classical smooth implication between lower sectional and lower rich bounds in the synthetic category. Synthetic category and addressing the second part of the remark about the dimension two case, more recently Liechek and Stadler proved that if you have instead an RCD K2 space and though with its two-dimensional volume measure, then what you get is that it is also an Alexandro space with sectional curve at abundance and below by capital K. So in this case, that confirmed the smooth remark that in dimension two, a rich sectional, they are the same. They are the same. About the open, so this basically settles the basic question about the implications between sectional and rich in the synthetic case. And let me address a few, let me mention a few to conclude a few questions, a few intriguing questions about the relationship between lower sectional and lower rich in the synthetic case and the bound from the scalar pulmon. So I would like to start pointing out this theorem due to Petruning. Theorem due to Petrunin, which amounts to say that in any dimension there exists a positive constant such that if you stare at a smooth Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature bounded from below by minus one, for simplicity, then what you can prove is that there is a uniform scale invariant integral curvature bound L1 integral curvature bound for the scalar curvature. So here the key is that the integral of the scalar, the L1, the scale invariant L1 norm of the scalar under One norm of the scalar under lower sectional probability bounds is uniformly bounded independently of any other geometric quantity. A related conjecture due to Yao, I'm not completely sure about the year, this is the first year where I found it stated, is that an analogous integral bound should hold if in Petruni's theorem you replace the assumption that this manifold, this multi-mani manifold has lower sectional curvature. As lower sectional curvature as a sectional curvature bounded from below by minus one, with the assumption that the rich equivalent of the manifold is bounded from below by minus one. This is a long-standing conjecture to Yao. And these, in my perspective, are key open questions concerning the relationship between scalar, integral scalar, and lower Ricci in the smooth case. If you are more interested, of course, they are related. Of course, they are related questions, but if you are more interested in the synthetic category, here are related open questions. So, the first one, I find it stated by Petruning and Lebedeva in a recent reprint, is to find the well-behaved notion of scalar curvature measure on Alexander spaces. And more in general, I want to ask the same question for a notion of measure-bound curvature, and analogously, in the setting of RCD, KA. In the setting of RCD, Kn spaces, so synthetic lower H bounds, but you can even be less optimistic and stick to the case where the essential dimension is equal to the upper synthetic bound of the dimension. Another open question is to find a notion of scalar curvature measure for RCDK and measure spaces, which should be consistent probably with the smooth, both with the smooth case, so with the notion of the natural notion of scalar curvature in the smooth setting, and also with the gas. And also with the Gauss-Bornet theorem in dimension two. And to conclude, let me point out the works of Kapovich Lichogette Truning and the more recent work of Bajik for related results and proposals. So that's all I wanted to say and thank you for the attention. Thank you very much for the interesting talk. Are there any questions, comments? Comments? Sorry, can I? I know, please go ahead. I just wanted to make a comment about you were listening to some conjectures and results relation between sectional and lower sectional low-rich bounds. There is one which I find very interesting. I wanted to advertise, if you don't mind. So, if you have an conjecture. The conjecture is that, well, in Alexander geometry, there is a conjecture that the boundary of an Alexandrov space is again Alexandrov with the same lower Karochev bound. It's true in smooth case by Gauss formula. And this has been open now for some 30 years and it seems very, very hard. Nobody knows what to do with it. So I would like to propose a weaker conjecture that the boundary of Alexander. The boundary of Alexandra space is RCD. Non-collapsed RCD, right? So, if somebody wants to tackle that, that would be a weaker version of that conjecture and should still be interesting. Sorry. I have a comment on the question. If I may. So, the comment is that, I mean, perhaps there should be, I mean, I should make, I want to mention that both the definition. Want to mention that both the definition of non-collapsed RCD space and the notion of topological boundary that you used both come from the paper of myself with the Philippines. And I mean, it should be mentioned, I think. And the second thing is a question. So in this conjecture of Yao about lower Richie bound and integral scalar curvature, to your knowledge, the measure, I mean, is there manifold way? The measure, I mean, is the manifold weighted or can I mean, can it be weighted or I mean, basically, it's collapsed or non-collapsed? So, because I suspect it should be non-collapsed, morally speaking. But perhaps Yao sees more than me. I mean, for sure he does, but in this case, perhaps. Do you have a comment? I mean, do you know? I'm not sure I got your point. So, what maybe one remark I could. How do you interpret lower Ichi bound in Yao's conjecture? Is Bakri-Emery Lichnerowitz or is really, you know, what is the Richie bound? What is the lead? Is the measure the out of measure, or you know, or are you allowing also a weighted manifold? I think that originally, in the so for sure, in the statement that I found in this open problems paper, dating back to 1990, is dealing with the smoothie manian manifolds and all with their volume measure. Okay, so there's no space for weights in that case. One comment that I may add is that, so even in the case That so, even in the case of lower sectional, if you go to Petruni's paper, and there is also a previous paper by Petruni, so it seems that the conjecture, so Petruni's result was easier to prove in the case where you assume additionally to the lower section of cold water bound, a lower volume bound on the volume of balls. So, this could be called a non-collapsed version of the integral scalar culvert condition. Scalar Culver conjecture. And of course, you can add the same. So the Yaus conjecture is still open even in the lower H case, the conjecture is still open even if you assume that there is a uniform lower bound on the volume of the balls. And for instance, in... Even in the smooth setting, nothing is. I mean, you're really speaking about the smooth category here. Right? Yep. Yeah. And if you go, for instance, to a recent paper about conjectures by Neighbor. Paper about conjectures by neighbor, you can find both the non-collapse version of the conjecture, where by non-collapse, I mean that you add the requirement that the volume of balls is uniformly bounded away from zero and the collapse conjecture by the original policy. Thanks. You're welcome. I had a question, more basic question. So, um, Question. So you had this codimension estimate for the subset of the space which is a topological manifold. It was co-dimension four, right? But I'm a bit confused by this because I guess, for example, in Alexandrov spaces, you can say this is co-dimension two, right? But then I mean, how is this consistent with this? With this, so I think that even in the Alexandro case, if you have no boundary, so the statement should be at least the conjecture. I'm not sure if this is true. I think it should, the statement should be that if there is no boundary, they are topological manifolds away from sets of co-dimensional three. Right, yeah, right. So in this case, the conjecture is about non-collapsed rich limit spaces of so non-collapsed limits of manifolds with empty boundaries. Of manifolds with empty boundaries, I forgot to add so this I think that this is consistent. Am I missing something? Um, like say a cone of RP2. I guess I'm just confused. So is that sure? This is not a limit of smooth remanufacturing. Oh, that's not a limit. Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, I see, I see, I see. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Are there further questions? We have another question. Okay, so I guess is this one? I guess it's on. So for, I guess, this is more a question maybe for Kapovich that just mentioned his. For Kapovich that just mentioned his revised conjecture. So, what would you think happens when a boundary of a rich limit space? I mean, I guess. Did you hear the question? Sorry, you're asking me. Well, yeah, you or whoever's interested in that topic, I guess. Well, in the reach of limit category, even if it Even if you just have a smooth manifold with low Richie bound, the boundary doesn't have to have the same or any low Richie bound. I mean, it doesn't translate. It only works for sectional curvature. If you look at Gauss's formulas, that if you have ambient sectional curvature bounded below, then the boundary also has sectional curvature bounded below. So this is. I wouldn't expect anything to be true for the boundary of non-collapsed reaching limit. Sorry, RCD space. But the one that I asked should be correct. Okay, thanks. Thanks. Okay, more questions? I have a question, sorry. Sir. Yeah, for this conjecture of defining this color curvature on RCD spaces, I'm aware there is this notion of measure-valued curvature tensor in the RCD setting. I think this notion is to Nicola degree. We try to use that tensor. Tensor to define the scalar curvature somehow? Is there like any? Maybe, please correct me if I'm wrong. So, I am not sure that the GE's notion gives you at the moment a measured value of the tensor. And the other issue, so from my point of view, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is that even in the two-dimensional case, this is not. This is not a priori consistent with gas volume. So, this is for the way it is defined. This is not, so this is this does not charge a set of zero capacity. And in particular, even in the two-dimensional case, it is not able to go through codimensional singularities, wherein one might expect to have direct deltas, the vertexes of codimensional two singularities. But please correct me if I'm wrong. Please correct me if I'm wrong. If I may add a comment in this direction, because I'm working together with Camilo Bereno, who is also in the audience here. And so, in fact, I think we can have really a measured value tensor in some sense of this Richie curvature, at least on a finite dimensional RCDKN spaces, which anyway are the most relevant from the geometric perspective. Relevant from the geometric perspective, and so there is a measure. But I agree with Daniele when he says, and more generally, any comment that says that a definition per se is not sufficient, you should come with some theorem, say Gauss-Bonnet or whatever other result relating the scalar curvature with the geometry of the manifold. So, one of the facts that is true for this Ricci curvature that I That you know, that I introduced is that it really covers the geometry of R C D K and spaces. You look at the tensor and you can deduce whether it is R C D spaces or not, basically, which is the lower Ricci-Courage bound, to be more precise. But with the trace of the Ricci measure as defined in terms of measure, I really have no result to present. On the other hand, I'm not really sure that one should exp should. Sure, that one should really expect a direct mass on the tip of cones. These are not really, I mean, on two-dimensional cones, I agree. On higher-dimensional cones, you should not see that. And so there is a little bit. You agree, right? So there is a really different. Sorry. Sorry. No, it's like it's really like when you compute the hash of the absolute value, right? Dimension one, the Hessian of modules of X. The Hessian of modules of X as a direct mass, and in higher dimension is an absolutely continuous measure. So, but it is true that this Ricci tensor, as I defined, does not see sets of co-dimension two. So, these tips of cones, you know, could be an issue. And yeah. So, if I may add, so I think that due to the natural scaling of the curvature, what should be could be reasonable to expect is that the scale. To expect is that the scalar curvature measure, and this is for instance the case in the setting of limit of manifolds with the lower sectional curvature bounds. So, what might be reasonable to expect is that this scalar cover measure is absolutely vanishes on sets of, for instance, of outer measure of dimension n minus 2 vanishing. So, in particular, one might expect that if it vanishes. One might expect that it is vanishing at all. It's not charging sigma points of a dimension higher than two, but it should might charge. And this is, for instance, conjecture in the paper by Neighbor that I mentioned before, that it might should charge the vertexes of co-dimension two singular points. I agree. So I have another question maybe related to the possibility of having a topological manifold. Of having a topological manifold inside? I mean, do you think you could find conditions under which an RCD space, say a non-collapsing one, would have a fundamental class or would actually be a homology manifold? Because this is something that kind of does happen for Alexandrov spaces and that is very useful in the smooth manifold case. And is something that would be desirable to have so that we could compare different things that are more topological to more geometric ones. More geometric ones, so I guess more of a question. Thanks for asking. I'm not sure I have any insight on this television about this. Maybe someone in the audience. Okay. Okay, if there are not further questions or comments, let's thank Danielle again. And we resume at 9:15. Yeah, 9:15.
