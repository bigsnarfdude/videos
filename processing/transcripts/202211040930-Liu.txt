So, please, the floor is yours. Thank you very much for saying for the invitation. It's really nice to see some friends over there and talk about some connections with Kinetic student with Kodovika Ken, which I have been lately working on. So, let me just slightly change the title so that it gives you motivation what it is about. What it is about. So it's like a slide chain title called a long time behavior for Nipia Games, which I currently work on, and we can serve. But then I will probably also focus on the game. Let me just do this. Okay, yeah. So let me just give you the motivation. So let me first explain connection. So suppose you have a kinetic system, which is more complicated than usual, it's not like. Usually, it's not giving you the laws, how to interact in how to the creation, but rather it's given by sort of some optimization. That's what the MiFi game means. So, suppose you have individual player in the MI field, then you want to do optimize strategy. And open strategy is that basically I use sort of more economical ways that. So, you have a terminal cost. That means, but terminal cost is. That means, but terminal cost is called a mean field terminal cost. That means you are how terminal profit, which means you are among all the terminal, all the populations, how much you have here. So, suppose you use genetic G. Yes, it doesn't go back and forth for some reason. Oh, so that's can you try again? Yeah, let's say, let me let me without the okay. Uh, okay, let me try stop a sharing. Okay, let me try to stop the sharing. Let's do a simple one. How about that? Yes. Let's do the make it work. Okay, so let's can you see the screen? Yeah, yeah. Okay, let's just do this. Yeah, okay. So now it's working. Perfect. Thanks. Thank you. So now you look at this individuals, the different from usual kinetic students, but later on back to kinetic students. So you have more before below kinetic objection. Below objection. So you'll maximize your property. You have terminal property, but among populations, kinetic means. So you have the population density low at time t, and how much you property, and you subtract the learning cost, which you kinetic energy, subtract to potential energy, potential energy again, you are among the population. So you're giving by this. So doing this guy, this is a clearly a formula solution to the lax only classimic group. A luxur only semi-group for this humming jack group equation. That's how it works. It is all right. So then you yourself doing simple dynamic self-e-transport. But among all this discussion, interacting or condensing this velocity there. Now, if optimal trajectory itself is easily just usually Hamiltonian dynamic, you write down this individual trajectory, just satisfy this Hamiltonian system, with my Hamiltonian given by usually Hamiltonian plus. Usually, Hamptonia plus potential energy comes from the population. So that is this. Now, but this is a simple story. The story is that the main story is that for this one, suppose you solve this Hamden-Jacques equation for this value function, which is the plan evolution, and this solution is given by this Lux Orlunic semi-group representation. Now, what it is now you reduce basically correct action from the Call reduction from this optimization self to kinetic equation. That means you're giving your position yourself is normally in the called a feedback control called kinetic. That means this guy. Your optimal strategy is actually where you are, XS. You take this, you take this optimal strategy is the momentum, and I put inside Hamiltonia, and you know what to do. So that is sort of the idea. So that is sort of the idea for the how this reduction from the open control to determine the loss. Of course, Connecticut normally giving loss, how this giving either defined locally, globally. But here's sort of more under level of one additionally potential, the minimization. But important is how to reduction, to reduce the optimization directly compared to kinetic, that's what I'm talking about. Talk about. So now, first for the mean field. So individual self connection and then meaningful if we agree with the mean field. So that means you look at this mean field itself, look at population. It doesn't same thing. Now here's sort of important. So you have the individually beginning, the terminal cost and terminal cost, learning cost and terminal property itself. You have to introduce this free energy so that you recast the population. You recast the population, the whole population can maximize the property for terminal property and this learning cost. Now, here, this is just a functional. So, you subject the transport. So, you individually, you immerse in the population dynamic itself. Basically, you are just a flow map for individual transport. So, now the catch is that called a potential game. So, that means this guy, when you compute the profit or cost. The profit or cost itself, you should compute the energy instead of total cost. So that is the main results of the potential game, which always gets the Nobel Prize for understanding economics. Okay. Now, and the impure consistency, that's important. So now you learn in this in the density level, population level of game, you have this dynamic equation called a new field game system, or maybe just trajectory for the population. For the population. So again, the transport equation or kinetic, nice kinetic equation, but the strategy was given by solving this Hampton-Jacobi equation. Same equation as we said individually. Okay, but now this equation system is very complicated because I have the initial condition and a terminal condition. Now catch is this one. Let's say a few words catch. Is this a Nash equivalent? That means if individual I If individual items my optimal strategy, I should be consistent with the optimal strategy of population. So I shall be seen as a behavior as a group. So that's called a natural equipment. So that in here, just simply your strategy, what you have here is by feedback control is given by this one. And your decision maker is just a feedback control. If you have to solve this complicated harmonic. So then you. So then, then this individual behavior self agrees with the dynamic of okay. So, that is so now what is important here? How to this is a complicated system. It's like complicational. Yeah, the extremely complicated initial like the backboard back forward backwards. So, now there's a number of ways to kind of reduce the problem. I guess first of all, easiest of one called the best. Uh, first of all, easiest of one called the best uh response strategy, which uh uh is well known in the economics mathematically. Uh, together with Pierre DeGar and Christian Lingov, in 14 we write a sequence of papers to explain how this kind of kinetic patient is connected with the Nash equivalent and meteor gain. So that's what we patient. So then we formally in the 17 with the McCarty again with a peer, we were actually to explain. We appear, we will actually explain how to justify for me-fit gain systems to this more, uh, uh, uh, to this best uh response strategy that we have. So now, recently, is this replica results is a paper by Leonz is a sort of a remark on this one, says that media can actually reduce to the faster refi strategy, which in particular regulates particularly this paper, variation paper, you take a large You take a large discount limit. That means time evolution, the time horizon is not so important. As a limit, it's actually exactly this fast 35 strategy, which we was early time studying. So that's the one deduction. Basically, say doing optimization, you have to do something sort of not if you have to complete this whole system, the great. But otherwise, there's also the way to reduction, which is the first is just a large discount limit, which is very naturally for our usually. When actually, for our usually our happy kinetic patient, so another one, so you built called infinite time horizon called a weak came theory. So, same idea. So, basically, how to determine the feedback control or reduce to the kinetic condition. See a number of activities. Indeed, the first paper probably in the 1905-06, he just delivered the MIPAC game. He studied the station of the MIPA games and is exactly right on Vikings' theorem. Atom became theorem. Then, for recently, Bob Gambo and Gome and Katarik series, many, many recent activities, quite indeed a hot topic over that. That is how means this guy himself solve dynamic Hamza Jacobi equation. And most of the time, importantly, as long as you have to solve a steady Hamza-Jacobi equation, this will be enough to give to you the best response. Best to response. So that is the idea. So now, of course, the system is complicated. Let's work on a rather elementary simple question in one dimension. In a circle, I will try to explain this KM results, which is the most recent work with Yuan Yuan Gao on this one. So now let me just try to explain exactly the idea, same as K. So what does it mean? Again, you see this the You see, this game is a basic list of Hamiltonian system. It's a coupler system, it's complicated. If we, anyway, we can determine the momentum P, then we just reduce to kinetic equation. I will say first equation called kinetic equation, this is called Hampton. So now, what does here is Kim says this guy, if we have to solve, always reduce to solve stationary Hampton-Jacques equation, if we solve this OCL problem, if you have to solve this one, you can make a transformation. You can make a transformation called a GNIT function, then it becomes kinetic map, you reduce to angular action angular available, then reduced to the beautifully simple first order system, which is our kinetic fish. So that way the KM. Of course, this is very difficult. If you want to solve this classically, it's almost impossible. So it's a perturbative way. So that is how KM name comes from. So now let's look at the Let's look at what it is. So, for steady state itself, you look at the very simple Langevin dynamic on circle, you're giving the potential, and this potential derivative is a periodic. So it's make a perfect dynamic on circle. But on the other hand, you're assuming this average input, the flux, the force to the B bar is not equal to zero. So that means. Equal to zero, so that means that each cycle dynamically self is pumping some energy b bar. This will make the system yearly visible. This will give you all kinds of interesting phenomena, which I'm explaining. So if we study this one, we're not studying really because this can have exotic. It's always convergent equivalent and equivalent given by this stationary fork-Planck equation. Give this one. One dimension is a closed formula. And the closed formula is quite interesting. And the closed formula is quite interesting. Let me explain. This pi we usually denote as an equivalent solution. And then the given state is a very nice given state. But this u given is another periodic. We call it scoop periodic. That means subtract a linear function. It is periodic. Now, this solution, pi, is a periodic function. So there's a collection, the periodic collection to make this periodic function as integral form and it is a verified theory. So now here we'll So now, here we want to say a few words. If we b bar equal to zero, that means u is a periodic function. That's pi just by given state and e to minus u x divided by epsilon. So this u is nothing but a root function in logic deviation. So that is a very simple solar problem. It's just usual stuff, what we're familiar with. But now interesting case is that if b bar not equal. If B bar is not equal to zero, what happens? So now you study this logic deviation, you perform called WKB expansion equivalently. So then if you perform this WKB equation dynamically, this dynamically Hamilton Jacques equation, but for pi, just stationary Hamilton Jacques equation. And this Hamiltonian coming out, just this form, particular form. Okay, so that is when now. Okay, so that is when. Now, how the behavior are rather interesting. Suppose, like, give you an extremely simple example, just a single well, okay, but it's not periodic because this low and the high. And now, what is the solution? The solution is called exit problem. That means if you are a participant here, in the way, just like the brand emotion, you bring this guy, how much energy you reach to this one, you overcome energy barrier. Can energy vary. But if we at this point, then it's interesting. So, what interesting means, this guy, you flank here, if you want to reach this point, you will not climb a mountain to here, this one here, to make this the energy barrier. Rather, you access for easy problem leaving from this point, but at this point itself, send at this point because periodic function. Then you down here, and important here. And important here, for this system, anything down here is at a zero cost, a skip descent is zero cost. So that will end up the solution is given this nice function have cutoff. So that is a rate function for logic deviation. And this is how this works. And this cutoff points are not differentiable, but nevertheless, it is a viscous solution. It's just fine. Okay. So that is when now, this is for very simple example. We get close formula. We can solve. For example, we get close formula and solve it, but important here is for general what we do. We have to really use a slightly more complicated same as always use optimization. Now, here's two concepts. One called a manure potential, one called a pierce potential. So that means precise was before we doing this July, this media game for fixed time holism. Then, for this fixed time, solve the end of equation, dynamic equation solve time-dependent content. So time-dependent time tension could be quite complicated. So, the way to remove this is one study solution itself is instead of this T, we have called indefinite time flood. The least section becomes this metropolis. I mean, infinite T. And now, this, then, this is how this energy value computer. So, that is one concept in your computer. So, that basically we can. Basically, maybe we can explain how the indefinite time horizon or infinite time horizon depends on the problem. And this indeed, if one pointer x0 or y0, it becomes the stationary pointer, then this in female in T becomes the limb in T. That's what becomes really the sort of how to solve this VKK problem. So that's a conduction. But this computer, this least action is a lot complicated. Let me explain a little. Me explain a little bit. So, now also another connection is very important called a critical energy level in this K-M theorem. And for this case, indeed, it is a rather simple because we are Laca is a special property. For an Large Deviation principle, Lacande always non-negative. And if Lacande to zero, that's why exemption for zero cost. If zero cost, if only if we lower for larger numbers, and with this two. And with these two properties, we can easily derive, prove that this critical energy value is indeed zero. So that is how this determines the connection value. So now we just end up solving steady state, stationary human density acoustic equation. There's some calculations I'm going to skip. So basically, say this guy, for any point itself, you on circle, you lift for a layer line, then you can put the energy. Line, then you can fit energy belly. So there are two parts. One is if we up here, that's how much of the belly you have here, exact potential. But then down here itself, because zero cost is a flat. Then continue. That is the right belly and it's a left belly. Hello? Hello? Oh, my time. No, no. Okay, okay. So now, okay, so then in technology, I got an Russian. Okay, now how to do computer. Uh, right, okay. Now, how to compute this equivalent that close formula? It's quite interesting called uh cost grinding. So, you dream this uh uh grounding motion on anywhere, and what does it mean is a cost-glaning, then you have to reduce the uh the two matrixes, then it is a linear algebra, you can solve the eigenvector problem, you can close formula bingo, you have the solution. So, so I couldn't skip the solution. So, puncture line is the solution. This is a logic division related function can be. Larger division relative function can be solved explicitly by this causal grani Markoving jumping process. Okay, so now let me just what is K means. Okay, so this a notion of weak solution basically really means is a sub solution and a solution is a very much usual weak definition. Just look at the value function itself satisfy inequality in general and optimal when achieved over there. That's called a particular definition. Over there, that's called a particular definition. So, our main results. Okay, at least I expand this one. So, what do we prove for this larger division rate function can be represented by this sort of the energy level for each basically try to determine the metastability for this star once you determine this manager? So, that's maybe important. I want to steer giving back. So this indeed that's an example which in the friend of Benjo's book. So we have given potential, which is not periodic. So first important, you need to determine what's the polarity in the time frequency in the local minimize. So that's what was adjusted this one. That's a close formula by solving linear eigenvector vector problem and globally dependent. So at just this value, basically lifting this energy of where in some level. That's a key part. Once you have this one, The key part once you have this one, then you just compute some menu potential. This can be closed formula solution, and that's a rate function for larger deviation. Now, this guy is the indeed model language is the weak KM solution to this Hampton-Jacobi equation. Let me digest a little bit. And then important concept, Hampton-Jacobi equation called Lagrange point. Every point, there is this collapse curve tracking back to this extreme called the It's called the mother set or RBNI set. And along this one itself, again, our friend is feedback control. Along this guy itself, you're giving this solution to the Hamilton equation. Then you Hamiltonian, you can do this velocity or Lagrange graph. You know, velocity, you don't kinetic. So it's just a dynamic of this guy. And this has closed formula. So that is how basically a connector with the meteor again or other things. Or other things. Then we also prove that all this extreme points is nothing completely catalyzed called the projector mass set or projector Abini set for this dynamic system. So now last one is quite important for selection principle. So for the dynamic Hamilton-Jacobi equation or conservation laws, we know otherly giving this entropy selection principle, you found a solution uniquely. Solution uniquely. Why? But however, when the for station solution, this entropy solution is not unique. You need an additional selection principle. So in here, additional selection principle is choose the largest of a maximum leakage continuous viscous solution, such as that subject in this invariant set called RB set satisfies boundary conditions. That's important. Basically, the first determined this frequency in metastability. Metastability, then other this must be true, who, because that's a determination of metastability. Then you globally just choose the largest possible value. That's giving rise into this weak can solution. So that is the once you have VKN solution, then the system becomes a kinetic region, then you can dynamic it. So now, of course, the writing is simple as possible, you can coupling more complicated way with that. Okay, so I guess the main time is. Yes, my time is up. Maybe I skip the proof, everything, but this last part is interesting. I want to expand the message. So, what does for this turn of the two parameters, when t equal to infinity aguricity, another epsilon go to noise equal to zero, and there's an exchange person? If for the equality itself, here's what we do: if for special initial data, and then for general initial data itself. And then for general initial data itself, it's always converging to the equilibrium pi. Then you do logic deviation principle. That means minus epsilon multiple logo to this guy. And this guy converging to this formula we explained. So now on left-hand side reverse order, I fix my t, I take logic deviation principle, and it means I better solution to a dynamical Hampton-Jacques equation, non-linear equation. Then you take a time limiter. Then you take a time limit. Then, this economist for non-linear time jack range vertically is not in general not unique. So, for special one, we prove unique. So, that is the exchange is one is unique and not that's what we choose the left side as a selection principle, right is not. So, now here's the example, which is usually how to do that. People use a selection principle called vanishing discount limit, actually, since Leon's paper. So, for this particular problem itself, we can solve. Particular problem itself we can solve explicitly. For vanishing viscosity, means this descendant lambda fact then becomes a stationary Hamza Jacquel equation with lambda. This system satisfies comparison principle and the solution is uniquely always trivial identity to you never ever pick up this logic deviation with the function. So that time this limit indeed is cannot exchange. So that's the two different principles. So we will prefer on this left-hand Uh, we will prefer on this left-hand side logic deviation principle for the uh inventory measure. Okay, with this, maybe I just uh uh summarize what we said. So we think this kinetic equation, the equivalent solution for this stationary Hammer-Jacouf equation, and not unique there's selection principle in general, and this is selection particularly for language dynamical circle given by this global clue. Therefore, given by this global close formula, and this obtained by cost-granned Markovian process. And then, this guy, with this one, can study dynamic system, which means called upper-mouth theorem, which means determine all kinds of inventor sets in writing measure, mass measure, or you can determine how I did not go through. So, that's what given selection principle. And this selection principle is not usually people use called a vanishing discount limit selection principle, which is not true. Principle, which is not true, and for our particular problem, this chooses the trivial solution zero. Uh, this is the selection, the larger deviation principle. With this, I thank you very much for your attention. Thank you. Thank you, Danwal. Yeah, thank you, Jose. Yeah. Any questions, comments in the audience or online? Then we have a curiosity about the main theorem. Yes, yes. You said about the W, you discussed, I mean, you discussed that the rate function is unique. Yeah, no, let's say the solution, the unique viscosity solution for the Hamilton-Dacovi type equation. What happens about the curve, the gamma? Oh, gamma is Q, yeah. So that's a punchline. So that's called feedback. That's a functional, so that's called feedback control. Once you solve this W, then you know this function, then you know, the Hamiltonian, you plug in there, and you have close formulas. Normally, the like the two system is a velocity not determined. Now, this guy normally we call like a lange galax. That means this velocity field is a function position or called feedback control. So, you just the curve is just simply determined by. Curve is just simply determined by this one for our particular problem. Is either steeper descent, like this one, and in the case when actually is a W is constant, then just sweet descent. Otherwise, just follow this potential, the steeper up here. So that is giving the curve, the optimal curve, optimal offers. Either going to steep descent or spare ascend. I see. I don't know. I see. And another more wider perspective question. What would be the implication of this theorem on the original problem? Could you just improve, like, I don't know, the computations of the numerical method used for trying to solve the problem, the midfield gaining problem, trying to find the minimum. Yeah, so let me explain. So I'm beginning with work on chemical reactions. So it's called energy length scale. That's important because. Scale. That's important because you do anything molecular dynamics, you want to determine what is the NGL land scale of chemical reaction. So that's weak KM is a way to determine NGL scale. So that's the first importance because you're doing the prototype or by chemical reaction as well. But now, so this is how this beginning of working with this one. But for me, the game itself is the same question, which is the starting point from Leons, what this guy said. So now, here, this is the sort of the Now, here, this is a sort of the easier way because it looks a lot of information because best strategy is an easier, simple connection equation, but this one is contained more information, later sort of anticipation, anticipation or solve with some kind of Hamlet-Jacobi equation. So, you have more to say. So, you want to solve this kind of steady Hamden-Jacobi equation. Dynamically is too much information. You don't want to solve. You just want to solve determining the station of Hamlet-Jacobi region. Once you solve this equation, suppose. Once you solve this equation, suppose you have to solve, so instead of this one, you just okay replace this guy by this station solution. You can have a solve. Once I have the W here, okay, phi other one for W. So now you determine this draft velocity for this one. Of course, you can additionally, you can add this brownie motion, you can accretion operate. But basically, the force, driving force, the force are determined instead of like a. Force are determined instead of like a way doing the cooling force. That's what predetermined. We know this guy, but genetically, problem what comes we do not know. That's the way to do it. So, instead of the Coulomb law, Coulomb's law is giving potential force, you give him solving by the stationary combination. That's the purpose to try to solve this guy. So, indeed, the example for the Kulu law is just that stationary, you wouldn't care how it's about and it's just giving as long if electrostatic force you came here, you know, you dropping a drop the particle move. So, that because these are. Particular move. So that, of course, these are doing the simple success in continuous, otherwise, in general, you have the V dot in the back to the kinetic level. This is the continuum level. So you can back to the kinetic level. You can say that. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Denmu. Thank you. More questions, comments? No? If not, let's thank you again. Thank you. Thank you. And I think we have a coffee break now. No? So I think the next speaker. I think the next speaker is Jean-May that is not yet there. I don't see her, but maybe she is. And yeah, we have a break of half an hour. I will assume 10:30. Yeah.
