I'm going to tell you about something that is very solidly in this and beyond category here, which is some recent work that I've done with one of my students on non-dissipative viscosity in systems with discrete symmetries, so both discrete rotational symmetries and discrete translational symmetries. Most of this work was done with my student Pranov here, and here some collaborators that I've worked on prior related work with. That I've worked on prior related work with. Just as an outline, since this is sort of outside the scope of sort of the main line of the conference, I'll give a review of what Hall viscosity is and why we might care about it. And then I'll talk about what happens when you relax the rotational symmetry constraints that people usually use when they talk about these things and what new phenomenology arises. And also some peculiarities of hydrodynamics without rotational. Of hydrodynamics without rotational symmetry, that I don't think people have really highlighted much before. Then I'll do what we always do in this case, which is use the simplest test system I could possibly think of to do calculations, which is free fermions. And we'll see there that angular momentum plays a particularly important role in this non-dissipative hydrodynamics. Then I'll talk about how we can generalize these things to lattice models. Okay, so what is viscosity? Well, if we go back... Viscosity? Well, if we go back to Landau and Lipschitz, they tell us that if we have some fluid, we can apply a rate of strain to that fluid and look at the stress tensor that results. So just as a reminder for people that haven't thought about stress tensors in a very long time, this is this object. I'll write it as tau mu nu. And what this does is it parametrizes the force densities that act on some parcel of fluid. So if I have this tau, I can If I have this tau, I can consider two surfaces normal to the mu direction, and the force difference in the nu direction between the two surfaces is given by this tau mu nu tensor. And you can see sort of a schematic of this here, where we have some parcel, we have the various directions. Now, if I write down Newton's equations or the Euler equation for a fluid, I can write it in terms of the time derivative of the momentum density and Momentum density. And this fact that tau parametrizes the forces on the fluid tells me that it sits on the right-hand side of this equation. So this negative divergence of tau is like my F, and this time derivative of the momentum density is my MA, or dp dt. So this is the fundamental conservation law that tells us how fluids move. And then what we need is some constitutive relation to tell us what this tau mu nu actually is. What is this tau nu actually for any system that we care about? And the way we do this is we do a gradient expansion of this tau in terms of the velocity field of the fluid. And the first non-trivial term that enters is gradients of the velocity field, so d mu v nu, and this is what's called a strain rate, because it's the time derivative of an actual strain. So viscosity tells me how the stress tensor changes in the presence of a Changes in the presence of a strain rate. So I can write down my constitutive relation. I'll put averages now because I'm going to be talking about quantum fluids rather than classical fluids. So this is some perturbed ground state, perturbed average, and this is the ground state average. So I can get some response to not strain rate, but actual strain. That's parametrized by this tensor kappa, which are usually called elastic moduli. For a fluid, they're essentially boring because there's only Essentially boring because there's only compression. And then I have some fourth rank tensor, eta, that tells me how the stress changes in response to a strain rate. And this fourth rank tensor, eta, is the viscosity tensor. So for, I can look at this, it has two pairs of indices, is sort of the easiest way to think about it. The first pair, mu nu, tells me what stress I get. The second pair, lambda rho, tells me what strain rate I'm applying. Strain rate I'm applying. And if I look at this tensor, I can symmetrize and anti-symmetrize under exchanging those pairs. And the anti-symmetric combination written here is non-dissipative. And that if I look at delta tau times strain rates to get some rate of energy dissipation or energy loss, this is identically zero for this combination, which means if I have a gapped fluid at zero temperature, so for instance, some Zero temperature, so for instance, some kind of quantum Hall state, then this non-dissipative viscosity tensor is allowed to be non-zero in that state because it is the momentum analog of a Hall current. The stress that I get is perpendicular to the applied strain. And on this talk, I'll focus on two dimensions where each of these indices, mu nu lambda rho, is either x or y, one or two. So if I want to get some handle on what this complicated Some handle on what this complicated fourth-rank tensor is actually telling me, I should come up with a convenient parametrization of these strains and a convenient parametrization of these stresses. So what strains are, they're telling me about the deformations that I can do of my two-dimensional plane. And there's sort of four different things I can do. The first is I can take some parcel of fluid and I can just expand it. So I increase the volume. And this is if I have my strain rate here. And this is, if I have my strain right here, this is what I get when I contract these two indices. So it's div.v. And I'll call this a delta strain, for instance. Another simple thing I can do is I can take my parcel of fluid and I can just rotate it, as I showed here, and that's what I get by taking the curl of V. And then there's the two other strains that I can do, which are usually called shears, one where I compress in one direction and expand in the other. expand in the other and that's I can write by taking the sigma z polymatrix and contracting it with this derivative of v. So it's dx vx minus dy vy. And then there's the other kind of shear I can do where I can take my square parcel of fluid and I can turn it into a parallelogram instead. And that's what I get when I contract with sigma x. So I can play the same sort of game with the stress tensor because it has a similar structure. Well it's right two times. Structure, well, right to tensor. And I can look at the four linearly independent stresses I can get. This sort of delta contraction tells me about hydrostatic pressure, the forces that act uniformly in all directions. Contracting the anti-symmetric part of the stress tensor tells me about torques. It's rotations. And then I have my two shear stresses that are given by sigma z and sigma x. So now I have. So now I have my four independent strain rates, my four independent stresses. I can put them together in this giant constitutive relation and see what this fourth rank tensor is telling me. And when I have rotational symmetry in two dimensions, things are particularly simple because it turns out for this non-dissipative viscosity, there's only one linearly independent component. And what it does is it says that if I apply one type of shear strain, I get the other. Strain, I get the other kind of shear stress and anti-symmetrized on these. And since these sorts of anti-symmetric products are going to come up a lot in this talk, I'll just replace them with this wedge here. The way this constraint comes about, and the reason that this is rotationally symmetric, is because if I act on this by a rotation in space, the sigma z polymatrix and the sigma x polymatrix rotate into each other like a vector, and what this really is here is the And what this really is here is the cross product of those two vectors. So it's rotationally invariant, but it breaks parity symmetry because it's a cross product. Why on earth would we care about computing this coefficient for this fourth ring tensor? Well, it turns out that for 2D chiral topological phases, we can relate this Hall viscosity to certain geometric invariants of the ground state. So I put this picture back in because it should remind you a little bit. Because it should remind you a little bit of something that was in my Carmeli's talk earlier, where if I put my 2D chiral topological phase on a torus, and then I look at what happens to the stress tensor as I slowly twist the boundary conditions of that torus. So changing tau here is doing this sort of partial Dane twist that we were looking at earlier. I can ask how the stress tensor changes in response to this adiabatic deformation. And it turns out that That the Hall viscosity I get for this response is given by some numerical factor one-half, some non-universal but computable factor n-bar, which is just the ground state density of electrons, and then a geometric invariant s-bar, which is something like the mean orbital spin per particle, and ends up being related to an invariant of a quantum Hall state known as a shift, or the shift, which is the amount by which I have to change the Which I have to change the magnetic flux from the usual Landau formula when I put my system on a sphere rather than on a torus. So that's with rotational symmetry. And one can show, it was shown in this paper, for instance, that if I do enforce rotational symmetry, not only is this the only non-dissipative viscosity coefficient, but it's also quantized. No rotational symmetry preserving perturbation can change this value. So, what happens if I break it? So, what happens if I break rotational symmetry? Well, then this relatively nice expression becomes three lines long instead of just one, and I get six viscosity coefficients instead of just one. So, first this sort of seems like a nightmare, but it turns out we can make some sense of this. I've divided these up into two different types of coefficients, ones which have no, you know, just eta, gamma, and theta. Just eta, gamma, and theta, and these involve my various tensors, but no deltas. And then I have these barred coefficients, which are related, but they involve a compression in some direction. And you would think that this means they would have to be non-zero if I had some kind of gapped phase, which was incompressible. It turns out, for some subtle reasons that we'll talk about in a few slides, this is actually not the case. And I can give you models where these are non-zero. These are non-zero. But this is still really messy. Let's look at something more physical. Let's look at the forces that we actually get from these viscosity coefficients. So if I go back to my continuity equation and compute this divergence of the stress tensor, these are the things that, if I'm sitting inside my fluid, are what I feel in response to these six viscosity coefficients. And I can go through the math of computing this divergence. And what I get is that the forces are parametrized. That the forces are parametrized by some rank 2 tensor and then various gradients of the velocity. And here, star just means the contraction with epsilon. So, this is a rank 2 tensor. It has three independent components. I have my six viscosities. So there must be some linear combinations of these viscosity coefficients that aren't doing anything to the bulk fluid. And if I write this out, it turns out the combinations that are relevant for giving me bulk forces. Relevant for giving me bulk forces are the sums of these barred and unbarred coefficients. So there's a redundancy here. There's three linear combinations of viscosity coefficients, these differences, that do absolutely nothing in the bulk of the fluid when I look at the hydrodynamic equations. And the reason for this is that they come from divergence-less contributions to the stress tensor. If I add to the stress tensor, let C be some arbitrary Let C be some arbitrary symmetric tensor. I form this funny combination of epsilon's gradients and velocities just so that when I take dμ of this thing, it's identically zero. And there's three different ways I can do this, and that corresponds to the differences between these barred and unbarred viscosity coefficients. And so without something, a general principle besides hydrodynamic forces to fix the antisymmetric components. To fix the anti-symmetric component of the stress tensor here, or not anti-symmetric, sorry, to fix the stress tensor here, I'm sort of at a loss at determining anything besides these sums of the barred and unbarred coefficients. One thing worth noting, sort of if you look at this expression, I just stuck a symmetric tensor in here, the natural question one could ask is, well, what if I stick an anti-symmetric tensor in here? And it turns out that also gives you It turns out that also gives you a divergence-free contribution of the stress tensor, and it's one that contributes to the dissipative viscosities rather than the non-dissipative viscosities. So what this says is that if I have no symmetries in my system, and I look at some particular linear combination of dissipative viscosity coefficients, they produce no forces in the bulk. They correspond to total divergences, which means that they only give me dissipation at the surfaces of the fluid rather than Fluid rather than due to bulk flow. So I need some principle to fix my stress tensor so that I can disambiguate between these barred and unbarred viscosity coefficients. If we remember how this worked in a rotationally symmetric system, if I have rotational symmetry, then I can appeal to this Bell-Infante-Rosenfeld construction, which tells me that there's always a way by adding specific gradients of the speed. Specific gradients of the spin current to the stress tensor to end up with a stress tensor that's symmetric. And the symmetric stress is essentially unique, and at least unique up to this order in gradients. And I can choose that as the physical stress tensor, and then my ambiguity goes away. So if I want to fix my six viscosity coefficients, I need to generalize this Bellinfante procedure to non-rotationally invariant. To non-rotationally invariant systems. And we sort of are going to do it in the most naive way possible, and it turns out that that's more or less the only way to do it. So let's focus on this integrated stress tensor where I just, I'll call it capital T mu nu. And I can introduce operators in the quantum mechanical system that generate the deformations, these four strain deformations I showed you earlier. And then through award identity, And then, through a word identity, it turns out I can write the stress-to-integrated stress operator as a derivative of these strain generators. Then, the anti-symmetric component of the stress ends up being the time derivative of the angular momentum operator for my fluid. This is consistent with the interpretation of the anti-symmetric stress as a torque density. So, if I just have some fluid of point particles and I have Fluid of point particles, and I ask what happens if I do a shear to this. What I'm doing is I'm doing a position-dependent displacement of all of the particles in my system, and as a quantum mechanical operator, this is generated by some anti-commutator of position with momentum. Momentum gives me the displacement, x says that it's dependent on position. So, this moves my particles around, but it doesn't tell me anything about the internal. Tell me anything about the internal degrees of freedom of my particles. If I just use this to generate strains and I do a rotation, I've rotated the position of my particles, but I haven't done anything to their spins. And at some fundamental level, this should raise a red flag, because the rotational symmetry of my system, if I have, for instance, spin-orbit coupling, is not just spatial rotations independent of spin rotations. I have to do both together. And to do both together, I'm going to take this. I'm going to take this strange generator and I'm just going to add to it the internal angular momentum operator. So if I have Dirac electrons, for instance, this would just be my sigma Z Pauli matrix. If I have a more complicated lattice system, I have to work out what this is from the group or the crystallographic symmetries and the specific embedding that I've chosen for my system. And so this will call it spin angular momentum for the rest of this. Spin-angular momentum for the rest of this talk. Turns out this is sort of a Hamiltonian formulation of what happens in the ordinary Dirac-Belenfonte-Rosenfeld construction. So what does this mean for the continuity equation? I've changed my strain generator, so in some sense what I've done is I've changed my definition of what momentum density is. I've taken this ordinary kinetic momentum density, which is just like the velocity of the fluid. This is the rho v, which tells me about the momentum. Which tells me about the momentum due to particle motion. And I've added to it something that, when you turn the cranks, looks like the gradient of the angular momentum or spin density of the fluid. This is sort of a weird thing at first sight. So what this is saying is that if I have a spinning particle, or a particle with spin, I should say, there's a gradient in the spin density. This is associated with a linear momentum. And this is actually. Momentum. And this is actually the same sort of thing that comes out of the rotationally invariant Bellenfante procedure if you look at the continuity equation for the Bellenfante stress tensor. It's also consistent with some previous attempts of if you want to derive geometric response by putting a field theory on curved space-time, you can fix similar ambiguities in the stress tensor by demanding that you do diffeomorphisms that leave the torsion of the That leaves the torsion of the background space fixed and call that the Bell-Infante stress tensor. And when you do that procedure, exactly this term pops out in the linear momentum density as well. So now we have a formalism. Let's see if it tells us anything reasonable. And to do that, we'll focus on a system of free fermions. And I'll take a particularly general system where I just write it like this. And I have some internal. And I have some internal degrees of freedom of n of them, and there's some internal angular momentum or spin that I'll leave as some generic operator that acts in this n by n space. So the stress tensor that I get from this, it's some one-body operator that has this form, and there's sort of two pieces here. The first involves derivatives of this one-body Hamiltonian. This is like p nu vν. So this is the usual connection. So, this is the usual canonical kinetic stress. And then I have another term here that I'll call the spin stress, which is basically given by the change in the Hamiltonian that I get after doing an internal rotation only. So now I can chug through the Kubo formula for viscosity and compute the Hall viscosity tensor in this case. And we'll do it in two steps. First, let's just ignore this new First, let's just ignore this new internal spin stress that I wrote down and use this kinetic piece, which is something that I think a lot of people in this community, including myself, have talked on and off about for about a decade that, oh, somebody should compute the Hall viscosity for free fermions. And for some reason, nobody ever did it. So eventually, we did it. And what you end up getting is that this fourth rank tensor, there's some epsilon, and then there's a nice expression here. And then there's a nice expression here. Omega is the non-abelian Bary curvature for the occupied states. Trace makes it the abelian Bary curvature. And then I look at its quadrupole moments in momentum space. So probably saying quadrupole moments here is the closest I'm going to get to doing anything related to fractons for this talk, but that's what it is. So you can see there's three components here in a rotationally invariant system. What I just get is Variant system, what I just get is k squared times trace of the barrier curvature. So, what are the forces that we get from this kinetic Hall viscosity? And this is the really curious thing. We have this expression. It's written in terms of topological quantities, so we think it should mean something. And if you look at the hydrodynamic forces, you get, because of the symmetry of this guy, or anti-symmetry under mu and lambda. Or anti-symmetry under μ and lambda, you get absolutely no bulk forces from this nice expression, which is extremely disappointing in some sense, but it begs the question, where are the non-dissipative forces in these free fermion systems coming from? And they're coming entirely from the spin. So the internal spin is actually key to getting viscous forces for free fermions with these systems. These systems. So just writing these can write out everything generally here. So here are these three nice expressions I showed you before, the moments of the Bary curvature. And then this is probably something that deserves further investigation for the other components of the viscosity tensor in terms of, so you have these minus, these guys, that's why the sums are zero if I have no internal spin. And then the spin contributions. And then the spin contributions to the forces are actually these really awkward-looking structures where I take my internal angular momentum operator, contract it with the bary connection, and then dot it with the momentum. And this is all done in some particularly weird way such that it's secretly gauge u n gauge invariant, where n is the number of occupied states, even though it looks like there's no reason for that to be. But you can rewrite it in terms of projectors. You can rewrite it in terms of projectors, and it is. And so, well, that's the result. This is the nice part of the result. This is the part of the result that it would be nice to understand better. So, let's do something else new. So, if we're doing condensed matter free fermion systems with anisotropic one-body Hamiltonians, in solid state, these usually come from some underlying crystal lattice. And so, we're doing some low-energy approaches. And so we're doing some low-energy approximation where we say, well, we have some small Fermi surface, and we can ignore the fact that we don't actually have real translational symmetry and just forget about the lattice other than the way that it deforms the Fermi surface. But it would be nice to see what happens if we try and incorporate discrete translational symmetry into the hydrodynamics in some essential way. And, well, the starting point of this whole discussion was the conservation. Of this whole discussion was the conservation law for momentum density, so we're going to need to abandon that if we only have discrete translation symmetry. But what we can do is instead of considering the momentum density as a continuous function, we can sort of average the momentum density over a unit cell in the system and consider the momentum density as a function of points in the Brave lattice. And if we do that, we can write a long wavelength conservation law for this. Wavelength conservation law for this momentum density. If the system is interacting, there is a right-hand side to this conservation law that is exactly the rate of umklop scattering due to the interaction. But if the system's non-interacting, then it's an exact conservation law. And this average momentum density is a conserved quantity. We can write out the stress tensor for the non-interacting system that we get from this. The interacting one is in the paper. It's a horrendously ugly and painful expression. But for the non-interacting system, Expression. But for the non-interacting one, we get something nice where what we did is we took the k that was sitting in the continuum stress tensor, replaced it with something that becomes k when the lattice constant goes to zero, and we stuck a weird cosine in the spin stress term. I should say the way I wrote this expression, it's strictly speaking only valid for orthorhombic lattices. It works for things like triangular lattice as well. Things like triangular lattice as well. You just have to be a little careful about what these index contractions actually mean in that case. But the point of doing this is now we can write down a theory of a system that has very manifest point group symmetry that's not continuous rotational symmetry, where we didn't have to sort of pull an anisotropy out of a hat. It came from this lattice. So the sines and cosines that pop up in the stress tensor, Cosines that pop up in the stress tensor are sort of, well, they're crucial for periodicity. If I have the discrete translation symmetry, everything that I have write down in any quantity better be periodic in momentum k. The sines and cosines assure that. But they're also important for making sure that the point group symmetry is respected at all of the high symmetry points in the Voron zone. If I sort of skip this cosine here, then I get the same internal or spin stress at every point. Our spin stress at every point in the Bronze zone, even though the action of the rotations is different at different points in momentum space. This also has the nice fact that if I take the small k limit, I recover things that look like my continuum formulas, so it goes back into the results that I was showing before. And this fact that the kinetic viscosities give no forces is still true, because I still have this particular anti-symmetry on these two indices. And in fact, These two indices. And in fact, whenever my stress tensor has the form of, you know, k or sine k times some other function, I end up getting something that contributes nothing to the viscous forces. Yeah. Can you just say a little bit more how you define the stress tensor? Okay, yeah. So what we did is, yeah, so I left this off the slide because it's kind of a few steps. So we take the momentum density, right? The momentum density, write it in the continuum, the momentum density is, you know, C dagger grad mu c. Then you discretize the derivative of that. And so discretizing the derivative turns it into what we're going to define as the lattice momentum density. That's this momentum averaged over a unit cell. We commute that with the free fermion, or for this expression, commute it with the free fermion lattice Hamiltonian. This gives us some us some this gives us a continuity equation and then we do an expansion and small wave vector and you can commute it with the interacting Hamiltonian as well and there's a bunch more terms good so let's do an example and the example will just be a two band churned insulator pick this example one because it's two band free fermion problem on a square lattice so it's the easiest thing we could pick the second is because The second is because the Hall viscosity in this system has been considered before in, for instance, in this paper. So we write down the Hamiltonian. It's given here, can parametrize it in terms of these three functions, dx, dy, dz. If these two hopping amplitudes are equal to each other, then this has a fourfold rotational symmetry. Otherwise, it just has two-fold rotational symmetry. And importantly, the four-fold rotational symmetry Importantly, the fourfold rotational symmetry is generated by one-half sigma z in this system. So that's what I'm going to pick for my internal angular momentum operator. We can plot out the band structure for this Hamiltonian. There's four special points. Well, four special points here. I've only shown three of them. There's 0, 0, pi, 0, pi, pi, and then 0, pi in the Brown zone. And the speech of this model. And the feature of this model is that in a low-energy approximation, you can think of it as one two-dimensional direct fermion at each of these points with some different mass. And so if we sort of simplify to that low-energy picture, at the gamma point, the mass is given by these parameters. It's different here. And then it's the same at these x and y points. So I mentioned before. So, I mentioned before that this cosine term and the spin stress was important for the point group symmetries. Practically, what it does is it ensures that if I have a fourfold symmetry here, which gives me an isotropic stress tensor, then this cosine that I added makes sure that I have an isotropic stress tensor here as well. So, then what we can do is we can just compute what is. What is the viscosity in this case? We can do a full lattice computation, which I can show you here. We have eta h, which is the kinetic viscosity, and then the spin part, and they add together to give some complicated function as a function of this mass parameter m. Sort of the more interesting limit is where we can apply a continuum approximation. And the continuum approximation here holds when the gaps at all of these Holds when the gaps at all of these Dirac points are much smaller than the bandwidth of the system. So, I mean, basically, here. So, I can think of this as a massive Dirac fermion because the linear range of the dispersion is very large. And I can expand about those four points. You can sort of see here I've plotted the density of the viscosity, and you can see that it's sort of concentrated at these four Dirac points here. And what I find when I do this is I do this is I compute the total viscosity in the continuum approximation. What it ends up looking like is just viscosity that I get for four direct fermions sitting at the origin in a continuum model. This is sort of in contrast to the result in the Shapurian et al. paper, where they ignored the spin stress. And by ignoring the spin stress, they found that they got something that was very different from the continuum theory. So, just to conclude, without rotational symmetry, non-dissipative viscosity, the forces, and the bulk depend on three of six possible coefficients. We can use the role of internal angular momentum to fix the other three coefficients. And this sort of highlights how, for free fermions, all of the viscous forces that I get are due to internal angular momentum. For future work, this could be useful for. For future work, this could be useful for looking for experimental signatures of viscosity in 2D anisotropic phases like quantum hole pneumatics. Lattice formalism would be interesting to apply to systems like graphene or twisted bilayer graphene. And one sort of more long-term and theoretically interesting direction is you can take Dirac equation, for instance. You can write down the Dirac equation on arbitrary triangulations of manifolds. Arbitrary triangulations of manifolds using some Kayler-Dirac type formalism. It would be interesting to see what this momentum density and this viscous transport that we wrote down translate to in that setting. So thanks for your attention. I hope I did not derail the course of the conference too much. Yeah, so normally the viscosity divided by entropy density is a dimensionless constant. But here, But here you have changed later. So, how you construct a dimensional constant is the whole disclaimer. You divide by density times h bar. So. Density and charging speed? Yeah, yeah, so that's actually set H bar equal to 1 here. But in the quantum Hall case, where this sort of first started, the Hall viscosity itself is dimensionful, as you say, so it can't be quantized. But the interesting quantity is that. But the interesting quantity is actually eta h over n bar, so divided by charge density. Right, the entropy density only enters for the dissipative viscosity, so the shear viscosity enters. For like topological superconductors, then what do you do? For topological superconductors, it ends up being the fermion density that you divide by. Not very well divide by. Well, the average fermion density in the ground size. Well, the average fermion density in the ground state is well defined. Well, yeah, it's the average is what you have to defy by. I mean, it's not, right. The density, I mean, even in the quantum Hall case, the density is not necessarily quantized if you move the magnetic field around. But you can do an experiment where you do an established experiment to determine the density. You do The density. You do some hypothetical experiment that people have talked about and, depending on who you ask, have done in some systems to measure the Hull viscosity. And then you divide the two results. I'm confused about this relation with Shapurian's result. I mean, what physical quantity is different? I mean, you made it sound like it was your choice of stress tension. But that's like not a physical quantity. The choice of stress tensor is not a physical quantity. Let's say forces, viscous forces are a physical quantity. So do you get different results? Well, they get zero, and do we get not zero? I mean, they don't, the thing is, in these anisotropic systems, I think this fact that most, well, let me actually put it, this fact. So this fact that So, this fact that for free fermions, if you just use the kinetic viscosity, you get zero hydrodynamic forces. This has probably been known in some form at some time by some people, but I don't think anybody's put all the pieces together. And so in the Shapurian paper, what they do is they take the kinetic stress that they derive for this churn insulator model, they compute one component of the fourth-rank viscosity tensor, and say Hall viscosity equals this. viscosity equals this, which is computing, no, I have a pointer, it's computing this coefficient. But they didn't look at the full fourth rank tensor. And if you look at the full fourth rank tensor, what you find is zero. So that in itself is, I think, well, depending on how you want to measure differences, it's a very large difference. But so, and we can sort of So, and we can sort of phrase it more quantitatively here. So, I broke down this plot. So, the Shapurian paper calculated this blue curve, which is the kinetic viscosity. We calculated this yellow curve, and then the hydrodynamic forces, which are the sum of the two. So, if I came through a transition between, say, a totally triple state and some total and S D state, do we expect to see? Signature do we expect to see in terms of this all discussed? Not necessarily. It depends on specifically the nature of this crystalline SPT state. So you need an expression for the other three coefficients that didn't depend on the trace of the bary curvature? Oh, yeah. Depending on the optiagonal. So say I take a system with C2 times time reversal, which would make the trace of omega zero at every k-point. Sure. Would I have any forces there? What viscous forces? It breaks down universal, but it's good. Okay. Good. The first three would be zero. It depends. Do you want C2T or do you want C2 and T separate? Only C2 times T. Okay. Together. Only C2 times T together. Okay. Neither of them. Okay. So these are zero because the trace of omega is zero. This guy, sorry, this guy. Actually, both of these, these two don't need to be zero. So you can do a full sit. So, you can do a full symmetry. The nice thing about these expressions, like this, is you do this point-group symmetry analysis. And so, well, everything here is T odd because it's non-dissipative viscosity. And then, right, so C2 is, you can see that these guys are all C2 even. So, asking what happens with C2T is just asking what happens with T, essentially. Happens with T essentially. The actual more interesting case, I think, is mirror symmetry in two dimensions. Because what happens with mirror symmetry is these guys that we usually think about are zero. And this one. With C2 times T, why would Windows 3 be zero first? Because the trace of the. No, no, no. I said with C2 times T, they're all zero, and I'm saying. C2 times C, they're all zero. And I'm saying, yes, these are zero, these two are non-zero, this is zero. But with mirror symmetry, is the case where I think is more interesting, because that's the case where you can eliminate all but two of these coefficients. Nothing's quantized. Well, okay. Uh Haldane has an argument. An argument that is back. Haldane has an argument that the trace of this tensor should be quantized for a gap system. Even if you have no rotational symmetry? That's his claim. Now there's two. Now, 2 eta bar h. Yeah, so there's a subtlety here, which is when he derived this claim, he assumed that these barred coefficients were all zero. And I think this is, I mean, I wouldn't even call it an assumption. It was just sort of nobody wrote down these barred coefficients for like 20 or 30 years in this community. So they just weren't there. He assumed a particular structure for the viscosity tensor. Particular structure for the viscosity tensor that didn't have them and derived that the trace of this was quantized. And so it's unclear how that argument will need to be modified in the presence of the bar coefficients. So you just did a calculation. This turn insulator, and it wasn't quantized. Well, for lattice systems, the argument for quantization was always in continuum quantum law systems. We should think Barry again and take any other question about whole system.
