Carl Rasi from University of Rome 1. Can we speak on topic? Our solutions of reaction integration equations as in particle one dimension. Thank you. Thank you very much. I would like to thank the organizers for the opportunity of doing this talk. Thank you very much. So it's so nice to be back on conferences. Conferences, traveling again and meeting people. This is a wonderful place for coming back to the real scientific academic life. So what I'm going to talk about is work we have done in collaboration with Rosso Amel, who is also talking about this collaboration in his talk. And so I'm considering here the simplest possible reaction effusion equations, so homogeneous reaction diffusion equation in the whole space. And what is important, what the interesting part of our work is in the initial datum. So the equation is as simple as possible. The initial datum would like to be more the most general as possible. More general as possible. And this is the common point with Francois's talk also. So the question that I'm addressing in this talk is, does you become locally planner as t goes to plus infinity? And I will explain in a moment what I mean with this. And it has a reminiscence with the syllabus. Reminiscence with the celebrated conjecture by the Georgi about the Arlenkan equation Jung Chen talked about. This is the same equation that Jun Chen talked about, but it's just W scale. So here the stable states are 0 and 1 instead of minus 1 and 1. And the conjecture is: does a solution between 0 and 1, which is monotone in one direction, is Monotone in one direction is necessarily one-dimensional. That means it depends on just one spatial direction, which is, of course, not necessarily E1, but can be another direction. And the conjecture is that true at least up to dimension A. But in fact, what I'm talking about has nothing to do with Arlenkan equation. With Arankan equation because in Alekan equation, the double well, the minima are at the same level of the double well. So have the same, the stationary states have the same energy level, whereas in my case one has lower energy in the sense that it is more attractive than zero, in the sense that I will explain. That I will explain in a moment. So it has, the question has an analog, it's a sort of parabolic analog of the Allenkin equation, which is for stationary solutions, but it's radically different in its essence. So these are the very standard reaction terms considered in the literature, and these are the And these are the kind of F that we would like if we aimed at considering with Francois, and these are not what we managed yet. Considering in Francois's talk, he's considering this and also more general kind of reactions, but here we will see that I will need to focus on one specific type to get some results. And what is important is the unbalanced cognition. The unbalanced condition. So one is more attractive than zero. You know, in these three cases. So here we have to impose, here it's automatically imposed in the mono-stable combustion. It's automatically true. And here is the assumption on u0, the initial data. So all the interesting part comes from the initial data. And for convenience, we restrict two indicator functions. We could have considered slightly more general, but let's stick also in our preprint, we stick on. We stick on this kind of initial data, but the important point is that U can be very general. So the capital U is the set, is the support of the initial data can be very general. Whereas typically in the literature, essentially two types of initial data are often considered, which are bounded capital U or almost planar capital U. Here the point is to consider general is to consider general set capital, as general as possible. And for these three cases, if U is large enough in the sense that it contains a large enough ball, then there is invasion, meaning that the solution converges locally in form to one. So actually there are cases where it's true, where the hair trigger effect holds and then the result is true for any pole, but in general in this But in general, in this bisable case, we need to impose that U contains a large enough O. So, here this is the case that I want to consider. A case where U gives rise to an invading solution. So, the set U gives rise to an invading solution. But I recall here is the problem. U is a generic, say, measurable subset of our N. So, we want what So, we want what do I mean with becomes planar? So, we want a notion which is simultaneously global and local. So, to explain this, what happens if I consider, for instance, capital U equal to a ball, so under the invasion hypothesis, the solution is converging locally uniformly to one. So, the level sets are the solution set. sets are the solution, say the level set one half is departing at infinity, that's time distinct. And so it means that this curvature is going to zero. So in our sense this is becoming planar, at least locally. But locally, not locally around zero, because there it's going to one, but we want a local notion, but it follows the level sets, that can follow, can track the level sets. So this is the function. So, this is defined by the capital omega limit set, which is what you see, the limit of u t n x n as n goes to plus infinity, the limit you can take in n infinity log going c to lot, diaparmolic uh estimate, for some sequence t n going to plus infinity and an arbitrary sequence x n. Sequence X. So this is, if you take one of these up to subsequences, you get a limit, and so you consider all possible limits. So you are going, the time is going to plus infinity, but the position is moving everywhere in space. This is the capital omega limit set. It's different from the small omega limit set, which is without this xn, which will be just the constant function one under the Factor one under the invasion hypothesis. And the question is: does this capital omega set, capital omega limit set, just contains one-dimensional functions? If you move around, you see just functions which are one-dimensional. If it's true, we say that u is using total. We say that U is asymptotically locally planned. So, what are the known results about this property? So, this is true if capital U is bounded. And this is a celebrated Jones result, 83, proved with a very elegant proof which works, quite simple proof based on reflection argument and of the lemma, and works for. La and works for basically arbitrary function f under the hypothesis of invasion that we is unit. So if capital U is bounded, okay, it works. Then if u is say the subgraph of a bounded function, so it's what I can call almost planar, initial data. So it's a perturbation of the So it's a perturbation of the of a bounded say perturbation of uh 1D function. So here is again true, it can be deduced from results by Branson and a UV type result by Stiki ML and also there are some results by Jean-Michel Robshlov, we'll have to see Michael in the bicep case. So these are two cases where the property holds, but there are also Holds, but there are also negative cases, which is if u is this shaped. So if capital U, the set is this shape. So you have to think this is unbounded. So it's like the subgraph of absolute value of x1 in two dimensions, something like that. So in this case, this solution does not become locally planned, as Digosu classifies. And so sorry, I don't want to show this. So, what we so if we want to prove something, we should add some hypotheses that are fulfilled in these cases and are not fulfilled in this case. So, what is the difference between the set capital U here and here and the set capital U here? Of course, one can figure out millions, thousands of differences between these classes of sets, and it And it turns out that one good difference between this and this one is that in these two cases U is at finite Hausdorff distance from a combat set. Whereas in this case it's not true. So here, for instance, take any combat set. Of course two bounded sets are at finite host of distance, the one from the other. You want from the other. Here you take the half space and you are bounded half-star distance from the half-space. Here you cannot find a convex set, bounded house of distance from this. So this was our claim. If capital U is a bounded house of distance from a comet set, then the solution should be asymptotically, locally, planned. So this is the definition. So this is the definition of the also of distance, which is not a real distance in if the sets are not compact, but it's defined like this. So why convexity matters? So let's see the two cases where we have positive answer and negative answer. So here, negative answer here, we don't know yet. But if the conjecture is true, If the conjecture is true, this should have a positive answer because this can be a US context. So the reason is that this one develops a V-shaped front. Proved by several people, Francois, Rugis Monot, Himinamia also cuts the several types of V-shaped fronts, combining several plano fronts merging together, pyramidal fronts. Fronts. So if you start from this initial data, you end up with a solution which looks like this, which moves with constant speed. What happens here? Does this develop in an A-shaped front or not? These kinds of fronts have never been produced in the literature. Do they exist or not? Under dipotene. Under the hypothesis of invasion. So, one explanation that suggests that this exists and this does not comes from a spreading set result, about the spreading speed result that Fran√ßois will talk about in this talk. That the upper level set The upper level set behaves like capital U plus V star T of T. C star is the minimum speed of planar fronts or the asymptotic speed of spreading. The same. Positive constant. For any level set. So the upper level sets for T large are just the original capital U thickened thickened by C star T. So in the case of the V shaped, Of the V shape is this. Whereas in the case, so you see this corner remains. In the case of the A shape, it runs. And this is C star T. So this radius, this is the radius of the circular part. So this is going to plus infinity as T goes to. To plus infinity, as t goes to plus infinity. So meaning that the curvature of this is going to zero. So this is becoming flat, whereas this is not becoming flat. But this is just a heuristic explanation. This is not a proof. Why? Because this little wave means up to little O of T correction term. Of course, this is not the real upper levels. This is not the real level. Upper level set. This is not the real level set. There is a mistake, which is a little over t. The real level set is smooth, but its curvature is not going to zero. Okay, so this is just an heuristic. But this heuristic turns out to be true, at least we are able to prove that this is true, this is what happens, and that the conjecture is true, but not for the general classes of reactions that General classes of reactions that we wanted to deal with, but we are able to prove it in the KPP case. So F strongly KPP means that F vanishes at 0, 1, as always the basic assumption in this talk, and F of U over U is decreasing or not increasing. So this is the assumption that we make. So, this is the assumption that we make. So, for instance, the u times 1 minus 1, the standard logistic term. So, under this hypothesis, we are able to prove the result. So, if f is strongly KPP and is at finite out of distance from a convex set and also is uniformly smooth, then the result is true. So, the omega limit set just consists Just consists of 1D functions. So the function becomes asymptotically local in Planner. And in addition, it's monotone, so that the 1D functions are monotone in the direction, the function that I call C, in the large sense. Of course, in the large sense, because in the omega inside there are also constants one and zero. Okay, so as a matter of fact, As a matter of fact, this assumption of uniform smoothness of capital U can be relaxed, but I will not enter details on this. I want to more focus on the proximity convexity assumption on Carpenter L. And after we have this result, what one would like to know is what are the directions which you see in the omega limit set. A limit set. So that you actually see. So to describe this set capital E, so the set of directions of the one-dimensional functions, which are we add strictly monotone, because of course if you take constant functions, they are one-dimensional in every direction. So we impose also that they are strictly monotone, because otherwise you have all the whole sphere. And as a byproduct of the proof of this theorem, we fully characterize We fully characterize this set. And in the particular case where U is convex, so we have a general result, but it's a little bit more technical to state. But in the case where U is convex, this coincides with the closure of the outward normals to capital U. So you get in the limit all 1D functions in all the directions. 1D functions in all the directions of the outward normals, of the closure of the outward normals to you. So I think that the interesting part of our work is besides the result is the technique of the proof, which is, in fact, we managed to overcome the obstruction of the boundary. Of the boundedness of the initial datum in John's argument, which is really crucial. So, John's argument is very elegant, very adapts to every word for every function f, but it really uses the fact that the support of initial data is bounded. And we managed to overcome this obstruction. And I would like to sketch the idea of this. So, let's. So let's consider the case where u is almost planar. So it's capital U is, so in two dimension, is x2 less than or equal to gamma of x1, where gamma is bounded. Almost planned. So this was already known also by Peter, depending on the type of Depending on the type of nonlinearity that the solution is becoming plus. So we want to recall that there is invasion, so if we want to track, we track the level set, so the level set is going very far. So let's take a time t, let's take a point on a level set, say one half. So let's take X as such that we have this. And so John's arguments is by contradiction. So you assume that your gradient is not going to be vertical. So in this case, one wants to prove that the solution becomes a function of x2 only. 2 only. So assume that this is not the case. So the gradient of U has a slope which is not going, so as a direction which is not going to the vertex. And John's argument works if you continue this line, say in two dimension, if you don't cross the convex hull of the support of initial data. Of the support of initial data, you get the contribution without flag. So, this is John Sargon. And in fact, one notice that for the argument to work, you don't need the set capital U, which is the support of the initial data, to be bounded. But you would just need capital U to be bounded in the X1 variable. If it was from K to then, If it was truncated rho, in general by cylinder, here it's a strip, so this is capital U rho. In this case you would get a contradiction if the line does not, if the initial data were was u rho instead of u. So this is the first observation. You don't really need the set to be bounded, but bounded in the x1. In the x1 variable to apply Johnson. So, this is what we do: we replace capital U with Euro and we want to apply the result to the solution little Euro emerging from capital Euro. Okay, so to get the contradiction, we need two things. First, that this solution looks like the original one. Like the original one around this point. It's gradient, actually, as we like this one. So, this is the first thing. You roll close to U at this point. And you want this line not to intersect Euro. Let me say. Let me say let me call this I don't know R R So the point is that for one to hold you would like to have rho very large because the s the the smaller rho, the less chances you have to approximate your solution. You're far from your solution. Solution, you are far from your solution. Instead, for this, you would like to have rho very small because if rho is too large, you will intersect the line. So, you have the combination of these two things, and this is the delicate point of the proof, and okay, this is the summary of the idea. And so, raw raw So, rho very quite large to have a good approximation, and rho quite small to get the contradiction by John's argument. And in fact, it turns out that you cannot choose rho once and for all, but rho must depend on t. So, take this point for t very large, you assume that you have a slope which is not, you have a line which is not vertical, and then you choose a row depending on t, and then you can. T and then you can get the contribution. So the point is to have these two conditions simultaneous by the suitable choice of rows. And this is quite delicate, and it must be delicate, because we know that it's not always true. If capital U is B-shaped, this cannot be done, because the result is not true. So in fact, what happens? What happens? What happens in the bad case why this cannot be true, heuristic. So in this case, when you cut off the region, in fact you are neglecting parts of the initial datum that actually contribute to the value of U here because there are Here, because they are quite close compared with these points here. So, in this case, you cannot choose the row suitably because they are too close to the point where you are doing the article. And if capital U is close to a convex set, you can do that. And to do that, we use some kind of retracting subversion. some kind of retracting several solutions to estimate the contribution of the cutted part to the solution you at this point. Okay, just a skip. Just two open questions. People here in the audience have worked about these kind of questions, of course. Okay, no, the first one is can we go beyond the Fisher KTP reaction term? Taking the reaction term, I think yes, but the argument doesn't work, our truth doesn't apply. And the second one, can we be more precise about the set capital omega U, the omega limit set? So can we say that under the assumption of the theorem convex proximity, then the omega limit set. Then the omega limit sets is just constant functions and critical fronts. So this is very reasonable. This is what happens in the bounded if u is bounded. And we ask if it's true. We suspect this to be true in general. So thank you very much for your attention. Thank you. Any questions or comments? Can you explain what you mean by the money? Can you explain what you mean by the normals to you? Because in the example you you had there before, the the side capital E is just one element. Yes. Whereas normals seem not to give it. In fact, this is true only in this particular case where you use convex. So this formulation when you use convex, you really convex. Really convex, really convex, really convex, so not this case. But we have a characterization also in the more general case, and in this case, it's a bit more complicated, you have to take points which are very far from you, so whose distance from capital U is going to plus infinity, and you take And you take the projection onto capital U, and this gives you a direction. So x minus the projection gives you... So you take all this, the closure of all the unit vectors obtained like this, as the distance to the points goes to plus infinity. So in fact, I can I I can I let me see if I can write it simpler. So you are that so you are that C is in this set if there exists XN Xn such that the distance of Xn and capital U goes to plus infinity, as n equals to infinity, and c is equal to the limit, as n equals to plus infinity, of xn minus the projection onto u, one of the projections, because there can be several. Because there can be several normalized. So the projection is the nearest point? Yes, there can be several, then you take all of them. So this is, if this is true, so C belongs to capital E, and then capital E is actually the closure of the points obtained in this way. So in the case of a bounded, the case Bounded, the case that I draw at the blackboard, the bounded subgraph of the bounded function, you just have the vertical. Because these points here, you don't see these four points which are very far. But so I stated in this simplest case where U is complex. More questions? Uh if your initial condition is the subgraph of a sublinear function, is it known your eventually point? So sublinear sublinear sublinear works. In fact of course sublinear can be not a bounded house of this finite house of distance from a common circle, distance, you take square root somehow. Square root. But in fact, we have so this result is a consequence of a more general result. So the real result that we have has this geometric assumption on capital U. So basically you take a point x, you take one of You take one of its projections, so the nearest point, the closest point of habitat. You take the largest exterior cone, start with vertex, the projection and axis x minus c and you call this is the opening of this cone. And what you require is that as the distance Is that as the distance of x from the set u goes to plus infinity, this becomes flat. So this is the condition. The limb soup is less than or equal to zero as the distance goes to plus infinity. So this is related to Peter's question about direction. These are the directions that you see in the direction. So this case includes the sublinear. Includes the sublinear. In fact, so this is the real hypothesis that we are committed here, which is true in particular in the convex proximity case, but it's just a particular case. It's true, for instance, if gamma satisfies gamma of x1 minus gamma of x1 prime over x1 minus x1 prime goals to Goes to zero as the distance as this goes to pass infinity. So under this condition, this geometric hypothesis holds and the result is true. But this is more joint. Okay, more questions or comments? Just for people? So this thing I want to speak about is lunch time. The photo, Google photo will be two o'clock, right? Two o'clock, good photos. I think it will start over two minutes. I think it's stock or two in the market.
