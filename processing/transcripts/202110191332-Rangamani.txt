So the first presenter is Admini Rangamani, who is a professor at the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC San Diego. Padmini has recently been a fellow of the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering and has previously received prestigious awards such as the Presidential Early Career Award. Prevention Early Career Award and Slow Research Travel, and I'm really looking forward to your talk. Well, thank you very much for the invitation. And what I really wanted to do was be there and travel again, but I'm still waiting for one member of my family to be vaccinated. So instead, I'm going to do this remotely. I want to talk about this notion of membrane tension because I think it's something that most of this audience Most of this audience will sort of appreciate, but before I do that, I actually want to thank the people who do the work. So, this is my group right after we all were vaccinated and before Delta variant, and we were particularly happy. And we generally, I think it's the weather vaccinations. And I also want to thank my experimental collaborators, Belia Fowler, Shelly Halbane, David Drubin, and David Santian, who's actually my theory collaborator. John, who's actually my theory collaborator. Because what you'll see is a sort of storyline that goes across many, many years of sort of going between the rigorous, difficult mathematical and computational problems and then experiments in biology. So why tension of all things? And there are perhaps other things we could talk about. So I actually debated this quite a bit because when we were discussing mathematics of the cell, I found myself wondering, you know, what Found myself wondering: you know, what is it that we could think about as something that integrates signaling transport and mechanics? And some of you may be aware that I like building all sorts of complex models of cellular processes. So my goal here actually is, in my view, quite simple, but perhaps I'm oversimplifying it. So what I want to get at is a fundamental discrepancy of the different definitions even of memory. Definitions even of membrane tension and how they form our thinking. And as you'll see throughout this talk, much of my sort of problem-solving mode comes from looking at experiments or working very closely with cell biologists. But if you talk to somebody who's looking at a lipid protein level, they'll talk to you about the composition of the bilayer. I had to throw in a virus there because and And you know how the lipids may orient themselves and things like that. And there's a lot of work done here in the field of liquid crystals. So, why would we care? We would care because something like a healthy cardiomyocyte versus heart failure results in quite dramatic changes of these local length scales of lipid-protein interactions and can alter the calcium dynamics. At the vesicle level, you can think about trafficking as one of the very common examples that comes up. The very common examples that come up, and that's where my group has actually spent a lot of time working our way through the sort of mechanics of trafficking endocytosis as our stereotypical example. But if you go on to the cell level, then things get even more interesting, right? Because these nanodomains of signaling molecules can affect calcium cyclic AMP dynamics. Here's a very good, very recent example from Justin Taraska's group that I want to show you. That I want to show you, where they showed that EGFR timerization and cross-phosphorylation is very tightly related to the clathrin scaffolds and the integrin beta-fire integrin accumulation. So the formation of these domains is critical for downstream effects and interacting with trafficking. And one of my most favorite papers I've read recently that actually connects all of these skills in the context of difficulty In the context of early differentiation, where you have membrane tension regulation, biomolecules, the tension regulation of exendocytosis, ERC activity, and then the paper transition. And many of you will be familiar at the tissue level with what happens at the cell monolayer and how tension can play a key role in cell division and the mechanics of the monolayer. For today though, I'm going to focus on the vesicle level and the cell level and tell you a few vignettes. Tell you a few vignettes. I'm not going to go into the details of the partial differential equations and their derivations, but I would welcome a discussion on that. I'm instead going to show you how our thinking has evolved and continues to evolve with respect to tension. So if you take a look at what's happening at the vesicle level, let's dive in a little bit deeper and look at a sort of stereotypical experiment of what's happening with the formation of a clathrin. The formation of a clafrin-coated bud and tension. So, I'm choosing a simple example to demonstrate what is actually a very complex process in its simplicity. So, what you're looking at here is an experiment from this paper where they have vesicles with specific lipids and specific adapter proteins and clatron. And what they do is they change the osmotic pressure. And when they change the osmotic pressure under hypertonic conditions, under hypertonic conditions where you have the equivalent of low tension, they see large numbers of buds forming and then at hypertonic conditions with high membrane tension, they don't see as many buds forming and from there they conclude that membrane tension inhibits the formation of buds. So this led us to thinking about well what is it about membrane tension and these codes, how do they interact and how do they play with each other to result in this energy landscape if you will. Energy landscape, if you will. To think this through, what we did was first developed this sort of framework, this very classic framework in the world of membrane mechanics, membrane biophysics, which is using the Helfrick energy, which all it simply says, this energy density here says that the belling of the membrane can be captured by changes to its mean curvature and its Gaussian curvature. And to incorporate any equivalent of proteins or any other complexities, you can use a mathematical construct known as a spontaneous curvature. And you can distribute this along the coordinates, and so now you can have the equivalent of a heterogeneous membrane. You want to minimize this membrane, you will basically conduct a force balance, and what you will get is the resulting equation you solve for the shape of the membrane. First thing. First thing, computationally, we first assume that it's a maxisymmetric geometry because it's good now. When you eventually conduct a force balance on this membrane, we impose a local incompressibility constraint because the liquid bilayer is not very stretchy. This local incompressibility essentially then comes down here in this quantity lambda, which is effectively the treated as a membrane tension in the literature. But from a mathematical standpoint, Literature, but from a mathematical standpoint, all it is is a Lagrange multiplier. Now, you can add more complexity to this, you know, forces fewer acting and things like that, and you can prescribe your boundary conditions that I'm showing you here. Now, one thing that happens with this heterogeneity that you've introduced to capture a cult or whatever is, in addition to this so-called shape equation, which is a partial differential equation, you will end up getting a gradient of this surface pressure. Of this surface pressure. Now, I'm deliberately using the word membrane tension here and then surface pressure here because I want to reconcile. So, if I take this and I want to study the role of membrane tension, I am going to use the lambda 0 here as the boundary condition and run some calculations. These are highly nonlinear equations. They're not always trivial to obtain solutions. Trivial to obtain solutions, but in access symmetry, things work in MATLAB for the most part. Alright, so what I'm going to show you in these movies are each frame is mechanical equilibrium, so the movie is just a parameter speed. The blue region is where a equivalent of a coat is already formed, and the high tension and low tension are the boundary condition lambda 0 that I told you about. So all I'm going to do now is change this at Now is change this extent of curvature induced by this code C0 and then there you go. And intuition should serve us well here because we know that high tension membrane is hard to bend, low tension it bends easily. But now what you also see is that the equivalent of in the case of a low tension for the same amount of spontaneous curvature you get these very nice buttons you know and endocytosis happen pushy ball. But as we were doing this parameter But as we were doing this parameter swing of tensions across our framework, we actually ran into something quite interesting, which was that at a certain intermediate value of tension, I'll let this run and I'll be quiet for a second and let you enjoy this, and then I'll show you this how. Alright, so there you go, and then you go back. So what actually happens here is What actually happens here is a snap through instability, which is that, if I run this again, just when you get to this curvature, and if you look at the shape, it's a wide open U-shaped neck. Just a small amount of energy added to the system from the spontaneous curvature is enough to close the neck. So clearly, then, there is a landscape between this spontaneous curvature and this membrane tension, lambda zero, such that The zero such that the extremes are obvious. If you have really high tension out here, it doesn't matter how much curvature you add, you're going to get these open buttons and the equivalent of stalled endocytosis. If you have low tension, you really don't need to add a lot of curvature and then you're fine, you can get these closed butts. But there are ranges of tension where you can go from an open state to a closed state through these snap-through transitions where you can almost imagine. where you can almost imagine this to be the equivalent of a catastrophe surface. And this gap widens, obviously, for higher tensions, but this range exists. If you're wondering why this is biologically relevant, because I showed you experiments that were done in a vesicle, it's because different cell types have different ranges of tension. And then there's a debate in the field of whether tension is homogeneous or heterogeneous in a cell and so on. So, alright, so tension and And curvature induced by F co can compete. But is that the sufficient representation of membrane tension? Do we understand the physics of the membrane well enough if we just focus on this? So let's add another layer of complexity here. So I'm going to remind us, in this case, don't worry about the equations, that the membrane is not just an elastic. Just an elastic thin shell that can bend out of plane, but it's actually also a viscous 2D interface. So if you now want to account for in-plane lipid flow, you can think of the membrane now as a viscoelastic solid. In this case, we are using the equivalent of a very simple Maxwell viscoelastic material. So you're summing the elastic and the viscous contributions. And interestingly, when you do that, Interestingly, when you do that, the shape equation that you solve for the shape of the membrane simply gives you the same term as before for the shape. And then you have some shape-coupled, so recall that this is the mean curvature and the Gaussian curvature, some shape-coupled terms that go with this cost. Now, these two equations are what we need to deal with. In this case, you get a big In this case, you get a gradient of lambda as before, and this right-hand side is still the gradient induced by whatever spontaneous curvature you put in there. But then you have these two other terms. So if you take a closer look at this term and you unravel it and you ignore all the covariant and the contravariant and all that they're not there, what it really looks like is 2D Stokes lower deforming surface. Right? So what this is really telling you is the fluid flow equations, and so then the Flow equations, and so then there happens to be some bending component, but the fluid flow equations performable surface. The constraint that implements the 2D incompressibility is that the divergence of the financial velocity field is balanced by the curvature of the normal volts. So if you have a 3D fluid, 3D incompressible fluid, you would say divergence of velocity zero, and this is effectively the 2D deformable surface. Equal. So, this idea actually of interfacial surfaces and fluidity is not new, but it allows us to now see that this lambda is better represented as a surface pressure than just as a membrane tension. So, if you think about what are the implications of such a heterogeneous evolving membrane tension or a surface pressure, you can actually. Surface pressure, you can actually solve this system of coupled equations that I showed you. Where for now, if you'll allow me to just absorb a patch of proteins on there, right? So I'm populating this little domain with some proteins, and those proteins induce a spontaneous curvature. What the system tells you is that correspondingly there will be a local change in membrane tension to account for the incompressibility. And there's a separate discussion I'd like to have. And there's a separate discussion I'd like to have whether whether the membrane is vocally truly to be incompressible or when you add layers of proteins and glycocalyx and the actinocortex, what happens? But we'll maybe have that later. Alright, so so far, tension is important for trafficking. It interacts with spontaneous curvature and governs the energy landscape and The landscape, and if you consider additional effects such as domains of proteins, the tension can vary. So, let's add on a little bit more and ask how do these aggregates form and why do we care? So, again, going back to some amazing imaging, what you're looking at here is a medium image of clustering-coated bits. And you can see these aggregates, how beautiful they sound their membrane, and they need to form to bend the membrane. Bend the membrane. Again, a very rich field of active research: what came first, the classroom, or the curvature, or critical sizes of classroom, and things like that. But this goes beyond actually classroom because it talks, this idea of aggregation of particles and interacting with curvature goes into spaces of, you know, if you have genetic proteins, how do they aggregate and curve the membrane? Do they play a role? Do they play a role in deformations of the membrane, subsequently squeezing out buds, tubes, and things like that? And how would such curvatures interact with active mediated forces? So for those who are interested, I would highly recommend this very accessible review by Neer Gaugh, where he talks about all of these things without getting lost into the algebra. So now I want to make sure that whatever system I'm thinking about to complete my description, I can add To complete my description, I can add aggregation. But I also know that these membrane proteins diffusion the plane of the membrane. Alright, so to do that, to add the aggregation and the diffusion in the plane of the membrane, I'm first going to assume a constitutive relationship between the spontaneous curvature and sigma, a new quantity I'm introducing here, as the density of protein. So this is now surface density. Now, surface density, so number per unit area. And this L is a conversion factor that essentially says if you had so many proteins, what would be the effective curvature that they would introduce? And so I want to stay the dilute regime because I don't want to deal with protein crowding and other nonlinearities. I'm still an incompressible membrane, and for notational purposes, I will be dealing with an area fraction moving forward. Moving forward. So phi is my area of fraction. So if I put all of this together now, what happens is this membrane energy that we keep trying to minimize, our familiar term, this curvature term still remain, but then everything else gets very long and seemingly complex looking. But we can understand this because this is simply a feed-long fee term. It's simply saying mixing the entropic interactions. This term here, the aggregation, is Term here, the aggregation is the penalty for in-plane aggregation, it's the energy penalty. And you could think of gamma as the light entrance. If you're remembering African artillery, the gamma term essentially tunes this strength of in-plane domain formation. Okay, so with these, I'm going to show you two videos and then walk you through some stability analysis, but I'm not going to get into every step of the derivation, okay? Step on the derivation. Okay? Alright, so if I just allow diffusion, then intuition tells me that if I form a patch a priori, if I induce a patch. Now, with just diffusion, I cannot form a patch. But if I had a patch initially, and if diffusion were working in a sensible manner, then at long time, I should get a uniform distribution. And the colors bar here is that area fraction. Bar here is that area fraction C that I told you about. However, in this case, these proteins are coupled with the curvature, so it's not just simply a matter of diffusing out and becoming a uniform distribution. The shape must also change of the membrane because they are coupled by that L sigma function I showed you. So if I do that, you can see that as the proteins diffuse away, any curvature that I force the system to have Force the system to have essentially dissipates, and what you end up getting at one time is a flat sheet with a uniform distribution of proteins because of the boundary conditions and things like that. Okay, intuition is satisfied, but now what I want to do is actually want to form those domains. You see, I don't want the domains to disagree. I want to form those domains. So, what I do then is now go back and add the aggregation term. And I'm dealing with small deformations because, again, Deformations because again, I have 2D fluid flow, I have curvature, I have aggregation, I have protein transport on the surface. So the computation can get quite complex and this is something we are working through. So let's look at what happens if you actually couple those though. When you couple the aggregation and the diffusion, I start the simulation with a random distribution. Oops, too fast. Oops, too fast. And then you watch the domains start to resolve seemingly slowly at first because there's an aggregation potential that is driving these proteins to be together and overcoming anything that fusion wants to dissociate away. And as these proteins aggregate, you see they bend out of flame because that's the energy that we extract. So now we have a handle over colorful diffusion. Complete diffusion, aggregation, and bending. So at least the mathematics and the physics work out. And you can now ask this question. If I were to go so far as to say that our intuition tells us that curvature can trap molecules and can get a fusion trap, and you know, there's this positive feedback, mechanochemical feedback. My channel clinical feedback. I think we've all seen snippets of this. So we actually wondered if this is sort of universally true: that will you always get aggregation and deformation for various ranges of parameters. So you'll have to bear with me for a couple of slides because I have to show you why you can actually get a whole range of behaviors. And that kind of goes back to looking at this fairly long PDE. PE, which is not entirely written, but I'll break it down. So, what this is telling you is the diffusion of P on the surface. There's your peculiar number. This is the equivalent of a stickian diffusion with a bunch of terms that come from the bending. There's your curvature. And then there's a whole lot of everything else because we have all of these non-dimensional numbers. The key thing to keep in mind. The key thing to keep in mind is this L hat, which is the spontaneous curvature, and this S hat, which is the domain area and the footprint, so sort of a length scale. And keep in mind that when you change S hat and L hat, you will also be indirectly changing T hat because of the membrane tension. But let's see what happens here. So you can take this equation, write the dispersion relation, then coupled with bin. When coupled with bin. This last term is negative, it's always stabilizing, stabilizing, no domains formed. Then there is this fairly long, funky term here. And this is the term, the second term, that couples the in-plane transport with curvature. And these are all here just to remind you of who is who and what is what. And so, what the point I'm trying to make is that in some cases, In some cases, this term is always stabilizing. In some cases, however, the bending term can also be stabilizing because it goes with the negative sign. And if that is the case, the simulation that we saw earlier, where you saw this very nice deformation, I'm showing you the flow field and the tension field. If you tune those parameters associated with the bending, L hat, you see. You've seen this one before. Nice cable domains with furniture. Now I'm increasing SHAP, so the domain footprint. Fewer, excuse me, smaller domains, but more of them. Still curvature coupling. And then when you increase this SI to a point for low spontaneous curvature, so this is the low curvature induction, low bending. Curvature induction, low bending, high bending regime, you see that you actually don't get any domains. The instability never grows, that basically always decays to a stable state. So why this is important for us to think about is that these curvature bending, tension, coupling are all actually quite non-linear. And so the curvature-mediated feedback on aggregation of proteins to form these domains can be both positive and negative. So depending on which range of parameters. So depending on which range of parameters you fall in and your system falls in, you can either get very nice stable domains with high curvature or you basically get a uniform domain. And as we showed separately, this has implications for in-phase and out-of-phase, psychic AMP calcium signaling and things like that. But all of these are little pieces to this gigantic puzzle of what's happening on the membrane and how does this tension come about. At this level of vesicles, I want to show you one last vignette, which is you might ask me, but everything you showed me was like at this tension that axis symmetry and so on and so forth. But what happens when you actually take this to a generalizable framework? Can you actually repeat the experiment in your model? I want to remind you that in the experiment, what they did was change the osmotic environment. So Sun Cheng, my graduate student, actually coded up an entire framework using discrete differential geometry to capture these effects. So what you're going to see here is a movie that has the dynamics of proteins binding, diffusing, and inducing curvature in a hyperosmotic environment and then in a hypoosmotic environment. And so you can see here that the color map. The color map here is the curvature that's being used, and so this vesicle, this computational vesicle, actually buds out and puts these little vesicles out. And if you do the reverse, if you can watch in here, they're kind of like in this particular range of parameters, you see these sort of inward butts. They kind of butt outward a little bit, and then they butt inward. So this is where we're actually writing up the software and then hope to. And then hope to couple it to atom deformations. And much of our motivation comes from pictures like these where you can see these various, depending on the parameters, you can see the number of buttons and things like that. Alright, so in the last few minutes, I want to move up a scale and talk about interpretations of tension and implications of tension at the cell level. So I can So, I can imagine that many of you are thinking, as well, you have more than a lipid bio, you have an acronym cortex, you have the glycochelics, and things like that. How do we think about it? So I'm going to start with a relatively simple example, or at least I thought it was a simple example until it wasn't, which is the shape of a red blood cell. And to remind you, the red blood cell, why can't you get this fine? We all love it, we can write equations about it, but then it also has this very But then it also has this very nice underlying particle sizedleton, and we were very fortunate to work with Belia Fowler, who actually explained a lot of these molecular details to us. Now, the nice thing about the Red Block Cell is you can still use this sort of bending energy. You can add the work done by forces of the side skeleton in here and minimize this energy. But we also have a very rich literature, actually, of various parameter equations. So essentially, that allows to compare the That allows us to compare these parametric formulations with any simulations that we might undertake. So, the first thing we did was actually think about adding these forces uniformly around the red blood cell membrane and ask how does it compare to these well-accepted parametrized shapes in equations that exist in the literature. And to do that comparison, we actually keep track of. And we actually keep track of an error estimate and the volume of the red blood cell because a lot of these are very well established parameters. So if you do a uniform force distribution, you actually don't get a very nice ripple cell shape because either the dipple undipples or it gets too wide and things like that. So that was, it got us onto something. Got us onto something, and you know, Hane, my former student, essentially said, Well, why do we need the forces to be uniform? Let's actually go ahead and make the courses non-uniform because it looks like something's happening here. And maybe we'll make this non-uniform. And so we prescribed an additional force in the dimple. And then when you look at this error estimate, compare it with these parameters shifts, that when you have this force in the dimple, you know. Force in the dimple, you lower the other estimate, you get a good match with experiments. And so we went to Releya and said, you know, is there any variation of any of these proteins in the red blood cell? Member, we know a lot about the hexagonal cytospheric of the red blood cell. You know, everybody draws it as a pick or uniform. And so Allison, the student there actually went off and did this super-resolution imaging of the non-muscle myosin 2A filaments. Filaments, and I'm very happy to report that indeed they found a higher density of these filaments in the dimple region. Now, one thing that, since this talk is about friction, one thing that I have to tell you, too fast, sorry, one thing that I have to tell you is how well you can lower this error estimate that we care about with all of these heterogeneous forces and things like that. It really depends on what value of tension you have. So, you have now another third. So you have now another parameter to tune. And here, we are no longer talking just about surface pressure. We are talking about an effective tension which accounts for the cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer itself. So now you basically need to think about where in the function space these cell membranes may live. So that was one of our predictions. And then this morning, This morning, one last example, Thomas actually talked to us about individual spines, so then I went and changed my slides, which I tell my students not to do, but here we are, because I wanted to show how the shapes of these finds actually are. So these are like Thomas showing the EM images, you can trace out these finds. And then you look at what's going on over there, there's so much going on over there. It says branched actin, linear actin, plasma membrane, all sorts of. And plasma membrane, all sorts of things. But one interesting thing in the spinal net is you have these proteins that now induce what is known as a pediatric curvature. Essentially, all the proteins that we've talked about so far, they induce a curvature that is isotropic, so the membrane can become a sphere. Deatroller curvature, proteins, membrane can become a cylinder. They are anisotropic in their curvature inducent. The other thing. The other thing is that there is a ton of data for each and every parameter of the spine that you might care about for various shapes. Books have to write on all the spine. So, Ale was actually very brave, and I was quite reluctant in the beginning when she took on this project, because she said, you know, can we actually add layers of complexity to this model that we are working with, with these forces and things like that, and ask the inverse problem? ask the inverse problem what would it take what kind of force distribution protein distribution would it take to build these plants and mathematically it sounds like a very good problem but then it's biophysically it's a very hard one because we don't know the sort of full generation of synaptic genesis but nonetheless the way this is mathematically posed sounded very exciting to us and so what we did was added now a bedding energy due to this geotoic collection. energy due to this video torch collection. Put this through the radiational machinery and then look at can we capture these shapes. So first I'll go with a simple shape. You want a spherical head spine? No problem. Apply a normal force on this elastic membrane and you can now see that the neck radius and the force density are both as a function of tension match very nicely. Of friction match very nicely with scaling laws that can be very easily extracted. Okay, so this is pretty classic results from the literature. And then what Hawai did was, she said, I want to go beyond this, I actually want to look at a mushroom-shaped spine. Now, to get a mushroom-shaped spine, you have this thing called a full synaptic density, which is a very rich physically crowded area of proteins underneath the synaptic contact region. The synaptic contact region that Thomas alluded to. So now you have to have differential forces, and these differential forces that you apply in these locations also depend on tension. How much force you need depends on the membrane tension. And in the case of spines, this membrane tension can be important because to form a synapse, to form a spine, it's a lot like cell motility and phylopodia. You have to deform the membrane, get actinid there, and do it. Group spare. So, the net summary of doing a lot of these calculations was we found that the effective tension in this case goes beyond lambda. So you're all familiar with lambda by now, with all the different things. But it actually goes beyond that. It accounts for any of these spontaneous tensions induced by these devatory proteins. And so you can look at this phase map of the spontaneous devatory curvature. Spontaneous deviatory curvature tension and look for the neck radius because that's important. And you can scale it all down to this effective tension versus the neck radius. And you can do something similarly for the effective force required to perform this movement. Okay? So essentially, for something like vendor expines, which are very complex, you can still play with this idea of forces and tensions to get sort of a phase map, or at least that is our proposal here. Proposal here, very hard to prove experimentally, obviously. And I know now that at least one person in the audience is thinking, can't the membrane move into response to the applied forces? And so this is very preliminary, it's worked in progress, but I'll just show it because it's a full movie and it's a friendly audience, but you can see here, in response to, what's happening here is the spine is deforming, it's actually growing in response to active mediated forces. To active-mediated forces that are being placed on the mesh, and there's a whole background of Ophelin and R23 and things like that, but I won't go into that, but having to discuss. But it's deforming very, very slowly. Our synapses deform faster than that, but I just want to throw that out there as a way to sort of bring it all together. So I hope with this sort of perhaps unexpected theme that I was trying to draw across all. That I was trying to draw across all of these scales. You know, tension is something that we might want to think a little bit more about more carefully, and even its definition is so scale-dependent and system-dependent that we might want to have more discussions about it. And with that, I will thank you all for your attention and be happy to take any questions. Um Does anybody have questions from the virtual participants? Feel free to unreach yourself and ask. I'm going to ask one question before I go to the in-person participants. So at the beginning, when you had these very nice videos, Nice video. Can you determine the number of buttons? Like you flashed the dispersion relation on us. Can you predict how many buttons there are going to be or where things outside? Yeah, so you can predict the number of domain cells we call and you can actually predict that. I can I'll show you. So if I share my screen again. So if I share my screen again, this time without the screen share mode, you can see this slide now. So you can actually look at the number of these domains that form, they don't necessarily increase beyond a certain point, but it really depends on how much furniture is used, how much patterns there are, things like that. But yes, you can actually tune that if you will. Okay, thank you. So I don't see any other online questions, so why don't we take it to an in-person audience and they can pose questions. I've got a question. What do you anticipate would happen if you wounded the membrane, but with other conditions with underlying cortical cytoskeleton cancer? Cortical sinusoid without so if I heard you correctly, you asked what would happen if I wounded the membrane? Yeah, that's right. So I could tell you what happens if you try to form a pore on a lipid bilayer, right? It will try to reseal. I'm going to guess that it's just going to be much more complex with a wound and with the like I said. And with the glycotelics and the cortex and things like that. But yeah, that's a very good point. They're trying to think about, honestly, how many more layers we want to add to these sorts of complexities and when it becomes sort of computationally intractable, if you will, right? I mean, then you're in the business of building the cell in the computer sort of thing. But it's a hard problem. Yeah, I'm wondering also, thanks maybe, um what about what about like the glycolyx and things like that, like glycoscillation on the outside? Is that encompassed in some of these terms that you described, or is it something that would need to be added? So it would need to be added because the polymers in the glycokilics are actually fairly long. So one thing that we can dwell on in all of these formulations, right, with the Right, with the sulfuric energy. The approximation is that we don't really keep track of the thickness of the bilayer. So you basically are, you're not worrying about anything in the thickness. But if you look at the glycocalyx, which is significantly thicker than the plasma membrane, then your approximations of being in a thin shell theory kind of start to fade away, and then you have to worry about assigning a certain thickness to this. Certain thickness to this surface, and then the thickness deformations actually become quite important. So, some people have done some work on it, but it has not necessarily yet been parametrized to these bicycle problems. So, the mathematics of it exists in the sort of mechanics literature. Thanks. Okay, in the interest of time, let's move on to our next speaker. Also, for research. Also from UCSD, but
