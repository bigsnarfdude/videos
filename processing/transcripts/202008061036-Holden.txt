property there is a slight change. As you remember that in the setting of this proposition we don't know that H is determining eta. So therefore the variant of locality that is natural in this setting is to say that the probability that the curve does not intersect U, for some open set U, conditioned on age, is the function of H in the complement. Of age in the complement of U. Yeah, so this is somehow the natural analog of this locality property because we don't know that age determines eta. Okay, so yeah, so the starting point for proving this proposition, so it is that we first sample an SLE and then we let HREC sub t denote the harmonic extension of age. out the harmonic extension of age from the boundary of the hull at time t to the complement of this cell, assuming that the proposition holds. Because if we assume that the proposition is true, then the third condition of the proposition is telling us what these boundary data are. Okay, so then there is a second step which is to use the Lohmer equation and eto calculus to say that for each of the Learner equation and etocalculus to say that for each fixed z in the upper half-line, then h frac sub t of z is actually a local continuous martingale, and it's also possible to be given explicit expression for the quadratic variation. Then the same statement is holding if we're taking the average or sum of this function age frac sub t of z over multiple points. So, and what one can show in particular is that if we look at the pairing of H trac sub t with some function, some smooth test function phi, then this martingale property is still holding. It's still a local continuous martingale and with some, again with this explicit formula for the quadratic variation. At least as long as the SLE doesn't intersect the support of this test this test function. This test function. So then in the next step, we're choosing some domain V and then we're looking at V at age restricted to V. Then we're also looking at age rec subtau restricted to V and we're adding to that function some zero boundary GFF. And then I'm claiming that these two fields are equal in law. Law. So this can be proved by an explicit computation by using the previous point. Because since these fields are Gaussian, then the law of the field is characterized by the law of the field integrated against test functions. So this fourth bullet point is some first step towards proving existence of decoupling. Proving existence of the coupling because it's saying that if that there exists a coupling of age and of eta and of age tilde, which are consistent with this third bullet point. Okay, so okay, so then we can this fourth bullet point is for if some fixed field fixed some fixed field fixed domain v and some stopping time tab. But it's possible to extend this to the case of extend the coupling that we get from the fourth bullet point to the case of multiple stopping times and multiple domains. And then it's also possible to show that in this coupling then this locality property is also satisfied. So this is a very rough outline of how one can outline of how one can how we can prove such a proposition. Okay. So the next thing we will be looking at is that we will be looking at what are the values of the Gaussian free field along the SLE. And first we will be again looking start by looking at the case of smooth fields. So we recalled from earlier that e to the power ih is tangent to the curve at any point. And from this, it's possible to deduce that age is given by this constant chi times times the winding of the curve, at least modulo 2Ï€ chi. So then we ask about the case of the Gaussian free field and SLE. And SLE. And we see that in the case of the Gaussian reveal and SLE, we're seeing a somewhat different situation. So, in the case where the field is smooth, then the field is well defined on the curve itself. But since the GFF is not a function, this does not hold in our setting. And it turns out that in the case of the GFF and SLE, then it turns out that we get different that the value of The value of the GFF on the curve will be different depending on whether we approach the curve from the left side or the right side. If we approach the curve from the left side, then the boundary value will be minus alpha plus chi times the winding of the curve, while we will get plus alpha instead of minus alpha on the right side. So in particular, we have this what we call an angle gap of two alpha between the two sides. Between the two sides. So, one small remark here is that this is actually not well defined in the setting of SLE because if you look at a typical point of an SLE, then the winding will be infinite on that point. But it is possible in some way to make sense of the harmonic extension of the winding of the SLE. So, this is what we are considering to make this statement precise. Statement precise. Another remark is that if we consider the case kappa equals 4, then we get the chi equals 0. So in this case, we have minus alpha on one side and plus alpha on the other side. So in this case, we see that the SLE is actually a level line of the GFF because it marks the interface between positive and negative values. And this case has been studied in two papers by Schrum and Two papers by Schramm and Sheffield. Okay, so the next thing I want to do is that I want to explain, I want to explain why this angle gap is arising and also compute the exact value of the angle gap. So then we, for simplicity, we just assume instead of considering the SLE, we consider some straight line L pointing straight upwards. L pointing straight upwards. And then we recall the domain marker property. So if we phrase this with L instead of eta, then it would mean that conditioned on L, then the field we get after mapping out is equal in law to the original field. So in other words, the field in the right side of the figure has banned rada plus minus pi over root kappa. Yeah, and then I Yeah. And then I denote this field by h since it's equal in law to h. So then we know that these two fields are related by this coordinate change formula that I presented earlier. So the field on the left side will be h minus chi times the argument of the derivative of g. So it's possible to compute that on the left side of this line L, then the argument Then the argument of the derivative of g is minus pi over 2. So we plug into the formula and we see that h is equal to minus alpha, where alpha is defined to be pi over root kappa minus pi over 2 times chi. Similarly, on the right side, the argument of the derivative of g is plus pi over 2, and again we plug into the coordinate change formula to get that h is equal to plus alpha. Yeah, so then. Yeah, so then we can repeat this with a more complicated curve, and then we will see the result that we were trying to prove, which is that on the left side, the band radias are minus alpha plus chi times the winding, and on the right side we have plus alpha plus chi times the winding. And then we can simplify the definition of alpha, which is given on this slide, and we get the shown expression for alpha. For alpha. Okay, so in the remaining time, I will present a few applications of imaginary geometry because, as I mentioned before, it has proven to obtain a number of properties about SLE, which people had not managed to prove with the more classical Learner methods. So, one of the first examples of application. The first examples of applications of imaginary geometry is that Miller and Sheffield proved a reversibility of SLE kappa with kappa between four and eight. So this was earlier proved by Dapang Muzan in the case when kappa is smaller than four. And Wilhelm Schetfield also proved with imaginary geometry that for kappa bigger than eight, then we don't have irreversibility. And yeah, it also came up in Yeah, it also came up in Tuesday's lecture that they also gave an explicit law for the time reversal of SLV kappa for kappa bigger than 8. So a second application is that imaginary geometry was used to give an alternative construction of a space-filling SLE. So the idea of this is illustrated in the left part of the figure. So this is the same simulation as we looked at earlier. As we looked at earlier. So, at each point of the domain, we have started what we call east-going and west-going flow lines. So, a schematic sketch of this picture is given in the right part of the figure. So, here we have six points and we have started flow lines from these six points. And we see that these flow lines merge together to form a tree. Then we can go around this tree in the order indicated by the In the order indicated by the orange arrows. And we see that when we do this, we get an ordering of these six points. They're ordered by the order in which they are encountered when we go around the tree. So we see that we first get Z1, then Z2, then Z5, Z4, and so on. Okay, so a space-filling SLE can be characterized by the order in which it Characterized by the order in which it hits the points of the domain. So, and one way to construct the space-filling SOE is to repeat the construction in the right part of the figure, not with six points, but with a countable dense set of points. And then start flow lines from all these points, and then look at the ordering, which is induced by the flow lines. Yeah, and this turns out to give an ordering, which is easy. To give an ordering which is equal in law to that associated with a space building, SLE. So a third application is that imaginary geometry was also used to prove what the multifractal spectrum of SLE is. So this was proved by Ewan, who is in the chat, together with Miller and Sun. Miller and son. So, to define what the multipractical spectrum of SLE is, then we consider an SLE eta in the unit disk between plus minus i, and we'll let phi be a conformal map from the unit disk to the left part, to the domain to the left of the curve. And then the multifractal spectrum, yeah, so what this for instance, since this curve eta is fractal, then the derivative of phi will Then the derivative of phi will blow up as we approach the boundary of the domain. And the multipractal spectrum is telling us in what sense this function phi is blowing up. More precisely, it's given by one way to define the multipractal spectrum is to say that it is the function given at the bottom of the slide where dim sub age is denoting a half-stroke dimension. So, Gwynmiller and Son, they gave an explicit. Wynn Miller and Son, they gave an explicit formula for this multipractical spectrum, which was matching earlier predictions by Bertrand Drupal and D. So this proof of the multipractical spectrum of SOE, it is a very long and technical work. So I will just be mentioning one particular part of the proof where imaginary geometry is applied. So at one point in the proof, it's necessary. So, at one point in the proof, it's necessary to prove that if it proves some sort of independence property along the SLE. So, we prove to we choose two points, x and y, along the SLE, and we zoom in near these two points, and we want to argue that roughly speaking, the local behavior of the SLE near these two points is approximately independent. So, what they do to obtain this is that they run some flow lines of the Gaussian free field, which are shown in Field, which are shown in dark green on the slide, and they make search flow lines, which create pockets around the points. And then by the result I presented earlier, then we know what the boundary data of the SLE are along these flow lines. And then by combining this with the domain marker property of the Gaussian free field, then it's possible to deduce. Free field, then it's possible to deduce from this that the Gaussian free field is approximately independent in these two pockets, which again give us that the SOE segments are approximately independent. Okay, so another application is that it was used to compute the double and cut point dimension of SLE. So this was done by Miller and Bu. So yeah, so Yeah, so this is related to imaginary geometry because it turns out to be almost equivalent to, or it is the double and cut point dimension obviously can be obtained by understanding the house or by computing the Hausdorff dimension of the points of intersection between two imaginary geometry flow lines. Since it turns out that if we choose some typical cut point, for example, of an SLE. Cut point, for example, of an SLE, and we zoom in and near this point, then the behavior of the SLE close to this point can be approximately described by two imaginary geometry flow lines. So, yes, in the right figure, we have two flow lines of two different angles, theta one and theta two. And for certain values of theta one minus theta two, then these follow. then these flow lines will hit each other and bounce off each other. So just like the other works that I have presented on this slide, the proof of the double and cut point dimension by SOME is also a long and technical work. But I want to mention one very short lemma from this paper because it's saying one it's giving one typical application of Giving one typical application of imaginary geometry when we study SLE. So we are considering an SLE between plus minus one in the unit disk. Then we have some tube which is connecting plus minus i. And then the lemma is saying that the probability that the SLE is staying inside the tube is strictly positive. So this could probably also have been proved by more classical methods, but I want to give a very short an outline for a An outline for a very short proof using imaginary geometry. So, the idea is that we assume that eta is also the flow line of the Gaussian free field in the unit disk. Then we let eta tilde be an SLE inside this tube, also from also connecting plus minus one. And we assume that this is the flow line of the Gaussian free field, H, some Gaussian free field, H tilde. And then it's possible to. And then it's possible to argue that eta is absolutely continuous with respect to eta tilde, because age restricted to the tube is absolutely continuous with respect to age tilde if we are away from the boundary. And of course, eta tilde is staying inside the tube, so therefore eta also has to do this with positive probability. So one of the areas for which imaginary geometry has had the biggest influence is for the theory of leval quantum gravity. So I will not be stating any precise results in this direction because the mini course is not about LQG and I haven't given an introduction to it. But very roughly speaking, or what then Liwall quantum gravity is a theory of random surfaces. Of random surfaces. And if we're given some domain D in the complex plane, then the theory of label quantum gravity is giving us natural ways to sample random area measures and random boundary measures on this domain. So I will not go into the details of exactly how these random measures are sampled. So for now, just imagine that we're considering the unit disk with some random area measure and some random length measure. And some random length measure along the boundary. We also assume that the total boundary length is equal to 10, and the red points have been chosen such that the distance between adjacent points is exactly equal to 1. So, here we have three independent copies of LQG surfaces. So, this just means we have three copies of the unit. means we have three copies of the unit disk which each have some random area measure and some random boundary length measures measure such that the different the measures for the different disks are independent of each other so then we are gluing together these these three disks according to to banry length so yes we glue the right side of the left Glue the right side of the left disk to the left side of the middle disk, and so on. And since it's according to bandwidth length, then the red points are identified as shown. So when we do this gluing, then we get a new disk, at least in a topological sense. And then in certain situations, it's possible to argue that there exists a unique control map file. map phi which is taking this topological disk to the standard unit disk such that phi is continuous and it is conformal restricted to each of the of the three disks. So this brings us to the figure on the right side of the slide and here you can see that we get two black curves in the disk which are giving it Which are giving the interfaces between the original disks. And it's possible to show that for certain natural ways of sampling these Bander measures, then these two curves that we see in the disk in the right part of the figure, they are coupled together using this imaginary geometry coupling. And imaginary geometry has proven to be very useful for proving such conformal welding results. Conformal welding results that we see here because understanding what happens when we cut and glue these LQG surfaces is closely related to understanding how imaginary geometry flow lines interact with each other. So, I also want to mention that this is just a small selection of the applications in Magina Geometry as I said, and there are many important applications that I Many important applications that I have left out. And yeah, that's all I wanted to say today. I see there are some questions which have been coming in in the chat. I'm not sure if anything is still. But before that, maybe we should take a moment to thank Nina again, so the participants should be able to unmute themselves, I guess. Time for questions and we have stopped the recording at this point so uh you should be more freedom free to ask questions and before uh before we continue with some questions uh just a quick announcement Just a quick announcement that next week will be the final course by the Open Online Summer School with the Summer School for this year by Tom Hatchcroft. It will be on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday at the usual time about high-dimensional spanning trees. So we hope to see you all there. And there are some questions on the chat. You can also unmute yourself to ask other questions. So I guess. So I guess to risk this question, I guess some is arising, how does the restriction on kappa arise for the versatility proof? So I guess the problem is that when kappa is bigger than, so there is a problem when the SLE is filling the whole boundary. So that's, yeah, I know that that's somehow that are some parts of the proof that don't work when the SLE one is considering is filling up the whole. One is considering is filling up the whole boundary. Yeah. If someone has any more, yeah, I'm not sure I have anything more to add, but if someone else has they can do it. Yeah, I guess you can think of like the non-reversibility as The non-reversibility as somehow coming from how the curve interacts with the boundary. And so, if you have a setup where the curve is not actually tracing the boundary, this is not tracing like any positive length segment of the boundary, then it will be reversible. So, for example, things like the whole plane SLE kappa from infinity to infinity for kappa bigger than eight are still reversible. Okay, yeah, then there was a question if there are similar couplings for massive GFF. I think there has been considered something for the case for the level n case when kappa is equal to 4. Yeah, but I'm not familiar with that work at all. Yeah, again if anyone else wants to add something then they can they can do that Yeah are there any other other questions?  So there's a question from last one. What does free mean in GFF? Okay, so what does free mean in GFF? I am not sure, but maybe it means non-interacting or something. I am not sure. Maybe someone else can. Yeah, probably someone else here knows. I'm actually not sure. It could mean non-interacting or. Non-interacting or somewhat related to the pack. Yeah, no, I'm not sure. Maybe there's no mass that is non-massive. Yeah, it could be. I don't think that the fact that it has no mass is related to the free term, because if you look at like Scott's notes on the GFF, he says that it's also referred. In the GFF, he says that it's also referred to as the massless free field. And so, I guess if the free was already encapsulating the massless property, then it wouldn't make sense to yeah, but then if it refers to mass, then there is no such thing as a massive GFF. Yeah. Yeah. And then massless GFF is redundant. Yeah, I mean, I don't have a good answer to this. It could, it may be, yeah, yeah, I. Yeah, yeah, I'm not sure. It it doesn't make so much. I agree, it seems a bit contradictory. Yeah, that seems more reasonable. Yeah. Okay, so there's a question from Gurup. Is there any hope in the community about convergence through the imaginary? To the imaginary geometry flow lines, perhaps for some fields fractal but smoother than age. So I'm not sure how many attempts that there has been made on proving this. Also, I guess when it comes to for some fields then Uh, for some fields, then um, then I mean, somehow, um, yeah, I guess one can ask the question for all fields, and maybe some it's easier for smoother fields. Um, of course, the particular imaginary dromedoc coupling is very particular to the fact that the field is a GFF. Um, but it could be that one can make sense of these flow lines for sort. That one can make sense of these flow lines for sort of refer fields or for ref fields which are different from the GFF in some sense. Okay, you're adding just yeah, yeah, I guess Joan's remark, yeah, I guess that makes sense. Yeah, um any more any more questions? Okay, the argument would be yeah, somewhat similar. Yeah. Yeah, so that's that somehow also similar techniques as in as in Trump-Sheffield for kappa equals four. So should we maybe do breakout rooms or I can open one. I suspect most of the people here were staying for questions still, but we'll see if anyone joins. And I have the option.    Thanks, Nina, for this very nice presentation of the connections with imaginary geometry. Very nice. Thanks for the mini course. Yeah, thanks for inviting. Thanks, Jamila. Thomas, hi, Guru. We should briefly discuss hosting. We should briefly discuss hosting for next week. Sure. Yeah, then I will stop sharing. And yeah, I guess I'll see you at some later attention. Yeah. Looking forward to seeing you and hopefully you'll be able to visit us next year. Yeah. Hope so. Yeah, I hope so about having to defer. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Okay, see you. Okay. Yeah. Okay. See you. Good night. Yes, I was just about to create the Zoom meeting for next week. Okay. What's your, do you know about your availability on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday? I should be available in the mornings. Yeah, morning should be fine. Okay, and Thomas, hi. I can't do anything next week. You're out next week. Oh, okay, but you're okay, so I will very definitely be available on Tuesday, but there's a chance I want to be here on either Monday or Thursday. It's also weather. Uh it's a bit also weather dependent, and we'll have to see. But I'll put uh so I'll put you as the ability host. So even if I'm not here, you can start the meeting and yeah, I think I can even take care of the technical part of recording. That's what I was worried about. Okay. Yes, so I have all the permissions already. I have all the permissions already. Okay, so yeah, so between Goabu and James Martin is around. So he's on vacation as well next week, but he said if he did he could help. I remember Mata saying he's hosting Tom, but I don't know what happened to that. He sent an email a long time ago. A long time ago that he would be happy to hosting Tom, but I don't know what happened to that after. Oh, okay. Yes, I'll okay, so I'll include Matav in this as well. Okay, and I'll send And I'll send a message to Inon about his availability. So I'm guessing he'll be more available like in before lunch than after. Yeah, he's usually should be with one in the afternoons. Should we maybe sit down? I just texted him. Okay, so I'll be back. So I'll be back in the texted him with an email for with the Zoom invitation and all that for the mail list? Yes, I'll send an email to the mailing list for that. I'll be back in two minutes. So next week are you moving, Thomas? You have to get rid of everything? Yeah, I'll hopefully be able to attend, but we're moving. We leave next Friday, so there's a lot to be done. So what I so are you moving next week? So you're on Friday you're moving away, but yeah. Yeah, so you're moving your things next week. So many of them. We have movers. You have movers, fancy. Well, yeah, I've accumulated a lot of stuff in the past few years. So they come on Thursday. Nice. So they're also going to pack your things or are you packing your packing our own things? Okay. Things okay, so that's that's what I'll be doing, that's why I'd rather not have any focus. Yes, that's that can be a lot of work. You can see it's starting, but right. I guess it's also easier just to move everything and not to worry about getting new stuff when you arrive to Montreal. We're kind of doing a mix, like I have to take my books, obviously. Like, I have to take my books, obviously, but we're not going to take this couch. Only the good stuff. Yeah. Yeah, that's uh that's nice. So, uh, are you moving to Montreal, Thomas? Uh, yes. I'm at Montreal. I'm at Montreal. Oh, you're Montreal? I'm at Montreal. Oh, you're Montreal. Great. Are you? I'm not sure if we've met. Are you a student or a postdoc? Yeah, I'm a student. I'm a graduate student at the University of Montreal. Nice. So which university? University of Montreal. Oh, UDM. Okay. Cool. Well, then I guess. Who are you working with there? Alexander Freeberg. Oh, okay. I'll be seeing. I'll be seeing you in one way or another. You're doing a visiting position at Mookshio? I'm starting a postdoc. I'll be based at McGill. With who? With Jessica Lin also with Leah Popovich and Chowenju at. Popovich and challenge you at Concordia. So, any news about procedures for Israel? Sorry? Do you have any news about what's happening with Israel? Oh, yes, but the news are only valid for the next for this week and the next one, so I have to wait until the new update because it's like this is. It's like this is valid for 15 days if you arrive in the 15 days after your approval. So I think it's not for me. But it seems that the consulates are going to open in two weeks. Okay. So then I was already planning to go to the Israeli consulate in Mexico, so it's it's okay. I'm not in a rush. Yes, yes, I guess it's easier to do such things in person than long distance. Yeah, and also they are more familiar with Mexican documents. Like it seems that if you go to other consulates, you need Go to other consulates, you need to provide translations and your birth certificate. Yes, that's also a hassle. So do you so what are your plans for traveling to Mexico? Do you have well first I finish my corrections hopefully next week. Hopefully next week. And then you have to read them. Martin needs to read them. You need to submit to GSS. And while that happens, I will get rid of all this. But I don't have as many things as Thomas. I don't have so many things. Oh my God. Yeah, most things were already here, so I don't have to worry too much. Right. Worst case, I will be one of these persons that just puts all your stuff on the alley with a paper that says free. That works. Yeah, but it's not too bad. We should be quick. But I think it would be by the last week of August. Yeah, no reply yet from Inon So I'll uh so I think maybe I log off but uh if uh so uh we yeah so we can talk a bit regardless of enough availability uh yeah you want to talk now um so maybe in So maybe in 15 minutes? So just go on the usual on my usual UBC link. Yeah, okay. I'll be there. Okay, so see you. Bye, Toma. Bye, Sarai. Thanks for hosting. So Beers didn't talk today at all, I think. It's here now, as you can see. But it's here now, as you can see. But it didn't work. We don't have a grid recording today, so we'll have to upload something. Okay, so I'll send yeah, I'll send the recording to I'll send the link to Brent to upload. Okay. Yeah, it's strange because if you go to Bears Live, you can see us talking. Can you see it now? Yeah. I have a phone call, so I'll be going. See you later. Yeah. Bye. I'm not showing anything. Yeah. So all our trial plans are now available online. Very strange. Strange, it is indeed weird, okay. It probably will be fixed. Okay, okay. Um, I'm gonna log off here. Is it all right if I end this meeting? I think so. Okay, see you next time. Hi. Hi, Louis. Hi, hi, hi, Louis. Hi, Maz. Yeah, so yeah, it's nice to meet you and it's nice to know you are coming to meet you. Yeah, yeah, you too. So maybe we can chat when I'm out there. Yeah, that would be cool. Okay. See you, Ron. See you. Bye.
