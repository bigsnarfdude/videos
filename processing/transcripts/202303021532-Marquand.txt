So I'm going to tell you about the contents of my thesis, which is about sympathetic birational involutions of manifolds of a great intent type. And so I'm going to start by trying to motivate why we even want to study such things. But to do that, I need to tell you what a manifold of a Grady 10 type is. And so I'm going to start the same way most talks on hypercaleous manifolds start, which is with the Berger-Bogomolov decomposition theorem. So, like I said, this is due to Boville and Bogomolov. And this is basically a structure theorem for compact Kayla manifolds. So X is going to be a smooth, compact Canon Manifold. K in a manifold whose first chan class vanishes. And what it says is that there exists a finite eternal cover where this manifold x tilde has a really nice structure. It splits as a product. So it splits as a product. Product. So it splits as a product. What are the factors? Well, let me write them. Okay, so what are these factors? Well, this T is just going to be a complex torus. These Ci's are going to be collaborative manifolds, in the strict sense, I guess. I guess. And these xj's are the objects that we are interested in in today's talk. And these are hypercaleous manifolds, or I like to call them irreducible, holomorphic, symplectic manifolds. And so I'll say their definition in a second. But basically, what this is telling us is if we want to study manifolds with these properties, it suffices to just study each of these pieces individually. Okay. Okay, so what's the definition? Third, irreducible, holomorphic, symplectic manifold, which I'm going to abbreviate for the rest of the talk to IHSM. I might say hypercan accidentally. Hyper kid accidentally is a simply connected compact Kayla manifold and it has a holomorphic symplectic two-fold. So, in other words, there's So in other words, there's a holomorphic two-form that is everywhere non-degenerate. And this is unique up to scaling. Okay. Great. So let's see some examples. So everybody's favorite example in dimension two. Obviously, we have k3. Obviously, we have K3 surfaces. And then in every even dimension, we have two examples. So in dimension 2n, okay, so let's say we have a K3 surface S. We can take the Hilbert scheme of n points on our K3 surface. And there's a similar construction. And as a similar construction, instead of starting with a K3, you can start with an abelian surface, and what you end up with is what's called a generalized cuma. So I'm going to call that Kuma N. I don't really want to go into the details. Both of these examples are due to Bovell. And then we have two sporadic examples, one in dimension six. One in dimension 6 and one in dimension 10, which are due to O Grady, and they're going to be called O Grady 6 and O'Grady 10, respectively. And so originally these examples are constructed as certain resolutions of certain moduli spaces of shapes on either a K3 surface in the case of a gradient 10 or an abelian surface. Or an abelian surface in the case of a grain surface. But I'm going to come back, I'll come back to a G10 in a little bit later. And so now every example of a hypercaleer of an irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifold is going to be deformation equivalent, well, any known example is deformation equivalent to one of the ones I've written down. And so the kind of driving question is: are there any new examples? Is are there any new examples? Or are there any more examples? No, are there any more? And so I want to propose kind of a strategy that could potentially produce some examples. And so what's the strategy? The strategy is to study symplectic automorphisms. So of course these are automorphisms that preserve our symplectic form, our holomorphic symplectic form. And so this is kind of a classical idea. If we start with a K3 surface, nickelene classified symplectic automorphisms, and one thing we can do is if we take the quotient, We can do is if we take the quotient by a symplectic involution or the Nicolin involution, the symplectic form will descend, and this will have some singularities, but when we resolve the singularity, what we get is another K3 surface. So we've produced another example, although it's kind of of the same type, by taking the quotient. By taking the quotient and resolving. Okay. Okay, so let's say we have a symplectic automorphism of a known hypercale manifold X, then there's two objects we can study, or two natural objects. One is the fixed locus inside of X, and the other is going to be the quote. And the other is going to be the quotient. I'm only taking automorphisms of finite order. Okay, so both of these are going to have induced symplectic forms. For an automorphism, the fixed locus is going to be smooth, and so will be a symplectic variety. Of course, the quotient will have some singularities, but we could hope that maybe we could do some sort of symplectic resolution and get something new. And get something new. So, your automorphisms preserve the symplectic form. Kind of by definition, that's what you mean by an automorphism. Oh, yeah, so sorry, yeah, I'm checking symplectic automorphisms. That's the S. Yeah, that's the S. Yeah. Exactly. Okay, so the question is, do we get anything new if we do this? So, what is what is known? So, from now on, I'm going to focus on involutions, simply because, well, Simply because, well, I'm taking finite order. 2 should be where we start. So, what is that? Okay, so we can start with the K3M type. Well, the fixed locus of symplexic involutions on manifolds of K3N type has been classified. So, this was done by Kamanova. Kamanova, Mongadi and Oblankov. And what they show is that the fixed locus for a symplectic involution is always of K3m time, or is really the union, the disjoint union of Hypercaleum manifolds, which are all of a K3M type or possibly some isolated points. So we don't get anything new, we just get the same deformation type. And they also studied the case for involutions on the generalized commas and have a similar result. The same result. Again, you get results, you get manifolds of K3M type. So we don't really get anything new. And again, there's similar results. And again, there's similar results in the case of OG6. Again, getting nothing new. Okay, so what about OG10, which is the title in my title? So there's a very recent result of GREAS. Um Julian Zana, make sure I spell all the names right, uh Crossi, Vaniani, and Honorati. And what they show is that there are, so there does not exist any non-trivial symplectic automorphisms Of any manifolds of OG10 type. So there's nothing to study. No manifolds of O greater 10 type admit any symplectic automorphisms. Okay. So this kind of evidence kind of says, well, maybe this strategy is kind of pointless. It doesn't seem to give us anything new. And in the case of OG10, I mean, there are no symplectic automorphisms. And so what we Automorphisms, and so what we could try instead is maybe relax this to birational transformations instead. Alright, so the next idea is to relax this notion to by rational Symplectic automorphisms. So I'll denote that by burr sub s of x. And so again, this is not a new idea. This goes back to work of Marko Shovich and Chikolmirov. I think I'm probably saying. I think I'm probably saying it wrong. And so what they did is they looked at an example, a very explicit example, of a manifold of K33 type, which admitted a symplectic birational involution. Involution. And what they found is that the fixed locus in our example is a, well, it wasn't a smooth hypercalar, but it was an example of an irreducible holomorphic symphonic variety. So it had some mild singularities. So I'm going to just write IHSV for variety. And so this was a new example. And so, this was a new example. And in order to identify the fixed locus, they really used the geometry of a Lagrangian vibration, like a very explicit Lagrangian vibration. This was generalized, this technique was kind of generalized by Alvarello Ferrenti. And it's a curve, and has a lot of potential to produce new, lots of examples of irreducible polymorphic symplectic varieties. Okay, so this looks like we could, we have some hope if we're producing some singular examples. Maybe we get lucky if we find the right birational evolution. And so we should really try and study these birational evolutions. So the goal is to. So the goal is to classify asymptotic birational involutions. So is the fixed locus of a birational map like the closure of one of them. But so then does it matter which one you take the closure in? Oh, it's to itself. It's a birational map. Yes, birth. Yes, exactly. Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly where you're picking up the singularities in when you take this closure. Yeah. Okay, so how are we going to classify them? Okay, so now I'm going to let X be an irreducible homomorphic symplectic manifold of a fixed type. Something with fixed type, the deformation type. And I'm going to look at its second coherence. And I'm going to look at its second cohomology, equipped with the Bergel book model of Fujiki form, which gives us the structure of a lattice. And I'm going to fix a marking. So I'm going to fix an isomorphism with a lattice lambda. And so when I have an involution, a birational involution, I get an induced isometry of the second cohomology as a lactus. As a lattice. Get F an isometry. Wow, so this would be given by the pullback. So I get an isometry of this lattice. And so for an involution, this determines two sublattices, lambda plus and lambda minus. So lambda plus is just the invariant classes under the The invariant classes under this evolution, and lambda minus is the orthogonal complement with respect to my variable model form. And so if we want to classify an evolution, it's enough to kind of classify these two subvertices. That gives me enough information to recover the isometry. But we really want to also go backwards. So, given an isometry of my lattice, when is it induced from a symptom? From a symplectic birational invalidion. And so the global Torelli theorem, well, the Torelli theorem provides us a converse. I feel like I'm not using the word very well. Okay, so the Tyranny theorem. For hyperpotential manifolds tells me that if I take G, an isometry of my lattice, plus some lattice theoretic conditions, it tells me exactly when this is induced. In other words, there'll exist some directional involution. Well, it'll tell me that there exists some hyperkal manifold. There exists some hyperkalar manifold admitting an involution such that the pullback is equal to minus m. So we turn this kind of classification problem into like a very lattice theoretic problem. And so what are these lattice theoretic conditions? Well, they're just numerical con uh numerical conditions. Conditions on elements of 1 to minus. So, just to put it kind of in perspective, for K3 surfaces, what is this condition that we need? You would need there to not exist any vectors v in your co-invariant artis with Bobo-Bogomola squared equal to minus 2. So, no roots in this. So, no roots in this. And so, for a K3 surface, these kind of correspond to the classes of rational curves on your K3 surface. And so, these conditions are a little bit more complicated for the other hydrocanar manifolds, but they're known for the known types. So, for gradient 10, there should not exist any vectors inside of lambda minus whose Whose norm is minus two or norm is minus six and divisibility equal to three. Oh, I should mention that lambda minus should also be negative death. So if we have an isometry of my lattice, which sets Of my lattice, which satisfies these conditions, then I'm guaranteed that it comes from one of a manifold of agriculture 10 itself. So now the question is, why am I focusing on a gradient 10? Why not just do like K3n or something? But the kind of rationale is that we really want to get the fixed locus to be manifolds which aren't of K3n type. And so we want to try and start with something that kind of like With something that kind of like avoids K3 surfaces in the first place. And so we're going to focus on a grade of 10 because of this auxiliary construction. Rodney walked in at a good time because it's his construction. So a gradient tans have this auxiliary construction which starts from a cubic four fold instead of a K3 surface. So this is the so-called LSV construction. Is the so-called LSV construction of OV10? And so the L is Radu, the S is Julia Saka, and the V is Deborah Sun. Okay, so how does this go? So we start with a smooth cubic four fold inside of P5. Inside of P5. And we consider a general hyperplane section of P5, we can take, well, we can take the hyperplane section. And this is going to be a smooth cubic three-fold. And we saw this morning from Lena's talk that we can associate an abelian variety, we call it J of YH, to this cubic threefold. To this cubic threefold. So, this is the intermediate Jacobian, and this is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension 5. And so we can do this over, we can do this, maybe let me call this capital J, U, we can do this over an open subset of P5 joule, where this U is parametrizing the smooth hyperplane. The smooth hyperplane sections. And so, this was the, this is called the Donaghi Magman vibration, who observed that this non-compact variety J u admits a homomorphic symplectic form. And so the theorem of LSV says Of LSV says that there exists a smooth, projective, irreducible, holomorphic, symplectic manifold, let's call it Curly J compactifying JU. Ju. And so this manifold, Curly J, admits a Lagrangian vibration over P5, extending the Genogni-Markman vibration. And moreover, it's a vibrating 10 time. Good. So we can start with a cubic forfold and we produce a manifold of over 810 to 12. Does this curly J have a Does does this curly J have a modular interpretation? Oh, not yet. Think it might have a modular interpretation? No, I mean there are many people that try. It doesn't quite work with moduli of shoes or stuff like that, so maybe more content. Maybe that's good. I'm gonna use the shoes, doesn't mean, yeah. Okay. Okay, so what is the upshot from this construction is that we get some interesting involutions by looking at involutions that come from the cubic fold vault. This is the upshot. We get some interesting involutions. So, how this goes? Well, if we take an automorphism of my cubic fourfold, automorphisms of a cubic four fold are induced from automorphisms of the ambient P5. And so, in particular, they send hyperplane sections to hyperplane sections. And so, I'm going to get an induced involution on the open part at Ju. Ju. And so when I compactify, I get a birational involution on caluj. Okay, so we're almost ready to start to state kind of the main theorem. But before I do, there's one more kind of invariant that I want to mention about. To mention about the lattice. So for over any ten, we're going to be classifying the involutions by looking at the isometries of the lattice. And one can do this by looking at the induced action on the discriminant group. So I'm going to call that D, I guess. So this is the discriminant group of lambda. And in the case of OG10, this is equal to Z13. Z mod 3. And so if we have an involution acting on lambda, we get an induced action on the discriminant group, and that can either be by plus or minus the identity. So we're going to use that as kind of like a starting point to split up my classification. Okay, so I'm going to state the theorem. The theorem, the version that is joint with Stievelle Muller write his name. Okay, so we're gonna let X We're going to let X be a manifold of OG10 type F for symplectic by rational involution. And we're going to split the classification in kind of three blocks, and I'll kind of comment in a second why I'm doing that. Why I'm doing that. So the first one is: we're going to assume that f acts trivially on the discriminant group. Then we have two options for the action of lambda. So I'm going to write some anticipators now, and they're all going to be negative definite. Yeah. Yeah. So here, this is the negative definite E8. We're scaling this by 2. So we get two options here. And I'll comment on them in a second. What was the plus on the D12? It's like the extended lattice. An index 2 over. Yeah, index 2 over lattice of D12. It doesn't really matter what the left side. It is more important. What I'm going to say next, the geometric will be more important. So, okay, so this was acting trivially on the discriminant group. So now we can assume it acts by minus the identity on the discriminant group. And I'm also going to assume that lambda minus, the rank of lambda minus. The rank of lambda minus is less than 12. Then I get another two options and is E6 and some lattice M where M is an index two over lattice of D92 plus 24. Okay, so we get another two options. Again, I'll comment on them in a second. And then again, we can assume that it acts by minus the identity on the discriminant group, but now we'll allow the rank of the lambda minus to be greater than or equal to 12. And again, you get two pieces. I'm not going to write, well, we call them G. Well, we call them G12 and G16. These are explicitly determined lattices in rank 12 and rank 16. But again, it doesn't matter what they are. They do. It just matters that they exist. So we have this classification, and moreover, each one of these involution occurs. Okay, great. Okay, great. Okay, so now why have I kind of split this in this kind of way? Well, each of these, like 1, 2, and 3 were kind of proved in a very different way. And so I should comment that the EA2 should look familiar if you study symplectic involutions. This is exactly the Cohen-Variant analysis for a symplectic involution on a K3 surface. And it also occurs for K3N. And both of these were kind of obtained. And both of these were kind of obtained by embedding lambda minus into the leech lattice and looking at involutions of the leech lattice. The only difference with the K3 case is that now my lattice lambda is big enough to allow D12 plus to be embedded into it. But I don't really want to talk about those. So I want to talk about these two, or these three. And so these three come exactly from the qubit fourfolds. From the cubic full faults. Let me make some comments here. Okay, so how do we get these involutions? So if we, again, we're starting with a cubic fourfold in Q5. So B could admit, well, there are three possible involutions of a cubic portfolio. I'm going to write them as phi1, phi2, and phi3. And P3. And here, Pi are characterized by fixing a codimension i linear subspace of power. So you can write these down explicitly in coordinates, and you can write down an invariant cubic polynomial. And then we can look at the induced by rational evolution on the intermediate Jacobian, and we can look at whether it's anti-symplectic or symplectic. And two of these cases, we see that the induced action is anti-symplectic. And in one case, it's symplectic on the next. Okay, so this so this one's symplectic, so that's that's good. We get at least one symplectic by rational evolution. And now we really want to exploit the fact that my intermediate Jacobian comes with a Lagrangian vibration with a suction. So I have this Lagrangian vibration, and I have an extra anti-symplectic involution, which I'm going to call tau. Which I'm going to call tau on J, because this is anti-symplectic. And it acts by x goes to minus x on the sides. It's not too hard to see that actually tau commutes with the involutions, and so we can take the composition to get a symplectic involution. So we get three different symplectic birational involutions in this way. Okay. So now how do we get the lattices? I want to leave a little bit of space. Maybe. Yeah? Okay, so if we look at again the second cohomology The second cohomology of a manifold of a grade D10 type, as a lattice, this is isomorphic to the primitive cohomology of a cubic full vault equipped with the intersection pairing, plus a copy of the hyperbolic lattice view. So if I have an automorphism of a cubic fourfold, I get an induced isometry of this line. Isometry of this lattice, and I can extend it to an involution of this lattice by acting trivially on this extra hyperbolic sum out. And so, if I want to classify these induced action, it's enough to actually just classify them on the cubic fourth holes. And to classify its action, to get the lattices, it's basically the same as a As classifying the algebraic primitive cohomology of cubic full volt. So this A V prim, this is H22 of my cubic, intersected with H4 prim. Yes, yes, so we're taking a general feedback with this involution. Yes. Yes. Yes. And so this lattice is going to be generated by algebraic, by classes of algebraic surfaces inside of my qubit full fold. And so just to match them up with the picture, this one corresponds to the E82 lattice. And this is generated by cubic scrolls contained in a contained in my cubic fold folder. Contained in my cubic four-fold. And then the other two, this one, this E62, which was identified by Laza, Paul Steinen, and Jen. And it's generated by classes of planes that are contained in my cubic, in the cubic. And this last one corresponds to this other. And this last one corresponds to this funny matrix M, which is again generated by the planes, at least over Q. Does tau act by negation on H4 frame or how does tau act? Yeah, so that switches the... Yeah, exactly. So in these cases, this lattice is like the invariant classes on the cubic. And then when you apply the Cubic and then when you apply it to the tau, which is okay. Okay, and so this is a kind of why I split this into a okay, so we've talked about both of these two, and now we've talked about this second case, and this is essentially why I kind of split the second case away from the third. This condition on the rank of the co-invariant lattice ensures. Ensures that the invariant lattice splits off a copy of the hyperbolic lattice, and so we can conclude that it must come from an inversion of the cubic fourfold. Okay, so maybe I mention a little bit about this third case. So, originally, I thought that we would, this was it. I thought that the third case. This was it. I thought that the third case couldn't happen, and I tried for a while to kind of prove it, but it was pretty hard. Well, it was hard because it was not true. So I got in contact with my collaborators, Steve Le Muller, and the way that we found these lattices was really from a lattice enumeration problem. And so with these assumptions, it's very easy to determine the lambda plus, which in turn determines the Which in turn determines the genus of lambda minus, but unfortunately it's not unique in that genus. And so we ran a lattice enumeration program. Well, Suvel implemented a lattice enumeration program and we enumerated over 13,000 lattices and only two of them satisfied our conditions from the Torelli theorem. So only two of them actually occur. This took about six months for the program to finish. So it was kind of annoying. Yeah. Okay. So now in the remaining time I want to talk about a little bit of ongoing progress, which is to study, now that we have this classification, we can go back to what we actually really want to do, which is to study the fixed locus. And so the upshot from this construction is that we have three potential cases that we have like a Potential cases, but we have like a geometric realization, and we can really use the geometry to try and study the fix like this. So, I'll talk about one example. Are those three potential examples by dimension 8, 6, and 4? The dimension is the pixel logo. The dimension is the other one. So it should be. 24 minus 8. Yeah, it should be 16 of the fixed locus in the hyperkale. The dimension of the potentially new hyperkalemap. Right. 6884. 684. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Okay. Right, so let's study the fixed locus in one example. So I'm going to start with a cubic fourfold that emits my second involution, phi2. So this is the same as sending As it goes, so yeah, so if we take coordinates on p5 as x0 through x5, this sends x4, x5, to a minus x4, minus x5. And the identity on the other side. So you can write down an explicit equation for v, but I won't. And this involution on p5 is fixes On P5, it fixes both a line and a P3. So this fixes a line. And the line is actually going to be containing a look. No, this was V, sorry. And let's say pi, which is a P3. And these are just disjoint linear subspaces. Uh linear substratus. And so now when I look at the Lagrangian vibration, this is over P5 joule. And so again, I get an induced action here. And the fixed locus of the birational involution is going to be sitting over the fixed locus on the base. And so again, here. We get the involution fixes again, a line and a piece. Okay, so if I want to take, if I want to look at the fixed load case, it really, I mean I need to study cubic threefolds which are invariant under the involution and then study the intermediate Jacobi. So if I take a general So, if I take a general point in the base, this corresponds to an invariant cubic threefold. And so, in turn, the fixed part of the fiber is going to be the fixed part or the invariant part of the intermediate Jacobian. And so we have to study the action of involutions on cubic three folds and their action on the intermediate Jacobian. But luckily this has already been done. And so there are two possible involutions for a cubic threefold. One Cubic threefold, one when the cubic threefold is an echard cubic. And in that case, the invariant part is going to be an elliptic curve. And this was done in a paper by Jano. And I'm going to spell your name, Ron. And Jan. This is the case of an Eckard cubic. And then the other possibility is for so-called non-Eckard type involution. And in this situation, what we get is we get a, let me say, let me just say an abedian threefold with a one, two. With a 1, 2, 2 polarization. And so this was in a paper again with Jano, myself, and OK, so we know exactly what's going to be sat over these fibers. So if I take a point, a general point on this line, it's going to correspond to a cubic, which is actually an echo cubic. And so I get something that's fibered in elliptic curves. It in an elliptic curve, and it's not too hard to show that that's going to be a K3 surface. And then we get a six-fold fibered over this base P3, which is fibered in these abelian varieties with a one-two-tooth polarization. And so the question that remains is to study the singularities of this manifold or this variety. Well, it's variety. Yeah, and I think that's all I wanted to say. Yeah, I think that's more worth I want to say. Question is. So before you say get into really studying the single Say, get into really studying the singularities of M. Is there any way to tell just from the smooth part whether this is whether this will be different from, say, over E6 or K33 or the fixed locus as a yeah, the fixed locus of an involution is that uh it comes from a cubic foolfold, it's going to vary. comes from a cubic full fold is going to vary as the cubic forefold with the involution varies. So a cubic forefold with this type of involution has the module I has dimension 12. And so the module I of M is at least 12, which is too big for really. Okay, and how about for K3? For K33, I don't think you can do this, you can't rule out just with the moduli time, but The transcendental homology of this M does not embed into the K3 language. So it's not like a K3 field with whatever some polarization. So we know a priori if this is resolvable, it's a new example. Yes. And this one I mean, okay, quite obviously that this is. Okay, by default, that this is some sort of ORP4, but even so it's a new ORP4 that's not obtainable from a K3. Oh, it might be a non-resolvable orbifold. Yeah, yeah. But kind of all the examples, even in the orbifault situations, are obtained from whatever basically you can use. From K3, it's products of K3. So that's already sort of true. Yeah, so even if it's singular, it's a new example of it. is a new example of a holomorphic simpleton variety. But the singulars could be non-orbitals in the areas potentially. Potentially, but I suspect that they probably will be. I mean she did much more work than before. Yeah, just don't. So is this the dimension that's the most hopeful? Like you also had one that was like dimension eight and is it similar, like similarly promising in those other dimensions? I mean okay the dimension. I mean, oh o okay, there's much more to be said, but I don't know if you want to. I mean, the dimension eight is a project that I had with Washington and John for, I don't know, three years now. I mean, the problem is the dimension one, eight has more complicated singularity. So this one. This one, the singularity, should be isolated. Ah. W and how about the other direction, the dimension four one? Is that one any easier to analyze? Oh. No idea. No, yeah. We have no idea. Yeah, yeah, we have no idea. And that one might be simpler just because it's dimension four. Oh, oh, but I remember now. The dimension f 4, 1 fails, fails because I mean the same argument that we took be new fails. I mean it might be new, but the argument with the transcendental lattice fails because we support the associated. To be subtle, that that's what's taking pieces of action on. Maybe you would say all that. Yeah, maybe I should have said that. Yeah. So less potentially promising. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So the cubic forward, which would give you, with this involution, ends up being rational, so it has lots of associated K3s, so you kind of expect everything to be related to K3s. And maybe you should mention the other ones. Oh, associated KPG. Oh, that's okay. Yeah, so when I was studying cubic four folds with these involutions, you can say a lot, we have these three lattices which correspond to cubics. How does it go? Right, so a cubic, this Right, so a cubic, this was in the notation, this was V2, this was V1, and this was V3. And so a cubic, a false wall with this involution ends up being fractional. And so it has many associated K3s. In the case of so these two, the transcendental lattice for the cubic full fold is not embedded into the K3 lattice. And so from the point of view of rationality conjectures of Kuznetsov, they have no associated K3s and should be potentially irrational. But on the other hand, a cubic full-fold with the involution 31 does have an associated twisted K3 surface, where alpha is a two-torn parameter class obtained from we project from a plane. From project we project from a plane and we get a, you know, that gives you a K3 double cover of P2 branched in the sex stick. And then on the other hand, this P2 has no known, I guess, twisted kits of surface. So, from the point of view So, from the point of view of rationality conjectures, I really think these qubit forefolds with these two evolutions at least should be studied kind of in greater detail. It could be potentially irrational, if you believe, with these conjectures. Any more questions? Okay, let's take this. Um before I
