For putting this conference together and for the invitation and for allowing me to give this talk. All right, so let's get started. Uh this talk X is going to be a smooth projective variety over Q and B is an effective device. It's an effective eraser on X. We're going to talk about the front-end approximation relative to this device circuit. And for that, we need to introduce a couple of notions. So the first one is that, associated to this, you have Bayof functions. Wave functions, and this is for places B of Q. By the way, when I say D is a divisor on X, well, X is defined over Q, so the divisor is also defined over Q. Okay? All right, and with this notation, the key object today is going to be the truncated count. is going to be the truncated counting function and 1x v little x which is defined as the sum over primes of the minimum log p and the wave function relative to d and this is for Relative to d, and this is for x a rational point. This is the truncated counting function. And this notion is a generalization of the radical of an integer. And the way to see that is by means of the following example. If x is b over c in t one q Without zero or infinity, then the truncated counting function relative to the divisor zero of this x, I didn't write it, but b and c are co-prime integers, okay? They're co-prime integers. The truncated counting function is nothing but, well, let's see. This This Weil function is counting, taking into account the distance, the p-adic distance from x to the divisor d, roughly speaking. But we're taking the minimum with respect to log p. So what is really going on here is that you get log p if x reduces to d mod p, you get zero otherwise. And in this case, b is what matters here, because we are comparing with respect to the device or With respect to the divisor zero, the point zero, sorry, you get the logarithm of the radical of the numerator B, where the radical of an integer is the product of the different primes dividing this integer. Without looking at this. Alright, so the radical, we have seen the radical in some other places, right? Especially in the ABC conjecture. And Boyda's conjecture is a generalization of the ABC conjecture. Let me state what it says. ABC conjecture. Let me state what it says. Yes, could you, in that example, just write down what lambda is? Right. So in this example, lambda, maybe I should do it there. In this example, lambda For example, lambda q1 with respect to a prime of 0 x is something very explicit, it's just the PR evaluation of x times sorry, this is plus log P. So if the PR evaluation is negative, we just put a zero. Evaluation is negative, you just put a zero. And if it's positive, you take the evaluation with the weight log p. That will be the value function with respect to the point zero. Now, I say the value function, but that's not exactly correct. These value functions are defined only up to bounded error. Okay? But let's not pay too much attention to that technicality. Alright, Boyta's conjecture. Sorry, can I just ask if uh if you have more than one point in the support would be, do you take a minimum of something? You you look look at this database and uh look at the scales actually the maximum of the proximity, so it would be the logarithm of the minimum of the distances. Yeah, so this is not really a distance, it's this is more like a minus logarithm of the periodic distance. That's what it is. That's what it is. Weighted conjecture. It says the following. So assume D has normal crossings that epsilon be positive and A A an uncle shift on X, then there is a C properly contained in X sorry is declosed such that for every X X XQ not in C we have the height with respect to the canonical sheaf intensive with O B X is less than the trouquet counting function. The QK counting function x little x plus certain error term which is small with respect to the ample height. And there is this bounded error term just because everything here is defined up to a bounded error term. So this is what it's saying. And a remark. A remark is that the Bojeta's conjecture implies the ABC conjecture when X is P1 and the divisor V is 0, 1, infinity. These three points. I'm not gonna do the computation here, but just to tell you that this conjecture is very neat. You that this conjecture is very neat, it's complicated. And you can kind of see what's going on here, right? Here the canonical of P1 is minus O of minus 2. This is O of 3. So you get here the height with respect to O of 1. This is the usual height of the rational point. The concern function will give you a bunch of radicals, exactly like this. Then there's the error turn, the epsilon that's. And then there's the error term, the epsilon, that's floating around in the ABC conjecture. So you can see that something like that should follow from this statement. Unconditional progress. I'm sorry, where the thing I just take off one to that and on epsilon? Depends on everything. So I'm not. The only parameter that's not giving you dependence here is little x. Depends on the variety, depends on the divisor, depends on the choice of by functions, depends on epsilon, depends on everything. The same goes for this statistic closed set. So on conditional progress, you let A be C co-prime positive integers with A plus B equal to C then we know we know that We know that the logarithm of C is less than with an implicit constant that only depends on epsilon. Epsilon is some positive number radical of ABC to the power kappa plus epsilon where the best current Exponent is kappa equals one over three. And this is Stuart and U. I'm writing it like this because uh for history uh this number has been improved considering f i I think the first result was fifteen and then two thirds and then one third. Okay. Thirds and then one-third. Okay, but currently this is the problem. And I say in conditional progress, so maybe I should say something about that. The ABC conjecture, the ABC conjecture is more or less the same as weightless conjecture in this particular case. So in fact, this is an if and only if in that case. So any progress on the ABC conjecture can be seen as progress on VoITES conjecture. And here, well, if you're familiar with Well, if you're familiar with the ABC conjecture, we're missing a logarithm here, right? So, this is an exponential bound. But it is unconditional, and for some applications, that's all you need. It is unconditional. And this is in dimension one in higher dimension, we know nothing. No partial results in higher dimensions. All right. So that would weight is conjecture. Let me now talk about something different, also related. Talk about something different, also related to the approximation, which is approximation of points in higher-dimensional varieties. It's a subject that's received a lot of attention in the recent years. Okay, so approximation of algorithmic here is a easy fact. Here is an easy fact. Uh let T be an underdog point an A ample and X there is a number that depends on this data. A number n such that for all little x in Q, we have the proximity minus logarithm of the Archimedean distance from X to D is less than this constant times the height with respect to the. The height with respect to the animal sheet this is the distance at the Archimedean place. So you may wonder which distance, right? Well, it doesn't matter, because there's this logarithm in front. So any distance you get will be more or less the same up to a bounded factor, and this bounded factor contributes only to the fact. Bounded factor contributes only to an error term, which I probably should have written. Sorry. And you can put the distance in the complex points of your variety, for instance, by embedding the variety in projective space and restricting the Fougui-Stali metric. That's one possible way to do it. So this is an easy fact. I'm not giving the proof, but some little exercise, like you used inequality. And this minus logarithm should be thought as the proximity. So when As the proximity. So when the distance is very small, this minus logarithm is large. So this is measuring precisely how close x is to p. And we have seen theorems like this in other contexts. So an example in x equals q1 and a O1. So, by the way, O1 will appear in two different ways in my talk. One is a rounded error. Don't get confused. O of one n equals two plus epsilon. This is rough theory. Is in fact statement you want X to be distinct from P? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Absolutely. Thank you. So yeah, raw theorem is a standard distort. And this is Klaus' prof. Because there is another probe, which is my prof. And if you're interested in this kind of statement, you should probably read the work of McKinnon and Mein Roth, where they study what's the optimal value of this M. And they discover that this is connected to s sha s shadowy constants in agrariometry. So it's a very interesting subject. It's a very interesting subject. So when you put together this EasyFAG Boythus conjecture, you are led to the following conjecture. X V as a voitus conjecture, by which I mean X is a smooth projective variety and V is a normal crossing effective divisor. That G in X Q both. Let's uh shave canonical uh twisted by B sample there is an M depending on the previous data such that for every epsilon positive there is Uh sorry is enclosed subset properly contained in X, such that minus logarithm of the Archimedean distance is less than n times the duplicated counting function plus a little error. plus a bounded error term coming from, as always, from the fact that these definitions are only up to a bounded error term. Good, and this is for of linear x in x cube, not in z. So when you put together a Voitis translator with this observation, So when you put together a voice truncator with this observation, you end up with a statement about bounding the proximity to an algebraic point, not in terms of the height, but rather in terms of the truncated counting function. So this can be seen as a special case, a consequence of Coeter's conjecture in higher dimensional varieties. So what I want to explain today is the following theorem. End result: so theorem X smooth projective Write over Q d is going to be a divisor written as D1 plus DN with different crank devices such that Such that the number of m is not too small. M, the little m over there is larger than the rank of the rational points of decarbonizing the connected component plus the Picard rank. This is the rank of the nail severity group. This number is finite by the Mordenwell theorem, so this is certainly a finite number attached to the variety, not to the divisor, and you ask the divisor to have at least this number of components plus one. Let P and X divar not and the support of the divisor. In the support of the divisor, there is C strictly containing X, so it's declosed, such that for every epsilon positive, we have minus logarithm of the distance. dx less than the exponential of epsilon times the truncated counting function plus linear error turn plus abounded the return. Plus abounded the return. Since epsilon was quantified at the end, I'm going to insist on the dependence on epsilon here, although it also depends on the other data. And this is for all. Oh, yeah, look starter. Oh, yeah, log star. Log star means the logarithm when you can take it, otherwise, it's zero. Okay. Could you say what this exact Z looks like that comes through? The proof will tell you. So the proof will actually give you an instruction about what this C is. So certainly C will contain a device or D. There is an additional component that comes from a certain construction in the middle of the proof. So it's not just an existent statement. Statement: If you go through the proof, you actually get a description of what this C is. I don't want to get ahead of myself, so let's talk about how to prove this. And is there some other question? Maybe I should say that although you see an exponential here, this is a sub-exponential bound because of this epsilon. Because the capital N1, the truncated counting function, is like the logarithm of Rado. Of a radical. So if you write this in terms of radicals, you get at this point you get a radical to the power epsilon when you get rid of these logarithms. Right. So it gives you a sub-exponential bound in the spirit of Boyd's conjecture in higher dimensional varieties. So that's the contribution here. Yes, sorry. You said log style is the log when you can take it, but do you mean the absolute value? Oh yeah, thank you very much. So maybe I should be really precise about this. See, some of you really make a mistake saying what remote what remote star is, remote star. T is the logarithm of the max. Of the max between one and two. Some people write this as log plus log star. That's what you mean. Thank you. Some remarks? Some remarks? Maybe just one remark, because the other remarks are already made. What about this mysterious term? So this is the rank of certain a given variety, and those things are hard to compute. But there is a case where that term will not bother you, which is when the irregularity is zero for regular varieties. So let me remind you what the irregularity is. This is the hotch number one, zero, which is One zero, which is the dimension of H0X regular one forms. So if QX is zero, then certainly this is a trivial unique variety. Well So, in that case, the condition becomes you want more components than the Picard prank, which is easier to check. Right, so the statement looks very geometric, so it shouldn't be a surprise that there is some very geometry in the proof. But there is also transcendence theory, and that shows up in the form of. Theorem, and that shows up in the form of linear function logarithms. Linear function logarithms. So, what is this? Take A 0, A 1 to A N under Reg numbers. I would write numbers in k where k q is a number field degree d and v 0 b n are integers. Let me define a linear form of logarithm means. And now this is v0 logarithm of a 0. A 0 plus plus B and logarithm A n. So something has to be explained here. Well, first I forgot to exclude 0. Secondly, the number field is thought as embedded in the complex numbers. And in that way, the complex logarithm is defined up to a multiple of pi, right? So, right, so you need to pick a choice. So you need to pick a choice of what is the branch of the logarithm you're using. And the question is: what if this is not zero? How small can it be? So assume lamp is not a good thing. Lump is not zero. How small? How small can it be? Well, maker show that minus logarithm this is. Right. This is less than something explicit. An effective effective strong bound that I'm not writing, but not least showed an improvement on Baker's theorem. This one I'm going to write because I needed I need it yes d square plug e times t this e is Euler's number. Just to make sure that I don't get a zero here, okay log Yeah, I take it back. Log star instead of maximum between 1 and t, take the maximum between e and t, because otherwise I have to write e everywhere. I don't want to write e everywhere. So, yeah. Max j of the j's times uh c times d to the power n. times d to the power n times product k going from zero to n of the normalized height of these algebraic numbers where c is an effective absolute constant something like uh 30 okay it's not such a huge number but I Huge number. But I didn't check before coming here, so I don't want to write something incorrect. Let me just say, see some number, okay? It's a specific number. Good. Now, a remark here is that when lambda is small, lambda is approximately one minus a zero to the b0. 0 to the B0 A N to the B n approximately that. And here, one can connect with the previous topic because you can imagine that you have your favorite rational number and you factor into primes. The a's will become primes and the exponents will be the exponents in the prime factorization. And then you have the difference between a target, in this case one, and a rational number. Okay? So there is a connection. So there is a connection with the previous topic. Now you can be clever here. Instead of taking this primes, you can take alpha to the minus 1 times P1 to the exponent B1 times Pn to the power Pn. You choose A0 as your favorite algebraic number. The exponent B0 is minus 1. And in this case, you get that difference. You get that difference. And this difference is precisely measuring the distance between this rational number that I'm going to call r and the algebraic number alpha. Measuring that distance. So that distance will be controlled by this expression over here. And in this way, you get the following lemma that alpha in q r star of degree V. D, an algebraic number of degree D, and R, a rational number, P1 to the V1, Tn to the Vn, a positive rational number. You start. Positive is not such a bad prescription. You can put a negative sign in front, that's not going to change things very much. We need the prime, so one of my We need the prime, so 1 and minus 1 are out of these considerations, and we're throwing away zeros. But other than these little remarks, R is basically any rational number. Right. And the logarithm minus the logarithm of alpha minus dual r is less than a constant. is less than a constant depending on alpha, and this constant will absorb these contributions of b squared and this part over here, and also the fact that I have alpha to the minus 1 and 1 to multiply by alpha so that I get alpha minus r rather than 1 minus r over alpha. So there is this little alpha that's going to be absorbed in this kappa alpha times logarithm of the height of R. Of the height of R. So, where is this term coming? I'm not down here, okay? I will continue. But where is this term coming from? From here, because here you have the maximum of exponents. So, you can certainly bound this in terms of the logarithmic height of the number r times exponential of it's not going to fit here, so we need writing an exponent. Thank you for having me writing the next line. Times exponential of 10 plus logarithm of V little n plus little n times logarithm of uh logarithm of P logarithm of P C divided by N where R is written as V over C. Good, so I should explain where is this coming from. This first part, the 10 plus block V times N, that's coming from C D to the power n. Okay, so that 10 is actually when you do the computation with the actual numerical value of C. And this is perhaps And this is perhaps more mysterious. Where is this coming from? This part will become product j going from 1 to n of logarithm pj will become that, except for the factor of alpha that's already absorbed in this kappa alpha. And now you apply the geometric arithmetic mean inequality because this. mean inequality because this is a product and then you get a sum. And the sum is precisely this logarithm of, oh, this is wrong, sorry, radical BC. Because you're just taking the logarithm of the primes, okay? And you get that expression of the geometric mean, arithmetic mean inequality. But why did we do this? Well, you'll see in a moment, but for the moment, Uh well, you'll see in a moment, but for the moment uh we need to see how to control this term. This term is a little complicated. But the observation here the observation is that uh little n is the number of prime factors of the radical of Bc and the number of prime factors of an integer this bounded. Well, I should just write what Well, I should just write what it is. Expanded by 1 plus epsilon logarithm m divided by log, log, m. And this is up to finally mean exceptions, depending on accident. Right, so when you use this inequality for little n, and you plug it in here, one has to do a little calculation. Has to do a little calculus to figure out what's the maximum. It's not a complicated computation, but I'm not going to click here. But when you optimize that term, you end up with the following estimate. minus logarithm of alpha minus r less than a constant that depends well not constant but a number that depends on alpha and certain exponent that will appear now times law star h r times exponential epsilon times law Law radical DC. To be precise, what you really get is log radical divided by log log radical multiplied by log log log radical. So that's certainly epsilon of log radical. That's one of these analytic number theory things, right? Good. Now, remark when A and B are positive numbers, this is a really silly remark, but I need to write it down. This is less than A to the power 1 plus small delta plus B to the power 1 plus 1 over delta. For A and B positive. So, why do I care about this? Because I want to separate this multiplication. I want to separate that. So, with this remark, you get that the expression is less than exponential epsilon. And this epsilon is not the same epsilon there, but you can take it as small as you want. And one P1 of zero plus infinity of zero r plus plus star of height of epsilon plus a certain number that depends on the amount and epsilon. An epsilon. So, this elementary inequality, you can kind of separate that term and write this down. Why? Well, there is the logarithm of the radical of numerator and denominator. That's precisely the truncated counting function with respect to zero that will take into account the numerator and infinity that takes into account the denominator. And units. Okay, that's. Use this. Okay, that's a very special case of the main theorem. This is a special case. The main theorem for x equals q1 and the divisor being zero plus infinity. It's two points. And just to make sure that this is within the scope of the theorem. Scope of the theorem. The well, P1 is regular, so the irregularity is zero in this case. You don't have regular differentials other than zero. And the Picardy parameter is one. And here you have two components. And two is larger than one. So certainly this is one of the cases that appears in the material. So what we're going to do now is to To deduce the main theorem from this special case. Yeah, I have time. So let me remind you the objects. I'm not going to write the end of the Ethereum, but let me remind you the objects here. It was this divisor, d1 plus dm, where the dj's are different prime divisors, and m was larger than the rank of The rank of T0 x of the q that could be cut rank. Well, this inequality is telling you that T1, T2, T n are linearly independent in the peak x of the q. X over Q. Because of the standard exact sequence where you have peak zero, peak, and then severity. They are linearly dependent. And the meaning of that is that there is some non-trivial relation here up to linear equivalence. And that translates into the fact that there is a rational function from x to e1. To be one non-constant with the pullback of zero, infinity supported. And we're going to use this little f to pull back the inequality from p1 to the variety x, although x has arbitrary dimension, but there is this issue. As arbitrary dimension, but there is a decision that this is not amorphism, and that then approximation inequalities and functions do not behave so well on the rational maps. So, for the sake of explanation, let me first pretend first pretend morphism and then at the end I'm going. And then at the end, I'm going to tell you what's really going on in reality when you consider the general case when f is not necessarily a morphism. Okay, so recall we have this at the right point. Not only let me define it. And let me define alpha as f of p and this is a non-zero algebraic number. Sorry, it's very small, but what it says here is a non-zero direct number, and I'm identifying this as the direct points of p1 minus 0 and infinity. Taking that way. Taking the other way, like this alphabet over here. And now let me define a divisor, A divisor on Q1Q, and this is given by the Gala orbit. Of alpha. So alpha is a redirect, but the low orbit gives you a device for defined over Q. Now we are getting to the point where I can answer finally the question about what is C, the exceptional set C. Let Let C will be D plus, well, this is a little abuse of notation because the right-hand side will be a device or the left-hand side is an algebraic set, but I need the support, okay? I need the support of this. That's the exceptional set. So it comes from the construction of this F. Construction of this f. So when you find a linear equivalence relation between the D's and construct this function f, then you can precisely say what is the exception. Well, for all index in xq naught in this exceptional set, and we get All right, and here comes the definitive approximation part. So the proximity from X to the point P, yeah, there is the issue that you don't want X to be exactly P. So you can put P in the, well, the Gala orbit of P as P. The Gala orbit of P as part of Z, or just say somewhere little X is not P, as it was remarked before. Log, yeah, I was saying this. This is less than or equal to the Bayl function x infinity called back this device or A. Why is that? Well, the Veil function is measuring the Archimedean proximity in this case, the Archimedean proximity to the divisor. The divisor f pullback of A contains the point. You see that alpha is contained in A and alpha is the image of P. Therefore, P is contained in the pullback of A. So here's So here's the picture to have in mind. This is F pullback of A. This is P. When you have a point neural X, the proximity from X to P is less than the proximity from X to the divisor. Of course, this is not a proof. This is just to keep it in mind, but you need to do the math here. But you get this inequality. And why to And why to do something like this? Well, because the value functions are functorial. That's why. By the way, I'm not writing anywhere the plus O of 1 because otherwise things will not fit in blackboard. Sorry, this is P1. And that's my found the reality of the real functions. Functions. Now I'm going to use the theorem that we have in the case of T1, the special case. And I'm going to apply it to each gamma conjugate of alpha. So you get a bunch of inequalities, you pick the largest one. Fortunately, the largest one has the same shape as the one for alpha. So this is exponential. Exponential of epsilon and T1 0 plus routines sorry f of x plus logarithm star of the height star of the height of f little x to the power 1 plus epsilon plus and here I need to be precise about the epsilon so this error term depends on many things but in particular depends on the epsilon that just appeared okay so let's keep track of that now by functor reality again this is explanation This is explanation of epsilon times okay the counting function because this guy is factorial, okay I have pullback of uh 0 plus infinity 0 x plus uh logarithm. Here you see another another point where you can apply functality. You can apply something to reality. I'm using here that the usual height in D one is precisely the height associated to the sheaf O of one. Set it to the shift O of one. So I'm pulling it back again. And this is lesson river two, and here's where the magic occurs. This divisor is supported on D. And the truncated counting function, by definition, doesn't really care about multiplicities. So even though this divisor may have really large multiplicities, the truth counting function will in any case give you the following inequality. Politics And right, so yeah, I should say something about it, but in the moment. Yeah, so what happened here is what I just said, that the truncated counting function doesn't really care about multiplicity, so you happily just bound this by the divisor t. Here it's not quite the same, because you see that O1 can be thought as associated to the divisor bracket. Associated to the divisor bracket zero, right? To that point, bracket zero. And when you pull back bracket zero, you get something supported on D, but possibly with multiplicities. You put those multiplicities here, and well, there is the logarithm of the logarithmic height. So those multiplicities come as a factor in front of this, and then as an addition after you apply this second logarithm. And that addition is absorbed in this error term. Yeah, well, one has to be careful about things here, but all right, so you get that return and that's it. So that that gives you the the inequality for of the main theorem, but here is pretending that it is f is a morphism. Here's pretending that it is actually some morphism. What you do in general, just a question. That is just a rational map to be one. And what we should do is to consider resolution. So, what is this resolution? You take the closure of the graph and then you designularize the closure of the graph, okay, using Hironako's theorem. And then you work here and very carefully push down the inequalities from X tilde. This is technical. I'm not explaining this because, well, I don't have time. Yeah, so that's really what's going to happen. The argument I just gave will work up here. And then you need to carefully push the inequalities down to x, and then you do get some additional multiplicities, especially in. Get some additional multiplicities, especially in the organs. One has to be careful about that. But basically, the main idea is what I already explained. So, combining linear functions and logarithms and this geometric construction. Thank you. Thank you, Excel. Are there any questions? Sorry, excuse me, sorry. Are there any applications of the pseudo-voida structure? Oh, yes, yes. So what is this? Corolla of the main theorem. The main theorem is certainly weaker than this consequence of Voyage conjecture. So I'm going to explain an application of the main theorem. Let A B C equal prime positive Integers with A plus B equal to C and there is a little condition that A is somewhat smaller than C. For certain at the positive, of course, there is always an eta. You can compute it using logarithms of A and C, but I need to keep track of this guy. So take that as a definition of eta. Then logarithm of C is less than right now of A B C to the power epsilon. epsilon plus an error term that depends on epsilon and eta so this is an application and you may say well what is this right this is a sub explanation bound for the sequencer so the usual bound has a number here a fixed number I guess the record is one over three you can get an epsilon provided that one of the semants is somewhat smaller One of the semants is somewhat smaller than the addition. Let's see. And this is a consequence of the main theorem. Actually, this is what I was trying to prove. And then the other thing came. This is very strong. Thank you. Yes, Slovak here. You have in mind maybe a generalization to number fields? For excellent fields. Right, that's a very natural question. How to extend this to number fields? Well, the exponential bounds for the ABC conjecture have been already extended to number fields, and I suspect that the same kind of techniques will allow you to extend this resource to number fields, because the only part that is treaty over number fields is the linear function and logarithms part. The algebraic geometry and the font and approximation part, that's fine. And something I should have said is that for the purpose of explanation, today I focus on the arcade. Explanation today, I focus on the Archimedean distance, but the theorem in the paper works for any fixed place. It could be the article distance. Using linear forms in the logarithms rather than McVeigh still. But yeah, true. I suspect that this can be done also over number fields, only up to technicalities, the same sort of technicalities you encounter when you try to prove exponential bounds for the ABC conjecture over number fields. And I think it will be very interesting. And I think it will be very interesting because then the discriminator will show up and you can analyze what is the dependence on the discriminator and this sort of testing. Well, if there are any further questions, let's get to the panel to come back.
