I'd like to thank the organizers for their kind invitation. It's a great pleasure and honor to be part of this workshop. I've been listening to very interesting talks and to open my mind to a new field. I'm originally working on partial differential equations, but I started being fascinated by the n-body problem in the last few years. So today I would So today I will share with you a few things. So some of them may have been known for a long time, but I present different points of view and some of them are perhaps new in terms of results and point of view. So the dream is if you have a differential equation, we all know the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem that tells us. Theorem that tells us if you fix an initial condition and if your forcing is locally literacy, then there is a solution, and this solution can be singular in finite time or exist for all time. And then it comes the question to, is it possible to classify the fate of the solutions just based on the initial data which we have in hand? So this is an extremely ambitious question. Nevertheless, in some models, Nevertheless, in some models, some sort of classification of the phase space can be done. I'm trying to convince you about some of these few cases. Good, so this is joint works with Yang Xiaodeng, who is in San Yat University in China, and my student Lin Chun Chan. Good. So So, let's. I'll focus on two main problems. So, the first one is Kepler, the very famous one, and then I will move to slightly more complicated, which is his Helles Rundle problem. So, Kepler problem, it's this differential equation that we have seen quite a few times. So, it models the motion of the Sun, Earth, and Moon or Earth-Moon. Or Earth-Moon. Then, so this is the original form presented by Kepler. And so I'll present a modification of this model using a quasi-homogeneous potential. Okay, so here I will take two quasi-homogeneous potential with two powers, small a and small b, right? small b right and capital A and B are positive constants. So this is an attractive potential. Okay and Newton's himself he used this quasi-homogeneous potential mainly when he studied manif potential. So we can see, let's think about this term here as a correction of the original one. Of the original one, which is with the power A. Okay, so let's see this one as a correction. Good. So the manifest, so there are examples. Main examples include the manif potential. So this is the manif. And the second important example is Schwarzhill example. And as I said, so. And as I said, so we will consider these two additions here as correction terms to the original potential, which is a Newtonian potential. Okay? Good. So this is the first problem, which is Kepler problem. And then the second one is Hiltz-Dunner problem. So the Hiltz-Dunner problem, it studies the motion of the Moon, Sun, and Earth. Moon, Sun, and Earth. And the Moon has infinitesimal body, infinitesimal mass, and it's attached to the Earth, and the Earth is fixed at the origin. Okay, so this is Earth here, and Sun is at infinity, x equal to infinity, and the moon is moving in the plane here. Okay, and we choose a reference reference with the rotation frequency omega, and we normalize the frequency here to be one. Good. So Hilles has derived his system through a formal computation. And this computation was And this computation was made rigorous thanks to Mayer. So, and Meyer, he worked on the Hamiltonian rather than the equation of motions, okay, to derive Hill's lunar problem. Okay. So, the main questions, as I said, that we want to address is how large is the initial. How large is the initial set, the initial set of the initial data that can lead to finite time condition? And what kind of conditions we can impose to have global existence. So here we do not investigate the asymptotic properties for a global solution. And that can be a completely different subject and we started. A completely different subject, and we started analyzing this quite recently. So, but in this talk, I'm not talking about asymptotic behavior for global solutions. So, classification, finite time coordination, or solution that exists for all time, it may have a very complex behavior as t goes on. Okay, so these are my interacting potential, right? And this is Newton's law. And this is Newton's law. Okay. So there is this discussion about the difference between singularity and a cognition. And so we have a bit of history here. So I can skip that. So that is the Kihi transform, which I will talk about it at the end of my talk, which is a technique to regularize the collision singularity. To regularize the collision singularity, and that has been extensively used. And we have listened in this workshop to many experts talking about that and using this technique. So it blows up singularity to collision manifold by introducing a new change of coordinates and new time parameterization. And so the correlation manifold can be studied quite carefully. Studied quite carefully here. Okay. So now I haven't said anything about these powers of the potential, these powers A and B. Okay, if I go back here. So it turns out there is a threshold power that really matters. And this threshold power is the power two. Okay, so we'll see why this is the threshold power and This is the threshold power, and what happens below, and what happens beyond this power. So, there is the very famous result by Sari, the improbability result, which says that if you take the Newtonian potential and you look for the set of initial data that lead to finite time singularity, then the measure, the Lebesgue measure of this set is zero. Okay, that's called the improbability result. And this result can be extended to all powers between less than two. Okay, so let's agree from now on that if I take a power less than two, then we will call the potential to be weak. And if it is bigger than two, then we will call this as. Bigger than two, then we will call this is strong. Okay. So given this improbability result in the chaotic behavior of the Newtonian and by the problem, then it seems very unreasonable to do any kind of classification. Okay. Indeed, the boundary between collision and global solution can be fractal. And so we cannot think about So, we cannot think about any kind of classification. Nevertheless, if we go to the world of strong potentials, then we can start seeing some sort of classification, some sort of organization of the dynamic. And if you can think, if you naively think about a potential like this and potential like that. Potential like that. So let's say this is one, this is Newtonian, and this is B. The B is bigger than two. Then close to the blow-up or singularity, then this potential is much stronger. However, if bodies are away from each other, sufficiently away from each other, this potential is weaker. Potential is weaker. So, naively, we can expect that this kind of potential can present some organized dynamic. So, this is the naive intuition. And indeed, we can see that if you take strong potential with b bigger than two, then the set of initial data leading to finite time singularity becomes. To finite time singularity, we can with positive Lebesgue measure, no longer zero Lebesgue measure. I'll talk about this. And that's not really hard to prove that. Okay. And solutions with non-zero angular momentum can be achieved when we have strong potential. Okay? As long as the B goes past. Goes past the threshold two, then no need for the angular momentum to be zeroed at the collision. Okay, and this is known, this has been known for a long time now as a black hole effect. And Christina and Ernesto and their collaborator, they studied this, at least for the Kepler problem, Floren Diaco also, and for the isocelet. For the isocellis short sheet model. Good. And as I said a few years ago, together with Yangtze, so we have shown that the black hole effect in the general and body problem. Okay, so what are the ideas? So there are mainly two very basic ideas. Okay, the first one is ideas okay the first one is um variational um characterization of relative equilibrium right and the second one is the lagrange jacobi identity okay so let's start with lagrange jacobi identity so if we differentiate the angle of momentum um momentum of inertia sorry if we differentiate the momentum of inertia twice so the momentum momentum of inertia measures the size of the configuration okay The configuration. Okay, so if we measure this, if we differentiate this momentum of inertia twice, we get this very nice identity. Okay, and on the right-hand side, we get, let's label, let's call this function y of x. Since the energy is conserved, then this becomes a function of x. Now, the sign of this function y, it really matters and it will prescribe. matters and it will prescribe, it will dictate the dynamic of the solution. Indeed, if y becomes negative, then i is non-negative quantity that has second order, second derivative to be negative. So this is concave down function. And it's non-negative, then singularity has to happen. Then singularity has to happen. So, this is very nice and basic identity. So, what I wanted to say here is the sign of this right-hand side is really important. Okay, good. The second ingredient, it's basic ingredient as well. So, we will define an indicator function. Okay, and this indicator function would decide the fate of the solution. So, we will define this indicator function. So we will define this indicator function in the following way. So let's take the effect of potential. Let's rescale it with the parameter lambda, scalar lambda positive. We differentiated it with respect to the scaling parameter and we let the scaling parameter to be one. So basically what I'm doing here is I'm taking the equation of relative equilibrium and I'm multiplying it by x. I'm multiplying it by x, dot product in Rn, dotted product with Rn, and I can come up with a function now, scalar function. So this is a scalar function. Okay. Now, I want to minimize my energy functional under the constraint task that w is zero. Observe here that Observe here that relative equilibria, they necessarily in this class. Okay, so this class here, W equal to zero, is a much larger class than R is. So I'm minimizing my energy along this class. Okay? And a priori, there is no reason for this minimum to be finite. And indeed, if you take the Newtonian potential, this infimum is negative infinite. is negative infinity and you can think about negative infinity as as um um as bodies at at infinity at rest and at infinity you can think of it like that good so base it now on this variational characterization of this now this is this is just the number this is the threshold number okay base it on this so we can construct we can easily So we can construct, we can easily construct invariant sets for the dynamic for each fixed angular momentum. And we showed with Diancia a couple of years ago, or maybe a little bit more, that the sign, the sign of this scatter function will dictate the fate of the solution. Okay? So, what we wonder with So, what we wonder with Ling Chun is: can we extend this to quasi-homogeneous potential? So, the motivation here is not just purely mathematical, but we wanted to study more physical and realistic potentials. So what we have in mind is the Newtonian one, and we know that for the Newtonian one, this value is negative infinity. Okay. But we said, Okay, but we said, okay, what if we correct this mutinian potential with the strong potential? Can we carry our point of view to this to this to this more realistic models? So this is the motivation. Okay, so let's start by the Kepler problem, quasi-homogeneous Kepler problem. Okay, so this is completely integrable. Completely integrable model. So, what I'm saying is not new. But the point of view, I want you to bear with me with the point of view. So, let's rewrite the Kepler problem using polar coordinates. R is modulus of x. X is the difference between the position, Moon, Earth. And theta is the angle. So, this is polar coordinates. And the second equation is nothing but a And the second equation is nothing but the conservation of the angular momentum. Okay, so the total energy can be re-expressed as phi. And so we can rewrite the energy like this. Now, what is the effective potential? The effective potential is this quantity here. Okay, now let's rescale the effective potential and define our indicator function. Okay. Indicator function. Okay, so I want you to see this indicator function. How does it look like for the Kepler problem? Okay, so a few observations. So first, if we take a solution, which I don't know the fate yet, then which has an angular momentum C, phi, then the energy is bigger than the value of the effective potential. Than the value of the effect of potential, and another key observation is that the effect of potential is monotonic with respect to c. If you increase c, the effect of potential decreases. So it's standing. Good. Now let me show you what is our indicator function. So you do the computation, you end up with this function here, WC. Okay? So now we can divide the whole. We can divide the whole Kerala problem with quasi-homogeneous potential into five cases. Okay, so five cases are the following, depending on the powers A and the power B. So the first two cases is when both A and B are bigger than two. We will call this a strong, strong potential. Okay? So we do have two strong potential. Have two strong potentials here. The opposite term is when both the powers, when both powers are less than two, we will count this as the weak potential. Okay, now you can imagine when we have in between. So one is strong, one is weak. Think of Mani, think of Schwarzschild. Then in these two cases, In these two cases, so what we show is that exactly that this case is exactly like the strong homogeneous case. In the sense that we can classify the dynamic, based it on, below this threshold energy E star, based it on the sign of the indicator function only. Okay, however, if the two potentials are weak, Are weak, then we cannot implement that? That's like the Newtonian case. Now, if you have a mixture between strong and weak potential, then the momentum, the angular momentum plays a role. So there is a threshold of the angular momentum, there is a threshold value beyond which we can classify the dynamic based on the indicator function. function okay so now these are three cases one strong strong weak weak strong weak and the two limiting cases is when you have one weak and the other one is critical critical means equals to two and or the other critical case is when when a is critical and b is strong critical answer okay so So, our point of view in this case, in these two cases, gives partial result. And in order to complete all the phase space, we need we use the integrability. Okay. So let me now explain what is the idea. Okay. So this is the case of strong, strong case, strong, strong potential. So our So, our effective potential, this is the graph of our effective potential. As you can see, our effective potential has a critical point. And this critical point corresponds to the relative equilibrium. And if you take an energy less than this, as you can see here, so there are two cases. So, if I draw this line here, sorry, then there are two. Sorry, then there are two cases: either we are in this regime, which means collision, or we are in this regime, which means global existence. And now, how to distinguish between this region and this region is the indicator function that differentiates between the two sides. Now, if you look to the phase space, so this relative equilibria here corresponds to hyperbolic point here. Point here. And here, so the energy, all this energy is less than the energy of this hyperbolic point. You can see here, so we have a finite time collision at both minus and plus time. So this is the case when we have strong strong. The key thing is that we have a critical point for the effective potential, and as long as we have Factor potential, and as long as we have a critical point, then we can implement this indicator function technique. Indeed, you can subdivide this part of the phase space. So, if you take energy less than this critical energy, angular momentum bigger than constant C, C is arbitrary here, fix it. So, if W is the indicator function is non-negative, Non-negative, then we have global existence. If this indicator function is negative, then we have finite time condition. And so the equivalent way is to say that we are in this region or in this region. Good. Now, so these are examples of construction of invariant set based on energy method. Now, if you have Now, if you have a strong and weak potential, so this is the case when we have B bigger than two, but A less than two. Okay, so you can see that there is a threshold value of the angular momentum. This is the threshold value, C star. It's explicit constant that we have it explicit. Explicit. And if the angular momentum is beyond that, then again we have two critical points. So this one and this one, two critical points. So two relative equilibrium. And if C is less than this threshold C, we don't have a critical point. So and again, if you take energy lens, then you can classify the dynamic, right? Dynamic, right? So, we can what we can do is to classify the dynamic up to this threshold. So, this is the phase space again when the angular momentum is larger than this critical value and is less here. So, there is no critical point here. And here we have this center and we have another critical point here. Point here. Good. So in this case, so this is how to construct our invariant sets. So V plus is this value here. This value here. Okay. Okay. So, as I said, if we take angular momentum bigger than this threshold, then we can classify using the indicator function. And if not, then we basically integrate the equation. Okay. And so we have a table where we summarize all the cases and all. All the cases and all scenarios. And you can see, so we can implement our point of view in all these cases. The remaining cases, when we don't have a critical point, then we need to integrate the equation basically. Good. So this is the simple model where we have an integrable equation. So now let's move to more complicated models. Move to a more complicated model, which is the Hills-Tuna problem. So, Hill's problem, as I said, so it was derived rigorously by Mayer from the three-body problem using symplectic scaling. So, together with Yang Xia Deng, so we generalize this to strong homogeneous potentials. We generalize this derivation and using And using the same point of view, this indicator function, it's more complicated than the Kepler problem, but still we could implement our point of view and we could classify the dynamic below the threshold energy. Okay, so we want to do the same thing when we have quasi-homogeneous potential. Good. So, first, we want to derive the equation of motions using the point of view of Mayer and myself and Tank for homogeneous strong potentials. So, we had to make an extra assumption at some point. So, we wanted to match the match the powers in the scale. Powers in the scaling, simplify the scaling argument. And we made the assumption that the A potential is more relevant in the sense of thinking this of the RB potential as a correction. Okay. Good. So once we have that, We have that, so we can include Schwarzschild and Mel. Now, the other thing, the other difference with respect to the homogeneous case is that when we choose a rotating frame, in the homogeneous case, we can normalize the frequency of the rotation to be one, right? However, when we have WASI homogeneous potentials, this is no longer true. And we have to keep this angular velocity here omega. Good. So once we do this derivation, alamea, then we end up with the equation of motions that are in this equation number nine. This equation number nine. Okay. Okay, so what is V? V is the potential, the new potential. So it is like that. And here we have constant C epsilon. And we have the constant that depends on the frequency omega. Okay. So what is C epsilon? C epsilon is the very large constant. And what is epsilon? Epsilon is the ratio of the The ratio of the masses of the masses, and it's intended to be very small when you take the mass of the mole divided by the mass of the earth. So you get a very large constant here. Okay, now what is the energy? The energy is the kinetic energy plus this potential energy for this Hills-Lunar problem. Hills to the problem with quasi-homogeneous potential. Good. So let's define our indicator function. Okay. So we do exactly the same thing. We take the potential, right? We rescale it, and then we set that we differentiate with respect to the scaling parameter, and we set the parameter to be one. We get this scalar function. And then let's look to the Jacobi. And then let's look to the Jacobi, Lagrange-Jacobi identity in this case. So we take the moment of inertia, we differentiate it twice. So we get this now function that is a function of not only the position x, y, but also that depends on the velocity x dot and y dot. Okay, so now we have two functions, the indicator function w and w Indicator function w and the sine of k, which will be extremely important to prescribe the fate of solutions. Okay. So let's so let's assume that we have one weak potential and one strong. Can we, the question that we ask it: can we classify the dynamic basically? Okay. Okay, so the answer. So, the original idea, you may ask me, how did we come up with this indicator function? So, this indicator function have been extensively used in PDs, where you don't have only one indicator function, but you have infinitely many, basically, because the PDE have a family of scaling. Good. Good. So now let's narrow my main goal. My main goal is to classify the dynamic when I have a weak and a strong potential. And we will be able to do this as long as the frequency omega is sufficiently large. Okay? So let me tell you why. Why is the reason is exactly the same? The reason is exactly the same read. Okay, so if you take large frequency omega, you look to your effective potential, you find that it has two critical points. So there are two RE's here, this one and this one. Okay, however, if omega is not too large, then there is no critical point, as you can see here. No critical point of the Here, no critical point of the vector potential, so we cannot implement our point of view in this case. Okay, and there is hope to implement our point of view in this case. Now, you see this green curve here. This green curve corresponds to W. I'll do the curve. I keep changing the notation. So, this is, yeah, this, this one, this green one. Is k equal to zero. Okay. Good. Okay. Now, can we define ground state threshold? Okay, so we take the energy. This is the energy. I minimize it under the constraint that my indicator function is zero. And yes. And yes, this minimum exists and it's finite as long as my frequency is bigger than this explicit constant here. Okay. And it is not only that, but this threshold, this minimizer, it's achieved at two critical points with zero velocity, gamma zero plus minus. Okay, now this is not. Now, this is not the only thing that would dictate the fate. The other thing is this function k, which appears in Lagrange-Jacobi identity. So we would like to recharacterize our Lagrange points using also this functional, this function k. And indeed, we can show that the same threshold, it can be achieved under the It can be achieved under the constraint, the relaxed constraints, W is non-positive, K is non-negative. Okay? Good. Now we are in a very good setup where we can classify the dynamic. So let me show you how to construct invariant sets with predicted dynamic. So let's take the part of phase space. Part of phase space in which the energy is less than this explicit number here. So this number is explicit. We have it. So we consider all initial data with energy less than that explicit number. And W plus plus is whenever K, both K and W are negative. W plus minus K is negative, W is. plus minus k is negative w is still positive and then we have these four subsets okay good so now what we show and you can ask also what happens at the energy of the ground state itself okay so this is what we call w tippa so the energy is exactly at the energy of the ground state itself okay so what we should So, what we showed, so forget about W minus plus. So, this set is empty. Nothing to prove that. It's just as a bike. The two identities are not compatible. Okay. But W plus and W minus minus are non-empty, and all initial data in W plus lead to global solutions. Solutions or initial data in W minus, they lead to finite time synchronous solutions. Okay, and we can do the same when the energy is equal to the energy of the ground state. Good. So the last thing we wanted to understand is what happened at the collision. Happened at the collision or near collision when we have strong force homogeneous lunar compound. So now let's forget about let's forget about the sub potential. We are near the collision, so the most important term, the most important potential is the one with greatest power. Okay? Okay, so this is Heller's donor problem rewritten in this way. And then this is our energy. And we will implement here basically Mackey transform. Okay. Sorry, Slim, the time is over, but you can continue some mute. You have you need more time. This is the time. It's fine. Let me conclude. Yes, please. Yeah, let me just conclude. So, what we are able to do in this case, so we want we can classify the configuration at the blow-up time or the collision time. So, the angular momentum will show that the angular momentum converges to some fixed number, C star. number C star and therefore the configuration is either asymptotic to this explicit behavior if C star is zero we don't know if C star is zero or not it's and if C star is non-zero then we have this explicit configuration okay and to conclude so as long as we have strong component in our Strong component in our potential, then we can implement this point of view and get the dynamic more organized. We can study near collision dynamic. So, there are pros and cons of this method. It's simple, it's explicit, and collision sets are collision uh collision sets are expressed in in original coordinates right there is we didn't do any change of coordinates and the cons is that the energy method applies as long as the potential contains strong strong component or in different different way to say that as long as our effective potential has a critical point okay um just few words about what happens if we go beyond this threshold Go beyond this threshold is taught. So the dynamic becomes much more rich, but also much more complicated because it's hard to avoid the existence of heteroclinic orbits. At least we tried, but we failed. So this is something that we have done if we are slightly above this critical threshold, okay, but going beyond that. Going beyond that, I don't know how to do that. And the other future plan is to perform a collision study on the quasi-homogeneous Hebsilon block. Thank you so much. Thank you. Questions, comments? Let me see. Yes, Ernesto. Yes. Ernesto, are you going or sorry? I thought that Ernesto was to ask a question, no? No, no, perhaps someone online. I know. Yes. Well, a question is: what happened if question is what happens if A and B have different signs? It's one question. And also the results are what happen if A and B are both negative this kind of A and B. Repulsive forces. The results are working. Yeah, I think there are a few cases where we can implement this method, but they're definitely not in full generation. But definitely not in full generality. Right. Yeah. Okay. I do have some comments. So in the 90s, Florine Diaco actually promoted this problem and the quasi-homogeneous problem was the subject of my thesis, as you could see in the bibliography. But the approach there was different. So it's basically the problem, the quasi-homogeneous to body problem is regularized. To body problem is regularized from the beginning with the McGee coordinates, and then you know, it's just basically shaved all cases and including the measure, you know, positive, zero measure, whatever, all stuff there. So sleep knows this because we yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean, as I said, for the Kepler problem, nothing is in you in terms of results, but the point of view seems to be homogeneous, yes. Yeah, it seems to me the point of view, uh, hopefully will give results. Of you, uh, hopefully, will give results for the higher dimensions. Although it is related to Steven Smal's work, Topology and Mechanics. It's 1971. There are two papers where he links dynamics to the energy-momentum map, and that's what is used currently for classifying invariant regions in the phase. Variance regions in the phase space, but anyhow, that's that's more like a geometric view, let's say. Okay, so yeah, anyhow, but yeah, I wanted to bring Florine in the thank you, Christina. Thank you. Yeah, there you go. Okay, I agree. Okay, more questions? Okay, otherwise, we thank you. Okay, Druwais, we thank Slim again. Thank you so much. See you tomorrow then. Yes, okay. Nice to see you. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
