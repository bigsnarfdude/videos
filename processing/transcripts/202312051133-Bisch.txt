Right, it works. So the players in my talk are subfectors, right? This is a conference about subfactors and fusion categories. It's about time that a subfactor actually appears. What is a subfector? Well, it's an inclusion of 21 factors with finite John's index. And we just focus on the so-called hyperfinite 21 factor, which is the unique 21 factor that can be written as a union of finite-dimensional sista algebras, which, as we have heard in previous talk, actually. Which, as we have heard in previous talk, are just multi-matrix algebras, right? And so, where does subfactors make contact to fusion categories? Well, it's through what's called a standard invariant. The standard invariant you should think about as, since we are mostly category people here, as being the homespaces of the standard representation of a subvector, which is just M completed in the trace that the subvector comes canonically with as a Hilbert space that carries a. As a Hilbert space that carries a left n and a right m action. So it's an M by module. And you just do the usual game, you take tensor powers of this, you know, and it's convert gradient, you decompose into irreducibles, and you get a whole bunch of home spaces. And these home spaces in operator algebra world are called higher relative commutants, or just the commutants of N in MK and of M in Mk. So there's an operator algebra way of thinking about them. And there are two notions that I will need for the There are two notions that I will need for the sequel of the talk. One is the notion of a principal graph. The principal graph is just the fusion graph that you get by taking the standard representation of the subvector and decomposing it into irreducibles. And then take an irreducible, tensor it with the standard representation and decompose it into irreducibles. And this graph tells you how to do this. And of course, you have to do this for NN and MN bimodules. So you get two graphs that every subfactor. Two graphs that every sub vector comes with. They are obviously an invariant for the sub vector. And if the corresponding category of bimodules that you generate using this standard representation is fusion, then which is equivalent to saying that these graphs are finite, then we call a subfector finite depth. And another term that's important is this notion of irreducibility. A subfector is called irreducible if this representation of the subfactor is irreducible. The sub vector is irreducible as an NM by module, which is the same as saying that there is no intertwine of an NMN by except the identity. All right, so that's my subfector slide. And well, as I just said, there is this connection to category theory by thinking about these higher rate of comutants as homospaces of a certain C-star tensor category. And of course, there is also the planar algebra way of thinking about the standard invariant. Of thinking about the standard invariant of a subfactor, right? That's more like the diagrammatic way that you guys in categories area are used to thinking about the categories. And that goes back to Born's formulatorial description of the standard environment for subfactor using planar tangles. And I'm not going to say much about it except using it all the time. One particular type of subfactor I want you to pay attention to, that's the one. To pay attention to, that's the one where the fusion graphs are not finite but infinite. And they are the coxswain-Dinkling graphs of type A infinity. I'm going to call such a subfactor A infinity subfactor. And in that case, the category is just the Temporal Leap category, right, that you are probably familiar with, with the loop parameter given by the square root of the index. We take it to be equal than 2 to get A infinity. And in subfactor terms, what that means is that. Terms, what that means is that the in the Twiner spaces are as small as they get. So they contain just the so-called temporary leaf-Schoen's algebras, and in fact, they are equal. These algebras are always contained in here, and when they are equal, then the symmetry is minimal. And we sometimes also say it's a subfect of this trivial standard invariant. Of course, it's far from trivial, right? It's the Temple and Lieb algebras that are there. All right, so this is what I will call A-infinity subfect. What I will call A infinity subfector in this talk. Now, yesterday we were talking about open problems. There are many open problems in subfector theory, and probably one of the biggest open questions is, you know, what are actually all hyperfinite sub vectors where the Jones index is small. Small, for the purpose of this talk, will be less or equal than 5.25. And it turns out that this is a really hard question because the standard invariant for most of the sub-factors with index between Most of the subvectors with index between 4 and 5 will do nothing for us. And the representation theory of the sub vector is trivial. And so we will need some additional invariants. And this is due to a lack of amenability, for those of you who know what I'm talking about. So this is a hard question. And then the second question has been open since Vaughan's original paper on index of sub vectors. What are all the indices of hyperfinite sub vectors with trivial relative commutator? Is trivial relative Commutant. And the trivial relative Commutant condition, so the irreducibility of the L2 of MSNM bimodule is crucial. If you drop this, then it's known that every number because appears here. But as soon as you require irreducibility, this is wide open. Now, for index lesser equal than 4, the story is well known, has been completed by the mid-90s. That's the famous ADE classification of subfectors. ADE classification of subfectors. There are countably many non-isomorphic subfectors. You can always realize them in the hyperfinite world. And there are only two that have infinite depth in index 4. These are the ones with principle graph A infinity or D infinity. And there is John's rigidity, as you know. The index has to be of the form 4Ï€ over n or 4. So this is a story that a lot of people worked on for a long time, but it's completely known today. Now, the more recent story. Now, the more recent story, something that happened maybe in the last 15 years, is we also have a complete classification of standard invariants or categories, if you like, that come from subfactors up to index 5.25. And these are just amazing results by many hands. Some of them are in the audience here. Basically, everybody who has ever worked on subfactors has worked on this or that project or both. And, you know, so the upshot is, and I will. So the upshot is, and I will get back to this in a minute, that there are only about a dozen finite depth subvectors at indices between 4 and 5.25, and everybody else is A infinity except one subvector. So why is this interesting? Well, so let's look at all the possible numbers that are indices of finite depth sub vectors that lie. That lie in this small interval from 4 to 5.25, right? And it turns out there are just nine numbers. 4 is, of course, the first one. But then the first interesting one is 5 plus root 13 over 2. That's the index of the famous Hagrux subfector. And then the other one I want to focus attention to is 5 plus root root 17 over 2. That's the Azaeda Haggruck subfactor. And there's a few more. This is sort of a very interesting. This is sort of a very interesting story in itself, right? At each of these nine numbers, something really interesting happens. There's a nice fusion category that appears. In fact, several sometimes. So there are only nine indices, but there's about 12 or 14 subfactors that actually happen at these indices. So the question that I was wondering is: are there actually also subfectors with trivial standard invariant that have this indices? So in other words, can I somehow Indices. So, in other words, can I somehow destroy the symmetry but keep the index? This is a relevant question for the problem to determine, to try to determine all possible indices of subfectors of the higher finite one factor that are irreducible. So, because the conjecture, my conjecture would be that indeed you can probably realize all cognites of hyperfinite irreducible sub vectors through a infinity sub vector. So, if you ever want to determine. You ever want to determine that set, right? You can focus on A infinity subfactors. And of course, the other question is that's also wide open: what can be said about these A infinity subfactors? Because the standard invariant doesn't say anything about them. Which of them are isomorphic? The category or the planar algebra way will not help you much. Okay, so how do we construct sub vectors? Well, there is a very classical way of doing There is a very classical way of doing that, and this is a concept that goes back to Popper before subvectors. It's this notion of a commuting square. And what is a commuting square? Well, it's just a quadrilateral of inclusions of multi-matrix algebras such that the inclusions are connected. That just means the center of this algebra intersected with the center of that algebra is just all complex numbers. Or equivalently, if you think about the Brundley diagrams that give you the inclusions of the multi-matrix algebra. The inclusions of the multi-matrix algebra, then they should be connected graphs, connected by party graphs. And what is this commuting square property? Well, the commuting square property is the following. So we fix a trace on the largest algebra, and so we can think then of the largest algebra as a Hilbert space, where the inner product is given by the trace. And Commebulus squared just means if you project an operator from here down to here going this way around, then it's the same as projecting the other way around. Projecting the other way around, which is why we call it a commuting square. Now, in terms of orthogonality properties, you can reformulate it by saying that the orthogonal complement of that algebra in here is orthogonal to the orthogonal complement of the smallest algebra in this one, right, with respect to the product given by the trace. So, this already looks like a much more complicated property, as you know, and it's a property that's hard to actually construct. Construct. But the upshot is coming squares actually are really interesting. They were interesting many years ago, you know, just for the construction of exotic subfectors. But more recently, they have sort of come back into fashion by work of Yasu. Yasu found a really nice connection of commuting squares to topological order gap Hamiltonians, tensor networks, and so on. And go to Yasu's talk if you want to hear more about it. Then these commuting squares play a role. These communications play a role in what Jeffy and you in their group called one-fourier analysis. And then David and Jamie Victory did some very nice work a few years back by now, right? Where they used commuting squares to construct quantum error correcting codes. So that's another really interesting application. Alright, so just to give you a quick example, the simplest commuting square is the The simplest commuting square is the one that comes from the so-called spin model commuting square. But the smallest algebra is just the complex numbers. The largest is the n by n matrices. The trace that we fix on the algebra is just the matrix trace. And then the two off-diagonal algebras are just C plus C plus C, right? The diagonal matrices. And one of them is twisted by a unitary. And then you can check as an exercise that this forms a community square precisely when this unitary is. Precisely when this unitary is what's called a complex Valdemar matrix, i.e., satisfies this condition. Now, each such Homini square, and we'll explain it in a minute, gives rise to a subfect of the high or finite one factor that's irreducible and has Jolen's index n. And to this day, these are totally mysterious. We do not understand them at all. We don't know what the sub vectors are. Anyway, so how do we construct a sub vector from a commuter square? Subvector from a commuting square, so I'm going to call it a commuting square sub vector. Well, by taking the commuting square, we want to have a nice one, so we want it to be non-degenerate, which means that these two algebras, the product of these two algebras and the linear span is actually the largest algebra. This can be reformulated in terms of properties on the inclusion graphs, but let me not say that right now. And so, what you do is you just do the Jones basic construction for the top inclusion. That gives you a That gives you an orthogonal projection from here to here. Then you look at the algebra that that orthogonal projection plus the algebra A11 generates, and you call that algebra A12. That's another finite dimensional algebra. Then you can do the same thing down here. You take that orthogonal projection, you throw it into the algebra A01, you look at the algebra that it generates, and you get what's called A02. And in fact, it turns out that this is automatically the basic construction for the lower inclusion, right? Construction for the lower inclusion, right? That's under this non-degeneracy condition. Alright, and then you can iterate this construction, and then at the end, you get a union of finite-dimensional algebras, right? You take the closure, you get a Voneuman algebra in the B-corporial topology, and you end up with hyper-finite Voneuman algebras. Now, if these graphs are connected, this will be factors, okay, so they will have trivial center, and you can compute their indices. The indices will just be the squares. Indices, the indices will just be the square norms of these matrices, or if you like, the paraphorbenis eigenvalue of H transpose of K transpose, which are the same. And you can also do this, of course, going vertically. You get a vertical subfector and a horizontal subfactor. So each commuting square gives rise to two subfactors. And well, then the question is: well, okay, now we got subfactors of the hyperfinite torn vector, so they give rise to some C star tensor category, right? What is C-star tensor category, right? What is it? So, in order to compute the C-star tensor category, you have to compute these homespaces of the corresponding bimodules or the higher relative commutants. And this is the result to Ognianu, that this can in principle be done. So if you take the commutant of this guy in the n sky over here, then you can compute that by computing the commutant of A01 in the n sky over here. So it's just a finite-dimensional problem, right? So if a system of linear Solve a system of linear equations and you're done. So, in principle, this completely solves the problem, but of course, in practice, it doesn't, because the number of unknowns grows exponentially, and you just cannot even carry out these examples, even in the Hademar case. So, for spin-model subfluxes, it's impossible to compute this. All right, so, but it's a finite-dimensional problem, right? So, constructing a commuting square consists of finding four appropriate graphs and find And find what's called a bi-unitary connection on them. And a bi-unitary connection is just a block diagonal, two block diagonal unitaries whose entries are related using the parent-Fogenian states on the graph. So it's some crossing identity that the entries have to satisfy. And in practice, what that gives you is a condition on the absolute values of the entries of your unitary matrix. And you have to solve the problem whether you can find a unitary. You can find a unitary, so whether you can find complex phases, you know, that allows you to compute the matrix consisting of the absolute values to a unitary matrix. So it's a problem like a problem that appears in physics when you try to compute S matrices. Now, this is in general quite hard. It's sort of similar to computing 6J symbols. But it's even harder to compute the corresponding C-star tensor category that the subject gives. And so my goal. And so, my goal in this project that I was working on is to find a couple of tricks that would allow me to do that without doing any calculations whatsoever. And well, so the first trick that we found to do this is a version of graph planar algebraic padding. And so this is a project I've been working on with another student of mine, Julio Caceres, who is on the job market this year. So if you have a job, hire him. And so there are many versions of the graph plan algebra embedding theorem out there. Ours is closest to the original one by Jones and Pennys. And it's a little bit more general. And let me describe it briefly. So it turns out that whenever you're given a finite graph, it doesn't have to be finite, connected, and so on, well, then there is a graph planar algebra that's associated to it. And how do you do it? Well, clearly, as a vector space, you just look at loops. Space, you just look at loops of length 2n on the graph that are based at the vertices. So, in the bipartite case, we have even at odd vertices, right? So, you get two flavors of vector spaces here, the even and odd ones, the plus and the minus ones. Now, these loops are, of course, matrix units, so this is in secret actually a star algebra, right? And then what Wohl discovered is that you can define an action of the planar opera, so on planar tangles on these. Opera, so on planar tangles on these vector spaces, and that gives you a C-star planar algebra called the graph planar algebra, which is, however, in general not a sub-vector planar algebra, but some other planar algebra. Okay, and so what Julio and I proved is that if you start with a commuting square and you look at the horizontal and the vertical subfector, well then the graph planar algebra, sorry, the subvector planar algebra, let's say of the horizontal subfector over here. Horizontal subject over here embeds into the graph planar algebra of the first vertical graph in the community square, and then of course similarly for the other. And you know, this is no matter whether this subfactor has finite depths or not. This works for infinite depths problems. And this can be done, you know, it's kind of straightforward, elementary, pedestrian way to do it. So you use opening ion compactness. So first of all, you notice that the graph planar. The graph lanar algebra lives on the commutants of A00 and AN0 and A10 and AN0, so this inclusion of vector spaces. And then the higher rate of commutants of the sub vector are just sub spaces of this inclusion here, right? And so all you need to check is that the planar opera definition from the sub vector planar, from the graph planar algebra, when restricted to this sub-inclusion, is the one that. Sub-inclusion is the one that comes from the subinclusion, right? That and the hardware. This is actually explicitly down to earth. Okay, and so why is this useful? Well, this is useful because of a fairly recent result of Grossman, Morrison, Pennyson, Peterson, Snyder, who identified all the graphs into whose graph-planar algebra the sub-vector-planar algebra, finite depth sub-vector can embed. Namely, they have to be certain. Namely, they have to be certain module graphs of a C star category, that is a module category over the fusion category associated to the finite depth subfactor. And so the graph has to be a fusion graph of a particular object with respect to that sort of mathematical category. And you know, this has to be around pivotal and few adjectives. But I mean, it's a one-to-one correspondence. I mean, it's a one-to-one correspondence. And what's really nice about this theorem is that it allows me to use algebra to compute all these graphs. And so what's the idea then? Well, the idea to construct new subfectors is start with your finite depth subfectors, compute all the module graphs. That gives you all allowed embeddings of the subfactor planar algebra into graph planar algebras, right? And then try to construct a commuting square that doesn't. Construct a commuting square that doesn't use any of these graphs, and then you know it has to be infinite depth. And if you are lucky, then by classification, you know it's a infinite. And so that's the idea, and that's what we have worked on. There's one little snag here, which is you also want irreducibility of the sub vector, right? Now that fortunately is easy. There is a nice criterion by Hans Wensel, goes back to the 80s, you know, and he showed that if one of the graphs that you use in One of the graphs that you use in the community where it has a vertex that's connected to only one other vertex, then in fact the subfactor is reduced. So that's actually easy to verify. And so let's try to do this. And the first index for which we want to do this is, of course, 5 plus root 13 over 2. And it turns out that the solution was actually already in the literature, except nobody knew it, right? But with our theorem, we now know that there isn't any. We now know that there is an A infinity subfactor with index 5 plus root zones over 2. So, how does this go? Well, Emily Peters and Grossman Snyder have computed all possible module graphs. Let me just call them module graphs for this particular subfector planar algebra. These are principal graphs of the R-group subvector plus what's called a Broom. And these are all the module graphs. So, hence, using our strategy, all we need to do is construct a commuting square Paislet. Construct a commuting square based on a graph whose square norm is 5 plus root 13 over 2, right? Which is not one of these. And so, you know, we looked in the thesis of John Scow, right? So this is actually a result that goes back to Hargrove and Scow back in the 90s. They have constructed such a communist based on this particular graph, where the horizontal inclusions are given by these two graphs. And hence, you know, you get a sub-factor that's irreducible with index 5 plus root t. That's irreducible with index 5 plus root 13 over 2, except they didn't know what subfactor they were getting, right? But it turns out that Emily actually, for some weird reason, had already proven using planar algebra methods that the subfector planar algebra of the high group sub vector does not embed into the graph plane algebra of that particular graph. And so hence the corollary using our graph plane algebra embedding theorem is that there is a subfect of the hyperfinite q1 coming from this computing square, right? Coming from this computing square, right? So you take the horizontal sub vector, and that one has the right index, and it must have an infinity principle graph because there are no other infinite depth sub vectors with index between 4 and 5. So that solves the problem for 5 plus root 13 over 2. Well, then we said, okay, let's do 5 plus root 7dn over 2. Does the strategy work? And well, unfortunately, there was no list of module graphs in the literature, so we actually had to compute. In the literature, so we actually had to compute those. And this can be done using methods of Victor, they go back to Victor, and of course, Grossman Snyder, who have developed all kinds of combinatorial tools to do that. And we find 14 graphs. So there are two, these are the two principal graphs, and there are these other graphs, which are modular graphs for the Azaeda High group subfector. And so if we wanted to construct a commuter square whose, you know that is an A infinity subfactor with the right index, we need Infinity subfactor with the right index, we need to base it on a graph that's not one of these. So it turns out there's a ton of graphs that have norm 5 plus root 17 over 2. And we tried a lot, and a lot did not work. And so we tried to build community squares that are kind of simple. So the problem with a commuting square is you always have four graphs, right, with which you have to play. And so two of the graphs are the ones that you picked, right? But the other two you have no idea what to take, right? You have no idea what to take, right? And so typically, what you try is polynomials in G transpose and G transpose G to get a non-degenerate commuter square. But, you know, so we can show for a long list of graphs that it can not ever work. Now, eventually, we found one that works, and Julio did really the heavy lifting on this one. We call this one the double broom for obvious reasons, right? And this has the right norm, and I guess this should be probably a transpose here. I guess there should be Bureau transposed here. But the graphs H and K that we found here, they are really weird. So they have sort of nothing to do with GG transposed, but they work. And so as a result, we get a commuter square built on this graph, and the resulting irreducible hymofinite subfector has to be A infinity using classification hyperfraction. Alright, so we got a bit tired of doing this for every single subfactor, so we were thinking of a second trick. Thinking of a second trick. And the second trick that we use is try to compute commuting squares that carry a one-parameter family of non-equivalent connections. And well, it turns out that this could actually be done. So I knew that such a family exists for the 3 plus plus 3 sub vector. And so the idea was to kind of try to see whether this works for other 4 stars and stuff, like this is for the 4 star. And those of you who have seen me talking about this in Tokyo, I didn't have quite as many. Tokyo, I didn't have quite as many, right? Those two were not part of the list, but you can do those now too. So all of these graphs carry, so we could build community squares where all four graphs are the same, right? It's one of these graphs, G and G transpose. And we can show that there's a one-parameter family of non-equivalent connection on G, G transpose, where G is one of these. And so, you know, so how does this help us? Well, it turns out that this. It turns out that this graph and this graph here are principal graphs of subfectors. This is actually Pennys Morrison, and I guess Izumi, independently, who realized this graph as a principal graph of the subfector. This is GHJ. And so for these two graphs, it actually follows from Oknanu rigidity that some of the subfactors that you get from this one parameter family of community squares has to be infinity because at most there's most finite. Because at most there are most finitely many flat connections on each pair of graphs. Now, by the way, our theorem that I stated for just these particular graphs actually holds in general for any four-star with two pairwise legs of equal length. I know you're going to get irreducibility, but you have equal outfits Catalan too, right? Well, oh, or that. Sorry. Thank you, I was just listening to you. So I know that we get infinite depths, but I don't know whether it's the Infinite depths, but I don't know whether it's the Fusskatternan one that Bon and I construct. So there are two infinite depth subfactor at 3 plus square root of 5 positive. One could be A infinity, and we know that A3, 3 product, A4, one exists. Now what about the other indices? So one thing I want to point out, one of these indices here is 5, right? It's an integer index. And so this graph has index 5, so it's a one-parameter family of connections on that one. Well, fortunately, young. Fortunately, Yasu about a year ago proved the theorem that helps us out here. Namely, he proved that if you have a fixed finite depth subfactor, then there's at most countably many communicative squares that will approximate that subfactor. So since we have a one-parameter family, we know that for some of these parameters, we must get A-infinity subfactors by classification, because there are no other infinite-depth subfactors at these units, right? It's either finite depth. Sequences, right? It's either finite depths or if it's infinite depths, it has to be A infinity. And so, in particular, you know, we get, as far as I know, the first A infinity subfector with integer index to this. I don't think anything is known. So, this is the first known hyperfinite A infinity subfector with an integer index of the four. And of course, you know, if you have listened to what I said, we have now produced two A infinity subfectors in two different Two A infinity subfactors in two different ways with index 5 plus root 17 over 2, right? One was the module graph way of doing that, and the other one was this one parameter family of connections way. And of course, the obvious question is, are they isomorphic? They cannot be. They cannot. But how do you prove that? And of course, the similar question we have for all the other graphs. So all these four stars, with two equal x, we have with two. These two legs of equal lengths, pairwise equal, pairwise legs of equal lengths, right? Do they carry a one-parameter family of connections? Which of these subfactors, HD subfields that we get are small signatures almost? So this is a project I'm working on with Google at the moment. There's lots of interesting stuff, right? Ultimately, you know, this is a question about the space of bimodules of the hyperfinite 21 factor, right? You know, how Right? You know, how complicated can it be? How connected is it? You know, can you have continuous deformations of bimonnes and that kind of stuff? So it's really kind of some topology which is coming. All right, I guess my time is up, so thank you.
