Thank you. Go ahead. Okay, this is joint work with Rick Blue. Oh, that's not work. It's not okay. It doesn't seem to be changing. It clicked into the window. If you click the slide, maybe it'll make the slide active. And then arrow down the using page up and page down work. Ah, there we go. Page up and page down work? Ah, there we go. Okay. Yeah, no, I had to click on the window. I get. Okay. Okay. So this started with an example, the tropical and Arctic semi-rings. And these are two semi-rings on the extended integers. And the additions are the max and the min, and the multiplications are both plus, but we're writing them. But we're writing them, they're written plus one and plus two because of the differences on infinity and minus infinity. So Rick mentioned that this bicategory, the bicategory of Z plus relations, that is functions from Z relation from X to YR is a function from X cross Y to Z plus. And he mentioned this was a locally ordered linear bicategory. And was wondering whether we could do something similar or something with it and get more examples. So, I'm going to talk about two directions we went. One was we characterize all those quantiles Q, such that Q rel is a linear bicategory, where again, Q rel is just the bicategory of Q valued relations as the one cells that is. And then we were looking for a non-locally partially ordered example. Locally partially ordered examples. And we called those Girard bicategories because the Q rel example, well, the Z plus rel example will happen to be a Girard quantiloid. Okay. I did. Do I have to click every time? Oh, I have to click every time on the screen. Okay, so let me remind you of or tell you what a linear. remind you of or tell you what a linear bicategory is. Linear bicategories were introduced by Cockett, Kozlowski, and Seeley. So we have two by category, a linear bicategory has two bicategory structures, which we're denoting by tensor and plus or par. I'll call it plus. It's easier. And they're related by these linearities. So A tensor, the quantity B. Tensor, the quantity B plus C, that you have a natural transformation there to a tensor B in parentheses plus C. And similarly, if you put the plus first inside the parentheses and then the tensor and their naturality and coherence conditions. So we introduced the notion of an L D quantal, L D for linearly distributive. And so first recall that a quantal. And so, first, recall that a quantile is a monoid in the category soup of complete lattices and soup-preserving maps. And it turns out that when Q for a quantile Q, Q rel is a quantiloid, that is a soup enriched category. And we're going to come back to quantiles and quantiloids later. Okay, so an L D quantile is a soup lattice Q with two operations times. times and plus with unit elements each with the property that q times and q a plus are quantals and we have these linearities a times parentheses b plus c is less than or equal to a plus b times c and similarly if you put the plus first and then the times okay so an example of that turns out to be and i won't go through any of the details um the extended entity The extended integers with that plus one and plus two. Now, if Q is an LD quantal, you can use these two inequalities to define operations on Q routes. So if we have R relation from X to Y and S a relation from Y to Z, you can define R tensor S of X Z, a relation from X to Z, as the soup over Y of R of X Y times S of Y Z. Of xy times s of yz. And you can define r plus s of xz as the info for y of r of xy plus s of yz. And the theorem is that if that q times plus is an LD quantal, if and only if q rel times plus is a linear bicategory. So, in particular, what we are doing there is character. What we are doing there is characterizing all the linear bicategories of the form Q rel. So, in the forward direction, you can show that R tensor S plus T is less than or equal to R tensor S plus T as follows. So, first of all, if you take off the soup on the left-hand side, you're looking at R of W X. looking at r of w x times the inf of s of x y plus t of y z. And that's less than or equal to r of w x times the quantity s of x y plus t of y z for all x y and w x y and z. And that's less than or equal to now if you use the from the definition of L D quantal if you use the first Quantal, if you use the first inequality, you can change the parentheses. And now, because the first, the term before the plus, the first term, is less than or equal to the soup, you get the whole thing is less than or equal to soup over x of r w x times s of x y plus t of y z. And then that's less than or equal to the inf over, well, that be y of the whole thing, and that's what the right-hand side is. And that's what the right-hand side is of the r times s in parentheses plus t. Okay, going in the other. Oh, by the way, the other inequality is similar. Going in the other direction, if you have elements a, b, and c, and q, they induce relations from relations from one to one, which I'll call R sub A, R sub B, and R sub C. They're just constant at A, B, and C in Q rel. And C in Q rel. And since R sub A tensor R sub B plus C in parentheses less than or equal to the same thing with the other parentheses, when you plug in what you have, it follows that A times the quantity B sub plus C is less than the quantity of A times B plus C. Okay, and as I said, the other inequalities are similar. Okay, so now a non-post-settle example. So what I'm going to do. Examples. So, what I'm going to do is give a very specific example that turns out generalizes to categories that we are bicategories that we call Gerard by categories. So I'm going to go through some of it for this bicategory of locales, and it will be almost identical. So, I won't go through the details for the general case. Okay, so what is this? Case. Okay, so what is this category of bi-category of locales? The objects are locales. The one cells, a one-cell from X to Y is an XY bimodule. And the two cells are homomorphisms of bimodules. Okay, so if you recall, if you have a one cell, A from X to Y, then A op the soup lattice A. The soup lattice, AOP. Oh, by the way, for locales, I'll just remind people: are quantels in which the operation is meet. Okay. Any case, so we have a soup lattice, AOP, AOP as a soup lattice, and it becomes a bimap. It becomes a bimap module, if you like, because AOP is isomorphic to write mod. The soup lattice of write Y modules from A to Y op. And so that becomes, because A is a left, sorry, A is a right Y module, that becomes a left Y module. And similarly, if you look at X mod, A X op, because A is a left. Left module X module, it becomes a right X module. And you can give explicit definitions of the structure, the left Y and the right X using adjoints, but I'm not going to mention it here. Okay, and then if you take a second bimodule, a YZ bimodule, you can show that A tensor B opt. A tensor B op is isomorphic to a mod YABOP, which is isomorphic to Y mod B A op. Okay, and we'll use those things. So now we define B plus C to be Z mod B op C. Okay, so that would be the definition. And it turns out that you get an You get an associative operation using the fact that Z mod BOP C is isomorphic to C op tensor BOP op. Okay, and the units are Y op and Z op. And then claim is that lock is a linear bicategory. So to define the morphism from A tensor B plus C into A tensor B plus C. plus C into A tensor B plus C, we want to equivalently define a morphism from A tensor Z mod B op C into Z mod mod Y A B op C. And if we look at the transpose, so if we bring the mod Y A B op over to the left, we can use the evaluation at A, and that'll get us into B op tensor Z mod. So Z mod B up C, and then evaluate at B up, and that gets us into C. Okay, and the other linearity is similar. Okay, so now that generalizes. So first of all, we need these mods. So recall that B, a bicategory B is biclosed if it has right extensions and right liftings. And right liftings. The right extensions are these universal one cells together with a two cell from A followed by, and I'm calling it X mod A B here into B. And similarly, mod Y is a universal one cell together with a two cell from mod YAC. mod Y A C followed by A into C. So alternate notation is the lollipop notation. Now, if you look at the identity on X mod AB, that gives rise to, given an A, that gives rise to a morphism I'll call, one cell I'll call delta X A, which goes from mod X, X mod A, D sub X. Oh, so I'm in for B, I'm putting, sorry, let me back up. So given a fan. Sorry, let me back up. So, given a family, these are going to play the roles of the ops. So, given a family of one cells, D sub X from X to X, then if we look at the identity on X mod A D sub X, we get a one cell from A to mod X X mod A D sub X into X. And similarly, if we look at the identity. And similarly, if we look at the identity on y mod or mod y a d sub d sub x d sub x. Sorry, if we look at the identity on y mod a d sub y, we get another more, another one so we'll tell called delta sub a y. Okay. Okay, so the key properties of Key properties of AOP in lock that we used were that this A op is isomorphic to mod Y A Y op, which similarly X mod A X op. So to generalize the construction, we consider on B a B with a family of these one cells with the property that the delta sub x A. Delta sub x a's are all invertible, and that we'll call a dualizing family, and that these more these they're together, and that there's an isomorphism from for every a from mod y a d sub x to x mod A D sub X, which is are compatible with the delta sub A, y. With the delta sub AYs and the delta sub x, and that we'll call a cyclic family. And I'll say what I mean by compatible, at least I'll show you the slide. And then in that case, we define a perp, which is essentially our A op as X mod A D sub X. So here's a slide which shows you the properties we want. And such a family is such a category I'm going to call a Such a category when it calls a derived by category, biclosed with a cyclic dualizing family. And here's the compatibility. And I'm pretty much out of time, so let me just say you prove a lemma that shows that Z mod B perp C is isomorphic to C perp B perp perp and define B plus C to be Z mod B perp C. And exact same proof as Locke. We see that if B is a We see that if B is a Girard bicategory, B is a linear bicategory. And the two examples, the two examples we get from this are the bicategory of quantals, bimodules and homomorphisms, and also the bicategory of quantiloids, pro-functors and transformations. And I think I... Oh, wait, I have a few more minutes, don't I? You have five. I just think I have to finish that quarter. I think I have to finish that quarter off, so I started rushing a little. Okay, so how do we? The way we prove this is the following. It turns out that the category of quant bicategory of quantiles and the bicategory of quantiloids are both bicategories of the form mon B. And actually, this is either mon or mod. I always forget which is which. In any case, the objects of mon B. The objects of MONB are monads, and the morphisms of the one cells are bimodules in a category B. So for quantals, the one object by category soup, this is mon of the one object by category soup, and quantiloids is mon of the bicategory mat, whose objects are matrices in soup. Matrices in soup. And to establish these examples, what we do is prove if B is a Girard bicategory with local equalizers and co-equalizers, which are stable under composition, then so is MonB. So we have a single proof that gives both of these examples. Okay. And Because I rushed them at the references. We have a paper in preparation, which should soon be done. Here's a reference for the Kaki-Kozovsky-Seeley paper and the Q-REL. You can find more about that in the volume on monoidal topology. And then the Joyelle-Tierney paper, where they look at Tierney paper, where they look at locales and bimodules, is actually modules, but is an extension of the Galois Theoretical Grotendieg. And then there's a quantal reference. And also for the by closed by categories, a nice little reference is this paper by street. Okay. Any Any questions? Oh, Peter? Hi, Susan. Hi, Peter. I'm wondering the part that I couldn't quite follow or understand was where you introduced the family of maps DX. Maps DX. Right. Yeah. Sorry, I rushed. Can you give me maybe an example and say explicitly what this family is? Oh, sure. So encode the op, right? But yeah, well, for locales or quantals, what you've got there is the one-cell X-OP, so the soup lattice X-OP. So, the soup lattice X op is an X text by module. Oh, okay. Okay. And what happens in a category where we don't have the op directly available? Do we have so do we have any examples where well that all the examples that we have, I believe, come from. We have, I believe, come from there. I mean, you can do the same thing with any family, but one of the things you run into is, so for example, if you're in, if you look at rings and bimodules, okay, you can just put in anything, we can put in the identity, and you get the linearity condition, but what you don't get is the association. But what you don't get is the associativity. So you get one of these skew monoidal categories instead of monoidal structure. Okay, I see. They can take any family and ask about this. And in fact, pretty much any buy-closed buy category is going to give you something, but you don't get. But you don't get, in fact, the where is it? Oh, this one more back. The by closeness is always going to give you this. The problem is getting something that is actually associative for the plus. Okay, thank you. Awesome. Oh, Robin. Oh, yeah. Right. I just got back from a hike, Susan. So I'm jealous. Yeah, but yeah, yeah. So I'm going to ask a very simple question. So you started off with this example of tropical semi-rings. Yes. Yes, and you said it was so simple that you weren't going to tell us about it. Oh, I didn't say it was so simple, I just wasn't going to tell you. But I wonder whether you can explain this a little bit more to someone. Let's ask Rick too, because this was our starting point. And he came, he contacted me and said, can you generalize this? And that's where it started. So I think Rick is here. Rick, yeah. So, so, Robin, do you agree that so this, can you see my pointer? No. Pointer? No. But if you say, oh, because you want me to point something? So on this second line here, we've got Z plus max and then plus one, right? Those are both quantiles. So therefore, you can form the category, the bicategory Q rel, right? You know, the usual formula where you compose quantile-valued relations and you compose. This isn't ringing a bell. No, I'm. No, I'm okay. So if you give me a quantile and you give me a Q-valued relation is a function from X cross Y to Q. Yep. You compose two of these by multiplying and then taking the soup over the middle variable. Okay. Okay. That is a bicategory, a locally ordered bicategory. So this structure that was on the previous slide. structure that was on the previous slide, the Z plus has two different quantile structures on it. Right. And the two of them are related by a linear distribution as in your linear bicategory paper. Oh, I see. I see. So I guess. And that's what we're doing here with the LD quantals. Okay. I just did not review the composition. Right. So it is this. Right. So is this an example of something which doesn't have duals? Right. Yeah. So this definition, so every Girard Quantal is one of these, right? Right. But this doesn't assume that sort of duality. Okay. So you don't have you don't have duals. The other question I had is one second. Here's the definition of the composition. Yeah. Yeah. So, Robin, we do have examples. So, Robin, we do have examples of where they're not Gerard, and we took your shift monoids, remember from the first one and modified them to get these guys. Okay. Okay. Okay. So the other question is, Jurgen had this construction from a bicategory, which is essentially a sort of glorified two construction, which got you into a linear bicategory. A linear bicategory. I just wondered how what you've done is related to that. Do you remember that stuff? No. No. I'll look it up. Yeah. I think he calls it the Chu construction, right? Okay. Is that in your paper with Kostowski and Seeley or not? Well, there's a reference to it, certainly. To it, certainly, uh, but I don't think he realized at that when he originally wrote it up, he didn't realize it formed a linear bicategory. And uh, okay, we'll take a look at it. Yeah. Okay, thanks. Okay, awesome. Anyone else? We're not short for time if I understand the schedule modification correctly. Christine saying yes. Christine saying yes. Okay, well, if there are no other questions, we'll re-applause Susan. Thanks, Susan. Yeah.
