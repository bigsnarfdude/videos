Hi, so thanks very much for inviting me, even though I uh don't really work on fractons, so but I put fractons in the title, so I hope uh that works, and actually I think it has something to do with it. I hope you will like it. Um and I don't see how to go so we would like that. Okay, so uh first of course the the talk by uh Frank and um already provided some Already provided some introduction to thermalization and so on. But let's just briefly review it, very briefly. So, if you have a time-dependent protocol, right, so for example, you think that you evolve your system with many body Hamiltonians and you alternate between too many body Hamiltonians, then thermodynamic intuition, and that's why this slide is called thermodynamic intuition, dictates that after a while Dictates that after a while you will heat up. And since this is a lattice system where you can actually, the energy is bounded locally, you would expect to heat up to infinite temperature. Okay? Good. So that's what I put here, and that would be my guess always, and I think that's a sound guess. So, and I try to make it a little bit precise here, what it means, this heating up. It means that if you look at loadal operators. It means that if you look at local operators, right, and you consider the time evolution of that local operator, time evolution with this protocol, and then you take time to infinity, then this expectation value will go to the expectation value in the normalized ray state, which is like an infinite temperature state. Okay, and since this I gave this talk previously for mathematicians, I made certain here to first take the limit of volume going. The limit of volume going to infinity, and then, of course, time to infinity, otherwise, it would not be true, strictly speaking. Okay, good. So, but of course, the interesting cases are where this is not true or only true after a very long time. And there is an obvious possible obstruction to this heating up. And the obstruction would be that if this U, well, U I mean just the product of these two rotations. Just the product of these two protocols, right? So that the time evolution is indeed the power of that. If that u has a conserved quantity that is of the form of, let's say, a local Hamiltonian. It's not important here. I use the word Hamiltonian here basically just to say cell of a joint operator that is a sum of local terms. Okay, so it's of course not the Hamiltonian here because that system does not have a single Hamiltonian. So if something like that happens to be true, that you almost have To be true, that you almost have this local conserved quantity. I've said here the error is epsilon small, where this epsilon small should be understood again in a local sense, right? Because of course all these operators scale with the volume, but let's say that this difference is small locally, right? So if that is true, well then you can iterate that, you can go to the nth power, the nth power, that's like going to large time, right? Like going to large time, right? And then you still have almost a conserved quantity. And as long as you feel that conserved quantity, you of course cannot go to this infinite temperature state. Why? Because if you start out with a state that has a value for this quantity that is not the same as the maximal entropy value, right, then because of this, you keep that value. Okay, so that's an obstruction to heating. I'll see that I explained it in a very complicated way. I'll see that I explained it in a very complicated way, but I hope you understand it anyhow. So, upshot is: if you have almost a conserved quantity, then that is an obstruction to heating. You could say, how did you use that? That has to be a local, a sum of local terms? Well, yes, that is important because if it would be an arbitrary thing, right, you always have an arbitrary thing because you always can take some function of this evolution operator u that is by definition conserved, but if that is But if that is a completely non-local thing, right, then it will not constrain local expectation values. That's the same discussion as always. That's why to discuss thermalization for unitary or Hamiltonian systems, you really need to look locally, you need to disregard trivially conserved quantities. Getting holds. No conserved quantities. Okay. So that's one thing, the obstruction. Usually the presence of such an obstruction is accompanied also by pre-thermalization. And what I mean by pre-thermalization would be the following, so that your expectation value of local observables goes to a thermal value only at very long times, times of order 1 over epsilon, where this epsilon here was how well this quantity is approximate. How well this quantity is approximated, is conserved, right? But before you get there, something else might be happening, and that's actually pretty, from a physical point of view, it's pretty obvious what might happen. Well, you could have all the time to explore the this is a classical picture, but it applies to a quantum model just as well, to explore the part of phase space determined by the constraint that this HE is constant. Okay? So that would Okay? So that would imp so I think that also needs no further explanation. I'm not at this moment not claiming that this happens, I'm just saying this is something that often happens, right? It's not really implied by this, but it goes together with it. So you have an approximately concerned quantity, it obstructs heating, but you might also, before you eventually heat up, equilibrate with respect to that constraint. And then you have here a pre-thermal state. Very good. Very good. Now, I want to emphasize that when I say pre-thermalization, I want to take a little bit of distance from the meaning in which this word is very often used. So, this was actually, well, it's hard to say now who used it first, but I can trace it back to this paper almost 15 years ago. And that was always supposed to meant you. Supposed to meant you consider near-integrable systems, right? It's a weak perturbation of an integrable system, and then something, the thermalization is one over g squared, that just basically Fermi dollars, yes? What does weak mean? Oh, the g is small with respect to typical local time scales of that Hamiltonian. Is that okay? So the integral one has a does it have a gap in the no no no no it would not have a gap no no No, no, no, no, it would not have a gap, no, no. It's just the integrable model would be a sum of local terms, right? These local terms have on the lattice a typical energy scale, right? The pre-factor, let's say, right? And then that G would be small compared to that. Is that okay? Okay, so the fact that this time would be 1 over G squared is simply a consequence of the Fermi-Dolner rule, right? That heating does not occur at first, or thermalization does not occur. Or thermalization does not occur at first order in G, but in second order, and we will not be discussing here. I don't want to discuss that here. I want to discuss cases where this thermalization rate or the thermalization time is much smaller, respectively much bigger than just 1 over g squared. I want to discuss cases where it is non-perturbatively large in the small parameter g. Okay, let me also, now that I have it on the board, just say. Now that I have it on the board, just say that actually this phenomenon everybody whom I talk to agrees with that, but it's not often said, has not much to do with breaking integrability, it has everything to do with breaking a conservation law of the integrable model. So that could be just as well non-integrable, you would still have the same phenomenon. Anyhow, I don't want to discuss that. Okay, so as I said, I want to discuss cases where there will be obstruction, an obstruction to heating. That's actually here not. To heating, that's actually here not the case. And my thermalization time will be non-perturbable, it will be large in the small parameter. Okay, and then just as a last remark, I'm doing my other question, sorry, yes, sorry, just to get stuck on this. I can say, it's large for any of the things. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so sure, absolutely. Absolutely. So we are certainly not in the regime where spectral perturbation theory would apply. G will, of course, never be small compared to the level spacing. No, that's not what I said. I just meant you have a model on the lattice, which is a sum of local terms. Let's say a hopping, right? These hoppings come with a pre-factor, the hopping strings. Okay, so G would be small compared to that hopping. Is that okay? The the definition was okay. So, um So, I usually like to do work which is at least partially rigorous. And in this talk, statements about the obstruction to heating will be rigorous. Statements about pre-thermalization and thermalization are, of course, not rigorous. One can also always miss something, right? And that's unfortunately the okay, so that will become clear also. So, what are those cases where the obstruction is such that the time scale is stronger than just some inverse power? Oh, yes, yes, yes. That will be... Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So I really want to take distance from this phenomenon, right, which is very different. That, by the way, here you cannot really formulate it as an operator obstruction. It just because the word preterm. It's just because the word pre-thermalization has been used much more often for this than what I am saying, that I want to contrast my setup with this. Okay? Good. Good. So let me give immediately the simplest example of what I'm talking about, which is, well, I don't know whether it's trivial, but it's by now well known, and that is high-frequency driving. So I have again this protocol, two alternating Hamiltonians, and there is a small pre-factor, right, of all these Hamiltonians, which sort of Of all these Hamiltonians, which sort of, if you choose other units, it just means that you are driving at high frequency, right? Times are very short. Okay, now if you see that, you might be tempted to try a Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion of this product of unitaries and write something like that. And then, I mean, when I first saw this, I thought this might actually be correct. This might be a convergent expansion, but it's not a convergent expansion. Convergent expansion. There are reasons why this way you cannot write here a series that will sum up really to a local Hamiltonian. However, as people have understood, since five years or so, you can certainly prove that even though there is here not a convergent series, you still have an emergent Hamiltonian, which here could also be called an effective Hamiltonian, because it basically just sits here in the exponent. Just sits here in the exponent such that it is quasi-conserved in the sense that I was advertising earlier. And here you have this thing that was called epsilon on the previous slide, sorry for that confusion, is now actually exponentially small in one over epsilon, or you could say exponentially small in minus the frequency. So if the frequency is very large, this is an enormously small number, and so you have a conserved quantity up to a very long time. Conserved quantity up to a very long time, and you have exponentially slow heating. And so, a lot of words on that, I'm not going to review them. I'm sure you have heard about that in some forum. Very good. So, here, what I want to stress a little bit, even though it might be too much, here I say this conserved quantity, I also call it an effective Hamiltonian, because u, in a sense that I could make precise, is really exponential of that effective Hamiltonian. Exponential of that effective Hamiltonian up to a small correction. That need not be the case. A quantity can be conserved without it really generating the evolution, obviously. That's why I have actually two concepts, H emergent and H effective. Good. When did I actually start? At 2.15. 2.50, yes. Very good. Good, good. So that was the high-frequency driving, and now I come to the The high frequency driving, and now I come to the motivation for my work. And that was a recent paper, well, by now, two years ago, a recent paper where they do the following. So, there is again a protocol of a kicked system, right? So, this is the one many-body Hamiltonian, this is another many-body Hamiltonian. You see, it's what is also called the kicked easing model. And I think it's a little bit more. And uh it uh okay, so so it fits the setup of my first slide. You have two parameters, h and j. And if I take both h and j very small compared to one, right, I mean sort of sorry for saying compared to one, but sort of here you you just set basically frequency equal to one. Yeah. If you set are in that regime, then that's the regime I discussed on the previous slide. That's the high frequency regime, and then of course you have exponentially. Regime, and then of course you have exponentially slow heating. However, you could now try to do something else. You could say, well, let's just make one of these parameters small, right? So then you have, and the other parameter more or less equal to one. Perhaps they don't like my talk. Okay, I prefer it actually. So let's see. So, right, so one parameter more or less equal to one, the other one Parameter more or less equal to one, the other one very small, and then that would be moderate frequency but very weak driving. So you could ask, okay, what happens then? And these authors gave an answer to that, and they found that putting any one of these parameters very small also suffices to have very slow, very slow heating. Okay, and then they did numerics on that, which suggests that now the time scale is actually a stretched exponent. Stretched exponential in the small parameter. The small parameter is now h or j. And they also did some replica resummation that says that there is actually an effective Hamiltonian also for that model. So they say, well, it's a bit the same as the high-frequency driving, except that it's a little bit different, but I'm not going to say, not going to explain in what sense they say it's different. Anyhow, what is important for my talk is that that was the motivation for my work. The motivation for my work. This work was not entirely rigorous, and so I thought, can I make it rigorous? Can I understand it somehow better and perhaps differently. Okay. Now, let's think about what is the message here and what we should now think at this point. So, when you see this, you could be inclined to think: okay, so actually, if you have a periodically If you have a periodically driven system or a sort of periodic system and then you drive it weekly, right? Why weekly? So I well, you see, because if so my terminology is perhaps not so good, so it's just if one of these is absent, right, then it's not really a periodic system, then it's a fixed Hamiltonian, right? So it's periodically driven because both of these are non-zero, right? So we drive. So weak driving just means one of these is zero. So weak driving, does it always give exponential slow heating? And that is certainly suggested by what I wrote here, but it's also certainly incorrect. In general, we can, I will now not do any examples, we will basically get to that, but if you have weakly interacting phonons of fermions with some hopping on the lattice, and you drive that weakly, you will Weekly, you will, in general, get a kinetic equation, and actually, the heating rate of that will be given again by Fermi-Dolder rule. So, it's certainly not true that you always have exponentially slow heating. You don't have to believe me on that. That's sort of, that, well, let's basically say that's my opinion also. I think it's true, but for the purpose of this talk, that's an opinion. So, if that's not the slowdown, that moderate frequency with wheat driving gives exponentially slow heating, then perhaps. Gives exponentially slow heating, then perhaps is there some special structure for these models that mates here at this very slow heating? And yes, there is a special structure, and this thought is basically about the structure. Okay, and then well, it's a little bit, that was a numerical experiment from 2007 that I wish I had known beforehand because that's an even better motivation for my talk, I would say. So it's the same model, it's periodically. It's periodically kicked easing model, and then Thomas Prozen did very elaborate numerics on that model, right? So he choose, oh, I forgot to write that, but he sets J equal to something of order one, and then he varies HITS and HZ, and he looks at the thermalization rate. And white regions in this diagram mean that the thermalization rate, in some precisely defined sense that I don't want to go into, is smaller than one over one million. Is smaller than 1 over 1 million. And so you see, well, that's quite a lot. So a lot of regions with small thermalization rates. But you also see something nice here, which already confirms what I tried to tell you on the previous slide. It's not enough to have wheat driving. So let's look at the case where. Well, perhaps I don't know whether my point is uh so so for example if um if simply h it's small, right? So this thing is small. So if you would neglect it, then this together with that can be mapped to free fermions. And you can actually write again a nice Hamiltonian for that. So that would be an undriven system. And then you could say, okay, so is it by putting a small hx? Putting a small hx, will I also heat that up very slowly? And the answer is no, because here there is no white region. So you see here that indeed it's not always that weak driving leads to exponentially slow heating. So again, you ask for a special structure. Good. Actually, I have a question. So there are no finite size effects in this? Oh, yeah, you know. So we have this recall that for this driven system, finite size effects can be quite simple. Yeah, yeah. So that's sort of. Sort of no, I obviously don't know, right? So you see, also, it's 2007, but Thomas told me that he asked you to redo it and that you said that it seems very robust, this non-stormization. But nevertheless, this is like one thing that I was talked by, basically. You make the system larger, there is a small drift, but the question is where does this drift go? Yeah, sure, sure. So, no, so okay, so ob obviously I'm not the right person to comment on the validity of that numeric. To comment on the validity of their numerics, but I will give proofs that confirm a bit this file's diagram. So I sort of tend to. But it's very interesting because numerically there's always this drift and it's very unclear where this is going. Yeah, yeah, sure. No, I. Okay. So now I am... So I gave you the motivation and now I will give you, of course, the answer, right? And the answer will be a little bit trivial, but let me still explain a little bit the easiest things, okay? That we understand. Starting again with the Thai frequency. Understand starting again with that high-frequency regime that I already had, but now I write it a little bit with different parameters. So let's say that we have a time-dependent Hamiltonian, which is just the driving is here in this term, right? And J and H are both small, right? So it's really... Sorry, no, that's not so important. J and H have just to be smaller than this frequency. Here I put the frequency explicitly. So that's a bit of a pedagogical mistake, but okay. Roger mistake, but okay. And now, the whole point: why does this heat up so slowly? What is the intuition? Well, the intuition is the following: if you have this large frequency and you want to absorb a quantum from the drive, let's say a photon, right, then since your local terms in the Hamiltonian are much smaller, you need a lot of loadal, you need high-order imperturbation theory in these local terms to be able to absorb one photon, because one photon has such a huge energy. Okay, and that if you have never Huge energy. Okay, and that if you have never done such estimates, that might now sound very hand-waving, but that's basically the reason. And so the point is that dissipation or heating up or absorption of photons, you will only see it in an order of perturbation theory that is basically this omega divided by J and H. Let's say divided by J. Okay? And so the heating rate will go exponentially. Well, you cannot see now that it goes exponentially, but from these arguments you can convince yourself that the heating rate should go. That the heating rate should go should be much smaller than any power of this, and actually, it's an exponential of that. Okay, so it's basically a mismatch of local energies, it's absence of resonances that makes this high-frequency regime heat up so slowly. Another thing, which is basically the same but looks a bit different, and I like to present it separately, that's the stability of Dublins. So what is a dublon? Well, I don't know, but for let's say it's it's dead. Let's say it's that. We have a Hamiltonian which has a fermionic Hamiltonian. And here there is a term that is zero if there are zero or one fermions on the side, but is one if there are two fermions or is non-zero when there are two fermions. And you perturb it weakly, right? Now it's well known that this model also has a remarkable stability, namely the number of doublons cannot easily Doublons cannot easily be changed. Why is that? Well, it's the same reason as on the previous slide, because if that omega is huge, then you need high order of perturbation theory in this J to be able to match the energy of one doublom in order to absorb or create a doublom. So that is a process that will only happen at high order in perturbation theory, and so this again leads to basically to an exponentially long time. Exponentially long time, and exponentially long time for what? Well, basically, for stability of this term. So, this term here, the Dublin number, is essentially the effective conserved quantity. So, here I made a mistake myself. That's actually unbelievable that I did that. Or is it? Oh no, it's okay. It's okay. Here, you can transform that Hamiltonian, and then you will see that that is something That is something dominated by the okay, no, I messed up. I'm sorry. So, what I should have said is that this quantity, the number of doublons, is an emergent, is an HE, an emergent quantity that is conserved up to very long times. Actually, in the effective Hamiltonian, you would also get here another term that is of order j, but that conserves the number of Doublons. So, here you have both an HE and an H effective. Right, so also that is understood very well, and actually, it's non-different from the previous thing because by doing by going to an interaction picture, you can recover here the high-frequency model or the high-frequency setup. So, it's the same picture, and it's also the same mathematics actually. Good. So, now, right, so again, I warned you. Again, I warned you five minutes ago that we must be very careful not to conclude that weak driving always leads to slow thermalization. But here we sort of are almost falling in the same fallacy because it seems that all I used in these heuristics is that I have two distinct energy scales, right? This energy scale is much larger than that. But so that's not enough. If you think about it, what I really used in these heuristics is that Is that this term, this Hamiltonian, not only is it small, but it can absorb only a discrete small set of energies locally. That's because it's given by a set of commuting quantities, right? So if you want to excite this term locally, there is nothing else that you can do than just excite the local term, right? Because the total term is a sum of commuting terms. Total term is a sum of commuting terms. Okay, so this perhaps went a bit too quickly, but okay. So the whole point is that it's given by a sum of commuting local terms. And my talk will be stating, well, that's the general structure here. That's the important structure. Note that MBL systems are also given by a Hamiltonian. That is, after a lot of, after people understood how to do it, can be displayed as a sum of local terms that are mutually commuting. So that's a Mutually commuting. So that's a bit the same thing, right? Okay, and so then what I am saying here for these Dublins is that, okay, so that this thing is a sum of local terms, and after adding a small perturbation, this thing is almost conserved, or actually a dressed version of that is almost conserved. So that was all the introduction. And now, if I convince myself that I am looking for this structure. That I am looking for this structure, sum of commuting local terms. Well, do I have them here in the model that I actually set out to study? Well, yes, I have them, because both this is a sum of local commuting terms, and this is also a sum of local commuting terms. Okay, so let's focus on this term. Let's again call that doublance, even though I might actually call that number of domain walls or so. That would perhaps be more appropriate in this conference. Then you Then you now have, okay, so you have these guys that come with a pre-factor j, so that's an energy scale. And another energy scale here is the frequency. The frequency is simply 2 pi, because my time, my period was set to 1. And then you see that if you want to absorb a Dublin by this term, right, well, you can absorb photons, and you can absorb or create Dublin. Photons, and you can absorb or create doublons, but you have to match them, right? So if n is the number of, or m is the number of douplons that you can absorb, and n the number of photons that you want to emit, well you have to match them so that you are on resonance. So in first-order perturbation theory, this thing would have to be smaller than h, and in higher order perturbation theory becomes a different condition. But that's the mechanism of slow dissipation here. Of slow dissipation here. Again, a mismatch of local energies. Okay, so now that was all introduction and motivation, and now there is a TRM. So this is a simplified version of the TRM. So you have a time-dependent Hamiltonian that is periodic, that it's dominated by something that, okay, that can be here, some stalar tree factor, but basically there is a D, which is the sum of commuting logon terms. Here I even made it a bit stronger with integer gamma. Made it a bit stronger with integer gaps. So that was that's not really necessary, but it's easier to state the assumption. So these terms also have that property, right? Not only the spectrum of that is 0, 1, so in particular it's a lattice. And I will assume that condition here as well. So if you have that property and you have some, this number is sufficiently diophantine, which means that it's ill-approximated by rational number. Ill-approximated by rational numbers. I can explain what that means, but that's not so important. Then you have a result, you have a theorem, and the theorem says the following: take the pre-factor of the drive in here, small, right? And then you go to some appropriate rotated frame that I will not explain you. In this rotated frame, you will have a quasi-conserved quantity again, and this quasi-conserved quantity is nothing else than that D itself. So it's like that. That D itself. So it's like that Dublin number previously. So that Dublin number will also here be conserved, and it will be conserved up to a time which is perhaps not exponential, or at least I cannot prove it, but it's a stretched exponential in H. Okay? So another way to formulate that without going to a rotated frame is if you look at the stroboscopic evolution, then you have a dressed version of the Douglas number, right? So now you just put the frame change into the observable, so it's just Heisenberg versus Schroeder. So it's just Heisenberg versus Schrebnier picture. And now you have a quasi-conserved quantity, at least for the stromoscopic time evolution. And that is the obstruction to heating, and so we have for this model obtained a proof of slow heating. Now, at this moment you might think that, or that's what I thought actually, that the pre-thermalization associated in this model will be up to an ensemble determined by just fixing this. By just fixing this D tilde, which is, I recall you, just a small dressing of D. But then, actually, around the same time that we put our paper online, there was another approach with us, the same thing, but a bit better, and that's by Elzo Ho and Dumitrescu. And so let me just briefly say what is their point of view. Their point of view is that i instead of doing immediately what I do, they first go to an interaction to the interaction picture with respect to this tublond number. Respect to this Dublin number, and in that interaction picture, you okay, so you eliminate basically this from the Hamiltonian, you are left with that, and the price you pay is that this requires now an extra time dependence. It was already periodic, but now requires an extra time dependence because of evolution with that D. But because this D has integer spectrum, that time evolution will also be periodic, but with another frequency. So in the end, this the This thing here is now quasi-periodic. Okay, five minutes, very good. So they have a quasi-periodically driven system, and for this quasi-periodic driven system, they do again some things that are very similar to what I do. And they prove that after going to again a new frame, they can gauge away the time-dependent. Time dependent in the time dependence in the Hamiltonian, so then in this new quasi-periodically rotating frame, the time evolution becomes actually with a fixed static Hamiltonian. So that produces the same result as what I had on the previous slide, but the difference is that they immediately, that they characterize the pre-thermalization resige much more sharply. They say, no, no, it's not just that you have a Dublin number, which is conserved, that is true, but there is more truth. Is true, but there is more true. We also give you an effective Hamiltonian, but the price to pay for that is that you have to go to a quasi-periodically rotating frame. Okay, very good. Let's see what... So one of my messages is that this kit-easing model, which is really the Diniapit for so much, is incredibly rich. Because now we could go back and apply the TRM, and we will have at least three regions where the TRM applies, one of which is actually a time crystal, so it's pretty nice. So I would really. So, it's pretty nice. So, I would really like that somebody investigates this model again in the view of this theory. And now, I want to just give you one example where the fractons will come in. Sorry that it's so late. So, I now just do a static Hamiltonian. The theory applies more or less in the same way for a static Hamiltonian. And I choose this Easing model with the transverse and the longitudinal field. And I now want to have this HZ as a small perturbation. Z as a small perturbation, and then I see that not only do I have a Dublin here, but I also have the magnetization here. And upon assuming now again a new diophantine condition, I skip all that. The upshot will be by doing the same sort of steps, it's really the same sort of mathematics, that now upon going to a rotating frame, you have two quasi-conserved quantities. One is the Dublin number, or the number of domain walls, and the other is the number. Number of domain walls, and the other is the magnetization. And this, of course, reminds us very much of fractum. Well, okay, no, I know that's not a fractal, but that's one of the things that were discussed in the fractum community, right? Where you have this dipole and charge conservation. Well, this is domain wall and charge, you could say, but I think it does pretty much the same for you, because if you now look at such a configuration, then you see that there are no local moves possible, because there are no local moves that would conserve the magnetization. That would conserve the magnetization and the number of domain walls. So this thing is completely stuck in that sense. Of course, just as in those models with charge and dipole conservation, if you have hopping of higher orders, then you can move. So for example, if you have hopping that can move this whole domain wall, so this thing as a whole, then it's not stuck. And these hopping terms will generate These Hopping terms will generically be there here, but they will come with a very small pre-factor. They will be exponentially small in the length of that domain wall. So, okay, depends on what you like, but I would say that that gives a realization of one of these fractonic phenomena. And the thing I like very much about this, and why I present that, is that that comes with its robustness. Right? So, I repeat what is the setup here. You start, you Here, you start with a bit more trivial model, right? Because if you drop HZ, then well, you might not like that, right? So, just the Dublin number plus the magnetization, that's very trivial. But now, at least it is robust in the sense that if you add the small, you can add now any small perturbation to that, and you will preserve these properties of being of having two quasi-conserved quantities. Conserved quantities at the price, of course, that it's only true up to exponentially long time. So, okay, it gives, I think, another perspective on Fractonic behavior. Okay, so I'm already over time. Let me just shoot at you one thing that I like, and that's what I actually wanted to talk about, but I did not manage to prove the theorem. So, let me just be bold and provocative. So, I have described you, I did not phrase it like that, but I basically described you this philosophy. If you have a Hamiltonian, which is the sum of logos, Have a Hamiltonian, which is the sum of local commuting terms, and you perturb it weakly, right? So, here it's even about without the periodic driving, it's easier. You perturb it weakly, then the thermalization time will be non-perturbatively long in this parameter here. So, it will be longer than any inverse power law of that. Okay, now you could ask me, so is the converse true? Is the converse true? Or I ask you, is the converse true? If you have this phenomenon, does it mean that your Hamiltonian is always of this form? That it's a small perturbation of something that is a sum of local commuting terms? Well, literally speaking, not, because it could be that the W was just very special, but if you have that phenomenology for any w, of course also reasonable, right, some of local terms, then I conjecture that that's actually the case. Conjecture that that's actually the case, that my case is the only case. But I cannot prove it. Okay, so, well, I have conclusions, but the conclusions were already mentioned, so I thank you very much. Well sorry, maybe you said it and I missed it, but um you have this whatever, D and H one in in notation at some point. So so this so this slowness, the genetic, yeah, so the genetic slowness, which is non-perturbative one of it, usually, you know, say it's e to the one over h. It depends also on the structure of that h1. Of the h. So here on this slide there is no h1, you mean the w and You have this probably have this, you know, sum of commuting terms in the D, and you have something that will mix you, and the nature of that mixing operator is also important, not just the scaling, in the sense that it could be even worse, that's what I'm saying. Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure. I mean, yeah, well, look, if W commutes with D, then there is no thermalization, right? But sort of, that's not what I'm doing, right? I am describing a theory which has robustness in that sense. Which has robustness in that sense. So the W can be anything. Of course, if you take, instead of something that is just supported on two lattice sides, something on 20 lattice sides, then that will make all the constants in my theory worse, but not more than that. I'm asking about something even simpler. Okay. Not trying to criticize anything. It's that W is non-commuting with D and is the thing that will connect the states. Yes. And if this is constrained as well, the connection can be very complicated. The connection can be very complicated beyond just this argument that it has to be non-perturbative one over h. So let me deliberately probably misunderstand your question because I don't fully understand and say no, I conjecture that that's not true. So I say this is the only case. Not sure exactly, but Can I ask again, Ichenstein? Even more stupid. I'm thinking of something, forget quantum mechanics, plastic and turbo. Yeah, I'm thinking of a Rhino's law. Arrhenius law. Okay, but you see, that's sort of, I meant here, I I then you your your the temperature is is an important parameter, right? Is an important parameter. So I mean here, let's start from a so the whole first of all, the whole torque was independent of the state. So the whole torque was uniform in the Hilbert space. But here, when I want to go back, I want to say, so assume that starting from a state of finite density, which means that we are not close to the ground state, we are at a finite temperature or finite density, assume that from such a state, Assume that from such a state, the heating rate is vanishing. So the linear response, so the first order in H, is vanishing. Then I claim you have that. All right, thanks, Go Shadow. So let's meet back here in So let's meet back here in 25 minutes at 3.20. We should stop the right stop. Oh, face.
