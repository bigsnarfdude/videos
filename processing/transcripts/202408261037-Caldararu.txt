Hello, thank you for the invitation. Every time I come here, I'm stunned by the beauty of this plant. I woke up this morning, saw the big button, and there it is. Okay, so this is one of the rare occasions that I think the title. One of the rare occasions that I think the title of the conference matches with the topic of my talk. So, let me say what we want to do. So, the goal, which is fairly straightforward to state, is define normal Witten invariants for what I will call non-commutative spaces. Spaces, which non-commutative spaces, this is some kind of paradigm introduced by Konsevich a while ago. Basically, what that means is we want to not have any space around, but this should mean some kind of analogs of derived categories. Of something, or in any case, some kind of collabio category. And you need to put some adjectives here, maybe dg, maybe A infinity, something of that. So a non-commutative space you think of as what happens when you replace, instead of replacing your Instead of replacing your space by a commutative ring or a sheaf of commutative rings, the way you do in classical algebraic geometry, replace it by the derived category of modules of that non-commutative ring, and then you forget that of that commutative ring, and then you forget the fact that it came from a commutative ring, and you say maybe I'm allowing myself non- So the input data will be some kind of collaborative category C. Calabial category C. And I'm not going to worry too much about what collabial means. I'm going to try to save a few minutes. And I'm not going to try to say what DT or A infinity is. It's some kind of version of a category. So it's going to be very expository, but a lot of the details will have to be lost. But if you if you want to know more. You if you want to know more, feel free to ask me. So, examples of things that you would want to do would be take the category C to be the higher category of a synthetic manifold. And this should be your kind of most important example because this, in this case, you should get back classical rule of independence. As you well know, growth invariants are really attached to a symplectic manifold and if you can construct the Foucault category and understand it, well, in principle this machinery would recover the Chromovic invariance, forgetting the actual space x, but remembering just the Foucault categories. Other examples would be the derived category of a Calabi-Yau. Category of a Calabiao manifold, complex manifold. This is classical algebraic geometry. Take the Calabian manifold X hat, take its derived category, you feed in this machinery. What you should get out of this is something that in physics is called BCOV invariance. But this But this does not have a mathematical definition. For genus zero, so these invariants, these grommocon invariants, like classical grommet invariants are indexed by some genus. For genus zero, this should give rise to what started out all of mirror symmetries of things that you get out of variations of Hodge structures. on x. But for a genus greater than or equal to 1, you get new invariants, which by mirror symmetry should match with hierogenous invariant, hierogeneous classical remote invariance of the mirrors and prototypes. Or you could take other categories, C, you could Categories C, you could take some matrix factorizations of a potential, W, where again, in genus zero, these are very classical things called cytoinvariants, which appear in the study of singularity theory of your potential W. And in higher genus, these are new, or you could also Or you could also stick in some kind of um fuca sidel category. And this should, these are expected to give rise to those FJRW invariants. So in some sense, this approach is thrown Approach is trying to unify the very distinct constructions of all these various invariants that have been each one constructed ad hoc in various ways. And the goal is to say, well, we have one universal machinery where you start with some kind of a category and you feed it into this machinery. Your task has been. Your task has been changed instead of trying to define the various invariants. Your goal is to define a good, nice collabial category, then you feed it into the machinery and automatically get some nice invariants. How important is the dimension of the category here? It should work in any dimension. So, if you do derive category for something other than the three qualities, that's. You're not getting anything similar to Donaldson-Thomas, if that's what you're asking. This is not related to Donaldson-Tomas at all. If you feel it for an elliptic curve, for example, which is dimension one, you should get the Chromo-Vitan invariance of the mirror elliptic curve, which is the two tolerance, which is like the structure. You should get the Gromovicini invariance of any elliptic curve. K3 zero. It should be straightforward. Alright. So that's the goal. Now, why do we want to do this? Here's one reason why. Another reason is that it would allow you to get so another good reason is try to understand Mirror symmetry to arbitrary genus. So you might know that mirror symmetry started out with this famous paper of Candelas, Delaosa, Greenham Park, where these people observed from physics this amazing prediction. Physics, this amazing prediction that you could calculate the genus zero Gromovitan invariance of the quintic threefold by doing some variational fodge structure calculations on some mirror family of threefolds. That prediction was proved 10-15 years later in many different works. Ivan Dal and Yao and collaborators proved the genus zero version, but physicists always told us there should be higher genus versions of that. And while on the original side, the A side, we have perfectly fine definitions. The definition of Romovignovarians doesn't care if you're in genus zero or in higher genotype. On the B model side, on the analog of variation of house structures, Analog of variation of hot structures, we don't know what to put instead of the genus zero thing. And this approach is trying to define something which will be the mirror of and also even if you were looking at genus zero, this thing, if everything worked out correctly, and I have to warn that many things we don't know how to prove, but would give a tautological proof of the Proof of the genus zero mirror symmetry statement simply because we now know that the Foucault category, the quintic, is equivalent to the derived category of the family of mirror quintics. And so, because this construction is completely categorical, you only feed a category, it doesn't know where the category came from. Know where the category came from. So if it came from the category, you should get the promotion variants. But when you did the derived category, you should get the variation of other structures on the mirrors. So these are all of the goals. Koncevich in some sense in 1994 predicted the existence of such invariants when he accepted his Fields Medal, he gave this amazing talk. Who gave this amazing talk, where he predicted homological mirror symmetry, which was the equivalence between these two things. And he also said, well, the matching of numbers that we are seeing should come from this equivalence. So implicitly saying there should be some kind of invariance that you only feel output. Alright. So now that we've decided what we want to do, let's start trying to understand how we want why clubby. And why Clabiao category? Because you get Gromobwood invariants without... Oh, but the Foucault category is always Calabiao, even if the underlying space is not. On the B model side, if you start with the derived category of coherent sheaves on an algebraic variety, whether the resulting category is Calabia or not is directly related to the space being Calabia. In collabial. But Gromovitian invariants come from Foucault category, and Foucault category, collabial structure is some kind of orientation data. And what you want is a symplectic manifold to be orientable, not collabial. On the B model side, orientable means collabial. All right. So now So now, what do we do? Well, we begin with some very old ideas. So, I want to discuss topological field series. And this goes back to Atiya, who Goes back to Atiya, who came up with the formalization of the concept of what a topological field theory. I will stick to topological field theory in two dimensions. So topological field theories in two dimensions means basically you want to assign, you have, I'm going to use a technical term prop. You can think of it as a kind of like a category. Of topological surfaces. So I'm going to be very schematic. So I'm going to pretend that I have a bunch of surfaces, things like this. I'm not going to give details about orientable and things like that, with boundary. And such things can be glued together. So, for example, if I have For example, if I have that surface, which is a pair of plants with one hole here and two holes here, and then I have this tube with two holes here and no hole on the other side, I can glue them together to obtain something that looks like a plus one surface with one hole. Simple, so I just connect those two things. And what Adia defined as a field theory is some kind of a functor. So a 2D TFT is a functor. F let's say from this category of topological surfaces, let's call it two comb. So it's two combo distance to vector spaces. And you want it to be monoidal in the sense that it respects this joint union, turns into tensor product. Turns into tensor product. And in this very simplistic setting, we can understand things very, very well what it means. Basically, it turns out that you need to associate. So, such a 2B TFT consists of is what you assign to the circle. To the circle. That's a vector space V. Now, then what do you assign to this pair of pants? And that's a map, V tensor, V to V. And then finally, what you assign to this pair of pens. This pair of pens, not pair of pens, this cube with two inputs and one and no output. And that's a map V tensor V to K here around field. And the fact that this functor has to respect all the compositions in this wall turns out that this map should be an assumptiative multiplication on V. On V. So this map, mu is an associative multiplication. This map is a pairing, is a non-degenerate pairing. So what you have is you have a ring together with a pairing, and turns out that the main condition that needs to be satisfied is this one. Needs to be satisfied is this one. xy paired with z is equal to zx paired with y. So what we get out of this is the basic theorem, which says 2 DTFTs are in one-to-one correspondence with probabilistics. Frobenius algebra is a possibly non-commutative ring with an associative multiplication, but together with a non-degenerate pairing, so it necessarily must be finite-dimensional. It's a finite-dimensional algebra with a pairing, and the pairing With a pairing, and the pairing must satisfy this nice condition. These guys are commutative, though, or maybe I got this. Yeah, sorry, I need commutative from topological field theory. It tells us how to understand these kinds of These kind of complicated things, which are two-dimensional functors from two-dimensional cobordisms to vector spaces, which in some sense is a good way to understand surfaces using the process of cutting and pasting. So, the whole idea here is that a complicated surface like this one. A complicated surface like this one can be cut and pasted into two smaller things like this. So, if you understand what the functor does on this and on this, you will understand what the functor does on this, because this surface is obtained by the composition of this. And in some sense, there is a hidden theorem here which says that all the surfaces can be cut into pieces which look just like this guy and this guy. This guy and this guy, no matter how complicated the surface is. And it only relates, so that means that whatever the functor does on any surface can be understood from what it does on this piece, on this piece. But there are some restrictions of what it can do on this piece, on that piece. And the big theorem is that the only restrictions there are are that this map be replaced. This map be amplitude and associative, and this map be a non-determined pairing and the interaction between the fields. So why did I bring up topological field theory? You might think it has nothing to do with the problem I started out before, but somehow a Kalabi-Au category should be thought of as kind of a fancy version of a Frobenius analogy. Why? Well, a category is in some Well, a category is in some sense the same thing as a ring because you have composition of morphicism and composition of morphisms has to be associative. And the Calabial condition says that I have a non-degenerate pairing, so a Calabial category is some Is some category where home EE is there is a non-trivial pairing between this, maybe with some dimension shift. So have a non-degenerate pairing of this. So the notion of category So, the notion of category is kind of a fancy version of algebra, and the Calabiao condition of the category is a fancy version of the pairing, which is the frombinous part of the structure. So, if somebody told you, I want to define something which requires me to have a Calabi-Au category inside, you might say, okay, maybe in a very simplified way, a Calabi-Au category is a Frobenius algebra, and we know that the Frobenius. Frobenius algebra, and we know that the Frobenius algebra is really nice because it's the same thing that the thing that gives us the nice quantity. So you might ask, okay, what do Calabia DG categories give us? They give us a kind of fancy version, they're a fancy version of Vinius algebra, they should give us a fancy version of the topological field. So here's the first theorem. Theorem, which I don't think is known in both implications, I only know one implication. But the statement is the following. Given a cyclic, which is the same thing as calabial, this is the term used in the literature. A infinity L. A infinity algebra. We get a T CFT structure. Sorry, and here I mean to say smooth seven proper, it's important. We get a T CFT structure on the DG vector space. L, which is the hoffshelf chains. This notation means offshelf charts. So this theorem I need to attribute it. So it's due to So you do Konsevich Soibermann in some version which lacks a lot of details and to Costello in a version that has a lot of details but is not computationally expensive. So whatever this is, you should kind of think about it. This theorem I haven't I've told you very little about. Told you very little about it yet. I'm going to go into a lot more detail. But the basic version is that you should think of this as a highly, highly subduct version of this theorem. So this theorem said you give me a commutative from Linux algebra, you get a two-dimensional field theory, topological field theory. In this theorem, you say, you give me a cyclic. Say, you give me a secret anything in the algebra. Now, you might say, oh, well, these two don't look at all the same because of the presence of the word commutative here. And this cyclic infinity algebra is certainly never expected to be commutative. If you insisted on it being commutative, it would be very limited. So, maybe if you're wondering what they If you're wondering what A infinity algebra I'm imagining, I'm imagining A infinity algebra, let's call it A, to be the endomorphism algebra of the generator E of your Calabi-L categories. So you took your Calabial categories. Calabiao category C, in all the interesting cases we care about, it has a generator. Take the endomorphisms of the generator. That's going to be some DG algebra or infinity algebra, depending on your context you're working with. But that will never be like commutative algebra. This E could be like a vector bundle on your space X. What's the C of T C of T? What does it mean for an algebra? Sorry? So it means again that it has a non-degenerate pairing? It has a pairing. It has. The algebra has a pairing. So remember that, for example, if I started with C to be the derived category of a Be the derived category of a Calabial manifold. I took a generator of that Calabial manifold. If I took the endomorphisms of that, that's formed. That's exactly the kind of thing I have here. And that gives me a non-degenerate pair. And I took home in the derived category sense that it has only X, so the shift does not function. I mean, if you really want to think about a concrete case, take an elliptic curve. Take O and O of a point, so two line buttons, one of degree zero and one of degree one, add them together. They are, if you take the direct sum of them, it's a generator. Take home from, in the derived category, from that rank two vector bundle to itself. You get a six-dimensional Non-commutative algebra, which has a pairing and it has a May infinity structure. Okay? And kind of various results in Morita theory tell us that if you started with the generator, this endomorphism algebra contains all the information you want about these categories. Any other questions? Any other questions? Do we always have generators for each? Really? Yes. Maybe it's infinite dimensional or always. So let's say in the geometric context of a Clavia threefold, can I find a finite dimensional microbundle which is a data? Absolutely. It's a theorem of Vondal and Vandenberg that every algebraic alright doesn't have a derivative category of that has a change. And it's splitting or no. No, you need the split generator. When I say a generator, it means it generates a derived category as the Karubi completion of the Karubi completion of what it generates is a category. So it needs, you need to also split. Yeah, right. So it's just not. But it's in this sense a generator. But it's not just the smallest time linked category. No. It's the smallest. This is all you need. Does this make you happier? Well, the caveat sort of makes me feel less queasy, but I don't understand the caveat, but let's move on. For example, it does not require the case theory to be finitely generally for example, if that's what you prefer. Okay, yeah, I have both. So, for example, for an elliptic curve, you cannot. For example, for an elliptic curve, you cannot have a strong generator because everything you're going to generate from a generator will be in the abelian group of all the term classes of that generator. So, but that's finite. So, how do I get O of a different point from O of? Because O of the sum of three points which are on a line, on an analytic curve, is equal to O of any three other points, and that's the sum of O of a point plus O of another. Sum of a point plus of another point plus of another point. So every single point can be obtained as a direct sum of fixed line. Is that okay? So and it's known that with this splitting thing, this category, this algebra contains all the information you want to call the homophobic theory, that's called the Morida theorem. The DG category of A modules, or the infinity category of A modules is equivalent to the categories. That's what we want. Okay. So now, let me, so as I said, there's this kind of disconnect here. Here, the Frobenius algebra is commutative. Here, the algebra is certainly not commutative. And that's because. Not competitive. And that's because we are here, it's a story about what in physics would call closed strings. Well, here it's a story about open strings. The infinity algebra A encodes open strings, while the Hochschule chains of that algebra would encode the closed strings. So the correct theorem here is the following also. You have an extra theorem here. Theorem here. If A is a possibly non-commutative Frobenius algebra, then the center of A is a Frobenius algebra, is a commutative Frobenius algebra. Of course, the center of an algebra is commutative. But the statement is that there is a nice fairing that you can put on the center of the algebra, which plays well with all these structures. The correct full theorem says that the pair A together with Q of A gives you a open-closed Topological field theory, meaning that I can find some kind of structure where this thing corresponds to the open strings, this guy corresponds to the closed strings. And what's the connection with that? Of course, Hoch-Schild homology and Hochschild cohomology is directly related. Hoch-schild cohomology is the derived version of the set. Hoch-schild cohomology zero is set. Okay. Okay, alright, so I will not tell you how this theorem is proved because it's, in some sense, a very combinatorial theorem. It goes through the theory of Riemann graphs. But let me just say that if you give me the infinity algebra concretely, if you write it for me on a big sheet of paper, and you then I can write it down. I can write down explicit formulas for all the TCFT operations. And now I need to tell you what the TCFT what is a TCFT people were asked for. So a topological field theory, which is what I started with, talked only about topological surfaces. Surfaces. Things that looked like this, and I didn't distinguish at all, I didn't give them any shape. They were literally just topological surfaces. Now, I could try to do conformal field theory. So that would be CF. Where now I would want to start. I would want to study instead of topological surfaces, I would want to study conformal surfaces. And because of Riemann's theorem, a conformal surface is the same thing as Riemann surfaces. In other words, surfaces together with the choice of a complex structure. With the choice of a complex structure. Much, much, much more complicated thing. For a torus, I get all the possible elliptic curves. There's a whole A1 space of them. Now, what the TCFT is, it's something in between. So, in other words, what I'm trying to say here, maybe let me go back. What I'm trying to say here, maybe let me go back to this. When I'm talking about conformal surfaces, I would like to get an operation f of sigma for every sigma in Mgn. Right? So the space of all conformal structures on a surface of genus G with unmarked points. Mark points is Mgn. And so if I choose a surface with a conformal structure, I have chosen a point in Mgn. And I need to define what my functor f of the topological field theory does for every individual surface. So that's very complicated. Moreover, aren't you restricting yourself to where the size of Restricting yourself to where the size of the circles is like zero? I will discuss the size of the circle in a minute if you bear with me. What a TCFT does is it kind of topologizes this space. So it says, well, MGN, if I think about all of its individual points, it's a very complicated space. But it has some topology which we have some chance to understand. And so. And so, what a TCFT does is it looks for the topology of Mgn. In other words, explicitly, it's a set of maps of the F's that we had before. That we had before, maybe let me call it F again, from chains, topological chains, on MgKL to OG L tensor K, L tensor L. So here, I need to modify a little bit the MDN because I don't need just N marked points, I need K marked points which I call inputs, and L marked points that are outputs. So, the idea is again, instead of looking at the space MgN, which is complicated, I'm looking at its topology. In other words, I'm looking at its singular chains. But I work at chain level, which is very tricky. I'm not working, I'm working with all chains, not just with the homology classes of LG. That's what distinguishes it from a homological field. It be a notion of homological field. Yeah, a cohomological field theory. Yeah, a cohomological field theory would have something like this, but it would also have a bar. So the difference between this and the cohomological field theory is that we work at chain level, but we don't allow things in the compactified modular spaces. So we. Yeah, everything is a dg. This is a dg vector space and map of complex. It's a map of complex, isn't it? It's a map of complexes. And the requirement is that somehow we would think that Riemann surfaces can be sewed together and these maps are supposed to be compatible with the sew. But here is where I lie, because Riemann surfaces cannot be sewed together in a well-defined. So, why? Simply because if you give me a Riemann surface with a little hole, and another Riemann surface. Hole and another Riemann surface with a little hole, let's say the hole is even the same diameter. These things have conformal structures, so talk about diameters and things like that. Saying I'm going to glue this with this does not produce a well-defined Riemann surface at the end, because when I glue these things like this, it is different as a conformal surface than if I glue it like this, or like this, or like that, or like that. Okay, there's very important. A very important difference from the story of topological surfaces, where if I wanted to glue something to the holes, there was a well-defined topological surface obtained at the end. For Riemann surfaces, there is no such thing. If I try to glue things this way, it matters if I turn around. And we can see this in the most basic case, exactly the case that I talked about. About. So maybe let's have a concrete example here. The example that I started with is this, combined with this. In algebraic geometry, we know very well that there's only one such thing. It's a genus zero thing with three markings. It's only one. It's only one P1 with three points, three points. This also, there's only one of those. So, if there was a good way to glue them, I would get a well-defined elliptic curve. So, there would be some special elliptic curve, right? But there is no special elliptic curve for me. However, it turns out that topologists have known this for a long time, as I said, that if I go through all the possible If I go through all the possible rulings with 360-degree rotations, we do get something well defined. So I'm going to mark this like this. We get a one-chain in M11, and that is all elliptic curves. Close or at epsilon distance from the nodal cubic. So if you imagine that this circle had a very small radius, then what you get when you sew these things. Yet when you sew these things, you end up with an elliptic curve that looks kind of like this. It's an elliptic curve which has one geodesic in the hyperbolic matrix that's very small. It's exactly this little circle here. And there isn't only one of these, but there's exactly a circle of them. These are. Of them. These are when the radius of this goes down to zero, you get exactly the nodal cubic, the polylliptic curve. And if I require that it has a geodesical radius exactly epsilon, it's a small circle in the moduli space around the cusps, the round. Okay. So, in order for this to make sense, In order for this to make sense, I need to put something, I need to put these two letters here, framed. So, what I mean here, this is a moduli space that parameterizes Riemann surfaces of genus G, K, holes marked as inputs, L holes marked as outputs, but on the boundary of each circle I put a little framing. So I choose. I choose a special point on the boundary of each little circle. Both incoming and out, coming? Both incoming and outcoming. All of them. So that I can glue things. So if I knew, if I had a framing here, and I told you I want to align this point with that point, I would get a well-defined operation of gluing. And then these things form an opera or a probe, and the chains on that form a prop. I can ask for a map. A problem. I can ask for a map. Representation of that problem into a DG vector. So there's some real torus bundle over that space. It's an S1 to the K plus L bundle over MTK. Okay. All right. So that's what the T CFT is. And the magic of the whole story is that a cyclic A infinity algebra, Calabia Infinity Algebra, gives you exactly the data of a TCFT. Right? Now, we are still hunting because we have got nothing like Roma but invariant. So what is really going on? So let me say, do we have any model, any kind of model of a TCFT that's related to grommets? And the answer is yes. Is yes. So hopeful, I'm gonna say hopeful because talking to Mohamed Abuzay, he says we're at least 10 years away, in the language of the people's talk, of proving such a theorem. But hopeful guess is the following. So let's now go to Gromovin' the theory. So let's say X is a syntactic manifold or algebraic variety. Or algebraic variety, if you want. It's a polarization. Then we can form this nice space mgn bar of x. I'm going to omit the beta for now. And we have evaluation maps to x, and we have the map to mg and r that we have seen in the previous talk. And we have this nice map. And we have this nice map where if I take omega one up to omega n forms on x, I can do pi lower star of f1 upper star omega one f n upper star omega n and then And then integrate this along alpha for some alpha which is a chain on Mg. So I get the map which associates to a chain on Mg and bar is not. Well, I'm thinking that the virtual Well, I'm thinking that the virtual class somehow got absorbed in the prime. This is why I'm saying it's a hopeful guess, because everything here is not mathematics, it's just wishful thinking, pipe dreaming. Notice that I said here that I'm working with specific forms, not with cohomology classes. So I need to know, I know how to pull back forms, I know how to cup them together. I would like them, I would like. I would like them. I would like to know how to push forward here using the virtual fundamental class. I have no idea how to do this at chain level. So, this is supposed to be a specific form, not a cohomology class. Because I never said those forms were closed. This has no reason to be closed, and so the integral on the chain alpha depends on the specific form that I get. It does not. Form that I get does not depend only on its cohomology process. This chain alpha is not closed. So, constructing this map is really a pipe dream for now. But if somebody knew how to do this, and the word symplectic homology seems to come up in time, so symplectic homology, so this vector, this space of form should be replaced with symplectic homology. And there is some theory that I don't know. Theory that I don't know, but there is some hope that you could get such a map, which you should think of as this map, at least in the case where L is 0. So this is the L equals to 0 version of this map. You have K inputs and 0 output, so you assign to K element of your vector space L. This is L. You assign a number. You assign a number. And that's what you what this thing says you should do. The hope is that for some nice construction of this map, this would give a TCFT. In other words, it would play well with all the gluings of Freeman surfaces that go. If you had that, notice that you would have gotten more. And what you would have gotten, you would have gotten a lot of. Would have gotten, you would have gotten a little, little bar here. Right? So notice that the chain here is not in Mgn. It's in the compactified modules. If you had this map, to define Bromovitton theory in this setting would be extremely easy. All you'd need to do is plug in for your alpha the fundamental class of M G and R. The fundamental class of M G and R. Because that's what the chromophyton invariants are. You plug in n chromology classes represented by forms, you choose form representative, you put these here, you integrate along the fundamental class of mgmbar because that's the same thing as integrating downwards. Any questions about this? So this gadget that I've described here is a Kind of generalization of both Gromo-Witten theory, which Gromo-Witten theory, when you want to get numbers, means the only alpha you allow is the fundamental class of Mg and bar. But also a generalization of the TCF2 story, which only allows chains, it allows non-closed chains, but it allows chains from MGQL. But no bar. But no bar. So I would call this kind of construction something called a compactified TCF, because it works on compactified moduli spaces, not just on regular modules. So now the question is, what data do we need to get a compactified DCFT? Why? Because that's what we want to define remotely. Because that's what we want to define Gromo-Witten theory. We want in the Gromo-Witten theory to plug in the fundamental class of MDN bar, of the compactified one. And so we need a compactified T-shift. So we have seen that a cyclic K-infinity algebra gives rise to the TCFT. The question mark here is Mark here is what gives rise to a compact difference. We don't have the backwards arrow in the first slide? I don't think we know it. It's probably true, but I don't think I've seen a theorem like that. Now, here is the so the history of this problem was studied a lot. Studied a lot. First was maybe Konsevich Seibelmann realized 50% of the answer. Then Costello in 2005 gave a complete answer. And now we have a beautiful theorem. And the answer is it's a cyclic affinity algebra plus Plus, a trivialization of the circle action on L equals two function ch And nowadays we have a beautiful proof I mean the the but we have a best way to of stating this and I will just mention this And I will just mention this name, Yash Deshmukh. He's a former student of Mohammed al-Muzayd. He finished his PhD last year and he's at IAS now. He has a beautiful theorem which explains this in a very conceptual way. But I want to say that this tells us. This tells us that what we started out in the very beginning, saying you give me a Calabiao category, I want you to give me Gromovittin invariants, that is not possible. You needed more data. The Calabiao category is basically the same thing as the cyclic A-infinity algebra that did not give us a compactified TCFT. And we do not know how to compactify this TCFT in order to be able to integrate on the Be able to integrate on the compactified moduli space. But if you give me this extra data trivialization of the circle action, then you do get it. Now, this trivialization of the circle action sounds very, very complicated, but in practice, so if A comes from the derived category of collaborative, A collabial manifold. This data is a splitting of the Hodge filtration. So it's something that we understand very well. Now, since I only have 10 minutes, I'm going to have to cut short the discussion of how we define the remote capacity. How we define the remote, the categorical remote. And I will just tell you that nowadays we have in a sequence of papers with Kevin Costello and June Woodu and myself, we have an explicit computable definition of invariance that can be computed when you give me a cyclic A-infinity algebra and a splitting. Infinity algebra and the splitting of the multi-filtration on its single component. So that's as much as I can say at this point. Unfortunately, we don't have time to go through full construction. So I want to discuss the splitting of the hot filtration and explain where it comes from and why it was not evident before when we were talking about the remote. Maybe let me write down first this theorem that I stated just to say so theorem Costello make myself Costello and two given a cyclic A V algebra A A V by A and a splitting of its non-commutative concentration. There is a computable definition. So uh okay, so oh the short answer is this the cyclic homology of The cyclic homology of the algebra A admits a filtration, this associated graded hot shield homology. Splitting that filtration. Oh. That's what I mean by a splitting of its non-commutative filter. But I mean in the commutative case. In the commutative case, I will give an example so that we understand that. So I want to discuss the specific example delivery curves. So if you give me an elliptic, if x is an elliptic curve, there is a short exact sequence that's defined purely algebraically. So it doesn't matter on which over which field you are, which looks like this. This is a short exact sequence, which you should think of as coming from the Hodge filtration on the one Duram homology of the. One of the Ramko homology of the Ltd curve. This is a two-dimensional vector space, you know. This is defined algebraically. I'm thinking here about the algebraic Duramk homology. This is one-dimensional, this is one-dimensional, this is what we would call H1, 0, this is what we would call H0, 1. Of course, the Hodge diamond of an empty curve has a 1 and a 1, and the 2, 1 set up to the 2. And the 2 ones add up to the 2, which is the drama. The point is that, algebraically, this is the most we can hope to get. There is no splitting of this sequence of vector spaces that is God-given over an arbitrary field. Over the complex numbers, there is one, and this is the one that most people are familiar with. So you can think about the generator here. The generator here, which I call easy, this maps to something which I will still call dz. So to give a splitting of this short exact sequence, I need to tell you where a generator of H1 of O goes. In other words, I have this two-dimensional vector space. Inside of it I have a line, the line spanned by NC. I need to give you another line. I need to give you another line. I need to give you any element of H1 during that's not a multiple of DZ. And the standard choice in Hodge theory, as taught by Griffith and Herricks and stuff, it's DZBA. Everybody good? Everybody knows somehow that in classical Hodge theory, H01 is a complex conjugate of H1. A complex conjugate of H10. And that gives me a complete splitting of the Hodge filter engine. It allows me to write down H1 the round as a direct sum of these two vector responses. But this choice is not the only choice you can make. You can make any other choice you want. Any one-dimensional, any line in this two-dimensional vector space that is not this, the line spent by DC will give you a script. Span by dzing will give you a split. So for any choice of a split, it's this choice of a splitting that you need to make. To define a grommet like that. Just compact. Just a vector space metal. That's all. You might ask, okay, well, but what do I get for various splittings? So the answer is, or you might ask also, where do I get a splitting from? Where do I get a splitting from? What would be a nice natural splitting? So this leads us to the question of what splitting to use. So there are two answers that I can give you. Answer one is a complex one to get split. So you might ask, okay, I'm going to use this complex conjugate splitting because that's the one I learned from Griffiths and Taiwis, and I'm going to use it in a family of elliptic curves. So I've got my nice family of elliptic curves. So this is my tutorial description of M11 part. Here I have the node, and over here. And over here, I have my nice curves. And I'm sitting anywhere I want. At each point, I get a Calabial category, the derived category, I mean the B model, I get the derived category of that elliptic curve. And I can use the complex conjugate splitting, the one that I just wrote there. It's going to be a nice splitting that I can use. And I'm going to compute the Gromovitan invariant that I want with respect to the. Of it in the invariant that I want with respect to that splitting, I calculate it at each point and I get a function of m11 bar. The problem is the resulting Gromov Witten potential is not holomorphic. Why? Because the complex conjugate splitting is not holomorphic. It involves a complex conjugate which is not. It involves a complex conjugate, which is not. So, this cannot be the Gromo-Witten potential that we like, because the Gramo-Witten potential that everybody writes is a power, a generating power series of all Gromo-Witten invariants, so it's by definition a holomorphic function. But I can use a different splitting. So, so is this just the same as how is the Hodge filtration is homophobic for the Hodge the various speeds? Exactly, exactly. Yes, exactly. The Hodge splitting, the complex conjugate splitting is not holomorphic, so because of that, we introduce a non-holomorphic something in the calculation. The answer to will be the monodromy invariant splitting, which is very familiar to people doing mixed hodgepodge. Next hodge structures or logarithmic stuff. Basically, what I require is: I require my split, I have a flat connection on the cohomology of all the fibers around this point. I know that this monogram is maximally unipotent. This is the famous MUM point in parasymmetry. I require my splitting. I require my splitting to be preserved by the parallel transform around Mohammed Roman. I got confused by this statement, maybe for a really dumb reason, but maybe this will help clarify. You said the resulting Gromat-Witten potential is not holomorphic. So, but which Gromat-Witten potential are tangible? We're not talking about the ordinary Gromot-Wittenotic. No, no, it's not Grom-Witt-Witten potential. I said that we have some. We have something that we can associate to a collabial category and a split. And let's say we fix some genus, some number of mark points and insertions, and that will be some number. Now I have a family of Calabiao categories. So these are all the Calabiao categories of the derived categories of the elliptic curves. So for each one of these, I have some elliptic curve, I have its derived category. The right category. I have chosen my complex conjugates pretty calculated. I get the number, which is going to be some number which now varies along the modulus. I think of it as a function. It's a function that's not holomorphic. But it would be perhaps important to say that we are writing a mirror here. We're not in mirror right. You said this early on. When you start with a derived category and you do this procedure, you don't get the ordinary remote Witten invariance, except you can't do it. You get the remote invariance or something. The Gromo-Witten invariance of the mean. So I was hoping to get the Gromo-Witten invariance of the mirror electric curve, mirror to the electric curve, but I get something that's not even holomorphic, so it can't be the Gromovitch potential of something. The statement is that then the potential is holomorphic and it is exactly it is exactly It is exactly the remote potential of the mirror in. So this clarifies a fundamental problem that was there with the goal that I had in the beginning, which is that mirror symmetry does not happen everywhere. It only happens in the vicinity of the maximally unimportant monoclonal point. It's a vocal story for giving sort of the dual energy stuff. Somehow, I guess. I'm saying here, what I'm trying to say here is simply that in order to get a splitting which will calculate the Gromovitan invariance of the mirror, I need to place myself in the vicinity of a maximal minimum photo. So, that's the invariant cycle theorem. Yeah, I mean homology. Oh yeah, in homology, yes, yes, that's our cycle for the server. Now this explains why a certain variety can have several mirrors. I'm almost done. This also explains the famous holomorphic anomaly equation that Jake asked. Asked the failure of this non-holomorphic potential to be holomorphic, if I take its del Bar derivative, will be related to lower genus chromovitin invariance of any of the. So maybe I'll say this in words. The moral of this is that The moral of this is that categorical and numerative invariants are associated to a Calabia category and a splitting. A splitting can be taken either by this complex conjugate business or by a monodromy procedure. Looking at the interplay between various splittings gives us powerful results like the holomorphic anomaly equation. Mm I'll stop. Any questions? Decor, would you mind explaining again why you need to split the hodge filtration to get one of it parents? I cannot without actually giving you the full definition. But somehow the idea is that if I only Is that if I only have an elliptic curve, if it just gives me an elliptic curve or the derived category of an elliptic curve, all I know is how to integrate kind of insertions or things of that sort over chains on the uncompactified moduli space. I don't know how to integrate on the full. And how to extend that integration procedure to an integral which allows as inputs chains on the full moduli space, in particular the fundamental class. In particular, the fundamental class requires, depends on the specific choice of split. Remember that in Stella's paper from the mid-2000s, there was some kind of theorem where if you start with a and infinity kind of clapped kind of
