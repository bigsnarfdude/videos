My talk will be about some Hermitian geometry of a special class of manifolds that arise from number theory and generalize inway Bungieri surfaces. And they are of non-Keller type. It is very much linked to Livio's talk from yesterday. And let me just go a little bit through some very well-known definitions just to set the notations. So a Riemannian metric. So, a Riemannian metric on a complex manifold mj, where j denotes the complex structure, is a Keller. If it is compatible with the complex structure J, this is called Hermitian, and if the fundamental two-form associated to the metric, which is obtained by composing G, the metric with J on the first component, is closed. So, this is a one-one form. In complex dimension one, everybody is scalar because. Everybody is Keller because this fundamental form is a top form, so therefore it is automatically closed. So, real Keller geometry starts from complex dimension two onwards. When we have this, where we have this deep result due to Miaoka Todorovsky book da Lamari, stating that the existence of a Keller metric on a compact, complex surface is purely topological. So, it is equivalent to the evenness of the first. Is equivalent to the evenness of the first Betty number. Of course, the real theorem is in the converse direction. If the first Betty number is even, how to get the existence of a Keller metric, because the other direction is just a simple consequence of the Haudji identities. The non-Keller surfaces, the known non-Keller surfaces so far, are the Kodara, properly elliptic, Kinue, Hopf, and Kata surfaces. And conjecturally, Surfaces. And conjecturally, this should be the whole list. This is something called a global spherical shell conjecture. And Nicolina probably will talk more about global spherical shells. But the natural question is if non-Keller surfaces carry special remission metrics, some other special definition metrics. The answer is yes. So in complex dimension two, they all admit plurally closed metrics, because in complex Pluric closed metrics because, in complex, a pluric closed metric is by definition a metric whose fundamental form is Lidibar closed, but in complex dimension two, this coincides with the notion of Godish metric, and God is showing metrics always exist in a given conformal class. So, this existence of Florida clause metrics is something regarding all the surfaces, known or not known. But all the known, almost all the known non-keller surfaces, admit also. Non-Kellar surfaces that meet also locally conformally Keller metrics that were introduced yesterday by Livium, all except the subclass of in-way surfaces. So, this was proven by Tricheri for in-way surfaces, Orna Gouduchon for Hoff surfaces, Belguen for Codara properly elliptic, and Runela for cato surfaces. And just to remind you that omega is L C K if it satisfies this equality d omega is T power G omega for a closed realm form. For a closed real-run form theta. So it is a natural question to ask: is the higher dimensional analogs of are the higher dimensional analogues of these surfaces also special from a metric point of view? So today we will study, I will give the construction of Elliot Klaus-Toman manifolds and investigate what kind of special remission metrics they have, they admit, and correlate this. And correlate this the existence of such metrics with special number theoretical questions. So let's start with the beginning. Let's start with the Inver-Bongieri surface, because this is what one regains in complex dimension two from the Eulia-Klaustoma construction. So the Invere-Bon-Gier surface SA is associated to a matrix, three times three matrix, of determinant one and integer components that has this special property. That has this special property, has one real eigenvalue, alpha, and two complex eigenvalues, beta and beta conjugated. This alpha is assumed to be greater than one. And we take the eigenvector corresponding to the real value, the eigenvector corresponding to the complex eigenvalue. We can define a group of affine transformations of C cross H that is generated by three translations. This one. This one Zw goes to Z plus B I W plus Ai. So Ai Bi are the corresponding elements of the eigenvectors. And this dilation that multiplies the coordinate on H with the real eigenvalue and the coordinate on C with the complex eigenvalue. Okay, the quotient of C cross H to this group of transformations is the inevitable surface associated to A, and it was proven by the And it was proven by Tricheri to admit LCK metrics, and he actually gave an explicit LCK metric on this surface by writing it in coordinates on the universal cover, which is C times H. And it's quite straightforward to prove that indeed it descends to an LCK metric. And this is the Leaf form seen on the universal cover. Okay, now any class. Okay, now Le Claus-Toma manifolds were introduced by Carlo Leklas and Matitoma in 2005, and they are higher-dimensional analogs of Luhmann-Bongetic surfaces. So, first of all, they are of non-Keller type. We shall see why they are of non-Keller type in arbitrary dimension. And let me explain the construction. So, the construction starts with a so-called number field in number theory terminology. Number theory terminology, which is a finite extension of Q. So finite extension, let's denote by n the degree of this extension. And this number field has a number of real embeddings and a number of complex embeddings that come in pairs. So I will denote with S the number of real embeddings and to T the number of complex embeddings. So in practice, this number field is just Q of some algebraic number and this embedding. And these embeddings just move the alpha, the algebraic number, to its conjugates. So, this is how the embeddings are defined. And in this way, we can consider, we can set sigma 1 to be the identity, the one moving alpha to alpha itself. The number of these embeddings is in total the number of the degree of the extension, so s plus 2t equals n, and we shall consider from now on that we will. And we shall consider from now on that we work in the setting when both s and t are greater or equal than one. And just a small remark is that for any natural numbers s and t, one can find a number f k with precisely s-wheel embeddings and precisely 2t complex embeddings. Okay, the OT manifold would be a compact quotient of Hs cross C T, where H is the Poincar√© half plane, and to construct And to construct this compact quotient, we need two objects that are very important, especially for number theorists, associated to a number shield. And this is the ring of algebraic integers of k. So those elements of k that are roots of harmonic polynomials with the coefficient integers, and the group of positive units. So those units who have the real embeddings. The real embeddings are positive. So the image through all the real embeddings is positive. Okay, out of these two objects, the ring of algebraic integers and the group of positive units, we can construct the compact quotient. And first of all, we notice that we can act with the ring of algebraic integers on HS cross CT by translations. So we can add to any component the corresponding embedding of an integer. Of an integer. So I will denote from now on with w the coordinates on hs and with z the coordinates on ct. So what does this action do? So first of all, it is like quotienting to the lattice obtained by the image of all the integers via the embeddings, the lattice living in Rs cross Ct. So if we take sigma to be this map, you Be this map given by all the embeddings of defined on integers. A classical result from number theory states that the image of this is a lattice of maximal rank in Rs for Ct. So maximal rank would mean S plus 2t, which is precisely the number, the degree of the embedding, the degree of the extension. Okay, so this is a good option because we act on the first S components only with S components only with real, adding only real numbers. So this leaves unaffected the imaginary parts of Hs. So when we quotient, when we take the quotient of Hs for Ct with the action of this ring, what we get is we compactify the real parts of Hs and C T and we leave unaffected the imaginary parts. So it is a product of R plus S cross torus, a real Taurus, a real dimensional torus of dimension n. So it is a non-compact complex manifold so far. We can act also with the group of units, of positive units, by multiplying now. So it is an action by rotation or by dilation. We multiply every component with the corresponding embedding. And this action descends to the quotient of the first action. Of the first action, because if you multiply a unit and an integer, you obtain an integer. So we can consider now the action of the whole group of positive units on the quotient constructed before, but now this double quotient won't be a manifold because essentially this group is too big, the group of positive units. We have to restrict to a smaller group in order to get. Smaller group in order to get a proper discontinuous action. So, what we shall do is we shall take the logarithmic representation of the group of positive units. So, we take the logarithm of all the embeddings. We have no problems on the first test component since U is a positive unit. And we take the logarithm of the norm of the complex embeddings. First of all, this logarithmic representation of the group of forces. Representation of the group of positive units has the following property: that its image lands in a hybrid plane. This hybrid plane, given by the sum of all the components, is zero. This is just a consequence of the fact that u being a unit, the product of all the embeddings is equal to one, and therefore the sum of all these logarithms will be equal to zero. So now if we take the subgroup U. The subgroup U in the group of positive units, such that the projection of this of the image of U is a lattice of rank S, then we get proper little discontinuous, co-compact, fixed point-free action. So the quotient is indeed a manifold. So first, what I didn't say was that the image of L is not only living in H, so it is a maximal lattice in H. Is a maximal lattice in H, the hyperplane given by the sum of all the components equal zero, meaning that it is a lattice of rank S plus T minus one. So we choose wisely this group U, such that the projection on the first test component is a lattice of rank S. And now this quotient, this double quotient, is indeed a compact complex manifold. This is called the OT manifold associated to k and u. Those were the data that can. were the the data that constructed this was the data that constructed the the manifold um okay let's take uh let's take an example very easy example if we take the following polynomial um xp minus x to the power p minus two where p is a prime p not two p a proper prime um this polynomial will have one real root which is the p root of two and uh And all the other roots will be complex conjugated. So I just multiply this p-root of 2 with the root of the p-root of unity epsilon. Since p is a prime, I won't get here any real root. And we take the number field q of the p-root of 2. We can take the following unit given by the p-root. Following unit given by the period of 2 minus 1, it is indeed a unit since we can explicitly compute the product of all the embeddings. If you pay attention to these parentheses, what we get is actually the function, the polynomial computed in one, multiplied with the minus one corresponding to each parenthesis. So at the end, it will be one. So u is a unit. We take the group generated by this unit u, and we This unit u and we build the OT manifold as we saw associated to this k and to this u. Alexandra, may I ask you just one question? Epsilon is not in k epsilon is not in k, no. So k is just a real uh k is a real field. Yes, but then if you when you say it's a unit. If you, when you say it's a unit, ah, it's just you work in complex numbers and then you just take the product of all the others and you get a real number. Okay. Yeah, you should also check that it is a unit. Okay, thank you. Yes. So sigma, the embeddings, will move the period of two in the period of two times epsilon and so on. But KK is real. Okay, and from as a Okay, and from as a smooth manifold, X is a bundle over S1 with a fiber torus of dimension P. Okay, a few facts about the OT manifolds. So their first petty number coincides with the number of real embeddings, so S, it is at least one. And they are the fiber band, the total space of fibration over an S dimension. S dimensional real torus and the fiber is an n-dimensional real torus. So this is a real vibration. It's not a holomorphic vibration. Both their Duramo homology and their Dalbocho homology can be computed in terms of number of theoretical invariants associated to K and U. And they have they share an interesting property with Keller manifolds, although they are not Keller, which is they satisfy the Hodge decoration. Which is they satisfy the Hodge decomposition in the sense that the L-Betti number is the sum of the Hodge-Betty number Hodge numbers pq with p plus q equals L. And this is something equivalent to the degeneration of the Ferry-Herr spectral sequence at phase one. So this is something, this is a cohomological property, very interesting cohomological property they satisfy. Their Codanger dimension is minus infinity, they don't admit global holomorphic vector fields or holomorphic one forms. Vector fields or holomorphic one forms. So at this point, we can say for sure that they are non-Kellarian because if they, since they don't have global holomorphic one forms, H10 dolbo is zero, is zero. So if it was Keller, then also H01 should be also zero and B1 should be zero, but it's not. It is S. It is at least one. So at this point, we can say, okay, they are not of color type. And what's interesting. And what's interesting from the metric side is that, and we will exploit this fact, is that they have a solved manifold structure. So they can be organized as a quotient of a solvable Lie group to a discrete group gamma. This was proven by Kasura in 2012. And now we can study the Hermitian geometry of OT manifolds. And we will use the fact that it is a solved manifold. That it is a solved manifold. Okay, so since they generalize in Web Bombieri surfaces and in Web Bombieri surfaces were known to carry L CK metrics, it was a natural question to ask if also OT manifolds admit L C K metrics in arbitrary dimension. And it was proven by Elliot Klaus and Thomas in 2005 in one direction and then was by Battisti in the other direction that an OD money. That an OT manifold that meets an LCK metric if and only if this number theoretical condition is satisfied. So the norms of all the complex embeddings are equal for any unit in the group U. So the existence of LCK matrix is purely number theoretical. This condition turned out to be very difficult also for number theorists. So as you can see, it is obviously satisfied when See, it is obviously satisfied when t equals one because there's nothing to check, it's only one embedding in that case, maybe it's conjugate, but they obviously they have the same norm. But there is no known example for T strictly greater than one of an OT manifold carrying an LCK metric. And I would like to. Can I ask a question about this? Yes. So, I guess in one of the directions, if the norms aren't one. Aren't one. How do you show there's not a metric, an LCK metric if the norms are not equal? You mean, yeah, yeah, how do you show they are not? Well, so I'm going actually, I'm going to run through the proof. You will see that if it meets an SDK metric, it is forced. I mean, you will see exactly where this condition comes. Oh, okay. Yeah, great. Thank you. Yeah. So the idea. The idea of the proof is what Viviu said yesterday: that LCK metrics actually can be seen as Keller metrics on the universal cover that are homotized by the fundamental group. So this, so a manifold admits an LCK metric if and only if there exists an omega tilde, a Kelorometric on the universal power, such that any element in pi one acts uh with respect to this metric by multiplying it with a positive uh factor. Multiplying it with a positive factor. So I would like now to, yeah, maybe let's see a small proof of this statement. So if the manifold is LCK, then on the universal cover, it's easy to cook up a scalar metric of this type. You just pull back the leaf form, which will be globally exact since the universal cover is simply connected. And you multiply the pullback of the LCK metric with this suitable conformal factor. Suitable conformal factor, this omega tilde can be easily shown to satisfy this condition. And the other way around, if we look at this association to any element in pi 1, if we associate any element in pi 1, the logarithm of this constant, then what we get is an element in the dual of pi 1, which is the first Duram homology group. So this association gives us a Duram class, class. For class homology class in H1 during, we just pick every element in this class, we pull it back to the universal cover, we take the primitive, and this Keller form multiplied with this factor, this conformal factor, can be shown to be to descend to the quotient and to be L C K precisely with theta as V4. So, this is the key. This is something, this is how one usually proves about. One usually proves about a manifold that it is LCK. Okay, so now let's see the proof of the result. So the easy part would be if the number theoretical condition is satisfied, don't just take this metric on the universal cover. I mean, check that indeed it is positive, so and therefore it is scalar by the way it is defined. And that the fundamental group. That the fundamental group acts in that nice way. So, an integer, if you take an integer, you know K, we can see that it will leave the metric alone because A will act anyway by translation, so they are killed by the differentials. And if we take a unit, then we can see that in front of each factor here, it will appear the norm of. The norm of the complex embedding of index of order j, and also this product of the real embeddings to the power minus one over t, which are equal. So this is the constant, the homothetizing constant of the unit u. Okay, so this was straightforward. The other way around now, assuming that the OT manifold is L C K, we would like to deduce this number theoretical. Would like to deduce this number theoretical condition. So that we would like to deduce that this condition is forced somehow. So since it is LCK, it means that the universal cover carries a Keller metric, this one written in the most general way, such that it has the property with respect to the fundamental group. But one can show here that actually omega tilde descends to the first quotient to Hs cross. First quotient to Hs for CT, quotient to OK, which was a torus times R plus to the power S. We average over this torus, and by and this means that we can book up another Keller metric, which has this coefficient constant in many directions, the direction of the real parts of Hs and the coordinates on Ct. And by using again that this is closed, we deduce that the coefficients. We deduce that the coefficients have to be constant for sampling for s plus one onwards. So from here, the fact that gamma star of omega tilde is C gamma of omega tilde, we get that it is absolutely mandatory that the complex embeddings have the same norm. So this is how we forced this condition by the Keller condition. Condition by the Keller condition, the LCK condition on the manifold. Okay, so so far I didn't use the solved manifold structure of OT manifold. Just to resume what I said, this numerical condition is difficult to verify in practice. No example with t different from one is known, but there are some. But there are some cases known when it can happen. For example, it was proven by Voulette school that if T is strictly bigger than S, then that condition can never be met. So therefore, there are no LCK metrics on an OT manifold. Now, the source manifold structure opens a world because this one. Sorry, Alexandra, I have a question just if you want. Just if you may. Yeah, so you have this non-existence result for a locally conformally categor, but you can also see that from the existence of a special current. Can you see this current from the constraint of the construction? Can you prove non-existence by showing that there is a current which is a boundary in the twisted sense? Yeah, I see. Yeah, I see. I don't know. So, this part with the non-existence of LCK matrix is purely number theoretical. So, I don't know exactly how this can be reflected in the current description. I am not sure. I mean, yeah, this part is purely number theory to prove that it cannot be. To prove that it cannot be with currents, yeah. So, I never tried, and I don't know. So the solved manifold structure is presented in the following way. So, it was given by Kasuya. Maybe I won't go into all the details since I started a bit later, but the thing is to organize HS. The thing is to organize HS cross-city as any group, of course. And essentially, we shall use two sets of numbers that appear naturally from the constructions. So the complex embeddings can be related to the real embeddings through these numbers, to this set of numbers BKI and to CKI. Maybe they are not necessarily important now to understand, but this is how. But this is how one gives the structure, which more elegantly is presented in the following way. We organize HS cross CT as a semi-direct product between RS and RS cross CT, where the action phi is given by this matrix, where the sets BKJ and CKJ appear. So these were the ones that linked the complex embeddings with the real embeddings. Real embeddings. And in this description, we see the group of positive units U included in RS via the logarithm representation. So U is log of sigma 1 of U, log of sigma S of U. And OK is seen in RS query CT by the embeddings, by all the embeddings, sigma 1 of A, sigma S plus T of A. So this is the description. It's a semi-direct product. The description: the semi-direct product factorized to a quotient to a descriptive subgroup. So, as I said, this opens the world because we have this general method to prove existence or non-existence of special permission metrics on solved manifolds, also provided that the complex structure is left invariant. So, also in this case, it is we have to note the fact that the complex structure. Have to note the fact that the complex structure is left invariant. So, in general, if we want to investigate the existence of a special metric, if this special metric is nice enough, we can use some average tricks and prove the exist elect invariant metric of this type. Then we use the structure equations of the Lie algebra of G and we either find an explicit example or we find a contradiction and we therefore declare that. Therefore, declare that the solvent cannot admit that precise kind of metric. So, the whole thing is played on what special metrics we are considered. Can they be averaged or not? This is the important arrow. So, we know that balanced metrics and Luri-close metrics have this property. So, proven by Nafino and Grancharov was the fact that if a solved manifold admits a balanced metric, A balance metric, then there exists also a left-invariant balance metric on the solved manifold. So, again, I would like to emphasize that the solved manifold has a left-invariant complex structure. And the same works also for pluriclosed. So, pluric closed, I said at the beginning, meant a metric whose fundamental form was DDC closed. And pallet means that omega to the power n minus one is closed. Equivalently, omega is co-closed. Is co-closed. Okay, all these averaging tweaks stem from an averaging tweak of Belgoon in the context of LCK metrics with left-invariant Lie form. So this averaging procedure requires the existence of a B-in-variant volume form, which is granted on any simply connected Lie group which admits a discrete subgroup with compact quotient. And once we have And once we have this invariant volume form, we can average in this way. So, if we have omega a pluri-closed metric, we can define the average omega zero on calculated in two left invariant vector fields to be the integral of omega, the initial flow reclause metric, calculated in x and y times the invariant volume form. And for the balance metric, it is a bit more. Uh, it is a bit more delicate. We cannot define the same uh uh averaging procedure. Um, I mean, we cannot average omega, but what we should average is the n minus one power of omega, because balanced metrics are in correspondence with n minus one and minus one positive closed forms. This is just a linear algebra observation that was due to Michelson, who introduced the value. We introduced the balanced metrics, and this is called the Michelson trick, if I am not wrong. So if we have a balanced metric, we raise it to the power n minus one, we average that power, and we get an n minus one and minus one positive form that is closed, is left invariant. And this form will have a root. This form will be the n minus one power of. The n minus one power of a left invariant balance metric. I have a question, Alexandra. Do you assume here that the group gamma preserves the complex structure? The group gamma, the lattice? Yes. No. No, you what do you mean? So I assume that the What do you mean? So, I assume that the complex structure is left invariant. Ah, you assume. Okay, so you have. But I don't assume that it is B invariant or something like that. No, only left invariant. And the quotient is to the left. Okay, so you fix a left-invariant complex structure. Okay, thank you. Yes, yes. So by exploiting the solved manifold structure, we Solve manifold structure, we can show that an OT manifold does not support balanced metrics. But it turns out that any LCK, so this is quite, this is very unexpected, that any LCK, any OT manifold that meets instead a locally conformally balanced metric. So the existence runs through, the proof of this theorem runs through that scheme that we have to average and To average and look for the look at the structure equations of the Lie algebra. So it involves some technical computations. And for the second part, why any OT manifold that meets an LCP metric, locally conformally balanced, we can just give explicitly the metric on the universal cover and it can be shown that it is invariant with respect to the action of pi one and it is invariant. The action of pi one, and it is indeed locally conformally balanced. Okay, more interesting are plurally closed matrix because they will actually exist and not always, they will be linked to a number theoretical condition. So what we proved was that an OT manifold of type ST admits a pluric closed metric if and only if the following number theoretical condition is met. Number theoretical condition is met. So, this is in the spirit of the LCK description. So, this number theoretical condition is that the number of real embeddings is less or equal than the number of half of the complex embeddings, and the embeddings have to satisfy this condition. So, after possibly relabeling the embeddings, each real embedding will have a corresponding complex embedding such that sigma i of sigma s plus i. sigma i of sigma s plus i times sigma s plus i conjugated is one and possibly there are some other complex embeddings left out so when their index is higher than s and they have to be of norm one so the proof again it's the same uh the same trick we can give the explicit description Description of the metric on the universal cover if we know that the number theory condition is met. And we can check that this is indeed ddc closed, it is invariant with respect to the action of pi one. And for the other, we just take one one form, a generic one, one form. We ask it to be the bar closed and to be positive. And by long computations, we obtain. Computations, we obtain the Florida clause condition happens if and only if that condition, that number theory condition is met. So, when is it satisfied? So, Arturas Dubits can't prove that for any natural number S, there exists an OT manifold of type S that satisfies this condition. So, when the signature, when we have the same number of real embeddings and complex embeddings. Embeddings and complex embeddings, then this condition simplifies to only the first part. So we have that any real embedding has a corresponding complex embedding and it satisfies this condition. So he proved that for any real, for any notable number S, there exists a K and the U that satisfy this condition. And therefore, automatic ones will provide examples of purely closed. Provide examples of purely closed manifolds in any even complex dimension. And they are not simply connected, so their first betting number is equal to s. What we did recently with Daniel Angela Arturoz Dovicas and Bonas Telsi was to refine a bit the number theoretical condition. So this is purely number theory here. So that condition happens if and only if s equals t. And after possibly relabeling the embeddings, we have this relation between the real embeddings and the complex embeddings. And this has to be satisfied for any unit U and for any index running from 1 to S. Yeah, here it's worth noting that an OT manifold cannot be at the same time LCK very closed unless we are talking of a surface. Unless we are talking of a surface, unless we are in the case s equals t equals one, because if you put together the two numerical conditions, we get that s has to be equal to t has to be equal to one. And what's even maybe more interesting is that the existence of a pluriclos metric has some implication in the topology and the analytic properties of an oti-manifold. Namely, it forces the third beta number to be this number. Betty number to be this number, and it forces the Hodge number of dimension 2, 1 to be s. So, I don't know if this maybe subscribes to some higher goal of finding homological restrictions, homological obstructions for a manifold to admit purely closed matrix, but it could be a beginning. In the proof of this, we exploit the number theoretical description of the derivative. Theoretical description of the Duramental Boch homology that we proved with Nicolina Strati and Matitoma. And in complex dimension four, these topological and analytic conditions turn out to be equivalent. So it's also sufficient to have Ferdinand number equal to 2 or Hodge number in degree 2, 1 equal to 2 to have a purely closed measure because it happens that if we have. Because it happens that if we have these conditions satisfied, then the numerical condition is automatically satisfied. So we get the existence of a pluriclosed metric. Okay, on some other note, we also prove that there are no so-called Asteno-Keller metrics that are defined as metrics whose fundamental form satisfy this condition that omega to the power. Condition that omega to the power n minus two is ddc closed. So in this case, we had to switch the strategy because this kind of metrics cannot be averaged. So they are not like purely closed or balanced. I mean, we could average an n minus two, n minus two positive form that is this DDC closed, but it's not granted that will come from a metric. So here we don't use the solved manifold structure. solve manifold structure but what we used was that we we built a semi-positive 22 form that is ddc exact and if omega as tenokeler metric existed then we can have this into integration trick that if we integrate the ddc of eta wage omega n minus two by applying stokes twice is eta wage ddc of omega n minus two which has to be zero but Which has to be zero, but the first part has to be semi-positive. So we obtain a contradiction. And I would like to finish with giving you an example of a Luri-closed OT manifold in dimension complex dimension 4. This example was given to me by Matthias Thoma, and it could be considered the very first example of a OT manifold with a pluric closed metric. Manifold with the totally closed metric. So let's take the following irreducible polynomial in degree 6, and this can be split as a product of two polynomials in degree 3 over Q of the square root of 2. And it can be shown that this polynomial F admits two real roots, alpha and alpha prime, and four complex roots conjugated. We can take the And we can take the number field to be Q of one of the real roots. As I said in the beginning, the complex embeddings will just move alpha to the other roots of the polynomial. We can take some very special units. We can take the unit precisely alpha, the root of the polynomial, because we can show that it is indeed a unit, but the product of all the conjugates is one. Conjugates is one and also one minus alpha. It happens to satisfy the same property. So at this point, we are tempted to take alpha and one minus alpha as the positive, as the group of positive units from the construction. There is just one more step to check. We have to check that indeed the projection on the first two components of the logarithmic proposition. Two components of the logarithmic representation of this U is indeed a lattice in R2 of lattice of maximal rank, so rank two. So, in other words, if these vectors are linearly independent and they happen to be. So, this would be the first example of a pluriclosa manifold in dimension four. And I have no idea what time it is. I just hope I didn't go over time because of. I'm because of the cakey start, but I would like to thank you for the attention.
