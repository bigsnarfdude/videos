Thank you to the organizers for inviting me to this really nice meeting. It's a real pleasure to be here and the surroundings are not so bad either. Okay, so let me start by acknowledging my collaborators. Alexei Sheshkidov, currently from the Institute for Periodical Sciences at Westlake University of China. Fabian Jin from Eteha Zuri. Had Zurich, Samuel McCaller, who's currently in Caltech in Pasadena, Milto Absfiro from the Vesa de la Jellero, and Rohan Schwitzkai from the University of Illinois Chicago. So this is going to be based on a couple of different, well, actually three different papers. Okay, so let me start with an introduction, which is basically made easier by John Luca's talk. So we have the equations for incompressible fluid flow and path to slow. Slow. Okay. And mu equals zero is the Euler equation, model for inlet sediment fluid flow, nu created zeros member Stokes, which is a model for viscous mid-cluster fluid flow. So for smooth solutions, we have this little calculation where we hit the PDE with u and integrate into the domain. So we get d dt of the energy. And after a bunch of manipulations, it's minus mu times the integral of the great. Is mu times the integral of the gradient of mu squared, the dissipation rate. Okay, so if you have inviscid fluid flow, nu is equal to zero, then if the flow is smooth so that you can justify all these calculations, then you conserve kinetic energy. And as Angeluca pointed out, anomalous dissipation is a cornerstone of turbulence theory. This corresponds to inviscid fluid flows which do not conserve energy. Actually, that would be inviscid dissipation. Actually, that would be inviscid dissipation. Anomalous dissipation means the dissipation rate does not vanish, and the vanishing is costly limit. Okay, so that is the K41 zero law of turbulence, and therefore turbulence requires anomalous dissipation and irregular fluid flows. So in 1949, Anzager proposed Paul conjecture that anomalous dissipation could occur in inviscid fluid flow with less than a third regularity. With less than a third regularity. In fact, he was talking about inviscid dissipation, and that inviscid fluid flows with more than a third regularity conserve kinetic energy. And currently, this is a theorem. This is a lower conjecture. The research developed along two fronts, one called flexibility and one called rigidity. And here we're going to be concerned with rigidity and specifically for 2D flows. Okay, so let me give you a very brief history. So, let me give you a very brief history of the rigidity aspect of this research. So, that consists of establishing regularity thresholds for conservation of energy. And the first result is due to Chris and Sulem from 1975, where they stated that if the velocity is bounded in time into h5 over 6 in space, then they conserve kinetic energy. And this is in 3D. And then A ink and then B4 establish a similar result. Established a similar result in L3 in time and a little bit better than C one third. And then constantinely in TT in 1994 did what is almost a state of the art, which is L3 in time, B one third plus epsilon, three infinity basel space. The state of the art is due to Sheshkirov, Konstantin, Friedlander, and Schwittkoi from 2008, and that is L3 in time B1 3rd 3C0, where that refers to the Little Pele component. That refers to the little Paley components vanishing at infinite frequency. Okay, and this is all the Bazov space results are both for 3D and 2D. Okay, what is a legitimately 2D result is due to Deshaun Rebert from 2000, where they state that if the initial vorticity is at Lp for P larger than 3 halves, then you have conservation of energy. And this is also all from zero forcing. Okay, the extension to P equal 3.5. The extension to p equal 3 halves is a consequence of the Shetzkidov constant Friedlander and Schwitzkwe result because then the velocity will be if W1 3 halves and that's contained in L3 and time V1 third 3C0. This involves setting optimal conditions for the energy flux to vanish, all of these results. Okay, so let me start specifying the 2D. The 2D flows, I'm going to be looking at them on the Taurus. I'm going to be looking at them on the torus for simplicity, with initial data, which is L2. And I'm going to be interested in weak solutions for which the vorticity has some integrand case, so for starters. So it's going to be pth power integral for some p greater than or equal to 1. Okay, and we're going to be considering first the case of zero force. Okay, so I want to make a very brief note that smooth vorticity is transported in 2D and therefore LQ bounds are preserved by the Therefore, LP bounds are preserved by the evolution, at least in a smooth setting. So, this is a very legitimate problem. And I also want to contrast with what is known as wild solutions, which have no control on the digibility of vorticity. Very recently, there's been a couple of papers where you have some control on vorticity itself in Fertuti. So, we have Eliabro and Maripolombo that showed that you have wild solutions wherever for. We wild solutions, where Vortici belongs to this Lorentz space. Oops. It disappears. Okay. I'll try not to hit anybody with this. Lorenz space L1 infinity, which is not a subset of L1. This is weak L1. And Nirabut Stefana did the same thing, the vorticity in these hardy spaces, HP, for P between 2 thirds and 1. This is again not as obvious. This is again not a function of L1. Okay, so just to set things, set notation, let me start with my definition of weak solution, what I'm looking at. So I'm taking initial velocity, which is L2, initial vorticity, which is Lp, and then I have a vector field which is continuous into L2 with weak topology, with a vorticity which is bounded in time into Lp. And I'm going to say it's a weak solution. And I'm going to say it's a weak solution if for every test vector field, which is divergence-free, I hit the PDE with the test vector field, put all the derivatives off the test vector field, and I get this identity. And the divergence-free conditions should hold in the sense of distributions. Okay, so existence of this kind of weak solution is due, it goes back to Duperna Maida from 1987 in the case P greater than 1 and the case P equals 1 was done by Ethel Lebecki and C. Joe Wu in 1997. Beth Kinsijo moved in 1993. But uniqueness is open, even except for maybe L infinity vorticity and near L infinity. And I don't want to get into the technicalities of how near. Okay, so I'm going to add a qualifier here, which is that I'm going to say the weak solution is conservative if the altered norm of the velocity is constant in time. So the baseline result is this one. So if you have a weak solution with vortices. If you have a weak solution with vorticity of L3, then it's conservative. All of these weak solutions are conservative. And moreover, the local energy balance law also holds in the sense of distributions. All right, so this result is contained, as I mentioned before, in the Cheskadoma-Alley paper, but I'm going to outline an elementary proof just to make things clear where this L3 halves comes in. Okay, so the idea is to sort of a state. Okay, so the idea is sort of a standard idea. We modify the PDE itself. We have a remainder term, the Reynolds stress term, which is the commutator between the convolution within all linearity and the convolution. And then I multiply the equation by u epsilon, which is now smooth. I get this local energy balance law. And I want to show that when epsilon goes to zero, all the terms converge to the right thing. converged in the right thing. Alright, so this is what we get. We get this convergence in the sense of distributions, this converges in the sense of distributions, and this term here converges strongly with L infinity in time to L1. Both A and B are subcritical for vorticity of L3 halves. They require only the vorticity being L6 over 5. Oops. Okay. Okay. And it's the energy flux term, which is the mean old term, which needs the vorticity of L3 halves. Oh, this is fun. Okay. And the proof of C uses convergence of modifications together with the Sovaland embedding, which says that if the vorticity is L three halves, the velocity is in L6. So the bad term, which looks like this, becomes with the integral. That's the key thing. integral. That's the key thing. You have u squared will be about 3, and that's dual to the green root, which is going to be about 3 halves. Okay. Equals 3 halves is optimal for this technique. And this is part of something that we did with Ramon Reed, meeting Milton and I with Ramon and Alexei. There is a vector field, you can produce a vector field which is p 1 third 3 infinity, which is w1p for p less than 3 halves, such that the flux Three halves such that the flux doesn't vanish when you send the frequency to infinity. So this is the flux through the energy flux up to wave number two in the key. Okay? All right. The relevant thing is that this vector field is not a dynamical example. It's just something to highlight the fact that this technique has hit its seal. It's just that. It's just that. It's not a solution of Euler. Now, if we go back to Christmas 2D turbulence theory, which the physicist would say is a figment of his imagination, because there's no such thing as 2D turbulence, but he postulated a forward entropy cascade, which sort of implies that there's supposed to be some kind of regularizing effect in 2D. Okay, and so it suggests that there may be a dynamical mechanism which prevents anomalous dissipation in two dimensions. Participation in two dimensions. And that's what we're exploring, even for a super critical approach. Well, I'm saying less than one-third regular, but I'm actually referring to the scaling of regularity. And you come back. Sorry, regular. Okay, so W1P for P less than 3 halves is super critical. It's on the same scale as the C alpha for less than 1. C alpha for alpha less than a third. Okay, so we'll see. So I wrote here that it turns out that vanishing discourages solutions in 2D are energy preserving even at this supercritical regularity, which is explored through these estimates on vorticity. All right, so I'm introduced to Vanishing-Duskasi solutions. So this is a definition that we introduced with Roman and We introduced with Roman and Alexei. We have a physically realizable solution, means that it's a weak solution of the Euler equations, and there is a family of solutions of 2D-IVER-Stokes, which converge weak star to the physically realizable solution, and such that the initial data is converge strong. Okay, any family satisfying two is called a physical realization of my physically realizable research. Reliable research. Okay, so with this definition, we proved the following theorem. This is an old theorem back to 2016. If you have a physically realizable solution with a vorticity which belongs to Lp for some p greater than 1, any P greater than 1, and such that the initial vorticities are bounded in L P, and this may be something that we can still get rid of, then you conserve Zenergy. All of such use conserve energy and p between one and three halves as on Zachary, supercritical in the sense of scaling. Okay, let me give you a very brief proof here, because basically the idea of this proof is going to be super used in the rest of the talk. Okay, so we start by assuming that our vorticity is in L P for P less than 2, otherwise the result is trivial, and that it doesn't belong to L2. And then it doesn't belong to L2. And since u is physically realizable, I can reach it by some physical realization. Here's my vorticity equation, which since thank God on the torus, there's no boundary layers, so the vorticity, the business vorticity equation holds. And then we can use energy methods, Gallardo-Mirenberg, and maximum principal vorticity to get this estimate here on the L2 norms from the entropy. The L2 norms from the enstrophy. It's bounded by the rate of dissipation of enstrophy is bounded by minus 2ν times the entropy to this power 2 over 2 minus p, because the entropy is the L to normal squared, times this thing which is going to be bounded from above. So I have, I will call y of t to be the entropy. C0 is the supin mu of the L P norms of this vorticity. And then I have an equation which reads, have an equation which reads y prime less than or equal to minus 2 twice a constant nu y to the 2 over 2 minus p. And the important thing is that this power 2 over 2 minus p is greater than t. So when I integrate in time, I get this mess here and then I go back and energy identity, which I can rewrite in terms of the dissipation rate in terms of vorticity, integrate in time. Integrate in time, use the estimate for vorticity, and we get that the energy at time t minus the initial energy is less than or equal to zero and greater than or equal to this object here. Now, if we forget this, because that's going to be going to zero anyways, this is going to zero, what I have is mu times t to the power of two times p minus one over p. It's a positive power. And therefore, Therefore, this vanishes. My right-hand side vanishes. Okay, so we use the fact, we then get that the difference in energies here when it's in viscosity to zero, to zero. Now, in their work in 1987, Dupre and Maida also noted that if the vorticity is an L P for P greater than 1 An L P for P greater than one, strictly greater than one, then you have non-concentration. So that the velocities converge strongly, the viscous velocity converts strongly to the Euler velocity. And that implies that for each time t, the energy of the viscous solution converges to the energy of the Euler solution, the immissive energy. If you use that together with the strong convergence of the initial data, which was embedded in the definition of Which was embedded in the definition of physically relizable solution, then we get that the energy is conserved for the Euler solution. We do not know anything about local energy balance or local energy conservation. This you do. Okay, let me summarize the key steps of the proof. First, we had to show that the dissipation vanishes. And this was done by showing basically that the dissipation, not the rate. Not the rate, but the full dissipation is bounded by viscosity to a positive power. To get this, we needed to have an estimate on the dissipation of entropy. And then we used the strong convergence of the L2, the L2 of the physical realizations. Then we got that the difference of the energy at time t minus the initial energy is equal to the limit as viscosity vanishes of the energy. The limit is viscosity vanishes of the energy, the viscous energy at time t minus the initial one, and that's zero because the dissipation vanishes. Total dissipation vanishes. Okay, we were really pleased with our results until 2021 when Sandra and Mahaler, Sid Mishra, and Kamas Paras Guido proved the following theorem. They showed that conservative physically realizable solutions are actually equivalent to strong convergence of the realization. Convergence of the realization. Very strange. So all you need is strong convergence and then you know energy conservation. Okay, the key object in their work were these L2-based structure functions. So the structure function S2, the spatial structure function is just the integral over the torus. Then you take the average over the radius r of the increments of u nu and Of uν. And you take the ultimum of this thing here and integrate that over the torus and take the square root of that. And then you take the integral in time of what's inside here, and you get this time-independent structure function. Okay. Okay, remember what's the models of continuity? It's just a non-negative function which vanishes as r goes to zero. And here's their theory. And here's their theorem. So they showed that if you have a physically realizable solution, then if u nu is a physical realization, the following are equivalent. First, these physical realizations converge strongly in Lp in time, L2 in space, for some p between 1 and infinity, in particular for p equals 2. That's all they actually do, because that's all that's really needed. Okay, there exists the models of continuity such that the time Continuity such that the time-independent structure function is bounded by this model of continuity, and 3U is conservative. Okay, at first I didn't believe this. Okay, so I'm going to give you a brief discussion because what we do actually is to extend this to the forced case, but this is the really interesting theorem. Okay, so if you being conservative and plaster convergence, it's very easy. Is very easy. All right, so what you do is you just note that of capital T times the energy of middle t is equal to the integral because it's constant. That's less than or equal to the limin of the integrals of the viscous energies just by weak lower semi-continuity, which of course is less than or equal to the limb soup, which by the dissipation, the viscous dissipation is less than or equal to t times the initial viscous energy, which is equal to t times the initial energy. Equal to t times the initial energy when you take the limit as viscosity vanishes. And then since you have conservation, these two endpoints are equal, and therefore all the less than or equal signs are actually the equal signs, and you have convergence of norms. And then convergence of norms plus weak convergence implies strong convergence. That's it. It's very, very simple. Okay, so instead of discussing the other equivalences, The other equivalences. The one that we'd be most interested in is that Straubenberg, which implies energy conservation. I'm going to give you an outline of the proof of something slightly stronger. Suppose that I know not only that there's a model subcontinuity, but that this model subcontinuity goes like r to the alpha, for some power of. Okay. So I'm assuming that I have s2 is like r to the alpha and Alpha and uniform and viscosity and time. Now, this then implies compactness in C0TL2. That's the plan. This implies compactness by the Komogorov compactness criterion at L23. So the bottom line, this is really the root of the story, which is that once you know strong convergence, you actually know a lot. You actually know that translations and things are in these increments. I mean, these increments are vanishingly small. I don't think that is pretty cool. All right, so it remains to show that the dissipation, the full dissipation, vanishes. And that is a consequence of this lemma, that if u is h2, then the outcome norm of the vorticity is bounded by r times the gradient plus the structure function, and then you can use your structure function to optimize and get this. To optimize and get this. All right, once you have this, you have your energy entropy dissipation inequality, and you use this to show that you get a differential inequality very similar to the one we had. That's the bottom line we get. dy dt is minus a constant mu y to this power 2 minus alpha over minus alpha, which is again greater than 2. Two. So it goes back to what we had done. Okay, so you compare, well, okay, I'm just stressing this. Okay, so you integrate the OD and you find, blah, blah, blah, this is all downhill and therefore you can estimate your energy dissipation by, again, mu to a power, a positive power F. Alright. Consequences of their work. First of all, our wonderful First of all, our wonderful, beautiful little theorem at Lp is actually the immediate corollary. In fact, if u0 is at L2 and omega naught belongs to x, and x is some kind of rearrangement invariant space, which is compactly embedded in h minus 1, and if you can show that the Neverstokes preserves the boundedness in L infinity of time of x, then any weak limit of mu is actually energy conserving. Examples, Lp, L log L alpha, Zygmunt space for alpha greater than 1 half, this modified Lorentz space, which I will get into a little bit further in this lecture, for Q less than 2. All of these are rearrangement invariant subspaces of L1, which are compactly embedded in H minus 1. The proof of the boundedness of in L infinity time to X of the Never Stokes evolution is something that we did with Fabian and That we did with Fabian and Sambo by operator splitting. I want to emphasize that there are no tools to deal with a vorticity which is L1 intersect H minus 1. We don't know what happens in L1 or even more interestingly in bounded measures intersect H minus 1. And this goes back to work by Delore and some by Kitsu Jewu, where they show that you have no concentrations in vorticity, but you could have concentrations. But you could have concentrations in energy. So the estimates don't exclude concentrations and energy, i.e. an energy defect. Okay, let me go into force, fluid, flow, and energy balance. So in our never stokes with forcing, I just add plus F. And then I'm going to substitute the energy conservation by the energy balance law. And then the question now is to seek regularity conditions on the forsake, which lead to energy. On the forsake, which lead to energy balance from the solutions of the oil equations. Why do we want to do this? Because low regularity flows are a natural consequence for turbulence, and forcing is one of the preferred mechanisms to generate such low regularity flows. Okay, so I need to add something more to the notion of physically realizable forcing, and I'm going to add the condition that the viscous forces converge weakly to the weakly to the misinforcing term L1 in time to L2. Okay, so the first interview that we had along these lines, which was just myself with multiple objects fusion, said that if you have a physically realizable weak solution with an external forcing which is L1 and L2, then if for some p greater than 1, the initial vorticity belongs to Lp, and the initial vorticity And the initial vorticity is converge strongly in Lp, and the curl of the forcing is bounded. And L1 and time Lp intersect L infinity in time L2, then use energy balance. The proof of this was very complicated, actually. Very complicated. But we really weren't happy with this theorem because the conditions 2 and 3 were too strong, and especially 3 was way too strong. And especially three, was way too strong. So now we have this new result with Samuel and Fabian, and here's the result. So if you have a physically realizable solution with external forcing at L1 times L2, and you assume that actually the forces are a little better, they're L2 and time and L2, they converge strongly. The viscous forces converge strongly to the Strongly to the emissive force of L2L2, then U is energy balanced if and only if you have a strong convergence in L2L2. Okay. All right. Some observations. If you don't have stock convergence, you don't have energy enough. Exactly. Within this regularity assumptions for the forcing. Exactly. Okay, so. Okay, so this hypothesis 1, which is that the forces are in L2, L2, this is sort of a minimal assumption that we need to control vorticity. Because when you do estimates for vorticity, you have a term here, which is F mu omega nu times curl of F. You throw your curl onto the vorticity, you get F mu times the grad curve of omega nu, the polymer, I guess. The political, I guess, and then you have to you need some control on the L2 pi squared. That's not going to have to integrate that in time, you need control L2 in time. Okay, now, hypothesis two, that the four things have to converge strongly, that cannot be weakened. It's not enough to assume that the four sings converge weakly. And you can see that with the following counterexample. So you take uνu to be x per corpus. So you take u nu to be x per power x squared times this rapidly oscillating vector field. You take f nu to be the difference. The obvious thing dt mu nu minus mu Laplace mu nu. The non-linear term disappears because this is radially symmetric. And this converges weakly to u equals 0, and f equals forces converge weakly to 0, the u and u converge weakly to 0. The forcing does not converge to 0. The force n does not convert strongly to F, and of course, zero is energy balanced, obviously. It'll therefore, there you go. You need to have the strong convergence in order to get, I'm sorry, you need to have the strong convergence of the forces in order to get the strong convergence of the velocities and get an energy problem. Okay, so we can hypothesis. Here's a very brief discussion of the proof. Here's a very brief discussion of the proof. Step one, we have to establish temporary estimates, which are fairly easy. We have to deal with the forcing term and the squared space L2, L2, which is not natural for diverse stokes, but there you go. Step two, energy balance applies strong convergence again. This is the easy side. It's a little variation on what we had before. You just integrate in time the Euler flow. That's less than or equal by reflow or semi-pathlude limiting from. We flowers and limit of the integral of time of the viscous flow of the viscous energies, which is soup, and then you use the dissipation of energy for Never Stokes. And you use the fact that Fνu converges strongly to F, and U nu converges in principle to T. Okay? So you get this. And again, all the less than or equal to signs become equal signs because you're assuming energy balance. Energy balance. Okay. Step three: strong convergence implies energy balance. That's the hard one. And the key lemma that we need is this. If you have something which is pre-compact, diff-free, then there exists a function, a superlinear function sigma, such that the integral from, well, we're saying delta here, but it could be even zero. Okay, the integral of the answer. zero. The integral of the entropy squared, which at time zero, it's infinite. But the integral still is squared times this slightly superlinear function is less than or equal to your dissipation. Dissipation of instrument. So this object here is playing the role of that 2 plus epsilon power in the energy of a poly. Problem is that this is integrated in time. That this is integrated in time. Now, there we go. So, the level allows us to obtain a differential inequality, which says that d dt of the full dissipation that I want is bounded by y squared times c. We then show that if y is increasing, a set of increasing functions such that satisfying this differential quality, then the limit is vanished, viscosity vanishes as you see. And there you have that the full dissipation vanishes. So continuity in timeline allows you to take delta looks enough to go to zero. Okay, so that's really the lead of the thing. And it's still based on this original idea back from our work with Roman and Alexei from 2016, that you have to get something a little bit better than power 2 in something. In something. We did it for the anstrophy. This is done for the full dissertation. All right, so let me give you some examples. So the main example that I want to discuss, which is the biggest example actually, but I want to go some most stuff, is a modified Lorentz space, L1Q. And that is a subset. That's not weak L1, that's a subset of L1. And here's the definition: it's the functions in L1 such that they integrate over to. 1 such that they integral over to the side of the torus of ms of omega to the q, ds over s to the 1 over q is finite. And ms is basically the distribution function. It's the mass, the vorticity in a set of Lebesgue measure S. Okay, so it's well known that L1Q embeds compactly into H minus 1 if Q is strictly less than 2. Of 2. 2 is equal to 2, you don't have a compact embedding, you have a continuous embedding. Moreover, this was something that was observed by Pierre Lilio, L1 to this modified Lorentz space, is the largest rearrangement invariant space, subspace of L1, which is continuously embedded into H minus 1. Okay. In his book on fluid mechanics, Volume 1, Volume 1, Incompressible Flows. Purely Oil has the following compactness criterion. I'm crediting this to him because I don't know anywhere else that this has been done. I think it was really him. And it's actually even comprehensive. So here's the proposition. If you have a sequence or a family in L12, it's going to be pre-compact if it's bounded in L12, and when you have a compound, And when you get near this singularity at s equals 0, take the sup and n, the limit as delta equals to 0, this object has to vanish. Okay. So we want to use, of course, omega n to be omega nu. It takes some kind of sequence of viscosities for some physical realization of a physically realizable big solution. Step one, we need to bound ms of omega nu. MS of omega nu in terms of initial data. And that's done by operator splitting, and that's how you prove that actually if you are in a rearrangement invariant space at the beginning of your initial data and your forces are in a rate rearrangement invariant space, then the never-Stokes will evolution will keep that there, L infinity intact. Okay, and then we also have the following proposition. The following proposition. In fact, that's, yeah, this is what we do by operator splitting. If you have a solution of neighbor scopes with force in Fν, and if you look at the curl of F nu, it has to belong to L1, L1, then this MS, I don't know, it's like a distribution function of the viscous vorticity in time t is bounded by the initial data and the force. Every S. Sorry. For each S. For each S. For each S. Yes, for each S. Okay, so proof I said this operator split. Okay, so we can use this bound plus the compactness criterion to establish energy balance for vorticities and forcing in L1, 2. That's our main example. We have the following theorem. This is the main theorem. If you use physical realizable with F and L1 and L2, and use And L2 and u is L2. But then we assume that omega naught belongs to this modified Lorentz space L12 and g nu belongs to L1 times L12. If additionally, we have uniform bounds on omega naught nu in L12, and for G nu, and L1 in L1 in time in L12, uniform decay of the vorticity initial data, uniform decay of the time average force. Uniform decay of the time average forsake, then the unit will be compact in C0TL2, and use an energy balanced solution. It's like the best theorem that we could do. Okay, so let me give you some conclusions. First of all, the Anzager scaling is not the last word on invisiblication. There is a dynamical mechanism to avoid anomalous dissipation in TBD, and this should be kind of a very important. And this should be contrasted with what happens in 3D, in particular, in Joluka's talk from Tuesday, I guess, right? I had asked Joluka whether his forces converge strongly in L2, and I think they do, probably. But that would be an example in 3D where you don't have the same things. You have strong convergence, and yet you don't have energy conservation. Our 2D winter physical reliable solutions are L. physical realizable solutions are L infinity into W1P for any P greater than 1, and therefore they're not attainable through convex integration. That's another take-home that we get, and so it somehow supports a 2D selection principle. The vanish of Viscassia limit being a selection criteria is something that goes back to Bardo's TT and Lieberman, when they looked at shear flows in 3D. The vanish of Viscasia. The manager development was costing to select one solution among infinite possibilities. Another observation is that there's some work that we did on symmetry breaking that's avoided by statistically realizable locations. By this I mean if you start with an initial data which is two-dimensional, then if you're vanishing viscosity, you're forced to remain two-dimensional. If you're not vanishing viscosity, you could break that symmetry and become three-dimensional. But this is work that Milton and I did with Claude Baardos, Don Chunyu, and with Lis T a long time ago, ten years ago. Jesus. Okay, so I don't think I was that old. All right, so other approximations that have been considered smooth solutions, i.e., you modify your initial data and exactly solve the smooth equations. The vortex-blob method. Vortex-Blob method for P, local energy balance for peak variables over five. This is stuff that was looked at by Joan Luca and his group, John Siampa and Stefan Spiritu. And Euler-Alpha approximation, again, by Abate, Pripa, and Spiritu this year. There's been one extension of this kind of work to 3D, which is for access by. To 3D, which is for access metropoid or no swirl, but binobile and size in 202. This is a little bit weird because it's an anisotropic. So the criticality is a little weird. Okay, so this is what there's what they prove. If the sporticity omega naught over r is an LP for p greater than 3 over 2, then you again get energy conservation. What happens? Conservation. What happens in the case p equals 1? Up for graphs? Is that the last row? Yes. Okay. We have no tools. So I want to call attention that there's a discrepancy with respect to what we know about conservation of L P norms of vorticity, because it has been established by Joe Luca and his group that the vorticity is, if it starts at L1, it stays in L1, and the L1 load is considered. And the L11 is conserved. And there should be some parallel between that and conservation of energy. We don't know. And I think that what's at stake here is exactly the same as what we know about the over-time solutions where you have no concentrations in vorticity, but you might have concentrations in energy. So we're trying for a slightly less ambitious project, but still majorly ambitious, to show that if you start with vorticity in L1 and you're physically In L1, and you're physically realizable, then you cannot be attainable by convex integration methods. All right, so that's what I wanted to say on the mathematical side. And I do want to make a little bit of propaganda. I want to take advantage of, what do I have, like two minutes? A little bit of propaganda of a new journal. I'm one of three managing editors. This is a new journal of Umalpa. Umalpa is the main association. Is the main association in mathematics in Latin America and the Caribbean. And this is a journal that was started. I think we started taking submissions this year. I'm not sure. I don't remember. But I think it was this year we've been doing fairly well. We've been very selective, which is good. You wouldn't believe the papers that we've, the authors who've rejected papers. But at this point, the journal. But at this point, the journal is doing pretty well. We already have four acceptances, and I would like to invite all of you to submit your very best work to Obita Matabache. It would be a great pleasure to publish. Okay, thank you. Who's the publisher? Who's the publisher? The one you like. MSP. MSP. The ecstasy metric, I mean if you go to helical flows, that should still work, right? It should. I mean, it should have a result for helicopter flows as well. Yes. Problem is that you're breaking symmetry, so it's kind of hard to get. So it's kind of hard to get something meaningful in terms of the criticality to establish whether this is a supercritical, subcritical, it's that. So in the case of L1 for the TCTV, and L1 case for TCTV in Mirror. We can't. We can't. We don't know what happens now what? We don't know what happened in L1. The closest we get to L1 is this L12. That's the closest. You can try to control the initial data with don't finish your notes. But something you did for the. Okay, I'm sorry, I can't. I'm really hard up here. Sorry. It means you can try to just find initial data in everyone over this.
