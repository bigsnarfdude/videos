Good morning everyone. So let's start our web section session. And our first speaker is James Reiter. Speaks about degrees of non-pinemaro. Thanks. Okay. So yeah, like I indicated, I would first tell you about the motivations for this, which will be around certain transcendence results in differential equations. Transcendence results in differential equations, but then pretty quickly I'll stop talking about that and talk about some general model here. So okay, so the motivations are like this. You have some general differential equation of order m. It's an algebraic differential equation, and we're thinking about the theory d. And we're thinking about the theory DCL0. And this is, so this is a polynomial in x and its first n many derivatives and one variable, although there's no reason for that restriction except that it makes it easier to talk about. And so many problems in algebraic. Algebraic differential equations basically boil down to understanding the algebraic relations between Solutions of this equation. I guess I'll call it star. And yeah, I wrote it that way to be quick, but I really mean algebraic relations between the solutions and their derivatives. So that is algebraic relations between The set of things delta to the i a sub j, where i goes from 0 to n minus 1. Of course, there's no reason to put n because we understand the algebraic relation once you get to n. And some number of solutions, say one. And some number of solutions, say one through n. Let me assume that all this is over some differential field K. All right. And so, yeah, and so let me just give some rough examples from fairly recent times. So, for instance, So, for instance, there's a series of papers starting about a decade ago by Rani and Anand, in which they show, well, for any Pan-Levi equation, but in particular, say, for the second Pan-Levi equation. When the parameter is transcendental, there are no algebraic relations over C of T. Here, C of T is K. There are no, yeah, there are, there are, thank you. Yeah, there are no algebraic relations over C of T between any number of solutions. So all of the solutions are completely as algebraically independent as they could be. And again, there I mean a solution. There, I mean, a solution and its first derivative. Of course, there's no reason to include the second derivative. Okay, and okay, so part of the motivation, I guess, is sort of what can be proved. I mean, could you prove anything non-trivial in general about this situation? And hopefully, some people already recognize, of course, this has something. I mean, the method by which they prove this is that they. Proved this is that they noticed that some results of Nishioka implied that this is a strongly minimal set, and then they characterized the geometry of that set as being trivial, and I really mean like completely trivial in the sense that ACL is nothing. Okay. So, in other words, So, in other words, um let me uh let me now uh let's say that C ampolts of star if um between uh any um M solutions there are no algebraic relations. Then, in general, you can see that Just because of the way the condition's formulated, that property, I mean, the higher numbered properties imply the lower ones. They're just a special case. I don't know. I needed some letter. This is what I chose. No reason. I could change it. I could change it to D if you like. So, in fact, so what Nakmu and Palai showed, formulated in this language, hopefully you can see, is that CN holds. Holds. Okay. And so, in fact, what we ended up proving using the methods that I'll talk about in the Using the methods that I'll talk about in this talk, is that something I think pretty surprising to us is true, that for any differential equation as above, turns out that we proved that C3 implies Cn. Cn for all n. So somehow you'll get a hint of how this happens in the talk. This is a, I guess this is a theorem by Rahim and I. And there's some interesting special case of the theorem. The argument is really due to, it's in the same paper, but it's really due to It's really due to Remy, and the details were worked out by the three of us. If the field K is contained in the constant field, then C two implies CN for all. For all. This was really surprising. So, this says: if you want to check whether there are any non-trivial algebraic relations between any number of solutions, you only have to check C3 or C2. I left out a hypothesis, of course. It's not true for equations of order one. I'll give you a I'll give you a picture of why that's not true. I mean not. Or maybe I should just give the example. Yeah, maybe I should give the example. So it's not true for equations of order one. And the example is pretty simple. It's well known. And it's an important class of equations that are. It's an important class of equations that are frequently studied. So if you take an equation like this with R and C of T and you have the property that Let me call this equation starlight. If there are no algebraic solutions to this equation, then it turns out that C3 holds. But But C4 fails. And I'll try to explain why that is, why it has to do actually with model theory, but the short answer is that the binding group of this equation is PGL2, which Which acts three transitively on the solution set. And what that means is that any three solutions to the equation fit in a Morley sequence, but any fourth solution to the equation does not. Any fourth solution to the equation, no. Of the equation can be written as a certain rational function of the first three and an arbitrary constant. What about polar coefficients? A1 and racial polar coefficients. Then C2 implies Cn for all that. Yeah, what you can prove is that the only way that that wouldn't be the case is if the binding group were to be too transitive. To be too transitive. And if you look at it, you can prove in that case that the binding group has a non-trivial center. And then you can prove that such an algebraic group with a certain action can't be two transit points. Yeah. Questionable. Yeah, so really it's kind of the, it's the only thing that you have. This kind of Riccati equation is the only reason you have to assume that. have to assume that there there's not there's not examples that are like somehow over the constants okay so good okay so that's all I'll say really about differential equations as such so next I want to talk about this notion of degree of non-minimality or This notion of degree of non-minimality, or actually some more general things. Okay, right. Okay, so throughout, I guess if I would be thinking that so E is a stable type. I'm not really going to prove anything in this kind of general setting, but I think all the definitions make sense, and one maybe could prove things in this setting, so I'll formulate them here. Then canonical base of Of forking extension P is in the ACL of some finite initial segment of a Morley sequence E. No, pardon me? Pardon me? Not from the finite? How do you get it finite? Are you something like a stable? No, I don't think so. It's still true. Do you? Super stability. Otherwise, you have cantables, then. Yes, super stability. Yes, super stability. Okay, okay, so yeah, maybe if you take the canonical basis of a four-double forks, then it would be enough. Also, I don't prove anything about this. So it's not the canonical base, but there is forks, then there is a finite space such that we force the final. Okay, so really, I'm interested in the case where. So really, I'm interested in the case where T is super stable. I think you could formulate this in, yeah, like I said, in a good deal of generality, which I quickly tried to do, but okay, so, but the point is: if you have a formula witnessing forking than some finite, then it will be. Then it will be witnessed over some finite Morley sequence in the type. And so when T is yeah, so again T is super stable, I want to define the degree of non-minimality of P to be P to be the minimal length of such Morley sequence such that the forking extension is not Is not algebraic. Which one? For some specifics? Some. So for some footprints. So minimal overall footprint. So I mean, let me say the case that I have in mind. So if you have, and why it's called this, so. Why it's called this. So if you have u, u rank of p bigger than 1, then there is some forking extension of rank greater than or equal to 1. So that's exactly not algebraic. And so what we're asking is that So what we're asking is that what we're asking for is the minimal length of this tuple A1 through AK so that there's a forking extension which witnesses in a way that the U rank is bigger than 1. It's a forking extension whose rank is at least 1, so it tells you the U rank of P is. So it tells you the U rank of P is at least two. Yeah, I always witness normality by name, so enable type, extension. So so what's your question? Suppose this is not L plus one, so this is a fortune extension. Can you always meet this by a route for type? Ah, that's a good question. In the way yeah, in the way I've defined it, that's not necessary. So part yeah. So, part yeah, let me finish right. Um, so Okay, so sorry, what's the rule of k here? Yeah, that's the degree of non-minimality. Yeah, so the minimal length, which I'm calling K, it's the length of this tuple. I'm a bit confused, so the type Q is not different every P1 in P. I mean, the type Q. P is over the empty side, let's say. Or else, you know, there's some parameter set A, and A is P is over A and Q is over A together with A1 through AK. But just assume it's over the empty set for ease of reference. Okay, now, kind of similar to Sergei's question, you might define something a little more general, I think. You might define, say, I don't know, I would call it the alpha 4k degree or something. And so and this is, let's say, the length of the Of a Morley sequence A1 through AK over which P has a forking extension of rank forking extension Q of rank. Q of rank, well, at least alpha. So the A1AK are actually a realization of the type Q, right? Not of the type P. I mean they're realizations of the type P. As well. But they are not a modicum of P because Q are forks. Q at four of us. Yeah. I mean, maybe I'll let Morley take the stop q, which one is which one of the what's mean? A1 through a k are independent, and if you take the next element in the Morley sequence, it forks over A1 through AK. I'm going to take Morley sequence in Q and watch it as a look at it as a disease of P. And you ask, minimalize K is not Molly sequence. It's the same. Yeah. So A1 through AK are independent realizations. So meaning modes so that you may assume that they are independent of each other. Yeah, yeah. I'm choosing K. Yeah, it's a lemma you can prove, I won't mention it now, that you can always do this for, that the minimal such k can always be realized by a Morley sequence. One has to prove. Of P. Of P. Okay. So there. There are examples which show when you take alpha. So, I mean, of course, the relationship is that the degree of non-minimality is like f zero, or sorry, f one of p. So there are examples. So, there are examples showing, you know, you know, so for instance, F2 of P can be strictly greater than the non-minimality degree. That doesn't exactly answer your question. That doesn't exactly answer your question. You're kind of asking the opposite: whether you can, whether the minimal formulated it, I just rebar greater than or equal to. But yeah, the answer to your question should be no. You can't always make it that way. Sometimes you should. Sometimes you should be able to build a type which really has a, well, maybe from the examples I'll give, you'll see what's at stake and what would have to be done. Okay, right. Okay, so let me say some kind of obvious things about this notion and then tell you what we know and don't know. Okay, so So let's let A satisfy this, A be a realization of this type. So again, it's over the empty set, or you can make that a no problem with doing that. Um proper vibration is an element. So, an element in the DCL of A together with little A such that A is not in the ACL of A together with D. So if you think about it, what it's like is here you've got this type P, the type of A, the type of little A. Of little A over A. And there's some map to another type, the type of B over A, say? And the type, so the, I mean, this is a definable map because we have map because we have L condition, but the fibers of this map are not final. And so yeah, I mean, okay. Yeah, I want otherwise. O otherwise there's I think you can't have can't have what I'm saying happens happen to answer I think Martin's question Okay, so maybe you can see it's not too hard that to see that if P has proper vibration Yeah. I mean, if Martin, if B were at the break over A, A would also be, and that would be CL of A. No, no. No, no. Yeah, B should not be in ACL of A. No. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're right. You're right. Okay. Okay, fine, yeah. Sorry, Martin's right. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So it's not hard to see that if P has a If P has a proper vibration, then the degree of non-minimality will be one. I mean, if, as long as. Yeah. So, I mean, the way to see this is that you take one realization of the type P, and then take its image, and then look at the fiber over the image. That will give you a forking extension of P. That will give you a forking extension of p. Okay? So that, so then the k here will just be will be one. You'll have a forking extension, and it won't be algebraic because of this condition here. So it might be natural to ask whether this is the only way, but it's not. The non-inimatric degree being k means k plus 1 will fork. Yes, correct. Yeah, so it means there's a Morley sequence of length 2 so that the second element forks over the first. Yeah. Or sorry, there's an indissertible sequence in B. Yeah, I'm saying this wrong because one of the. Yeah, I'm saying this wrong because my k is your k plus minus one. So it's actually plus plus, right? I mean, so the non-mini-metative degree one means actually two relationships. So yeah, but it is true that I think that giving such an example, I mean, at least in DCF, it's pretty. At least in DCF, it's pretty hard to come up with such an example. In general, I think it shouldn't be too hard. Okay. Now, but the point is, if we're really interested in understanding this invariant, then non-minimality degree, we can kind of assume that Assuming that P has no proper vibrations, then there's a result of Rahim. Rahim and Anand from, I don't know, five or six years ago. Although maybe there's, I wouldn't be surprised if variants of this result existed previously. And what it says is that P is one of either two things. The first is internal to R, non-locally modular and minimal, or P is internal. Is interalgebraic with a power of a modular type modular minimal type. I mean, this is in the finite rank context. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, yes. But up to inter-algebrasity, of course. Up to inter-algebricity, of course, over the same base, it's invariant. And if you look in their theorem, this inter-algebricity happens to be over the same base. And it's very easy to see that such a type has degree of non-minimality one. So examples where it changes possibly changes. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah. But as you'll see, only changes by one because I can tell you what we know. I can tell you what we know. So, when you say internal, you mean internal or almost internal? I mean internal, actually. Yeah, yeah, actually internal. So, right, okay, so they proved this. When you say modular, you mean modular, you mean locally modular? Yeah, I mean it's actually modular in their proof. If it was locally modular, then I wouldn't say that you could ness it. I wouldn't say that you couldn't then then maybe it's all in TQ, right? Yeah, all in TQ. Okay, so let me just say a general remark. It seems Remark. It seems difficult to find types with a degree of non-minimality bigger than one. And I mean, concretely, well, maybe I should say it's difficult for him and I, it seemed very difficult. For heaven and I, it seemed very difficult. We constructed several types. We built several with NM degree two. But yeah, then in the context of where the theory is DCF0, DCF0. It's a theorem of Rahim, okay, yeah, of myself, Remy, and Rahim that the degree of non-minimality is at most two, which explains why it was so hard. Too, which explains why it was so hard for us. We actually don't have any example in any omega-stable theory where the degree of non-minimality is bigger than 2. So it would be interesting to find such an example. Okay, so let me say how Let me say the kind of result that we've proved in general then. So we have to make some assumptions. So now we're now going to assume I was up for your example, the Riccati equation. Well, the Riccati equation, the degree of non-generality, it's a case where the rank of the type is 1. So how... Yeah, so how you want to define it is a matter of notation, but it doesn't affect a theorem like this. Okay. So assuming T is omega stable, P has. Has a finite U rank and okay, I'm always assuming T has EI. But now a real assumption that is true in many interesting examples, but you might object more to. Every Non-locally modular minimal type Q is non-orthogonal to one over the empty set. You don't need to assume. You don't need to assume the empty set to make the theorem work, but the kind of example that would ruin the kinds of theorems I'm about to say would involve a theory where there's many orthogonality classes of non-locally modular types and they require more and more parameters to be defined. Of course, I don't know that that rubins in theorem is but. That ruins the theorems, but well, okay. So, all right, okay. So, what do we prove in this setting? So, then we prove a conditional statement first, and I'll explain the conditional statement.  So, what we prove is that if a certain conjecture called the Borvik-Cherling conjecture holds in T, then the degree of non-minimality is at most the U rank plus 2. Of course, that's fairly embarrassingly far from two. But I mean, that's why you can improve it. Okay. Okay. Um why this why the whole non-minimality degree relates to the CM uh condition? Uh maybe I completely yeah yeah well that's because it's not obvious but since since forking in DCF has to do with transcendence degree if you can prove the degree of non-minimality is at most two then that tells you that that together with knowledge about binding That, together with knowledge about binding groups of rank 1 types, tells you that C3 implies Cn for all N. Okay. Yeah, it's not obvious then. Okay, so in the last several minutes, I'll try to tell you what the Borvik-Turlin conjecture is. Okay, so in general, the reason that this comes up is because of this result of Rahim and Anand. Of Rohemian on it. So we have to handle the situation in order to control the degree of non-minimality. We have to handle the situation where P is R internal. And so, and this is non-locally modular. So, this is the sort of salient case for proving a result like this. And so, then you can look at the Then you can look at the binding group of P over R. This is a definable group and it acts transitively on realizations of P. You assume here is these two, right? Yeah, I'm assuming the degree of non-minimality is at least one. And then it will, yeah. Or two in omicron's. I disagree with the CI condition, but I think that it's okay. So so um So, um, all right. So we say, so whenever you have G acting on a set X definably, let's say transitively, we say so we saw yesterday from the U.S., and we have a lot So we saw yesterday from Frank's open problems that acting with a high degree of transitivity, especially if you assume sharpness, is a very restrictive condition. In fact, there's, for instance, once n is more than 3, it just doesn't happen. But we're going to consider a weaker condition, generic and transitivity. If you consider the action of G on Of g on x to the n, given like the diagonal action, so coordinate wise. I'll formulate it this way because this makes sense in a very general context. Yeah, you should assume it more than degree. Degree. Yeah, you need to assume like X is irritable in some sense for this to make sense. Or you can define generic as like the complement has lower rank or something like that if you want to do it generally. But there's not really a reason. Okay. And so what the Borbic, so I mean, you could draw a quick picture to understand this. So if you draw like two spaces. So, if you draw like two-space, well, like a two-transitive action has two orbits. One orbit is the diagonal, and the other orbit is as large as it can be. This is how the picture of two-transitive looks. But generic two-transitivity is like this. Transitivity is like this, but like a little bit weaker. There's still a diagonal orbit, and then there could be some other orbits. I'll draw in white. But they're small. There's still a big orbit. Okay, and so I'll just finish by saying what is the Borvik-Churling conjecture and how you can see that it relates to this. So, Borvik-Churling conjecture that Churling conjecture that if G acting on X is generically then transitive and the Morley of X is K, then n is less than or equal to K plus 2. It's k plus 2. And there's a strong form of the conjecture where, in the case where this is an equality and not an inequality, that the group is something very specific. And that k plus 2 is exactly where this u rank plus 2 comes from. And the extremal case is, of course, used. Okay, so I'll finish there. Thanks. Yes, thanks. Thank you. So do you know if this notion is preserved under interoperability? So if you have a relax, for example, I mean uh do you know if the like so you were asking about the normality in that three or so. Three or some omega stay total. Do you know the theory of compares for the magnetosphere? Yeah, I think that one can prove that. So I said we proved it for DCF0, but what we really proved was for this setting here, but where you have a good understanding of the groups definable in the theory. Definable in the theory, and you would have a good understanding of the binding groups that can appear in the theory. You mean pairs of algebraic and close fields, right? Yeah, it's a reduction. Yeah, of course. So yeah, so I think you can prove it in that setting, but yeah. More questions? Anything known about this conjecture when it's true? Yeah. So, okay, yeah, so I could say something about that. I think that there's, well, okay, so it's true. Well, okay, so it's true. Let me just summarize what's known very quickly. So, Borvik Schirlin, when the Morley rank of P equals 1, this is a result of Ryschovsky, plus P. X. This is from the mid-1980s, I guess, or Mysticism. Mid-1980s, I guess, or mesthesis maybe. When the Morley rank of x equals 2, this is a result of Altonil and Wiscons. There's various special cases which are too complicated for me to formulate in like a minute due to Borovic, where you assume something about the transitivity. Something about the transitivity of the group action, not just the generic transitivity. So there's many special cases due to Gorvik plus collaborators, plus many collaborators. Berkman, Karamucci, etc. There's many people who became involved in that. And then the case, which is pertinent to some of Some of the things I talked about at the beginning is when it's the case where the theory T is algebraically closed fields with characteristic zero. It's just the case for algebraic groups and characteristic zero. So Rahim and I did this. And I mean, interestingly, I think it is. Interestingly, I think it is open for characteristic people. It hasn't been done, although it seems quite doable for the right person. We are out of time, sorry, so that's nine fifty-five. Okay, just Just click on page already. I didn't say that it was already.
