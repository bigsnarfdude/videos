Thank you, everybody, for being here. So, I'm going to tell you about some joint work with Ty Liedman and Rafael Center, and really, I should be more honest. And the important part is to talk about irreducible SU2 representations. But part of what I want to do is just tell you what I mean by, you know, toroidal homology. You know, toroidal homology and irreducible suture representations, right? So the motivation is this conjecture is one of the Kirby problems. So the conjecture is that if M is a closed connected three manifold that is not the three sphere, then the fundamental group admits a non-trivial SU2 representation. And by that, what I mean is simply a homomorphic. A homomorphism between the fundamental group and SU2, where SU2 is this compact Lie group and really topologically is the three-sphere. So I just I'm going to consider these two by two matrices with complex entries and such that the determinant is That the determinant is one. Okay? And I think that you can hear my not very quiet cat, so I apologize. And now our theorem is, well, you know, we're not going to quite prove the conjecture. Of course, this is a very hard conjecture. But in the case where we have a toroidal homology sphere, then we're going to show that the conjecture is, in fact, true. And so as a little motivation, and I As a little motivation, and I know I'm really not a three-manifold topologist. And so if somebody wants to jump in at this point, I will be very happy to learn from you too. But this is sort of what I have come to understand is the importance of representations of three-manifold groups. So for example, let me just, I know that here I said closed, but let's say the three manifold with The three-manifold with boundary case. Let me just do one simple example, which is if we take the complement of the figure eight naught and then we look at representations of this fundamental group to PSL to C. Then this is the way. So right. So, Riley, I think in 1972, showed that there exists such row that is faithful and the image is discrete. And so the conclusion was that then. And so the conclusion was that then that for one, the figure eight knot admits, well, is a hyperbolic knot, let's just say. Sorry, I'm maybe I'm just blanking out here. So sigma is an integral homology. Integral homology sphere, is that right? Right, right. So, in other words. Also, toroidal? Right. Maybe I'm misreading toroidal here. Okay, yeah. So, so let me say what I mean by that. Right, okay. So, so this is maybe let's just leave this as the three-manifold with boundary case. When we have the closed case, for a three-manifold toroidal, it would usually mean that you. Would usually mean that you actually have non-trivial homology, and so you but having those two things simultaneously seems odd to me. It could be a separating force, though. Yes, so what do I mean by toroidal? Okay, so let's let me so the toroidal. What do I mean? No, I think I get it now. The separating, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I'll be more precise. I'll be more precise about what I mean, the topological construction that I want you to have in mind. But for now, let me say that in the three-manifold, the closed three-manifold case, before we had the machinery that we have right now regarding three-manifold groups and the classification of three manifolds in terms of the fundamental groups, except for the torsion portions, we just had very, very little, right? And so here we have, for example, you know, like there's the Poincaré conjecture. There's the Poincaré conjecture that I am mentioning here. And so there was, you know, the quest for non-trivial representations really predates Thurston's work and, of course, Permon's proof. And of course, Permanent's proof of the Poincaré conjecture. Right, and so this is, I mean, similar to what we have here, this in the three-manifold with boundary case, it is a way of finding geometric structures in our three manifolds. But then now there's this question: why as you two representations? So, for example, For example, you know, dihedral representations, meaning representations of any fundamental group, let me just call it pi into a dihedral group in, say, two n elements or well, you know, Well, you know what? These can be regarded as subsets of SU2, the dihedral element, right? So, for example, here's my triangle. So, this would give me the six and the all the rotations of this angle can be regarded as. As we can just realize them as rotations and reflections in R3, and then from there we can just regard them as elements of SU2. This is because, you know, like here I am relating to SO3, but SO3 is a quotient of SU2. So that's, maybe this is too fast, but that's the way in which we can do that. But that's the way in which we can do that. And so, for example, you know, like we do know that if we care about knot detection problems, the Perco pair is a famous pair of knots which were anyway, Perco used dihedral representations to distinguish some nuts. But let me leave it like that. Okay, but now, so my favorite. So, my favorite fact about SU2 representations and not just any other Lie group, right? Why am I talking about SU2 and not maybe here? Why am I not talking about just hyperbolic structures? Is the fact that I have gauge theory. So, let me talk about a little about Casson invariant. So, the Casson invariant, if If I have a three-manifold, I can split it into a Hagar splitting in which I have H plus and H minus are handlebodies. And his idea was, let me do it like that. So the idea of Kazun was, well, Of Kasson was, well, if I want to look at this manifold and I want to think about the representations of this manifold into SU2, really what I can do, I can just look at Vancampent's theorem. This is nothing new. But then, when I am looking at representations, if I want a representation of this type, well, let me just do something here. Let me just change all the arrows. And instead of looking at the fundamental group, let me look at the space of representations. And so, what Casson did. What Casson did was say, Well, let me look at the let me realize the space of representations of my three manifold as an intersection of the space of representations of each one of the handlebodies in the representation space of my surface. And why was this important? Because this. Was this important? Because this is a manifold that has a symplectic structure, and each one of these is a Lagrangian. Okay, so this is the precursor, and then the magical step was this one. Cliff Taubes just realized that, in fact, there's a gauge theoretical counterpart to Casun's invariant. Counterpart to Casson's invariant, and that in fact, if we look at the instanton floor homology, then the Euler characteristic of this instanton fluoro homology is going to be the Casson invariant. Okay, and so that's that's the reason why I am interested in that, and I think that the best tribe. That the best triumph of this train of thought, in my opinion, of course, the best is property P which is a theorem of Kronheimer and Murray. And so, what they And so, what they say is that say we have a knot in S3 and we do our surgery in along K. This means I take the knot exterior and I attach to it a solitaurus in such a way that the meridian of this solitaurus gets attached to the peak. PQ, or let me just instead of saying R P over Q surgery, PQ curve in the boundary of the tubular neighborhood of the nut, right? And so what they say is that there's going to be a representation into as you Into a zoo that is non-trivial as long as this surgery slope is less than two. And so the consequence is that no surgery. Oh, and here I should obviously say non-trivial not. Say non-trivial knot. Sorry, this is very important. But so then, no PQ surgery on a non-trivial knot gives us the three-sphere, and that is what's called property p. Okay. And they use the methods are gauge theoretic. They used instant and floor homology and non-trivial. Instant and floor homology and non-triviality of certain ones. Actually, they have three different proofs, to be honest, using different levels of instant and fluor homology or Donelson's polynomials, but and even reformulation in terms of suture manifolds. Okay, so let me just very briefly say this I already talked about. This I already talked about. We are basing our work on a theorem of Raphael Zendler, in which he had already told us that homomorphism to SL2C we already have. And again, we also know that for some choices of three manifolds, Y actually homology spheres. And I'll say Y homology spheres in a second. But if we have a ciphered fibrous space, If we have a ciphered fibrous space, then fintosional and STERN tells us that we have non-trivial representations. If we have twofold covers, twofold branch covers, as long when the determinant is one, so that we actually have an integer homology sphere, we also have representations. This is again Kron-Hammer and Muroca. If we know that our three-manifold is the boundary of a stein manifold, then Balden-N-Seebeck tells us. Manifold, then Balden and Cvec tells us that it's none. And this is the example that I want us to keep in mind, which is when we take two not complements and glue them together. That's, I'm going to say a little bit more on that, but that's sort of like the basic example that I want. Now, why irreducible and why homology spheres? Because if I have a three-manifold and I have a betting number, then I have, I start with the I have. I start with the fundamental group of my three-manifold. I take the Herovix map to the abelianization. If I have first-betting number positive, then I know that I'm just going to be able to have a, I will have a subjection to Z. And then from Z to S U2, I can just choose any non-trivial angle theta. And then I'm going to have an abelian image. And so that's, we just get them for free. So that's, that's not their. So that's not very interesting, and that's why we just want to focus on the irreducible case. Okay, so this is the strategy. I am going to tell you exactly what I want you to think about when I say toroidal homology sphere. I'm very briefly going to tell you how to do it in terms of the instant on floor homology. And then I'm going to talk about the pillowcase or the space of representations of the two torus. Of the two torus. And this is going to be in analogy to what Casson had done over here, in which he was able to produce a surface that was dividing the three, splitting the three manifold into two. And then it ended up being that the topology of that representation space gave him the answer that he was looking for. And so we're just going to, for us, that two manifold is going to be the two Taurus. Why the two Taurus? Okay. Two tours. Why the two torus? Okay, so for me, um, that the the the three manifolds I'm going to be thinking about are three manifolds that are splices, meaning I have a notch K1 in a homology sphere Y1, and same thing for K2 and Y2. And then I'm just going to glue them in such a way that the longitude of this first notch goes to the meridian of the second and the meridian. Meridian of the second, and the meridian of the first one goes to the meridian of the second. That's what I'm going to call as a splice. Okay. And so that's, so to answer your question, Jennifer, this is what I mean by toroidal homologous beer, really. And what I want, so then there are going to be some other qualifications that I am going to ask, and these have to do with finding the representations. The representations. If, well, if I don't have that is boundary incompressible, then I might no longer be a toroidal three-manifold. If I have that one of them is reducible, then I can just look at the irreducible. Now thinking entirely in terms of representations, I can choose to only work on the irreducible portion. And if one of these is say Y1 or Y2 already admit an SU2. Already admit an SU2 representation, then we can just use, we can promote that representation to a representation of the entire toroidal homology sphere. So I'm just going to assume that each one of the two homology spheres is a pseudo-cyclic, meaning it does not admit no irreducible representations. So, this is it. This is really what I want you to have in mind. We're going to have this splice, and then this very important, this is my torus. So, toroidal by toroidal means I have this beautifully wonderful torus that is going to help me so much. Okay, so then the pillowcase. So, what is the pillowcase? So, the pillowcase is nothing other than the space of representations of the tutorials. Of the tutorials. Why do we call it a pillowcase? Because it looks like a pillowcase. So because this group is abelian, then I know that the image on SU2 is going to be one of the maximal abelian tori. And so up to conjugation, I give the EC, the DS1 in SU2, right? Like the. In SU2, right? Like the simplest circle that we have, like the equatorial circle in S3, say, if we think of SU2 as the three-sphere. And so then, well, we can first reduce to a fundamental domain in which we have 2π over 2π. But because I also, because if it is up to conjugation, you know, conjugation by this element, 0, 1. 0, 1 minus 1, 0 gives me the negative, and so I can actually my fundamental domain reduces to half, and then there are some identifications, and this portion identifies with this, and this portion identifies with this, and that's how I get the pillow piece. Okay, so this is this is just a nice space. I mean, it's a, it's, this is basically a two-sphere with four orbifold points. But why do I care about so let me just Do I care about? So, let me just show you this example. So, this is the representation space or the image of the representation space for the left-handed trefoil. So, I have two copies. And now I'm going to form this place. So, what I do in the splice, again, in the splice, I take the meridian of one side and I take it to the longitude of the other one. So, in terms of, so these, these are the These, these are the pillowcases. This is from the perspective of the tubular neighborhood of the second torus knot. But if I want to use only the pillowcase of the first knot, then what I have to do is I have to take this pillowcase and I have to draw it here, right? So here I would have this. Right, so here I would have this, but then because of the identifications that I mentioned here, then it's the same thing as taking this portion that I should have over here, it's this portion here. And so here I win. I'm done. So here's what I want you to notice. Here, this curve sort of wraps around in this direction of the pillowcase. So does this one. And so because when I tilt this one, then the wrapping... Tilt this one, then the wrapping around happens in the other direction. Then I know for sure I'm going to have to have an intersection point. In fact, in this case, I have many. And all of these, so all of these now yellow points, all of these are going to be representations, irreducible representations. And that's it. So, you know, like, so really. And that's it. So, you know, like, so really, what we want to do, I, and there's another thing. It wraps around in this direction, but it doesn't touch the two sides. It stays away from these vertical sides, both of them. So there's the wrapping around and the wrapping around and then the fact that stays away from these ones. And those two are the only facts that I need to guarantee that I have these intersections. And so those are the two facts that I need to prove using instant. Need to prove using instant on floor homology. So, just very fast because I am running out of time, but that my assumptions allow me to do that. So, the fact that I have each one of the components here, I have is SU2 cyclic, it has no SU2 representations, that allowed, and the fact that I have a homology sphere allows me to conclude that the spatial representation is not going to touch the endpoints. The endpoints, and this is because if I had a representation that would intersect this side, then that would give me immediately, I would be able to promote this representation, not from the not exterior, but to the entire Y itself, the entire three manifold itself. There's something similar that happens on the other side. And so, my assumption that I have SU2C click allows me to do that. And then there are, you know, like then the other. And then there are, you know, like then the other two theorems, the wrapping around, you do actually need to use the package of instant and florb. And so the game is that there's zero surgery, has non-trivial instanton homology, and the homology sphere itself has trivial instantone fluoro homology, and that's what tells me that it does wrap around. So I don't have time to go through the proof. I would be happy to talk about that proof. would be happy to talk about that proof with anybody but that's sort of like the key we can just maybe forget about the gauge theory and and the analysis and then just conclude that there we have that wrapping around let me just ignore that uh actually yeah like i think that everything else is very very technical but yeah just just to summarize i have something that stays away and And goes wraps around in the cylinder that we get by cutting along the vertical portions, and that gives me the intersections that I need. So I cannot possibly tell you what the representation is. I am only able to tell you that it exists. But that is enough to say I'm never going to be able to get, for example, S3. I mean, it's silly, but I'm not never going to recover S3. Never going to recover S3 with this construction of a splice between two node exteriors in SU2 cyclic homology spheres. And that is it for today. Thank you. Okay, thank you very much. So are there any questions? So, if we have a moment, and if sir, if no one else has a question, I would love Juanita if you could explain that slide you skipped over where you tell us more about what instant fluoro homology. What it is? Okay. Yeah, yeah, that one there. Okay, excellent. So, basically, instant and fluoro homology is the Morse homology of the chain-Simons functional. Chain-Simons functional. Right, so what's the so in classic Moore's homology? You take a function, say here I have my two torus and I take the height function, and I can form a chain complex that will compute the CW homology, the singular homology of the space using as generator the critical points of my Morse function. So here I have these four critical points. The differentials are going to be the counter. Are going to be the count of flow lines of my function, and then the grading is going to be given by the index of the critical points. And so then, Flores version is we take all of the space of little s u2 or R3 valued one forms on my three manifold. That's just a form. And so I can form the watch, I can take derivatives, take the watch product, I form this very strange form, but then I just integrate it. That's a function. I just integrated. That's a function. And we can, if we use the machinery of Moore's homology, of course, the technical details are, you know, like there are technical details involving Moore's homology in the classical version. The technical details in this generalization are much greater. But if you look at the equivalent chain complex, and this is the key, in this case, key. In this case, the different generators are SU2 representations. And that's the miracle that we have a chain complex in which the generators are as U2 representations. And so if I have non-trivial, the idea is if I have non-trivial homology, then I have Homology, then I have non-trivial SU2 representation.
