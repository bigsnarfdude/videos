Is it okay? Can you hear us okay over there? Yeah, this isn't good. Before I was on the main screen, so this is much better. Okay, so right. So let me start by telling you what the sort of the model I space is in the context I'm going to talk about. So the Modulized space of n, and n is for me a closed oriented d-dimensional smooth manifold and then as I was saying, I associate to it the To it, the moduli space of M, which I denote by B div M, remembering sort of the fact that this is the classifying space of a topological group. But I'm going to think about this thing in a more concrete way. Namely, well, first is going to be like a model for this thing is going to be, say, the space of embeddings. Embeddings of n in some large Euclidean space. So I take this whole limit here, this whole limit here to make this space contractible, and I portion it by the action of the diffeomorphism group M. And even more concretely, I could think of this volunteer space as As sort of the space of all say manifolds in R infinity, so these are smooth manifolds which are diffeomorphic to M. And the word diffeomorphic here. And the word diffeomorphic here means like orientation, preserving diffeomorphism. Right? So that's the sort of object I'm going to be dealing with. And yeah, and just maybe this may be already known to you, but let me recall it quickly. This is a modelized space because it classifies manifold bundles in the sense that if I take homotopy classes of maps from, say, some nice Say some nice topological space, like a CW complex, for example. Then there is a map here to the, say, the set of smooth manifold smooth end modules over V up to some. Over V up to some notion of isomorphism. And this map is quite explicit. It takes a map to the pullback of a universal or tautological bundle over B. Over B. And this happens to be a bijection. And because of this, the sort of the topological invariance of this space will have some meaning in terms of manifold topology. So let me stress that out because that's what my talk will be about. I guess I can use all of them. So, yeah, so this the invariance of these guys or the typical invariants of these model line spaces are, well, if I take, say, the homotopy groups of these things, this will be by this interpretation that I gave down there. Interpretation that I gave down there, or this bijection I gave down there, this will be smooth, smooth n bundles over spheres, over say even the n sphere. Again, up to isomorphism. So, this is say these are we want to classify some interesting class of smooth models with fiber. Of smooth models with hiber m over the sphere. And even say a sub example of this would be when we take n equals one, which has an even more sort of concrete or dynamical interpretation, if you wish, which because so this pi one would be like pi naught of this by the way this is this thing is By the way, this thing is constructed as a classifying space, and this is just isotopic classes of D fields of M. Right, so that's what we would call in high-dimensional topology the mapping class group of M. Right. So that's for homotopy groups. And the other sort of invariance we care about typically in the context of manifolds, in banifold bundles, would be their ring of characteristic classes. So I can take, say, the k homology of this thing. With sort of any coefficients, and this would be the let me just call it the ring. Well, if I take the whole ring here, the ring of characteristic classes of again smooth and bundles. So, this obviously then. So, this obviously then, well, this is enough motivation to try to compute this invariance for this specific, or for this type of spaces. But the story is that, well, I think we don't know a manifold for which all these groups are known, any of these examples. Well, perhaps this is except maybe the mapping class group. But But even if we cannot compute them, well, there is a weaker form of that question: that is, well, can we say some qualitative information, like are they finitely generated, which would be maybe a first step in trying to compute these things. And that's what I want to mention. So for computations, we can't tell much, but for finiteness properties. For finiteness properties, we can say a lot for a very large class of manifolds. So that's the term I want to stay and discuss. So the theorem, this is due to myself, Manuel Karnich. And Alexander Coopers and says the following: the so let M be a closed connected, let me say oriented, although we can do better than a smooth manifold. Smooth manifold of dimension the and so the first restriction here is that it's going to be a theorem for even dimensional manifolds and the dimension is going to be large, you know, at least at least six and we're going to impose a And we're going to impose a condition on M, namely that its fundamental group is finite. Then, for all, so we're going to show that all these groups, the homotopy groups, and the groups, the cohomology groups, I mean, so degree-wise, these things are going to be finitely generated. Finally generated. Then for K bigger equal then to the groups the groups pi k V M and H K I guess I guess minus one B this end our final key generation. Right, so so then before I tell you anything about the proof of this, or rather the strategy of the of uh how to prove this, uh let me make uh a couple of remarks. Uh A couple of remarks regarding the sort of hypotheses that appear there. So the first one, yeah, so the first one is maybe what happens when case one. And it turns out that that case is, you have to treat that case differently, but that has been done already. And it's actually something we will use. So maybe a remark is that remember that k equals one corresponds to the mapping class group of for these manifolds with finite fundamental groups. So that is so phi zero d of m. So this case is, so this is due to, so the term is true in that case, and it's due to Solivan when pi one is zero. And then there is a generalization of that due to triangaphylo. When pi one is finite. Right, and they show more. So, so pi naught is not abelian in general, right? So, there being finitely generated is not like the best thing you can have. I mean, for abelian groups, like cohomology or higher homotopy groups, that's maybe good information. For non-abelian groups, Good information for non-abelian groups, it's not but they show the stronger thing, namely these are groups of type F infinity. Namely, there is an Eidenberg MacLean space for these groups, which has finitely many cells in each dimension. And the consequence of that is that, well, it has all the good finite psychohomological properties. So they show. Right, so they show they even show more than that, they show that those groups are let me let me just say a little lie here. Let's say that they show that they are arithmetic, although I mean, this is not entirely precise, but maybe the thing to take here is that they have good, I mean, they are of type F infinity and they they have all the good They have all the good cohomological properties. Okay, so they show sort of the strongest thing in particular of type F infinity. Okay, so that's that's for k equals one, and there is also some. And there is also something to say here about the dimension. So, for dimensions, well, for dimension two, the terms is still true, but it follows combining all, you know, all the classical things about, well, I guess it's just no, because we know in dimension two, there is just the sphere. And then there, you can use a result of smell to. Result of smale to that diff of S2 is homotop equivalent to SO3, right? But then in dimension four, and this is remarkable, the term is false, that it doesn't fall. So d equals four. So there are results of Baraglia. And a couple of years, or maybe one year later, Ying Fang, you know, Ying Feng Lin, I believe, they show that if you they found elements in P div n, so here they find like infinitely many. So, here they find like infinitely many copies of the integers when for many, let's say, for many four manifolds simply connected four manifolds like like Baraglia's example is a K-tree surface. Glass example is a K-3 surface, so it's not even like something very bizarre, and then Lean has many more. For some reason, I don't want to use that black, but I don't know why. It's just too cold in that side of Zero. Okay. So, in that sense, I mean, this is like probably the best, I mean, like the best you could. Oh, yeah. And so, the other thing, I will not write this, but when pi one is infinite, this thing doesn't hold like pi naught of d of the torus, or even like pi two p minus three for p prime of div of the torus. Of the if of the torus that has like infinite like infinitely generated torsions of loops there. So, in a sense, this is like optimal at least for even dimensions. So, let me then mention how this is proved. I must say that there was a version of this term for when M was a two-connected manifold, and that's due to connected manifold and that's due to coupers actually and the strategy we're gonna use to show this term is is basically the same except that we had to sort of tweak some some of the arguments but I think it's uh it's good to go over over the the main strategy here um right so strategy So, so the thing starts with picking a so the first thing is we pick a handle decomposition of M and we we're gonna focus on On the sub-manifold made out of handles of index less or equal than two. Right, so but this is a codimension zero sub-manifold, right? Soft manifold which is The union of handles of index less or equal than two. So maybe a picture is so maybe here, like, okay, so this will be a picture like for in for Okay, yeah, yes. So here in this, this is a two-dimensional manifold. So this example, M less or equal than two would be the whole manifold. But if you imagine the definition for something like m less or equal than one, then I would be, I mean, this would be the sort of manifold I would be choosing, right? And I'm going to call k, but that would be the complement of it. So k would be. So K would be complement, let's say the closure of the complement. So that'll be, in other words, like all the like the sub-manifold made out of handles of index bigger than two, right? And you will see in a second why this is this is what we want. This is what we want. Okay. So now, if I have a diffeomorphism of my manifold, I can restrict to an embedding of any sub-manifold. And I'm going to use that. So, right, so if I take A diffeomorphism of N, I can restrict it to an embedding of that sub-manifold like pipped. And sort of the fiber of this restriction map would be like all the diffeomorphisms that fix the comp limit. So that would be diffus. Of k which fix the boundary pointwise, or say a neighborhood of the boundary, right? Now, this sequence, I can, I mean, these maps are sort of compatible with the group operation, which is composition and all. So I can actually dilute it. And the so the sequence I actually care about. So, sort of the sequence I actually care about is this, this, and then the fiber happens to be embeddings of N. And I am not being careful with the components I'm taking. So, here I have to choose some components for this to be a fiber sequence. But let me just ignore that for the sake of showing you the argument. Showing you the argument. So I have this sequence, which again comes from restricting a lithiomorphism to this special sub-manifold. And then suppose, so let me maybe specialize my strategy here to only showing that pi star is finitely generated, like the homotopy groups. And then, so pi, so if I want to show that the homotopy groups of this guy are finitely generated. These guys are finitely generated, then by just the long-sack sequencing homotopy groups, I would have to show that the, or I would have to show that the homotopy groups of this guy and those of these guys are finitely generated, right? And that's what I will do. This is relative to the boundary. So if I K embeddings Embeddings and belief are finitely generated, then I would conclude that pi k P D F M is finitely generated. Okay, so I have to take care of two terms now. Two terms now. So one is this, and the other one is here. And so now for the orange term, I will use there is a method to show finite generation of these homotopy groups using this. Uh, using this uh embedding calculus of good, willy, klein, and vice. So, to show this is finitely generated, we use We use embedding patterns. So, namely, we so that there is these terms of goodwilly line and vice that roughly tell you something like this. You're going to have your embedding space here. Embedding space here. And so there are, there's like a tower that approximates this embedding space. So first you're going to have like bundle maps, like bundle isomorphisms between these guys, the tangent bundles of each of these two manifolds. And this, let me call it like T0. And let me call it like T0, and then over this, there is a T1, which I won't describe explicitly, and then there is a T2, and so on. And there are maps to each of those terms. Now, so the other sort of input here is that, so each of these maps is a fibration, and the fibers are, I'm going to just denote by L1, L2. Denote by L1, L2, the layers of the tower, and so on. And the whole point here, or the way we are going to be able to say something about the homotopy groups of this embedding space, is because, so the first thing is that under these conditions, I mean, this won't happen for every pair of manifolds or manifold and sub-manifold, but because we're taking this specific Specific dimension, the limit of this tower will be, will have the homotopy type or the weak homotopy type of the embedding space. So I will be able to compute, in principle, the homotopy groups of this guy by computing the homotopy groups of this tower. Now I told you I don't want to compute anything. I just want to say if these groups are finitely generated. Groups are finitely generated. Now, taking a limit may, even if every term is finitely generated, the limit may not be finitely generated. But the theorem is much better than that. It says that these maps here start becoming more and more highly connected, right? So I can sort of get finite generation at each degree if I go far enough or high enough in this tower. And for that, And for that, then for that, we just use an induction argument because we can sort of control this thing. This thing is just sort of purely homotopy theoretical. So this is a bunch of mapping spaces that one can control. So let me maybe just try that. We could just to summarize what's happening there. This is the thing I didn't want to erase. Queries kind of so okay so So, again, so the first thing that happens is that this embedding space has a homotopy type of the limit of that tower. And the maps, let me call them, I don't know, V1, V2, and so on. The connectivity of the phi case increases with k and three the the layers L K are built from configuration. Configuration spaces of M of K points in M and N and the target, right? So I don't want to be like super specific with what these things are. These are going to be like some section spaces of a fiber bundle. Of a fiber bundle whose base is, say, configurations of k points in the domain. And the fiber is more complicated to tell what it is, but it's also built out of configuration spaces. My point is that because they are written in terms of configuration spaces, and these guys have finite fundamental groups by hypothesis, then you're going to be able to conclude that those groups are finitely like the homo. Are finitely like the homotopy groups of these layers are going to be finitely generated. So then an induction argument, like analyzing this in sort of a separate way, will let you conclude, right? So say this orange term, one can take care of it by this goodwilly Klein-Wise theory. So then it remains. So, um, so then it remains to understand this term here. So, these um the homotopy groups of this complement. And for those, there is a geometric idea, which is also due to Cooper's and sorry, to Weiss, and in the way I'm gonna sort of present it to Cooper's. To cooperate, and is the following. So I want it to be consistent with my colors, but yeah, maybe not. So then to understand the homotopy groups of V D A so we use these vise options. Iver sequence. And the idea here is to forget that a diffeomorphism or just to remember the embedding part of a diffeomorphism and then see what's left. So basically, the thing is that if you take a diffeomorphism of this complement, you can forget. You can forget that it's a diffeomorphism and just say that that's an that is an embedding. So every diffeomorphism is an embedding. And in this, I won't require anything about the boundary, right? So an embedding. So if this is my manifold. So if this is K and here's the boundary of it, then an embedding in principle could send this boundary. Embedding in principle could send this boundary to the interior, right? So that a diffeomorphism has to send the boundary to itself, but an embedding doesn't have to do that. So if you model these maps correctly, you will see that sort of the fiber of this map or a typical fiber of this map would be like well, if you choose like a colour where this thing is the identity, where diffeomorphisms here are the identity. Where diffeomorphisms here are the identity, then sort of when you look at the boundary, the only way you can sort of twist the diffeomorphism is by doing something in this region, right? So you're supposed to do the same here if you want to be in the fiber of this map, right? So what I'm saying is that the sort of the fiber here is diffeomorphisms. Is diffeomorphisms of the boundary across an interval. Right? And here, this is not entirely correct. You have to take, again, some components, which I denote by this. And again, this will be like all embeddings of K, which are isotopic to adipheomorphism, right? For this to be a fiber sequence. What is good about this sequence is that, again, this one you can deliver. Is that again? This one you can dilute. This in particular is a, I mean, these are self-embedding, so you can compose them. So, so this actually you can do like B and B. But something, and this is sort of the vibe sequence, what Sander, what Cooper's observed in his thesis is that you can dilute once more this thing because this guy, B diff, I mean, not diff, but the whole model I. I mean, not this, but the whole moduli space here has like the structure of a like an E1 algebra, or let's say just a topological monoid. People is here knows what I mean. And the sort of the operation is by stacking, right? So here, things here are like boundary cross I. And if you take two of those, because you have this boundary condition, you can stack them. But more than that, this is like a more. More than that, this is like a module over this guy, right? Because if you have your manifold K, you can sort of stack one of these guys over there, right? So if you model this correctly, which Sander does in his thesis, then you see that this sequence can actually be delupto. So this would be like the homotopy, like the I like the corresponding homotopy quotient. So this would have like a B to like the classifying space of the classifying space of that thing. And this for technical purposes is fantastic, and you will see why. So this is the sequence that we will be using. So that's like the diluted value. That's like a diluted Weiss Fiverr sequence. Okay, so now again, remember that the thing we're trying to do is to show that these guys here are finitely generated. But again, this is a fiber sequence. So if I show that the homotopy groups of this are finitely generated and the homotopy groups of these are finitely generated, then I'm done. And for this, I won't say again, but again, Again, but again, this handle decomposition and picking this sub-manifold made out of two handles or handles of dimension of index less or equal than two, that was done so that this thing could be also analyzed by embedding calculus. So this also you can hit with embedding calculus. So, and by this sort of the same type of inductive argument, you can show that the homotopy groups of this are finitely generic groups. So, I'm just gonna not say more about it. So, it remains to take care of this space here, right? And here's where the work of Galatius and Randall Williams and Nina. Randall Williams and Nina Friedrich, who was a student of Oscar, shows up. So that'll be like the application of POM spectra, which is probably the reason why I'm giving this talk then. So this all because of this point. Okay, so it's very we're gonna get at this. We're gonna get at this space, at the homotopy of this space. But for those that are more familiar, well, you know, you can apply like this galacious Randall-Williams business here because you need to stabilize these manifolds, right? So that's what we do. And these sequences is very good in that regard because if you stabilize it, meaning if you connect some discs with connect some this case with manifolds WG which are SN cross SN connects some with itself G times then well you're going to change this manifold you're going to change this manifold but the boundary remains the same so you could still analyze this term if you even if you modify the the case in a suitable way so so let me then take let me also define kg to be Let me also define kg to be k connect sum wg and wg is the connect sum the g fold connect sum of sn with itself. Remember that d is to n here. And this is so this is probably the main reason why our theorem is going to hold only for even-dimensional manifolds, because the results here are not so strong for all-dimensional manifolds. For all-dimensional manifolds. So then there is this theorem of Galdasius and Randall Williams. And also there is another part by Friedrich where she takes care of the sort of the finite group situation, finite fundamental group situation. Fundamental finite fundamental group situation. And the only things, so I wouldn't state the theorem precisely, but we would need two things. One is homological stability for this situation. So H K of B B K G is independent of G Or Large with respect to K. And the other thing that is relevant here is that H, like the stable homology is computable in terms of. In terms of an infinite loop space of a spectrum. And this, again, it's not really important here now to define this, but this is some Tom spectrum. And again, I don't want to compute anything here. I just want to say if it's finitely generated or not. And that's, and because it's some Tom spectrum built out of sort of the canonical bundle over B O N, and we know the cohomology of B O N and all that, it's going to be relatively easy to show that the homology of these guys, of this kind of thing, is finitely generated degree-wise. Generated degree wise, right? So this will imply eventually that HK B this K G is finitely generative. Right. But now this is one problem now because this guy, well, this is not pi k, which is what I wanted here. Right. So, and typically, And typically, there is no reason why finite generation of pi of homology implies finite generation of homotopy groups. But in this situation, it's particular. So maybe, well, let me maybe tell you that. Yeah, she's asking if like how important it is to have this boundary here. And it is especially for us because, but I didn't state it incorrectly. But what you get here is not this aspect or this infinite loop space, but some homotopic quotient by the action of. By the action of some homotopy, like homotopy automorphisms. Now, typically, one sees this result of Galatius and Randall Williams when this is the actual WWG, and in this case, the sort of the map from the boundary to the WG is highly connected. So you can ignore these homotopy automorphisms. But in this case, you cannot ignore them. So you have to do a more, well, you have to be. A more, well, you have to be more careful with showing finite generation here. But yeah, the boundary is quite relevant. It's also relevant to define just the maps between the different Gs. I mean, just there. If you don't have a boundary, I guess there is no obvious map from a WG, the diffeomorphisms of a WG, to differ morphisms of a WG plus one. There is no obvious canonical way to extend those things. But from a Those things. But from a more technical point of view, the boundary appears hidden in this part. Right. Oh, yeah. So, but again, I'm telling you something about homology, and I wanted something about homotopy. But let's see. But yeah, so if I take, so let me call this sequence star. This sequence star just for a second. So, so then, in view of this theorem of Galatius, Randall, Williams, and Friedrich, and this sequence, well, we have the following sequence of implications. So, if so let's see. So, if I take that, if I can show that the homology of this embedding space, of the classifying space of this embedding space. Of the classifying space of this embedding space is finitely generated, then I would have that the homology, so I already have that this homology is finitely generated. So I put, so if I play with the cell spectral sequence for this vibration sequence here, I would conclude that the homology of this guy is finitely generated. So if I show this, then I have that HK The yeah, the this it is finitely generated, right? And this would imply that the homotopy groups are finitely generated because the so one of the good things about this space is that it's simply connected. So pi one of this b squared thing is zero, right? And then zero right and then there is this theorem of cert that if if you have a space whose uh which is simply connected then it has uh finitely generated homotopy groups if and only if it has finitely generated homology groups right which is something not true for infinite fundamental groups okay so then this would imply that phi j which is the thing we wanted to get at right And we would be done, right? So, so basically, we reduce it to this thing, so showing this statement here, right? And so the thing we know here, again, is that the homotopy groups of this guy will be again finitely generated by this embedding calculus argument. So, how to pass from there? So, how to pass from there to homology? This is not going to be a simply connected space, so you have to do better than just applying this service vault. So, but let me tell you maybe a general fact also about just spaces. Okay, I think that's okay to erase this. So, here is a general fact. So if you take X partner and you know that its fundamental group is of type F infinity, right? Then so you know this and you know that pi k And you know that pi k of x is finitely generated for all k bigger than one, all the higher homotopy groups are finitely generated, then you can conclude as you did for simply connected spaces. Then h k the homology is finitely generated. Right, so you so you want so if you just add this condition, so so the thing of SAR is weaker because. Is weaker because you ask for this to be zero, but if actually, if you show that this is of type F infinity, you could conclude something if you know something of the higher homotopy groups, which we know. So, say for when X is our space over there, we know that part, when X is the classifying space of this embedding space. So, we are left to show this property about pi one of that space. Pi one of that space. And that's where the whole strategy breaks, actually. But I wanted to show it this way because it would simplify many arguments if, say, somebody's able to show what I'm going to tell you here. So, okay, so you want to study this pi one of that space. So for that, you well, pi one of that space is pi naught of the embedding space. PI naught of the embedding space, so that would be like sort of the embedding mapping class group of this thing, right? So, and that group using again, like the bottom of the long exact sequence that comes from the vice fiber sequence, like if you just go to pi one and pi naught, you would find an extension like this. Gives the following gives that pi naught of diff and pi naught embeddings of kd this is onto and let me not tell you why but Let me not tell you why, but here the kernel of this map is going to be an abelian group, finitely generated abelian group. Right. Now, here is how you want to argue here. So if you remember at the beginning, I told you that the mapping class group of manifolds with finite fundamental group are arithmetic, right? Or they have like they are of type F. They have like they are of type f infinity, right? This manifold has finite fundamental group because m hat, k hat, and then if you just glue in this s n cross s n and it's bigger than three, than two, then you won't change the fundamental group. So it's going to be finite. So you want to say that this is like an arithmetic group or a type or of type F infinity, even. Right. And if and in that case, well, this will be a finitely generated abelian group. This will be, so in particular, F infinity. So then this would be of type F infinity, which is what we wanted, right? Those are like properties of this class of groups. Like if you have an extension of F infinity groups of groups so that the kernel and the sort of the group are F infinity, then the quotient is going to be F infinity. Then the quotient is going to be at infinity. So that would be enough to show it. But this, so in the theorem of Sullivan and Trentafilo, only the case of closed manifolds is handled. And it's not like it's not, I mean, there is no obvious extension of that theorem to manifolds with boundary. So if you could show that for this group, you would be done. Or this group, you would be done, and you would cut, I don't know, like five pages of our paper. So, so this was the idea we had, and we actually, like at this point, we just had to do a bunch of other tricks. But sort of the sort of the key idea is just here. Sort of the actual proof deviates from this in, I would say, sort of technical tricks. I just wanted to say that this is probably. To say that this is probably a statement that is interesting in itself and it would have an immediate consequence for what we're doing. So I'm going to stop there without giving you the real thing, but again, this is the sort of ideas that go into the actual proof. Okay, so thanks for listening. Thank you, Mauricio. Are there any questions for Mauricio? Let me just put some sort of order on this. Let me just first ask Kirin Oaxaca in the room if there's any questions, and then we'll ask the Zoom audience. So, in the end, do you get that pi one of your classifying space of embeddings is type F infinity, or you just get that its homology is finitely generated by other tricks? Yeah, we yeah, we showed you the latter. The latter? Yeah, we have to use some okay, cool. Sorry, I forgot to run back with the microphone. So, I was just saying that, yeah. I was just saying that we showed the latter that in the end we show something of the chromology of the homology by some doing some induction. Are there any other questions here? No. So anybody in the Zoom audience have any questions? You can just unmute your microphone and ask. I guess. Your microphone and ask. I guess is the easiest way. Can I just ask a quick question? What do you mean by arithmetic? I know what F infinity means. What does the phrase arithmetic mean? Yeah, I don't want to define that because I guess I forget what the actual definition is. It's not like something I can tell you in one sentence. It should be, I think you should take just F infinity as the property that we actually care about. That we actually care about. So being arithmetic is stronger. And yeah, I guess I must confess I can't tell you a precise definition now. Sorry. No, it's okay. But if I may, S L and C, that's probably the best example of an arithmetic. Yeah, right. So you do mean things like that. Yeah, in contrast of the subject, right? Right. Okay. So, may I ask a question? In the last short sequence, can you say a few words why the abelian group, I mean the kernel, which is an abelian group, why is it finitely generated? Yeah, okay, that goes again into the okay, okay. Then I there I would have to say if you show that this is If you show that this is arithmetic, I don't know where to look at, but if you show that this is arithmetic, there is a theorem of mild shape that shows that those group groups, it's how it's going. Okay, so that those groups have the property that every abelian subgroup is finitely generated. I can also show that this abelian group without using that is finitely generated. Using that is finitely generated. But if I go to higher dimensions, like bigger than seven, and using all this pseudo-isotopic theory, you can get it there. But you would have to go to a higher dimensional case, which is not what you want. But for those arid metric groups, the property that would imply that this is finitely generated is something proved, it's a classical theorem by Malchev from the 50s or so. Thank you. Are there any other questions either on Zoom or here? Well, if not, let's thank Mauricio for the
