Okay, this is the online of the talk. I will begin with a brief introduction to a gradient flow. So we use HPM models. Then in the second part, we tend to discuss numerical methods developed particularly for such models. Such models. And finally, I give you an application, which is a quaster growth model. I will show you how this model can be derived and how evasion numerical method can be designed for this problem. So, this is the model we are interested in. This is so-called radiant flow. We have very We have very nice mathematical structure writing under compact form. Here we have phi state variable, functional E, user call free energy. And here delta E, delta phi means variational derivative. And we know in physics, this is called on such variational principle. In more general setting, we have general setting we have a state vector phi by i and coefficient matrix mu which is a symmetric positive definite and very easily we can derive this energy displacement rule by just taking in the product of the equation with delta e theta phi then we get immediately this identity so let me the energy So the mean energy is already decreasing because this tidal delivery is already positive. And gradient flow can be widely used to understand some nature phenomena like snowflake formation and to understand why water draws only. why water draw on leaf take this shape and typical application in industry is material science here we see a microstructure of byloin and liquor and cupan so we see very similar shape snow effect structure so from nature we can observe Observe in the phase field approach, the state variable is the so-called phase field function. Different values of this function are used to indicate different phases and also the interface between phases based on the so-called mixed free energy. So the typical So the typical function E take this form, which is the sum of a gradient time and a nonlinear potential. And minimizing this free energy results in a profile of phase field function determined by balance between two effects, a gradient time represent an interaction between phases, driving to complete mixing. Complete mixing. On the other side, non-linear term F tends to complete separation of the faces. And the typical form of bilinear form is this W potential. So we know this will give you an kind equation or a Kanga equation. However, in real application, this Application this non-linear potential can be much more complicated. For example, in the simulation of FCM, here means phase change material in graphic form. I can use this nonlinear potential, which is the sum of nonlinear potential, double potential, and polynomial of degree phi. So here, So, here it was a joint project with Bordeaux University. The aim of the project is to design a numerical tool to be used in TM technology. TES means thermal energy storage. Okay, in this simulation, we use organic shore in graphic form to form to simulate how the PCM change from solid to liquid to store the energy and from liquid to solid to release energy. And for dentalized solidification, the nonlinear potential can be can define on the dentalized surface angle theta. To well define the gradient flow, we need to specify three key elements: stable perfect energy E, and sub-lapse space H, in which we perform the variation derivative. So we know if we take L2 space, then we get the Alankan equation. If we take H negative one, and then we have a Kanhe equation. A canhere equation, but we don't have to take these two spaces. For example, if we take H next alpha, here alpha, between one and zero, then we get this fractional canhele equation study many years ago by Ensburg and Ma. So, this is the so-called fractional conhiter equation. And remember, And remember, in the classical definition of the free energy, we have two terms: gradient temp and nonlinear potential. And gradient temperature interface. And the perimeter eta appearing in the nonlinear potential is used to control the interface thickness. So here, this parameter plays a key role in phase. A key role in phase field modeling. In real situations, the thickness of the diffusion interface between two phases is only the order of seven molecular size. So physically, this perimeter will be very, very small. But mathematically, if the diffuse interface of the model have the same thickness as the physical one, Thickness as the physical one, then the equation needs to be decretized on a microscopic scale to collect the resolve interface profile. So that means this will make quickly the problem become unpractical to solve. So it is interesting to see if we replace what happens if we replace the What happens if we replace the standard gradient operator by the so-called fractional gradient? So, this is what we did a few years ago. Here we replace the gradient operator by fractional gradient. So, gradient flow of this free energy gives us this fractional ankle equation. The abraction-Arankan equation. Here, this fractional gradient time can be viewed as a non-local interaction between the phases. And if we consider the steady-state origin of this equation, then we get this OD elliptic equation. Okay, we can see the The state is in equilibrium, then we have this equation 1D. So if we take s equal to 1, then the solution of this equation was given 20 years ago in this paper. This is a tensor hyperbolic equation. So from this expression, we see the signage of the The signet of the interface is order, is order eta. However, in the case of fractional case, we don't know the exact solution. But numerical evidence of the solution of this equation looks like this. We can't prove this, but numerical test of the solution of this equation is very close to this. Very close to this function. So it looks quite logical because if we consider two extreme cases, let s go to one, s go to one, and then we get this also. So this is in perfect agreement with the results of 20 years ago. And if we take S zero, then we Zero, then we get a piecewise constant. So this means two faces are completely separate. So here from it's a very simple numerical test. So we see, okay, here we compare the profile for different order S. So we see smaller is the fraction of the order S, sharper is the interface. The blue one corresponds to. The blue one corresponds to a smallest S. Okay, so the interface is sharper for smaller S. So the remaining three figures give a perfect agreement between a conjecture solution and numerical solution. So another amazing possibility is to consider this high fractional Kahnhiller equation. Type fraction can heat equation. So we replace standard derivative by fractional tight derivative with alpha between 0 and 1. So this is a high fractional Alankan equation study by several authors. Very interesting finding is we know something about this equation. For example, we know the We know the energy is already bounded by this energy. And members energy decreasing, we can prove this fractional derivative in time of the energy is already non-positive. So that means because according to the definition of time fractional derivative, this is some kind. Derivative: This is some kind of weight integral, so we call this a memorized energy. So, memorized energy is always decreasing. However, we don't know if the energy itself is decreasing. So, this point remains a mystery. So, since 10 years ago, we were unable to prove this. So, for a gradient flow, we can ask why we have this energy, why we define such energy, why we take this dissipation. So, we see what method is a combination of energy and dissipation. For example, for the diffusion equation, that's in the heat. That's in the heat equation. So it can be viewed in two different ways. So it is the gradient flow with this energy and this patient. So we get a gradient flow of this energy and taking a variation derivative in this space, then we get a diffusion equation that we can easily see with at least n. Receive with this energy and with sense matrix, then we get the sensing. Again, if we consider this free energy and with a modified matrix, we have the sensing. So that means combination of the energy and displacement. Only a combination define your gradient flow. So from my point of view, So, from my point of view, modeling is like an arc, rather than a science here. About choices, maybe one choice is better than others. Okay, so no really reason. So, here, personal test play role. Okay, now let's Now let's talk about numerical methods developed for gradient flow. So in a more general setting, let's consider non-linear probabilities equation, so flow. We have a fully implicit method schemes. And we have also semi-implicit schemes. To compare to fully implicit scheme, a semi-implicit implicit scheme is more, is more stable, but still non-linear. At each time step, we need to solve a non-linear equation. We have also convected splitting. That means we split the non-linear potential into a sum of two. Sum of two convex functionals. Recently, IEQ, the so-called auxiliary variable approach, became very, very popular. Very recently, we combined this approach with arbitrarily stable lunch quota scheme to construct arbitrarily stable. Absolutely a stable and container stable scheme. So to give to give you idea about this approach, let's see this very simple some very simple scheme. For example, For example, for this equation, by using by following complex splitting, we split non-linear potential into Fc and Fe, then we chip Fc increasatory and Fe equatory. So this schema can be unconditional stable. And in the stabilization technique, Stabilization technique, we add suitable stabilization time to the original scheme. So, this is what we call stabilization time. So, this scheme is linear. It's linear for suitable choosing a constant S, it can be unconditionally stable. This is a stabilization technique approach. Technique approach. And we can also have ETD approach after a spatial decretization. Then we get the OD system. In the ED approach, we introduce a suitable approximation to this exponential operator. For example, For example, first order ETD scheme look like this. And this is a Lagrange multiplier. So we introduce oscillator variable defined in this way. Then we extend our equation into the equation set, which is original one. And we have one more equation. We have one more equation for the Lagrange multiplier. By doing so, we are able to construct unconditionally stable scheme. Okay, very easy to resolve. So, this is IEQ, very popular IEQ approach. So, similarly, now we define the osyliary variable in this way, and we formulate. way and we formulated the original equation so this q equals this so this means this is always one in a continuum a continuous level then we by take a derivative of this equation we get one more equation okay so this is for a first order scheme so with this schema we have energy detection but it's not for the But it's not for the energy itself, original energy. Only the so-called unmodified energy is dissipative. And this is a similar idea has been used for oscillatory function. And here, so here, the oscillatory variable only depends on t. So we call this So we call this SAV scheme because R is independent of the SB variable. So once again, we have modified energy dissipation. Look like this. Okay, so this is a brief review of the existing scheme. Now let's go to the last part of the talk. The talk. So here we can see the application. This is an isotropy dental crystal growth. So one of the model may use this free energy with a sum of three parts. Conformational entropy plus thermal energy and plus non-linear potential. Plus the nonlinear potential. Here, phi is the so-called order parameter. U is the temperature. And we have two key parameters here. So K is a Latin heat perimeter that controls the speed of heat transfer along the interface. So the difficulty of the So, the difficulty of this model comes from this coefficient, kappa, depending on the gradient of the phase field function. So, this is the function describing an isotropy of conformational entropy depending on this sigma. Sigma is isotropy strength and sita is the identif surface angry. Centralized surface angle defined in this way. So, this is a specific expression for the nonlinear coefficient kappa. So, I think we have not enough time to go into the detail of this expression. So, I prefer to skip this slide. This slide. Okay, so a gradient flow of this free energy give us this equation set. One for the phase field function phi. Another is something heat equation for U for temperature. So the difficulty of this problem, this equation set comes from two facts. Cohesion shape comes from two facts. So they are coupling here. So phi coupling u and u coupling phi. Another difficulty is couple, it's high nonlinear, highly nonlinear from this. If we look at the flux, sorry, variational derivative of the free energy, then we have this. So this is. This so this is uh the derivative of e. So we see here we have a non-linear coefficient depending on gradient gradient phi here. H is variation derivative of kappa. Okay, into D, we can direct the calculations of this solid expression. In C D, we have this. Okay, we have this. So, several remarks. So, here the mobility parameter tau can be a function of phi. So, in this sense, this model is only a simplified version of the original model from this paper. From this paper. So phi is a polynomial of p, it's a polynomial on phi of degree of degree phi. So to make the minimum these two values, okay, we take from this paper. So the energy displacement loss is this, so can be derived by taking inner Derived by taking inner products of the first equation, this equation for the phase sphere with phi t w bit of phi, then we get this identity. And taking inner products of the second equation by this, by temperature, then we get this identity. So we sum this to identity, and we see the right-hand side here. side here each other because we have opposite sign okay so this cancel so we get immediate this energy displacement so we want to construct a numerical scheme we want the numerical tourism set by similar detail at degree a degree level and technical And technically, we modify the free energy by adding constant one into the energy. So I call this a technical change because by doing so, so we translate it for the equation because in the equation, only derivative of E. Derivative of E appear in the equation. Okay, to add one, we can make the free energy is treated bigger than one. So this facilitates the contraction of the scheme and also make easier the numerical analysis. Then we split the energy into two parts. So basically, this E1. Basically, this E1 is let me see. Okay, so E1 contains all non-linear terms. E2 is for a linear term. Then we reformulate our equation. Okay, we reform the equation by separating energy into E2E E1 E2. Okay, this is. Okay, so this is E1 is E2. So it's linear power, non-linear power. So we introduce the oscillatory function defined by nothing and energy. Then we take a type derivative of this oscillator function, only depend on t. Then we get one more equation for. one more equation for for a okay this is the expression for the right hand side uh this is the scheme we propose for this model and basically the proposed scheme consists of two two steps uh in one uh step one we compute the intermediate solution everything Everything denotes by bar phi bar u bar q bar. So we see so we treat all nonlinear term explicitly and linear time implicitly okay to make the equation each time step easy easy to solve and so this coefficient after are defined according to BD BDFK formula. So this is the coefficient we can we can check. So basically the first tight step is nothing in BDF or K scheme applied to the phase field function and heat equation. But so let me mention so for the ossy delay So for the oscillatory function A, so here we only use the first order first order scheme. So this A is approximation of first order to continue A. Then in step two, we collect the intermediate azorism by multiplying eta k here. So let me explain. So let me explain a little bit about eta k. So eta k is defined by CK. What is CK? CK is a ratio A bar and E. So remember, A a continuous level, A is nothing the energy itself. So this ratio is approximation to one of order one. Okay. Okay, so CK is close to one of order one, and by doing so, we have approximation eta k to one and order k. So this eta is approximation of one of order k. So remember, intermediate solution is also approximation of order k. Of order K. So this correct, we call this a correction step. Keep the approximation the same order as intermediate step. So to make the auxiliary function A as possible as close to the original energy. So we here we call data section. call the dissection step. So we try to choose this zeta as close to one, no, close to zero. So we take smaller as possible because see the condition is you have to satisfy this inequality to get the unconditionally stable scheme. Scheme. So we see the main computational cost of this scheme lie in step one. So it's FPDFK. Here we have everything non-linear time straight equation. So we have to solve linear equation each time step. So basically, we solve two. solve two elliptical equations for the intermediate intermediate solution phi phi bar phi bar u bar so so there are no basically there are no cost for uh to compute a and formally uh i already mentioned so phi phi bar u bar are k order approximation to the exact solution And so we can so in this remark we can prove we can see oscillary remain positive. Okay, you can see easily pro this identity. And also, okay, the key result of this schema is the stability. We see in this. So we see in this term, A is the auxiliary function we have defined, depending on T. So we see the auxiliary function remain bound during the time stepping. And using this stability, we can prove the quantity gradient of phase function and the temperature in L to normal remain bounded for all n. So let me this escalate. Me, this scheme is no condition for high-step size. So, we can emphasize the auxiliary function play a key role in establishing the bounded list list we we have seen in We have seen in the previous slide. And here, so remember the energy is depleted. So we want this decrease energy is depressive. However, this cannot be proved theoretically. All numerator tests true. It is true. Quite a trend, a little bit contradictory between a theoretical numerical test. So another point is very interesting to know. The stability of the scheme is independent of how the intermediate solution are computed. So in our scheme, we compute scheme but we can put a 5 bar for u bar by by using BDFK formula but we can in principle we can use any scheme very even we can triple everything explicitly okay theoretically we can prove the scheme is still unconditionally stable Finally, I show you some new mercury joints, and this is a conversion alt test. So we see here for k equal to 1, remember k is a BDF K. So for K equal to 1, we get the first order convergence with K equal to 2, a second order conversion, third order convergence. Okay, let's confirm the Okay, let's confirm the uh our numerical analysis. Uh it is uh possible to construct arbitrarily high-order unconditionally stable scheme. So like by using a large quota scheme. So the time is almost over. I I think I skipped this part. So we we we can refer to this Can refer to this recent paper for detail how we were able to contract arbitrarily high-order unconditionally stable scheme. So here is a simulation of critical growth. So this is a dynamic simulation of heterogeneous growth of a creature. Of a crystal. So we start with a very, very small, basically it is a point. Circular point with a diameter of 10 power minus 3 minus 4. Then the nucleus grows slowly. So with the k equal to zero point six. k equal to 0.6. Remember k is a light and heat coefficient. Visit this variable. Now we see the tiny nuclear growth into regular, almost a regular hexagon shape with almost no microstructure. But if we increase K into 0.7 maybe we Maybe we skip this. Okay, we see better from this slide. So, with k equals 0.8, so we see a snowflake shape is formed and the pattern is filled more and more microstructure. So, this is why dental critical is also called a Core snowflake recording in progress. Okay. Okay, so I almost finished. So if we see a snowflake pattern, the membranes become thinner if we further increase the K value. Okay, this is the 3D Earth. So I keep this. I keep this. So, this is 3D simulation. Once again, we see a creature growth into a diamond like shape. Okay, this is we use M equal to 4 means this force for dental critical growth. Okay, I see that's everything I want to talk about. Thank you for your attention.
