Between linear selection and the decay rates. Over to you, Maurice. Okay, thanks very much for Professor Du's introduction. And I also want to thank all the organizers for giving me a chance to make a presentation here. Today, my topic is the link between linear selection and decay rate. This is a joint work with Chang Heng Wu and Dong Yen Xiao. And Beng and Xiao. Today, we will talk about the front propagation phenomena. Frank propagation is very common in mathematics and physics. So in the long survey, in the long survey by physics students, he reviewed all the previous results about Frank's publication theoretically and Application theoretically and numerically. And it is very common in many experiments. As a physic, Stalin was also very concerned about the propagation speed, especially when it is linear or non-linearly selected. So the speed The speed selection problem is usually so for propagation problem, it is a non-linear problem. However, so if we linearize in the front, so usually we can also get another speed, a speed, usually so we call it a linear speed getting from by linearizing the front. Whether the Whether the propaganda speed of a non-linear problem is equal to the linear speed obtained by linearizing the front. So if they are equal to each other, so at this time we call it linearly selected. Otherwise, we call it non-linearly selected. And he also infaced the importance on the how to understand transition between Transition between linear and nonlinear selection. A typical example Stellus mostly often used in his survey is the classical feature KPP creation in this way. It is well known that the propagation speed for the feature KPP creation is always Is always linearly selected. However, so for the case of single equations with more general non-linearity, the speed selection problem has been totally solved by Muratov and his collaborators in 2004. In their paper, they proposed a and they proposed a sufficient and necessary condition on determining so for general for a general here is replaced by a general f so for general f whether the propagation speed is linearly or non-linearly selected however since rattles proof is based on constructing some particular functional Particular functional, it is a little bit hard to extend his result to some more general system problems. And from his results, we also can't get any information on how the transition happens between linear and non-linear selection. That's in today's talk for system problems. For system problems, we try to find a new kind of sufficient and necessary condition. So, for the speed selection problem for system problems. For example, so if we consider the well-known competitive lotocard water system, it is in this way, a very classical system problem. We have four. problem. We have four parameters here, dr A and B. Here we need DR to be positive, while AB are the competing coefficients for the two species. Usually to consider a linear selection problem, we need to assume A is smaller than one and B is bigger than one. This is the so-called strong weak type. Strong, weak type competitive system. Why we need this assumption? Because we hope the equilibrium 1,0 to be stable, while the other equilibrium 0,1 to be unstable. And thus, the front propagation phenomena could happen. Yeah, this is the Euro. Yeah, this is the Euro assumption on the strong weak type competitive system. So, our test goal is to give out sufficient and nice recognition on the speed selection problem. Okay, let's go back to the easiest case feature QP equation. Let's review some previous results on these topics. For feature QP equation, so we have So we have a non-linearity. So f of u equals to u minus u square. It is easy to see that u equals zero is unstable. Well, u equals one is stable. And by the well-known result, Fischer and the chromograph, so we know that there exists a critical speed too, such that one the speed C is no less than C is no less than two, there exists a traveling wave solution connecting one and zero. If c is less than two, there does not exist such a kind of traveling wave solution. Thus, two is the minimal speed of the traveling wave solutions. Later, by Aronson and Weinberg for compactly supported initial data. Compactly supported initial data, they show that the propagation speed is also two. And thus, for general for single equations, usually the propagation speed is equal to the minimal speed of traveling wave solutions. They are equal to each other. And later by Bramson, he gave out a sharp estimate on the propagation. Estimate on the propagation for fish KPA equation with impact initial data. Okay, so let's talk about something about with gender nonlinearity. We assume F to consider a linear selection problem, we need F to be of a monostable type. Then we need two equilibrium. Equilibriums. One is zero, another is one. We need zero is unstable and one to be stable. And f of u is positive between zero and one, between these two equilibrium points. Similar to future capification, so there also exists a critical speed C0 and such that one C. That one c is no less than c0, and there exists a traveling wave solution connecting zero and one. While if c is less than c0, there does not exist such kind of solution. And the proposition speed is also to be c0. Okay, now next let's get a lower bound for A lower bound for the propagation speed C0. Okay, we know that for a monostable problem, the front is very place a key rule on the propagation speed. If we linearize the equation at the front, then we got this linearized equation and we assume phi Assume phi to be some exponential function and submit this exponential function into this linearized equation, then we've got this one, this equation. We need to solve this alpha. We hope the root to be real. Otherwise, phi will change signs. We don't hope that happened. Then we can go that C0 is no less. that C0 is no less than two times square root of f prime of zero. C0 is the propagation speed of this non-linear problem. And this one, the right part, due times square root f times zero, is the linear state obtained. So from linearizing the front, C0 is no less than the Is no less than the linear speed. Okay, the so-called linear selection problem is we want to know whether C0 is equals to the linear speed. Otherwise, or C0 is bigger than the linear speed. If C0 equals to, we call it linear selection. If it is bigger than this guy, we call it non-linear selection. It nullinous action. In this paper, Alusi and Mr and Novaga for the general single equation gave out a necessary and sufficient condition to determine whether this propaganda speed is linearly or non-linearly selected. Okay, he showed that if it is non-linearly selected, then it is equivalent to find some state bigger than the linear sp and some Bigger than the linear sp and some function u with some regularity, which is not zero, such that the following function, functional, is non-positive. Okay. Okay. Since his result is based on the variational approach, we can easily see that for a general system like a competitive system, it is hard for us to build such To build such a functional, to find such a functional. And we also cannot find how the transition happens between linear and non-linear selection. Our final result is totally piloted by this example. And this is a very special family of functions with parameter s. For this family of functions, we have Functions, we have the explicit formula of its traveling wave solutions. Moreover, we know that F of U, S increases with respect to S. Correspondingly, by compression principle, we know that C0 of S also increases with respect to S. To S. And this is the propagation speed. However, partial U always equals to one at U equals zero. This means the linear speed for any S is always to be two. Here, the propagation speed increases zero with respect to S. However, the linear speed doesn't change. Okay, because we have expected. Okay, because we have explicit formula for these equations, we know that when s is no more than two, c0 is always linearly selected. When s is bigger than two, c0 is also bigger than two. Here, c0 is non-linearly selected. Thus, the transition between linear and non-linear selection happens at s equals 2. At s equals 2. Let's observe what happens at the traveling waves. For the linear case, because we have explicit formula, we know that the traveling wave has, at the front, I mean, has the order x times e to minus x. However, at the transition case, when s equals 2. The traveling wave has the order E2 minus X, one for the nonlinear case. So we can easily calculate the order for the traveling solution in this way. We can easily see that the order of the traveling wave of the front of the traveling solutions changes at the transition case when s equals to 2. Is well s equal to two. And actually, after we observe this example and we consider for a while, we believe that such a change at the order, such a change of the order of the traveling solutions, I mean, at the transition case, it's not just a coincidence for this particular family of functions. Family of functions, it should hold for more general cases. Because my time is limited, so I don't have too much time to spend on the result on single creations. I just want to stay here. Different from the result by Martov, we also provide a new sufficient and necessary condition on determining the linear, determining the linear. The linear are determining the linear selection problems for single equations. Now let's jump to the problem for competitive system directly. So, okay, here we need to assume A is smaller than one while B is bigger than one. This is the so-called strong weak type competitive system. And one, zero is stable, while zero, one is unstable. Capital U and capital V are the minimum. capital V are the minimal speed are the showing wave with minimal speed connecting these two equilibriums. Our goal now this time the linear the so-called linear speed is this one two times square root one minus a if one just substitutes v by one so we can easily get this calculation so we want to know whether So we want to know whether the minimum speed, C0, is bigger than the sky or equals to the sky. If we fix A, D, and R, the three parameters, we also found that by comparison principle, C0 also increases with respect to B. It is very similar to this particular example. We hope we could find some We hope we could find some similar property for the system. Now, let's review some previous results on the linear selection problem. So, firstly, in the beginning, Ogbo conjected that for all parameters, C0 should be linear selected. However, no, so his conjecture should be wrong. Later, by Weinberg and McLewis, they show that for Louis, they showed that for this range, C0 is linear selected. Later, by Huang, for a larger range, he showed C0 is linear selected. In his paper, Huang said he strongly believe the range he found here is optimal for the linear selection problem for competitive systems. However, later by Hosonal. However, later by Hao Song, he showed that Han's range is not optimal by numerical analysis. And later by Professor O, for some parts of the range, for some parameters, he showed theoretically Huang's range is not optimal. Now let's go to the first results, our first result on the competitive system. We know that. We know that if we fix AD and R and that B change, if B is sufficiently large, the perpetration speed is always non-linearly selected. We can prove it very easily. And thus, we want to find the minimum or the even for all these non-linearly selected B. We define it as B star. Since B is bigger than one, so we have So we have there are only two possibilities. One is B star equals to one. In this case, for any B strictly bigger than one, so the propagation speed is always non-deemed exactly. The other case is here, one B, B star is bigger than is strictly bigger than one. Then, so for B, between one and B star, so it is linear select. Down. So it is linear selected. The traveling wave solution, capital U, so has this order. Well, at the transition case, it has this order. Similar to the previous example, X disappear again here. And for non-deal case, we have this order. This is very easy to calculate. A very natural question is: so, where question is so whether this whether we could take some star such that it equals to one actually if we fix a and r and let d to be sufficiently large at this time we can prove that this star really equals to one okay it uh it can take a while it it could take a while however for these two cases there are some uh difference for this case we can see For this case, we can see the classification of the front very clearly, and we can also see how the transition happens very clearly. For this case, we cannot observe the transition between leading and non-linear selection. This inspires us to consider whether the range usually the range usually we considered for range usually we considered for we considered B is bigger than one, it is optimal or not. Why we need B is bigger than one? Okay, okay. Because we need it to connect the stable equilibrium and unstable one. However, if we enlarge the range to be from this one to infinity to there to infinity, so by our following Infinity. So, by our following result, we can always observe the linear and non-linear selection. For this range, we may not observe this transition. And for B, it's smaller than one. We consider the traveling wave connecting this positive stable equilibrium and this unstable one. So, the full version of our result is we still define this star to be the The minimum of non-linear selected B, non-linearly selected B. And here we assume we need B is positive. Then, here in that assumption, we can always find some positive B star, which is also bounded, such that we can observe the following classification for the decay rate of the traveling rate. Of the traveling wave, and the star could be bigger or smaller than one. Okay, compared with the results of Maratov, so our method for our observation can be applied to more complex cases like equations with abduction, periodicity, and some systems, as well as the comparison principle holds. That's all. Thank you. Exchange from here as well as from the zoom public default zone. Very interesting, Molly. So for the yeah, that's the kind of monostable page for the competition model. For the other strong competition, it's about stable, then it's a different story. I guess different, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I mean. So the Muratov's proof is by energy method. Your proof is more comparison. Can you say some words about my proof is my proof is based on constructing so suitable or super and the stub solutions. We don't rely, we don't rely on the energy. We don't really have the energy method. Okay. Constructing a comparison function must be very, very complicated for this. So, Yihuan, this is Shao Chang from St. John's. Oh, yes, you have a question for Maulin. Question for Molly, yes, please. So, Molly, it's a good talk. So, I like this result very much. Thank you. Can you compare your result with Professor Trinhua O's results? You know, Twen Hua O is my colleague here. So, can you compare your results with Dr. Trinhua O's earlier results? What's the difference? What's the difference between your result and their result? Actually, so if in my memory, so Professor Chu Hua O's, his method or his paper cannot solve for this way, for this competitive system. The system he could treat only has two equilibrium points. And now for this for this For this local vulture competitive system, it has three more than two equilibrium points. It's different. I recall Dr. Trinhua and his collaborators also studied the logo competition system for this kind of linear and non-linear selection. Actually, so Professor O has a lot of results. Professor O has a lot of results on this problem. I don't know which result you mean. So, so this reason why I want to know. So, you mean seems that you get this kind of if and only if condition. So, you seems you improved their results greatly. Am I right? Um in some sense. Okay. But but still a little different. but still a little different okay so uh the uh the second question so uh where did you uh uh well where did you all publish this result yes or no we still publish the paper okay but i recall uh earlier someone told me uh you finished this kind of work but uh i have not seen such a publication yet yeah yeah yeah yeah so so what we write uh So, while we write, while we try to finish the paper, so we found that in the beginning we can study this range for B, and later, so we found the output for B is this range. Then we have to add a lot of materials. We need to not have to finish it yet. Yeah, because you know here, so I'm sure Dr. Trin Hua O is interested in your work, I guess, because this is highly related to his earlier works. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, go talk. Good morning there, okay? Thank you, thank you. Yeah, can I ask one question? Okay, if I have time, yeah, okay. Yeah, we still have a couple of minutes. Yeah, okay. Okay. So say the Hassana conjecture, so do you already solve that conjecture? Which conjecture? Which conjecture? Which conjecture? I'm sorry. It is called Hassana conjecture. A times B less than one or A times B greater than one. And then the selection depends on the R value, something like that. Actually, I don't know that conjecture. Sorry, so I don't know whether we could solve it or not. Okay, so I will try it later. Okay, so I will try it later. Sorry. I'm not sure kindly. I'm not sure. So the selection is related to this B, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So because this B is the system monotonic in this B, right? Yeah, yeah, monotone, yeah. You're right. This is very important. Is very important. All right, I think let's thank Maurini again. Okay, thank you, John. Yeah, okay, let's create a story just one minute for me. Okay. Hi, everybody. Hello, everyone. Okay, we got your shared screen now. We have one minute, so let's have to wait for just a moment, just in case there are people joining at the exact time.
