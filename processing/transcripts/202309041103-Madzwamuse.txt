I'm the math department at UBC, and we will talk about single-to-collective cell migration using geometric blocks of SPDs. Thanks, Khan, for the invitation. And yeah, I'm delighted to be here. I'm looking forward to the talks as they talked before. I'm a mathematician, a blood mathematician. It's nice that we're a biologist so we can discuss some of these problems, I think. What I'm going to present. I think what I'm going to present to you is really models, not specific to any biological setting. So I will outline briefly what my research is. I'm new to the sort of North American sort of side of research. I was in the UK for a while and I'm trying to sort of get my research going within North America, in particular in Canada. In particular, in Canada. So I just thought I should share with you what my interests are. I'm interested in single cells, starting single cells, including their environments. But that's really a big, it's a huge area to look at. I want to develop, as I call it, data-driven help of bug service PDs that study cells within their environments. And I want to couple mechanics with biochemistry. So this is a perfect environment. I mean, Alex has just described the role of mechanics in biochemistry. The role of mechanics in biochemistry for cell division as one example. The other part that I focus on is really once we have the models, we do analysis where we can, mathematical analysis and so on, but I also focus on developing new or modifying new numerical methods for these models. High performance is important because we are solving these models in 2D and 3D. I use many finite elements, finite differences, sometimes. Many finite elements, finite differences, sometimes in solid. And when you want to solve these complex PDEs in real time, it's challenging. So you need efficient solvers. I want to do validation of the models. Model predictions is very important. So data is very important. Going back to data is really important. We do parameter estimation, we model selection as well. There's no reason why a single model should be the only model that describes the biological observation. And so I don't believe in that. I believe in various, you know. I believe in various, you know, calibrating them, you know, different properties of your model, for example. I'm going to speak today about one of these in terms of ordinal control. You see that all you are given are images. Can you find a dynamic model? So I'm interested in dynamics, both space and time, so not static sort of analysis, which we can also do, but I'm interested in the dynamics. So what this is a good example of two cells which are Good example of two cells which are really migrating on 2D. They have different dynamic shape changes, pseudopods forming, complex pseudoports. I like this one very much. Retraction, bending, and all sorts of properties, geometric properties that are of interest to a mathematician. Similarly to this one, you can see actin and myosin, they've been spoken about that they are co-localized on the classmate unit. So how do these drive protrusion and Drive protrusion and reduction of plasma membranes as molecules. But there's quite a lot of other properties that or processes going on in terms of the mechanics. What I want to focus on, maybe I should play again this video. Maybe I can go to the next one. Yeah, it plays up here. Yeah, I want to focus on two things. Just molecules that are residing only on the surface of the plasma membrane. I will ignore the bulk. That's the first thing. I will ignore the bulk. That's the first thing. We have looked at bulk when you couple bulk to surface flow. But I just want to be very simple and look at molecules that are residing only on the plasma membrane. And for that, I want to look at the mechanics of it by looking at the evolution law of the membrane. I'm looking, I'm going to be a pure mathematician here. I'm just going to assume that my interface is a sharp interface and not epsilon. I can talk about that. Epsilon. I can talk about that in the next talk. But for now, I'm just going to assume that I have a plasma membrane that's described sharply. And on that, there are molecules that reside on that plasma membrane, and these are given primarily by reaction diffusion systems. Someone has talked about tuning models. So that's something that I'm also interested in. What else? So for this, I'm going to propose, and this is what I'm going to propose. And this is what I'm going to propose: this molecular, you know, the actin and myosin. You can see, let's have a look at this. I didn't go into the details where acting here at the front end is driving the protrusion at the front end. It's also giving the front, the face of the cell. So it can identify what is front and what is back. If you look at my myosin, it's at the back end in the cell. It's contracted. It's highly concentrated. Again, it's the red, it's highlighted in red. So I'm going to assume. So I'm going to assume that rather than having these two molecular species on the surface, I have N species here. I call them the B species. And they satisfy this reaction diffusion system only on gamma. And with this, I have an evolution law for gamma, which is given by this material velocity B here, which again satisfies this material derivative according to Reynolds transport theorem and so on. So what am I interested in? I could go into the formula. I could go into the formulation of this. This is again, I just described this: the material dedicated here. This comes from the fact that the manifold is changing in time and space. You can think of convection and dilution as well. You have diffusion, this is the first part on the right-hand side, and the reactions. And I'm assuming that reactions will come from modeling experimental, driven experimental. And therefore, the question is. Question is what I mean if you know the reactions, I think the models will pause except for the material velocity. So the question is what drives this? And again, this is something that I'm interested when I'm looking at the bacteria division. What drives the sensors of the bacteria in order for you to disburbly? And there are many, I mean, mechanics as well as the biochemistry. And that's what I'm going to encounter. Bikinist. And that's what I'm going to encode. I'm just going to, this is a very simple one. I'm going to be very simple because at the moment, I'm going to assume that I know nothing about the bigger picture of the mechanics, for example. I just know that my material velocity, V, is going to be forced only in the normal direction. Again, I'm thinking of every single point on this manifold, whatever I have, every point in. Every point in the normal direction really, and I'm looking at the rate of change of this x in the normal direction. And that's this would be my velocity at a point, for example, in the normal direction only. I could add a tiger component and that will help me with the numerics out, improving convergence and stability. It's much better. The reblattrochemation on the clock subsection. But I'm I'm going to ignore that. But I'm going to ignore that. So I'm going to assume that my material velocity in the normal direction is given by this g function, which depends on the material points S, the B are the molecular species. As I said, this is as first attempt. I'm just going to take a mean character H. And that's it. Does this give us evolution in terms of the cell? One can solve, and this is. You spoke about smoothing out those lamps and so on, the pseudopods. I'm going to generate pseudopods. I'm going to go the opposite. I'm going to start with the smooth surface, CA for example, and I generate these pseudopods. But they are driven by the molecular species. They are reaction diffusion systems on the surface where there are high concentrations. The cell moves preferentially in that direction. It deforms substantially. If you change your parameter colours, you can now see this pseudopod. Parameter palace, you can now see these pseudopods form, yes. What is the initial formation for random, random perturbations around the uniform state on a fixed origin? It's on the surface. It's purely on the surface. I've ignored the bulk completely. This is just a surface PD. Yeah. Where is the time dependence of the reaction? The time depends. Uh the time dependent all the reactions are here. In the material. Yeah. Yeah. Any yeah? So so again, I'm being very brief here because I don't have time, but really I'm just looking at PDs on the surface and that's it. What evolves the manifold is the material velocity and the material velocity is given by this very simple. It's good that it, I mean, we can see. It's good that we can see now the formation of these superpoles, it's all, which is nice. But they're, well, it depends on what you want to model, really. This is just an example. There are quite many, but as you can see, the cell is growing in body. If you continue to grow this, the cell will enlarge infinitely. And that's not nice. So you have to do something. I also want to encode the mechanics. Some kind of mechanics. So I will modify my evolution law. I will modify my evolution law in this sense. It's a much more complex evolution law. And I will demonstrate that this is also quite a nice model. What does it mean? I have encoded, so I take these two terms from the previous one. Now I encode the Glomo flow. That's bending energy that comes from the Glomo flow type model. I've encoded the volume constraint that I was exporting about. So you have a Spoken about. So you have a Labanism applier here, which is time dependent. You have also forces that are interior forces if we were to look at the bulk dynamics, for example. Or you can look at exterior forces if the cell is living in an environment that is other forces coming out. You can think of hemotractant or obstacles where the cell is moving through obstacles and so on. I'll show you an example of that. Or you can think of addition as well. So you can encode these. So you can encode these are physically meaningful forces for that sellers encounter in their in their in their uh need for migration. So so that's it really. I use finite elements to discretize this. I should highlight that the H is, remember this is H is the Laplace, the term operator of the material points. This is also the Laplace, the terming operator of H. So you have the fourth order Laplace, the terming operator. Laplace determining operator on the so this is not an easy PDE to solve. It's highly non-linear because the Laplace determines the power 3 and so on. I am not going to go into the numerics, but we have solved this efficiently and also proven some numerical convergence and so on. In the case where we have only images, and this is the second talk that I'll give, if I have time, we can use a multi-fits to make. We can use a multi-fits, geometrical multiple methods, finite difference. We can also use finite difference. I'll try to get there if I can. So we can form this repos now, this in 3D. Again, the cell could migrate randomly or it could have directed migration. In particular, I spoken about these cells migrating through complex environments. They are chasing for food. In a minute we all want to go for lunch or walk and luckily there's no one we have to push out of the way. There's no one we have to push out of the way, but this cell is pushing out all the objects in order to get to the food. And these objects are deforming, they are moving. And the question is: can we use this as a toy? There is no experimental data for validation, but we just wanted to demonstrate that this is also could be kept under the model. And so, you, I mean, this is a caricature model because exactly exhibiting this is the geometric evolution law that I described, and you have a I described, and you have external forces where the cell is interacting. These are the unattropos potential type of forces where if it is far away, it gets attracted. If it is too close, it gets recurred. So, you could think of, okay, I'm thinking of a cell that's migrating within these deformed group objects. What about cell-to-cell interactions? They are going to form tissue and so on. Can we have something similar? Yeah, again, this. Yeah? Again, these are geometric PDs. I have to reiterate this. I have 10 cells. On each cell, I have a system of geometric P D's. So I've... Yes. So you have no FB doesn't exist here, right? There's no reactions. There are no reactions. I haven't said anything about FB at all. So I'm using, for this one, I think I'm using Manhattan reaction kinetics. So again, these are well established out to data. Are well established out to data and give it a type of model. I haven't, yeah, yeah. I've just assumed that we can rise to the patterns. Exactly. That actually, very good point. That gives actually rise to these pseudopods that are forming. Exactly. Exactly. The pseudopods are forming. Think of high concentrations of these molecular species. Exactly. So it's coupled with reaction diffusion systems, coupled with the evolution law and all this on one cell, and then I coupled to ten systems. Up into 10 systems for the 10 cells. So you cannot solve them on your computer at all. Yes? I am confusing. So, how do you encode the behavior of the cells when they come together? Is there something that you can do? Exactly. In one of the forces, I say there are external forces. In one of those forces, I have a Lunar John motion. If two cells are very close to each other, they repel each other. Very close. You have to have some measure. And if they are too far away, they attract each other. Attractive. And that keeps in other epsilon or the epsilon distance. That forces local measurements. It's locally exact. It's only locally exact. That is one of the parameters you said you could measure from experiment. Absolutely. So if we had to experimental time and then we could feed that into the model exactly. Absolutely. This would be. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The last talk, if I have ten minutes, it's really about, okay. Really, it's really about okay, Alex. You have so many images, you have images, you take images for time one, time level two, and so on. And these are discrete images. And the question is, can you have a dynamic model that tells you optimally how to move from one image to the other by self-tracking? Think of this as cell segmentation, whatever you want to call it, using geometric self-species. This is what we want to do. Rather than using all these other. Rather than using all these other sort of models that had been used, I want to use geometric surface PDs. The motivation came actually through a biomedical engineer, USAT Sasset, and they could follow neutral fuel cells in visible, in real life. And this is what they observed. If they cut a wound on the zipper fish, they can see cells migrating towards the wound. And they can reconstruct these 3D cells or the morphologies of the wound. Cells of the morphologies of these three in 3D. And the question that they wanted really was to, let's see, this comes up. They have a discrete sequence of images, but it's not coming up, hopefully. But I mean, I could show you in the next one. I have a discrete sequence of these images for a single circuit. And I want to have a dynamic model to follow this optimally. To follow this optimally. And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to use this, unlike particle tracking, I want to do whole cell tracking of the whole cell. And my aim is just to fit a mathematical model to static image tracking. That's really the important thing. I'm going to be very brief. I'm going to check this material velocity which I've given you again in the normal direction. Since I know the only thing I have, I have no biochemistry, I have no mechanics at all. I only have images. All I only have images, so I cannot incorporate anything else except to assume that I have a function, eta function, I call it a forcing function, that's space and time dependent, that allows me to move optimally from one image to another. This is an unknown function, both in space and in time. We have to find. If we could find this, then we're done. We have our evolution going. Yeah? In order to maintain, I mean, I have a volume constraint here because. I have a volume constraint here because again it's important that cells do not vanish. I don't want them to vanish. I have a regularity here, regularization term for the mean curvature, just to ensure uniqueness of solutions. You don't want many solutions. But there are issues with this model. This is on gamma, on gamma of t on the sharp interface. Now, I am proposing this eta t, eta function, sorry, the eta function, the forcing function. I don't know anything about the regularity, how continuous. How continuous, you know, what function spaces it should contribute belong to. That's one thing. I'm also not, I cannot measure. If I have two cells or two sort of surfaces, I can define their distance measure. But when I define that distance measure, it's not differential. And therefore, I cannot use it at all. I need that as well in order to find it. So I've Order to find it. So I've given you this model. It's a very nice model, but it's completely useless. I'll chuck it out of the window. It's not at all useful for me. Instead, I'm going to embed my service in a higher dimension. And I'm thinking of level set methods or fence fields, and that allows me to define the regularity of ETA. It's easily I can define the what called the measures that I need. Called the measures that I need. And if, in particular, and this is very nice, I can work directly with raw data. Use Alan Clark Smoothie. I use exactly the same thing, and this works very well. And I can identify the interior and the exterior of cells within the images. So I can read in the images and I can follow them quite nicely in terms of their definition. So I'm going to use Aval Khan for following the gamma of T, but I'm Of tea, but I'm solving this Alan Khan in the bulk, everywhere. In the bulk, I should go back here. Yeah, so this is my larger domain here. This is my gamma, it's embedded. I want really to resolve this, you know, close, close to this, to the memory. That's why it's very important because I'm only living on the senses. I don't care very much about what is happening. And I exploit this in my numerical method as well. So, uh So, now you can see I use this Alan Khan with a double one potential. The only thing I modify, and this was the first time that Alan Khan has been modified in this sense, I encode the forcing function, but I need the eta function. I also encode the Lagrange Map. And with that, I can now define the measures between the model, the solution to the model, at the final time, to the image, the design. Image, the desired image. And these are L2 measures. So they are quite nice measures. Similarly for the eta function, they are L2 measures. Now I can derive optimality conditions and so on and so on and solve my problem. But I should highlight that once I'm paying the price, I had only a single PD on the surface. I have now an Allen-Kahn model in the bulk one, highly non-linear, and I want to resolve when epsilon is getting. When epsilon is getting very small, when I get closer to the interface. That's one problem. But I also have to derive these optimality conditions, they are joint. So I have two conditions, one for Lambda, one for the Lagrange multiplier, lambda, also for eta, I should also say, but also for the adjoint V. It turns out that the adjoint model is linear, so it's very nice. I can solve that quite nicely. But this is highly non-linear, and therefore I've got. Linear, and therefore, I'm going to skip all this. I'm just going to show you the adjoint equation for P when you look at the optimal conditions. The only thing that comes into here is the solution from the Alan Khan, the Fire equation, as data and everything else. So, I can solve this model on a highly cost-grained mesh. And while defined on a highly defined mesh, and therefore, I call upon the multiple. And therefore, I colour from the multiples. And that's what I'm going to do. This is just a summary of the numerics. I use second order finite differences in terms of space as well as in terms of time. I also use a fully implicit second order. So second order in space, second order in time. I use all these multi-grid solvers for adaptivity, for measured adaptivity, and everything else to allow me to solve in 2D and 3D. To allow me to solve in 2D and 3D. When we started this, we could we could spend maybe two, three weeks waiting for the computations to launch. And now this takes a couple of hours for three. So in order to do this, this is where, for efficiency, really, as I said, I solve my fly, only an adaptive grid. This is very important, and I solve my joint. And I solve my joint problem for the cost group. And how do I do this? This is refined, very refined. This is very cost-grant. And I interpolate between these two and I solve between these two. This is not. And these are the D cycles. This could be very refined down here. And sorry, this is highly very cost, and this is very refined. I mean, we can go backwards and forwards. Remember, this is an invest problem. Remember, this is the inverse problem. You solve the forward problem going forward in time. They are joint. You have to solve it backwards in time. So you have to save all your solutions going forward and use them to go backwards. That's why it's highly computationally challenging. I can just briefly show you convergence for this. This is a well-known example in material science as a toy example just to do the analysis for the convergence, and it converges very well. For the convergence, and it converges very well when you refine the mesh with a 64 by 64 up to 512 by 512. Now, this is in 2D. If you were to do this in 3D, you could have a 64 to the power 3D, which is okay, but you have a 512 to the power 3, already a billion. If you go, I mean, it's really not possible to do this without adaptivity. And you can show the convergence in terms of the number of recycles. You can also show the efficiency of the multi-grid methods. It's linear. Methods, it's linear in complexity, so it really performs efficiently. Now, this is the adaptive mesh close to the surface, and it's very cost away from. And I mean, this is one cell. Sorry, I was going to say, this is the initial position of the cell, this is the final position of the cell, but you can see that the mesh is moving with the cell. Exactly. It's dynamic. It's also very important. And we can do also. Also, very important, and we can do also the analysis just for the for the sake of illustrating the images that I wanted to illustrate for the zebra for the zebra. So, you can you have an initial position and the cell is migrating optimally to the desired final position. What it recognizes, it's removing much faster at the final step because the only thing that it sees in my constraint, I gave you the J constraint, is the desire. J constraint is the desire, it's the final image at the final time. So it doesn't see anything else. We have calibrated these two. One of the things I should maybe not mention it because we haven't patented it, I've been told don't mention it, but I'm mentioning so one of the things that happened, I mean, Alex could confirm this. People take images, and after 200, 300 images, they process them and they come back and say, They are rubbish. You know, we have been using a time step of 10, whatever, 10 minutes, 10 seconds, whatever. You can use this algorithm to calibrate the time step at which your images are very good. You can segment them well, very well. So, one of the things I would like to do is to embed the time stepping and the segmentation into a microscope so that when you take your images, it can tell you whether you need to increase your time step or reduce your time step, depending on the quality of your image. I think this would be very nice. I think this would be very nice. It will save a lot of time for biologists rather than coming up with all these, I don't know how many tons of yes. I understand that when you were saying, but how exactly this is important to you, the proper time scale? I could go into the details of that, but we can talk about that, yes. But this is also very possible. Yeah. Because you have a time step here that tells you from one, you know, you're moving through images, 200 of them, and you can set, you can quantify. And you can say you can quantify the quant the quality of the visualization of the images. And that time scale, you can do it adaptively. And that's what we do. Here is another example as well. I think I will skip this one. I just wanted to illustrate... Oh, where is it? Sorry. This one is a nice one. I gave this talk some years ago in Grenoble to a physics. In Grenoble, the geophysics lab, and they said, Oh, but hang on, we have a cancer cell that really migrates very nicely, very differently. Can your method capture this? It's just a matter of reading in the images, and it does so. It does so. In fact, there were some physical units, numbers that we could quantify in order to understand the role of ITA. And that's what we've done here. And you can see here, these are the physical units of ITA. ETA is highlighted here, it has a high concentrations in the front hand. has a high concentration at the front end and lower concentrations. And you can see that it's capturing the morphological changes in this. The other thing that biologists, I gave this talk to a minute and the biologists say, okay, very nice. We spend hours counting how many cells are divided. Wheats. Okay. Wheats matter. So the question is, can you can we use this as a byproduct just to compute Product just to compute for infrared rates, for example. And the answer is yes. Only if you can compute this gas temperature or Zulus number. It's called Zulus number X, given by this integral of gauss, this whole gamma. So if there are topological changes, it tells you how many. X tells you the number. And in terms of cells, you can compute it in because actually luckily we found this paper when they computed actually this number using tests. Number using faces. And so we just processed our images, and you can see we start with three cells here. We have three cells, and you are counting them. This is the number, the EU's number, and automatically you can count how many cells are divided. And so we hope that, again, this could be somehow encoded into the laboratory as a software to help biologists count, well, quantify the proliferation. I think I should stop here and I think I have more time. I just wanted to say what I've given you are just models only on the surface. The last one has been extended to a bulk framework by need because we cannot define the model that the shall need. Yes. So, what do you learn about ETA in the last video? Yeah, it's related to cell polarization or protrusion as a protrusion force. Is it some kind of mechanical energy that marked some effect? No, this is the best, this is the only inference that we could make. It's yeah, it's not really a displacement. It's not you are you're computing actually eta everywhere. In pure not only Instead of registration type, you're using that to calibrate the time. Yeah. And however that was the time sample. So you are using that new cosmos. Yeah, but inter satisfies a stiff descent type of money. So we compute it as part of the English infrastructure. Yes. It's computer. Yeah. It's computer. Yeah. Regarding the time again, I think I I missed uh I don't understand how you map into real time from a simulation. So the images that you showed in there doesn't look like real time is represented there, right? There are. I'm not so sure what you mean by that. So I am I'm these images now this is a movie, right? But if you look at these images are changing it. If you look at these images, they are changing in time. You have reading so many, maybe 200 images. Yeah? So, each time step in those videos of the simulation that you showed us is equal to a real time unit? That's a very good question. So, we take these time units from suggested. So, whoever gave us the experiment, they will tell us normally what are the time scales that we use. Yes? It just seems to me in some of the movies that sort of the dynamics is accelerated towards the end. Sure, but this is nothing to do with the time scale. It is everything to do with how we have defined the cost function. Yeah, unfortunately, my if I go back, please. Yeah, okay. Here we go. Yeah, here, exactly. Yeah, yeah. This is actually embedded. It's by D. Inverted is by default, I should say, maybe not by default, by definition, really. The measure is only, it can only see, I need this to be, you need to compute the minimum, so it's going to, you know. But it can only see the final, the image, the final image at the final time. It knows nothing in between. No, I know. That's why I'm wondering. That's why I'm not completely sure. I that's why I'm not completely sure that uh you see the actual dynamics uh you you do you do if you check small times this is the importance really if you of course if you check large times times you you you miss a lot absolutely absolutely so in in fact in when they take these images the time scales are very small so for example if we take equation one so lambda would be a function of real time right these are reactions so that's Are reactionary. So is that where time is encoded in the equations? No, no, time is encoded in the variation of this phi. This is the partial derivative of 5 with spectral charge. No, no, I understand that, but the connection to the biochemical rates, right? So this goes to lambda. I don't have any chemistry here. This is what I said. I don't have any biochemical reactions at all. At all. It's only the only thing I have are images, nothing else. I don't have any chemical images. Pointers, you could, because he has the fantastic. Yeah, you could. If I knew about it, then I would output. Yeah, but I don't have. When I asked the engineer, what about the chemistry? Because I really wanted to Because I really wanted to couple this to nuclear diffusion systems, and I know the time scales. He said, We don't have any. I mean, it took me, I was very panicky. This was a PhD research. Two years, we could not get any results at all. And in the UK, PhDs in three years. And this is done. This is a big word. It's a big word. And so we said, let's just go to English. And luckily it turned out to be. And and luckily it turned out to that selection that you see it's just purely based on geometry. Yeah. Too much you don't have to expect too much. Exactly. Exactly. It's purely geometry, yes. How do you handle the boundary of the speed reads? And I'm also curious about the optimization method you are using. If I look at the sharp interface, there are no boundary conditions because the curve is closed. Oh, okay. Yeah, there's no boundary. Oh, okay. Yeah, there's no boundary conditions. But for these ones, I need to impose some boundary conditions. So, zero flux type and so on. Okay, okay, but the influence are more complex boundary. I have this one example for that joint, for example. This is important, I think, for that joint because I need, at the final time, I need these to be exactly too much. But yeah, I yeah. Sorry about that. Sorry. Uh so so you use the the finite the difference to disparatize the okay, but if it's a more complex uh boundary. The boundary is complex. It doesn't matter. It's complex already. So these are complex, complicated geometries. You can see they are embedded in a larger domain. So I really don't care about that's why we can all That's why we can hold it's I I'm just going to have my final difference and solve. Does that make sense? I'm solving this omega. I'm not solving all this. Yeah, yeah, okay. I see. That's true. Yes, I guess another question. So what you could do with your method, we choose the shape at t equal zero, t equal 10, and you know, we go from one to the text, but then we take all the Then you take all the additional measurements. You can see what extent can your method interpolate between. Yeah, we did, we did some, yes, we just, yeah, yeah. And how well does it work? Yes, but I should be very honest with you. If you look at, because really it will be misleading you if I say anything else. Yeah, it can only see where was it? Excellent. This is really the cost. What you want to do is to be able to put a summation here. If you have this intermediate, put a summation over the integrals of all the other images. I mean, a case where you don't give your method the intermediate, but then, because you have the dynamics coming up from your method, you can compare. Yes, but if they're too far apart, there's no way, there's no way. Far apart, there's no way, there's no way they will know this. I mean, I can give you two different images, two and one simple image. We have done this and this was a worry for us. This was a big worry. If you have two images, which one will you go to when you're on your market? And it's really not clear. So, one is in fact you you just have to put a summation through go through those intermediate and it will perform. But I think the question is if you interpolate between let's say you just want one single single interpolate. Just one single interpolate between two shapes, you see how it deforms. Yeah. And then you have actually doing some type points. That's your energy, do we design your energy function that can say something if you observe something function? Yeah, if you use if you use the interpolated. Can you say something about maybe the forces to be here? Yeah, we did all this, so we did the initial part was to do interpolation. We did all the interpolation and it really did not work at all efficiently. At all efficiently, you need to put a summation to go through this interpolated whatever in order for you to be. Maybe I should show that maybe in the future to include, when I yeah. You can use that data to infer more. Yes, yep, absolutely. Yes, yes. You need more information in between to be able to exactly. That's why I think it's a nice example because you can sort of you you can you can sort of calibrate the because i mean the images that we have given they have already a constant time scale on them there's no there's no variation in time scale just for the sake of time i you know can i continue during lunch just stop the recording thanks
