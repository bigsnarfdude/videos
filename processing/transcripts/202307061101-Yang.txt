Keep it to 15 minutes. So as I've actually shown here, it's been fantastic to have such a wonderful discussion among friends and colleagues. And so what I'm about to present today is actually jointly led by two postdocs. And I thought it was something that from Helen and Ing Shin. So Helen's actually back in Australia and Inxin is in the audience today. And I thought this work was just an exemplar. This work was just an example of how you know, someone with a very strong deep learning background who was a PhD student from my collaborator, Professor Jiman King, whose record is in medical imaging, and also my student Ying Xing, who had a lot of experience in sort of statistical bioinformatics. So, this work came about because the two postdocs worked so closely together, and it was just a pleasure to see. And it was just a pleasure to see this collaboration coming together. So, we're talking about spatially resolved transcriptomic data, and a lot of data that was presented in earlier session is sort of spots-based, where every spots have multiple cells. But now we actually go down to the subcellular level where every cells have multiple sort of transcripts. And so, what we are measuring, and what we call the subcellular Call the subcellular, especially transcriptomics data, is we're trying to capture this kind of total expression within each of the cells. So this is actually very high-resolution data, and I just call it SST image data. So this is an example of the data. So they have multiple transcripts, and we, for practical purposes, we actually sum all the channels, so it's like a maximum summation of the channel. Summation of the channel, and we also have a DAPI image which captures the nuclei information associated with them. So, what is the task at hand? The task at hand is actually trying to do segmentation of the cells. So, we want to identify all the pixels belonging to a cell in the form of a mask. And to do all this, essentially, we want to take these two information and come up with a mask that sort of says, this is a cell. A mask that sort of said this is a cell, and these are all the transcripts that actually belong to a particular cell. So the problem came when I was in Australia from 10X Ecidium, where we were just talking about what are the challenge with the cell segmentation is the currently existing method that's actually out there. A lot of them focus on the DEPI image or the DEPI segmentation that Ken sort of talked about just then, and they sort of simply explain. And then sort of simply expanded it. And so they don't actually take the cell morphology or the cell shape into account. And so this is one of the things when we started talking, they said, oh, the challenges is trying to take that into account. That sort of sparked the motivation of the work in this area. So challenges is not only there's hundreds of channels, it has high sparsity, no ground truth, sort of there's areas where densely packed together cells. So cell segmentation is challenging. So cell segmentation is challenging to try to capture that information. The channels are different protein markets. What are the 100 channels? The channels are just different genes. So all at different genes. So for example, there would be 300 channels. But you can't do it per channel because it's just very, very sparse. So far, we summed it into one thing in the category. So the classical method that's actually Classical method that's actually out there at the moment could be: say, you take the DEC in each and you sort of grow it, you do watershed. There is surprise, when I first got into it, I didn't realize, you know, in a very short span of time, probably within half a year or so, there was a flood of bio-archive paper in this space and also quite a few high-profile publications. So, there are methods where they sort of talk about being segmentation-free, which is using Tree, which is using modeling approach such as Basel and ClasterMap, to again assign different transcripts to the cell. And there are also more sort of segmentation-based methods, a lot of them based on deep learning cognition network, where again they try to, but at the end of the day, the problem is the same. They're trying to find the cell boundaries. Find the cell boundaries, or not so much the cell boundaries, but I think effectively classifying every transcript to a single cell. So that's actually the problem. So we look at this problem and then I spoke to my collaborator in computer science who says, okay, so what can we do? How can we combine sort of knowledge? So, you know, can we actually change cell-shaped morphology? So we put together a work. We put together a work that utilizes currently single cell references out there. So in this single cell transcription, there's a lot of ATLIS data. And in any tissue that you look at, there's a lot of data out there where we can use to actually capture cell type information. So we take that together with the damn image and the intensity damage, utilize a standard deep learning. A standard deep learning model, but the innovation is actually defining the different losses. So here we have six different losses, but one, we try to one capture the cell shape. So we actually look into that and found that different cell types have different sort of elongation shapes. So we capture that information. This is a fairly standard loss function which trying to control, you know. She's trying to control over-segmentation or under-segmentation. But another one that was a little bit more informative and biologically informed from the cell reference is if we roughly know, say, for melanoma cancer or breast cancer, the broad cell types that's available, we can actually estimate the positive and negative marker for different cell types. And trying to ensure that when we are segmenting a cell, that A cell that we have increased positive marker and minimized the negative marker. So that information also comes into play as one of the training processes. So I'm going to admit, deep learning is not my thing. I rely on the collaborator and also the student. So if you have very specific, detailed information, question, feel free to ask the question of Slack. So hopefully someone will answer. Like, so hopefully, someone will answer that. But the results is as follows. So, here is just an example to let you see visually how the various things perform. We compare to the current 10x method, basal methods, JAS, TA, and also some classical watershed. And you can see that looking at the H and E images, so visually, we have different shapes to try to capture some of the muscle cell being very elongated. Muscle cell being very elongated, fibroblasts are cell type that's elongated. Basil tends to be sort of over-segmenting the information. Many other sort of cell that's sort of buronal-based tends to sort of overgrow because they try to grow in a sort of a circular fashion. But being a statistician, it's not enough just to segment, it's trying to actually develop a performance framework to actually assess. Framework to actually assess. So in this manuscript that we have, 50% is developing, but the other 50% is trying to come up with a cell performance assessment framework that try to capture different components. So there's about 30 metrics in them, in which what I split into five different sort of components. Won't have time to talk through all of them, but I will just capture some of the key metric that is of interest. So if we look at some baseline characteristics. Some baseline characteristics. This is the chromium data. So, one of the data set we happen to have, the sort of the single-cell RNA-seq data. So, we say, hey, what is the number of transcript per cell on that data? And how does that actually compare with the rest of the cell type? So, you'll find that the nuclei-focused one tends to have very little because that's actually too small, right? And you don't want Small, right? And you don't want to just look at the nuclei, you actually want to look at the cell that's actually slightly bigger, which actually means that this is a very important graph or information scatterport to actually look at. So this measured, you know, for every gene, what's the percentage of cells overall that's expressed? So if you're not gaining any additional information than your nuclei, then your segmented cell and the nuclei would be sort of on the 45 diagonal line, which is what... On the 45 diagonal line, which is what basal is. If you are genuinely segmenting a cell, you would expect you are gaining more information, so you should see for every gene that dots is actually above the mark. Now, the next thing is how do the cell type composition actually changes compared to if you dissociate that information? So, roughly, if I look at, there's not a lot of data out there for the 10x public data in the breast. 10x public data in the breast cancer, we see that B cell and chromium, the correlation is 0.95. I'm going to be honest, most of the method out there, we're looking at this kind of cell type proportion in the high 90s. So people perform fairly similarly. So what do I feel it makes a difference? It's actually in the purity. So I look at the purity or the consistency within a cell. And so we look at the proportion of positive markers where you want to see. Positive markers where you want to see that being high, and then one minus the negative marker. So, in that sense, we want to see things performing on the top right-hand corner. And so, if you have a very small nuclei where the area is small, of course, you expect a lot more homogeneity, right? So, what's most important is to actually compare the average total transcript per cell because there's a trade-off. The bigger the region, there's less likely to be. Region, there's less likely to be homogeneity. So, the smaller the region, you tend to have that. So, big cells sort of capture that trade-off. It captures a proper size without costing a lot of purity. And finally, one of the sort of criteria that I got interested is also contamination. If you have two cells, because why are we interested in cell segmentation or spatial? Cell segmentation or spatial is we want to look at relationship between cells. So, for example, if you have V cells and T cells together, you don't expect T cells marker to come up on your V cells, right? So, on the x-axis, it's the distance between two cells. The further away the two cells is, the less chance of contamination. And so, we look at the distance, and everything is negative, right, and negatively correlated. So, the y-axis trying to measure the percentage. Trying to measure the percentage of cells expressing the negative marker. So, CD3B is a T cell marker. You don't want them to see in the B cell. So, you want this to be as low as possible and naturally as low as possible when you are further apart. So, it decreases, it goes apart, but you want to look at, so red is our method. Typically, that contamination is low compared to other methods. So, we created a lot of these kind of different metrics. A lot of these kinds of different metrics to try to capture what kind of information we genuinely want. And so I'm actually going to skip this replicability component. Just to say that this method, we tried it in COSMIC from Nanostring, NERSC from VisGen, and also it works for Stereo C in VGI. Not very extensive. Most of them we take their public data, which is, you know, one or two images, and run. And current work for And current workflow actually works through. I just want to say what was actually interesting is we sort of in this gen, or most of these methods are coming up with cell membrane marker at the same time, not just DEDGI. So can we actually incorporate cell membrane marker? Yes, since we posted our manuscript online, we have improved and included that cell membrane marker, which allows us to actually capture how many. Capture how many cells was that can actually capture with the cell membrane marker, to our surprise, it was about 30% of the cells that don't have nuclei in it. And so we're just interested in what's the characteristic when we are capturing these cells, where partially capture cells that has no nuclei and fully capture cells that has nuclei. Clearly, the ones with more nuclei is larger cells, more transcript. More transcript. There's no difference in terms of the shape. They tend to be a little bit purer in the positive marker. For this one, I have to say n equal to one limitation. We also thought it was very interesting that the tumor cell tend to have the nucleus in it with the fibroblast that's surrounding it the other way around. And because we use self-annotation, Cell annotation, we have a method to actually capture other sign and intermediate cell type annotation that things without nucleus was harder to annotate the information. So this is very new results. If people are interested, then I'll post this. There's a manuscript on bio archive and the code is publicly available, both the deep learning code and as well as the evaluation metric. Evaluation metric. And so before I finish, I would like to thank the team in Sydney. So this is when we are in COVID, and then that's after. Do we have any questions between the cell has non-nucleus or you have non-nucleus data? So you could segment a cell. So you have to segment a cell because you have two layers of you can stain it with the DAPI which shows the nucleus or you can stain it with sort of the cell membrane. So it has a nucleus, you don't have to stain it. We can't see it. Yes. So what they're saying is it's very likely when you slice it the nucleus is above or below the slice so you can't actually capture it because it's not a 3D. That's why a lot of people are thinking, after all we are looking at a 2D slice where the cells is a 3D. The cells as a 3D object rather than Alyssa. Gene, are you worried that using the single-cell data to create a model of the transcript that you expect to see in a cell by the segmentation based on the expectation? How do we define cells? Because we're sort of saying this is what we expect to see, and we will optimise the method until we see what we expect to see. So, yes and no. So, yes and no. I fully appreciate the discussion we have the last few weeks about that. You've got to realize that there is actually six different loss functions. So, most people are segmenting even without that information, right? So, if there's, so people actually ask me, what happened if the cell type is not there? So, you have to read, there's only one out of the six loss function. So, a lot of things are still looking at the membrane marker. So, you're still going to segment it if the membrane marker is there. Membrane marker is there. I think this, I'm just guessing, I think more work needs to be done. It's when the very densely packed region, this is when this kind of cell type marker probably will make a bigger difference. What about for, because I think the data you showed was from breast cancer. There's breast cancer, lung cancer, from cancer samples. So, you know, most of the, a lot of the public data that's come out has been on brain, where we've got super weird shapes like astrocytes. Shapes like astrocytes, which you probably process. So, astrocytes, like the exon, you can't guide, you have to stain it with some other things, colour. But the different weird shapes, so we did actually test this also on the brain data, just it's in the archive paper. One more question while she asked Julian.
