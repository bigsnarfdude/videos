and maybe also about random geo-omorphisms. But so first I should say a little bit about what I mean when I talk about divergence. So what's the general setting? I have some compact metric space X and I have some homeomorphism on X on X. And so the question And so the question I want to ask is how big can the space of xodic probability measures for f on x b okay and so what do I mean by how big? So what precisely So, what precisely the question I'm interested in today: Can the underlying space have finite dimension, but the space of aquatic invariant measures. Aquatic invariant measures have infinite dimension. And so when I say dimension, I actually mean upper box dimension this one. Should I recall what upper box dimension is? Okay. You can recall, yeah. So What you are doing is you look at the epsilon covering number. So, the number of epsilon balls that you need to. The number of epsilon balls that you need to cover your space x. And we are interested in the growth rate of this. And so for the upper box dimension, we are interested in the polynomial growth. So what we are doing is we take the logarithm of the epsilon covering number and compare this to the absolute value of the logarithm of epsilon when epsilon tends to zero. And so for upper box dimension, I'm taking here. Upper box dimension I'm taking here LM sup. If I would take LMINF, I would get the lower box dimension. And so today I want to consider upper box dimension of spaces. So one question one could ask next is, okay, if I have a metric space, how do I define the metric on the space of ergodic measures? And so for this, I will use the one. For this, I will use the one Passage diameter. And so one way of defining this is the following. So if I take any two probability measures on X, the one Massage distance between these measures can be These measures can be taken as the supremum over all one digit functions from x to r and I do the comparison of the integral of g with respect to mu or mu. So the diffs difference between the integrals of g, d, G d U compared to G A and so I should mention that there's a different definition of the one Wasterstein metric in terms of an optimal transport problem, but this is the definition which is faster to write down. Okay. Okay. And so in which context I want to consider this? So I should mention this was first studied in the context of smooth dynamics where X as the underlying space is a compact surface and F is often smooth. And in fact in this settings it also can happen, okay, here the upper works dimension is always two and you can get this infinite dimension. Infinite-dimensional space of ergodic measures. But so today I want to focus on three automorphisms since this is more related to the topic of this conference. Okay, so then I should tell you what kinds of geo automorphisms I want to consider. So I think they were mentioned, but only potentially. So the kinds of trees I am interested in are structurally Homogeneous trees. So what's this? So this is, these are rooted trees where every vertex on the same level has the same number of roots. So we have the root, which might have two children, and then on the first level, every vertex has. First level, every vertex has the same number of children, but this number here of children might be different than this number of children. And so the way I denote this is I denote the common degree of the vertices on the same level by dI. So on the zeros level we have two children, on the first level we have three children, and maybe Three children, and maybe on the next level you have two children again. So and the kinds of trees I will consider always have at least two children on every level. Because uh if you just have one uh children it doesn't really make a big difference, but it's Big difference, but it's helpful for technical reasons. So now, if I have a tree like this and I have an automorphism of this tree, I can look at the action of the automorphism on the space of ends of this tree. This tree, and then I can ask the question: how large the space of ergodic invariant measures can be. So before I'm talking about metrics, I should say that the space of ergodic invariant measures of tri-automorphism like this. Triotomorphism like this has a very nice description. You can think of this as the ends of the orbit tree. So if I take an automorphism like this, so maybe I should. Automorphism is not required to preserve the levels, right? It is required? It is required to preserve the levels. So I would say Now it says to fix the root, and maybe it interchanges the first two versus on the first level, and it has to send a child of a vertex to a child of the image. So for example, this vertex has to be sent to one of these three. So I won't fill in all the edges because this will take a long time. Will take a long time, but so for sample, I will take something like this. So I have on the zeros level, I have only one orbit. So And on the first level I have also only one orbit and on the second level I have two orbits. So I have the orbit of these four vertices and I have a different orbit consisting of these two vertices. And so the tree I take here is the tree of orbits on a given Of orbits on a given level. And so I have the obvious construction that I have an edge between two orbits if they are representative such there's an edge between them. And then I can identify the space of exotic measures on the ends of. The ends of my original tree with the ends of this orbit tree. Okay. So can you say why that's true? It's not obvious to me. So I think this was, for example, done by Kiochuk and Shabu? It's a theorem, not a it's it's a you definitely have to prove something, but they kind of when you look at that you see that that's When you look at that, you see that it's natural. And so I think you can do this not only in a setting of just an automorphism but also of group actions, and then you have to prove this with more care, but a similar statement is still true. So this gives us another So uh this gives us a nice description of this space, but so now I should tell you what kinds of metrics I want to consider on the space of ends of my original tree and how this will affect this kind of space. And so the first thing one could try is something like an ultrametric or a spherical ultrametric. So there the I take it's a distance of two ends one over the One over the number of vertices on the level where they diverge. Okay, so what do I mean by this? It's the total number of vertices. So what do I mean by this? So an end is just an infinite path from the root down the tree. And so for example, I could take an end by just going left straight away. And take a different end. To take a different end and do the same thing up to the second level, but then maybe go down a different way. And then the distance between those two ends would be one over the number of vertices on this level, so one over six. So I guess in the case that all the D's are the same for a prime, this is just a p-addic distance. Yes. And this is in the opposite organization of that point. Yes. So this is a very nice metric. So for example, the automorphisms of the tree act via isometries on this metric. But for the construction of emergence, this is not very helpful because this means that We have a map basically from this quotient map is one Lipschitz subjection with respect to this joke and so. And so, if you think of the one Massage diametric as an optimal transport problem, it's not hard to see that you have some kind of contraction because if you have two ends and you want to Uh Bernard, I'm sorry. What mapping is that? Should that be from boundary TF? Yeah, so it's really from boundary T. Yeah. This is from boundary T to this. And what is the mapping? Okay, so there are multiple ways to define this mapping. One way would be via this identification. Identification. So you have your original tree, and you have an end in this tree, and then you have the quotient lamp to the tree of orbits. And then you use this identification. That's one way. Another way of doing this would be if it's taking Birkhoff sums and hoping that everything works out and it does. So, what you could do is you could take the Do is you could take the weak limit of the empirical measures. Okay, so you're just taking the empirical measures and you have to show that this limit exists. And so if you take this definition, then you can see that this is contraction if you have an action via isometries because you can bound the Wasserstein distance between the empirical measures. Empirical measures via the original map just by taking the transport, the trivial transport on the empirical measures. So in this setting what you have is that you have one ligit projection from the original space you were considering to the space of empirical measures. So this obviously can't be bigger than the original space. Than the original space. So we have to do something different. I'm asking a good question. Yeah, I identity on the bottom of the graphical side. That's the boundary of what? Within this graph? So this is the space of orbits. Orbits. So you have your original tree and you had an automotive. You had an automorphism, and now you are identifying every vertex which is on the same orbit. And this gives you a new kind of tree. And the ends of this tree will be identified with the agricultural components. And it only works because you're working with an automatism of the tree, right? Yes, it's not true in general. It's not true in general. Well, it's true in this specific uh setting. In this specific setting. And so we can use this to get an easy understanding of the good metric on the original space of n's. So this metric didn't work because isometries Isometries have this property that you have a one-liter subjection. So, what I will do instead is the following construction which is a classical counterset construction. So, I will fix some stretching factor. Some stretching factor greater than one. And now I will associate to every vertex of my tree a sub-interval of 0, 1. And I start with the whole interval. And then I evenly divide this into sub-intervals of relative size. 1 over lambda times di. So this has size 1 over lambda times d0. And I continue this process. So I have to subdivide this evenly in three intervals and so on. And so on. And now for every end, I have a nested sequence of intervals with shrinking size. So I have a map from the space of x into the unit interval. And I will take as the metric, the metric I get. Metric I get via this embedding. Okay? And so, what can I say about this? Is there an upper bound for the TIs? No. That's part of the punch structure. So, with this embedding, I can state the main theorem. So, given DI degree sequence and Uh vertical homogeneous tree with this uh degree sequence then uh exists um automorphism automorphism Of this tree with infinite-dimensional space of ergodic measures with respect to the Hassanstein metric, with respect to this embedding. If an only If and only if the following holds so I want that the degrees can grow often enough very highly and so the way of raising this would be that I take the logarithm of the degree Of the degree, and I compare it to the sum of logarithms of the previous degrees. And I want that this LimpSoup is also infinite. Yeah, so so so infinity is you didn't finish the first sentence. Now it's a sentence. And so that should be. That should be uh F does going to be automorphism of the tree. Uh so I think that secondly so okay first of all what does this mean? This means the number of This means the number of children on a certain level compared to the number of vertices on a given level can be not bounded polynomially. The second theorem is there exists a decrease sequence and And an automorphism of the spectral homogeneous tree with this degree sequence such that we not only have that the upper box dimension is infinity, but if we look at The following. So, for the upper box dimension, I had to take the logarithm of the epsilon curving number and compare this to the logarithm of epsilon. And so now I'm not interested in the polynomial growth, but in the stretch exponential growth. What is a stretched exponential growth? So I'm taking the second logarithm, and here I can say that this is equal to one. So we have one stretched exponential growth. And in fact, this holds For almost all conjugates of f. So, in a sense, if I take the random element, the random a random uh element of the tree of uh a random element of the automorphisms of the tree and I conjugate uh f then with probability one this still holds okay since I only have uh two minutes uh I can very briefly say of how you can show this so there are um The easiest part is showing that if this is bounded, then this is actually bounded. And in fact, you can use the metric I defined earlier to get a nice bound because the metric I defined here is bounded by the ultra-metric I defined earlier. And then for the existence. For the existence theorem, it's actually easier to prove this kind of existence theorem. And here we are using an automorphism where the branching behavior of the orbits alternates. And of course, the degree sequence goes quite fast. And we actually prove this probabilistic state. Probabilistic statement with the use of the Hofning inequality. And then you can adjust this construction and arrive at the existence part of the statement. I think with this, I can start. Thank you very much. Do we have comments or questions for Verna? Questions over now? Sorry. So just about the last part of the second theory. So could you just say it again? So like you take, so for almost all conjugates of the map that's understood that exist? So you fix a degree sequence, which was quite fast. You take there's a certain There's a certain automorphism such that if you take a random element of the group of automorphisms and you take the conjugation. But this is like for this special F that you... Yes, this is for a special F, yeah. So it's a segment about controversy tasks. Yes. So in their guy's theory to logical dynamics, people kind of Plant of dynamics, people spend a great deal of time trying to understand what the generic transformation looks like. Maybe third transformation appears probability one. What about here in general? Or you know, transformations on trees. You're a theory like that. So the the next natural question would be what happens uh for just the random element uh with respect to the hard measure? Respect to the Haar measure. And so one problem is that for if I take a random pair rotation, you don't have that many orbits. So with the help of fixing the contributing class, I could circumvent this issue and make sure that I have a lot of orbits. But it's an interesting question: what happens? Yeah it's an interesting question what happens in general for the random elementary spectrum chains. Might be related there was kind of an older IPL scored and somebody else about random automorphisms of a tree that on average they generate frequently. Interesting. This embedding basically guarantees that the embedded 1001. If I add it in 0, 1 would be less than 1. Yes. And so actually, so this is something which is called here for the space of ergodic measures. And so this is This definition here is normally called metric order. So, or here because I'm taking Limps of upper metric order. And so there's a result that the metric order of the space of probability measures is bounded by the upper box dimension of the underlying space. So this is really the most that we can get. That we can start the speaker one more time. So this means we will close the morning session and we need to check out of our rooms right now at 11. That's all. We will do it after eleven. And for those of you who stay for lunch, I look forward to seeing you in time for one way you would like to say some closer words. To say some closer works. Thank everyone for coming. We look forward to see you again. You've been this real quick. Thanks to the organizers. Yes.
