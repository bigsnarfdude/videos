And you'll be talking about cellulose guidance to the cycle morphogenesis. Ah, it's already up. Thank you very much, Veleski. And thank you for joining us here. Thank you. I'm very glad to be among you, although virtually and not unfortunately, not all of the time. So I will discuss today a very simple question. A very simple question. How does a plant organ grow anisotropically? Well, here I draw squarish organs. So, several people in the audience have made important contributions to this question, and I hope the simple message that I have here will bring some food for thought. So, we addressed this question with just one second. Just one second. We addressed this question in collaboration with Dorota Tietkroska from the University of Silesia. What I will show you in the following is mostly the work of talented PhD students, Corinth Emollier, who's by the way is looking for a postdoc. So we worked on the SIPO of Arabidopsis Taliana as a model of Zestem. Taliana as a model of system, and we investigated anisotropy of core organ growth in this system. So, well, maybe the most naive answer to how does a plant organ grow anisotropically is that cellulose is aligned in the cell wall, and that the direction of alignment of the cellulose prescribes growth, more growth in the perpendicular direction, and that the degree of alignment of cellulose. And that the degree of alignment of cellulose gives or prescribes growth anisotropy. Then the next question is what prescribes the direction of cellulose in the cell wall. So now it's rather well established that cellulose synthesis occurs along the tracks of microtubules and that cellulose synthases are bound to. those synthases are bound to microtubules by a complex involving several proteins, including CSI1, on which I will focus here. So we looked at CSI1 mutant plants and measured the dimensions of sepals. So here, this is a sepal stream from one, well, from the side, from the other side, and from the top. And we measured the dimensions along the surface. Along the surface, and CSI mutants have the same width as wild-type plants, wild-type plants, but they are shorter. So, we wanted to know one that is established during sepal development. So, we imaged live flowers that are growing. So, you see here a sequence with flower seams from the side and from the top, and we measured the dimension. The top, and we measured dimensions of sepals. So we see that the widths have roughly the same behavior, whereas the length gradually departs, well, in CSI1 gradually departs from the well-type case. So there is overall reduced growth and isotropy of CSI1 sepals. We then looked at cell scale. So we kind of quantified cell growth and isotropy. We can quantify cell growth and isotropy at the cell scale. Here it's seen in color scale between one isotropic growth and two a certain level of anisotropy. And we looked at the differences in growth and isotropy between wild type plants and CSI mutant plants as a function of time. And to our surprise, we found that growth inisotropy at cell level was comparable. At cell level, it was comparable in the two genotypes. So there is another issue with that, even if the two are not clearly distinct with respect to growth anisotropy, and I will explain that in the following. So we wanted to know whether cell growth anisotropy, as measured, is compatible with sepal length to width ratio. So what What the average cell growth anisotropy tells us how the aspect ratio of the organ changes through time. So, from this step to this step, the aspect ratio length over width is multiplied by Gautama 1, the average cell growth anisotropy between the two steps. So, the resulting aspect ratio is obtained by multiplying the average cell growth anisotropy values and the initial And the initial aspect ratio of the organ. So, the predictions based on our measurements for cell growth anisotropy were about four for wild type and for CXI1 sepals, whereas the observed ones are two, around two. So, well, in what I showed you, I implicitly considered that all cells were going in the same direction. So, we looked at Direction. So we looked at the direction of cell growth and we tried to quantify the spatial variations of growth direction. So here are two excerpts where you see the main directions of growth of cells. So these are two examples from WildType and CSI1. And to make that more quantitative, we measured the angle between the main growth directions of two of neighboring pairs of neighboring cells. And here are the results shown by. are the results shown by according to genotype. So in the CSI1 there is slightly more in both genotypes cell growth direction is variable spatially and there is slightly more spatial variability in the CSI1 mutants. So there's reduced consistency of growth direction in CSI1 mutants. And then we wanted to know whether this is compatible with our observed Compatible with our observed aspect ratios of final of mature sepals. So, if we account for variability in growth direction, the simple model that I showed you initially has to be modified with every growth anisotropy value of growth anisotropy small gamma has to be replaced by a modified growth anisotropy that accounts for cell growth and That accounts for cell growth and isotropy and for variability in cell growth direction. So, sigma quantifies the variability in cell growth direction. So, if we take the values of gamma measured from experiments, the values of variabilities in directions measured from experiments, we predict aspect ratios of 2.7 for wild type and 2.1 for CSI1, which are close but slightly higher than the observed ones. Than the observed ones. So, this tells us that accounting for variability of growth direction is required to explain the aspect ratios of simples. So, this brings a quantitative support to a qualitative proposal by Baskin, which is almost 20 years ago, well, 20 years old, where he considered. Where he considered that the variability of, well, that cell growth anisotropy could be regulated or depend at organ scale on the differences in the orientation of cellular microcribles between cells. So, with at cell level, so each region here is say a cell. In each cell, the alignment of cell levels might be a cell. Alignment of cellulose microfibols is equivalent in the two pictures, but on the right, there are differences in the direction of cellulose microfibrils between cells. So from what we find, we propose that cell growth and isotropy, that organ growth anisotropy results from cell growth anisotropy and consistency of growth direction, spatial consistency. We see that growth and isotropy depends on scale, maybe to ring a bell. So, this is maybe related to the proposal by PCEMEC that growth of tissues is fractal. This raises question about models and multi-scale models, how to move from cell to tissue. Cell to tissue. And so this is based on what I've shown you. So there are some bits that I haven't discussed much. But so this, what we get also raises questions about the function of CSI1 or about the function of guidance of cellulose synthase by along microtubules. Is it to set the degree of growth anisotropy at cells? Of growth anisotropy at cell level, or rather to ensure consistency of growth direction across an organ. There are other issues that were discussed already a little bit earlier today or yesterday. The cell wall is multilamellate with cellulose fibrils that differ in orientation across the thickness of the cell wall. So which So, which layers inside the wall are important to determine the direction of cell growth? And this also calls for multi-scale models from the level of the lamella to the cell wall, which was actually addressed in the previous talk. So, I had this on my slides before listening to Gabriella. So, that's all I wanted to say. So that's all I wanted to say, and I would like to thank you for your attention. Thank you very much. So I think we can open the floor to questions and discussion. Christopher, please. Yes, thank you very much, Ariski. This was very clear, but the only point that I didn't get is how you obtain this formula where you link the Where you link the you recompute an effective what you call this gamma gamma with the actual gamma. What is the correction factor? And can you explain intuitively how you get this correction factor? So I write the growth tensor and I say that the growth tensor accounts for some. For some level of anisotropy that I prescribe that is fixed, but that the orientation of growth direction is a random variable. And then I average that growth tensor over all realization of the orientation of well, the local orientation of cells, growth. And I get that correction. And in the formula, you see that. Formula, you see that the larger the noise or the variability, the smallest the effective anisotropy of growth. Or in other words, to make, well, there's a simple limit that you can understand if cells are, each cell has one direction of growth. They all have the same growth and isotropy. If they grow all in random direction, All in random direction, the resulting the result will be isotropic on average. Online, we have Richard? Yeah, so I have a question related to your last point there, which is also on Gabriella's open questions about this layered model idea, right? And so then one easy way to do it, maybe, would be to do what. It maybe would be to do what Gamula is suggesting, where you have multiple layers and then you just put you know elements with different material properties in each layer. And this has some advantages because it's easy to specify and you can do it. And then you would imagine that the new layers would come in with no residual stress. And then as the simulation proceeds, they would gain more and more stress. And then maybe at the end, you toss them off after a certain time. So I was thinking, you know, is it possible or is it even mathematically tractable to make Tractable to make, you know, sort of a continuum model for that, like so an actual material that would behave like that? Or is it, or do you think it'd be just simpler to model it with layers, like actual layers in your simulation? There is already one model which is continuous, which were, so when, well, it's the end of the day, and I'm very bad at remembering people. Are very bad at remembering people's names. So, a group of English applied mathematicians and they did a continuous version of this idea with growth in only in one direction. Rosemary Dyson. Yes, Rosemary and Dyson and collaborators. Thank you. I was going to say, just for the material, a truly isotropic model, not. Purely isotropic model, not orthotropic, but truly isotropic, because this one, you know, if you have the fibers going in all these different directions, this thing has a lot of material parameters. So, how you would actually get a handle on figuring that out? Whereas in the layered model, this parameters are very simple, right? You have sort of fibers going this way, and then fibers going this way, and you can kind of forget about all the Poisson ratios and stuff like that. And their interaction would produce this more complicated model. So, or maybe one kind of thing. Or maybe one can be used to test the other, or something like this. Maybe. Well, that's a difficult issue in whatever the model is. Well, there will be additional parameters that would be difficult to measure. So, yeah, I don't know how to deal with it. Neither do I. Hi, thank you. Very interesting talk. I wanted to like, I've just submitted a paper where we use, we continue with Rosemary Dyson and we expand on some of our previous stuff and some of the stuff that have also been done with Lear Band as well, where we use this like fluid mechanics equation for the sale of reorientation. And I think there is the possibility to actually use it because you just maybe, if you kind of make certain assumptions. If you kind of make certain assumptions that they don't, they're not being like extended in the like within the cell wall direction and they're just being extended, you know, and reorientated upwards with the growth. You just maybe need to know like what angle they're initially deposited at and like kind of like the rate of like growth or the rate of reorientation, which you could maybe get from Charles Henderson's data from where he's got. Henderson's data from where he's got the cellulose reorientates as the cell grows. There could be more work using that. So there is, yeah, I think that's a good direction. Well, getting back to the question of measuring parameters. So it's possible to constrain a little bit more the parameters because it's possible to Because it's possible to have some idea about the average orientation of cellulose across the whole cell wall by either dyes when they work or by Raman spectroscopy as what our collaborators did. It's also possible to image the direction of To image the direction of synthesis of new microfibrils. So maybe this can constrain a little bit more the models. Thank you. Thank you, Areski. It was very interesting. I have last small question. How do you avoid? Small question. How do you avoid tearing or tears between these cells which are growing in different directions? So that's a very good point. So the direction is when we represent growth by, well, aerial growth, direction, degree of anisotropy, it's a simplification of the changes in shape of a cell. Of a cell. So, if two cells share the same edge, and one is going in that direction, the other is going in that direction, they can still do that while sharing the same edge. So it's a little bit in your like in your fractal model. So, you have cells or domains growing all in different directions without tearing. Without tearing. Very interesting. It creates almost kind of chains of relations of directions because each subsequent one has to be in 1D related to two previous ones. Very interesting. Thank you. Too much thoughts too well. Between the wild type and mutant, the widths doesn't change, just the lengths, which is modified. And is that possible with just the description you gave us? I mean, if you have less oriented Oriented. So, I there in what I described, I only discussed an isotropy. So, the mutant has a smaller area than wild type plants. And so, you could get, well, if the aerial growth is smaller and anisotropy. Smaller and isotropy is smaller, you can still get to the same width for the mutants. So I don't know whether the fact that they have the same width is only a coincidence or not. It might be that there are other processes that are involved in determining the width that we haven't perturbed here. Any other questions? And I would also like to mention if people have other questions for the other speakers of the session, because we were going quite quickly, so for any of the other speakers, please do we ask yeah we have a speaker and uh we're doing really well yeah because it's uh we have 20 minutes i mean what we could do now is to invite I mean, what we could do now is to invite the next speaker ready to the floor. And then afterwards, we can, you know, again, address questions to that speaker or to anyone else in the session. So, yeah, so Sarah, it's about you. Is that okay? If we Sarah Robinson? Oh, yeah. 40 minutes. Oh, it's a 40 hours, right? The lucky one. You could have done 40. I had a question that related to Dan elements of Dan's talk to the both. It's possible. So we're going to have a question. It links a bit with. Is it about biomechanics? Go ahead. So it seems to me Dan explained very nicely the kind of concept of crypto. Of a concept of creep growth and importance for plant and organ development. So that's very, very clear, at least to me, I think. Now, if you look at the empirical data from a time lapse, of which there has been a lot in different organs recently, there's been many efforts started actually by Richard Smith to correlate that growth with Correlate that growth with wall properties by looking at cell wall stiffness estimated by osmotic treatment experiments, where you evaluate wall displacement after plasmolysis in the context of the same samples where growth data was obtained. And what those studies seem to show, they've been done by different groups, and I mean seem there at some level. I mean, it seems they're at some level at least okay, is that you have a correlation of softer walls with faster growth and vice versa, that growth cessation may correlate with the or correlate with the walls stiffening. So, and that I mean it's at some level intuitive, but I have some difficulty in linking that with creep growth, right? Because you wouldn't predict that creep. That creep growth is associated with stiffening, as we believe that is measured by those osmotic treatment experiments, like which evaluate, I say again, the displacement of the wall after class molecules. So it'd be interesting to see what people think about that. I mean, at the end of the day, it seems that stiffness as measured by that and extensibility, which relates to creep growth, are different processes. Different processes, and yet we can measure stiffness correlating with faster growth. So reduced stiffness correlating with faster growth. So did everybody get the question? It's basically to reconcile this idea of growth, stiffness, and link it with treat now. Yeah, and I think we should build. I mean, maybe the experiments are not measuring what we think. I don't know. And as far as I know, no one's done the osmotic treatment experiment. The osmotic treatment experiments on expansive Newtons, which should be, I mean, would be important purely as good experimental tracks as a control. So, Areski, I think, has a has a comment on this. I hope. Areski, you have a handle. Yes, so the question is about whether the modulus of the wall or the stiffness of the wall is truly related or Related or how to explain that it is related to growth. So, strictly speaking, growth is related to, is irreversible, so it's related to the irreversible deformations of the wall, as nicely discussed by Dan. So, I think we should take this correlation between modulus and growth as reflective. As reflecting the status of the wall, or the modulus is can be indicative of the status of the wall. So, if the wall has a given composition, the same composition, then the modulus, for instance, reflects the degree of cross-linking of the wall. That's well established for polymers. So, if you take a given polymer, you don't change the composition, but you change. Composition, but you change the degree of cross-linking, you obtain something that appears stiffer. So, and well, that's on one hand. On the other hand, the degree of cross-linking will certainly have an influence on how the world weeps. So, my current opinion, but it's only an opinion at this point, is that the correlation between growth and Between growth and modulus is indicative of another factor that is in between. So, I was actually going to ask Daniel to comment on that, that you raised your hand. So, I have a slightly different perspective, maybe a majorly different perspective. So, I agree with Aretzky that these modulus measurements, stiffness measurements of various sorts, tell us something about the structure of the cell wall. Not necessarily cross-linking, but it tells us something about the structure of the cell wall. But it tells us something about the structure of the cell wall. And that's, you know, our model is trying to bring those two together and provide molecular interpretation of that. So, cross-linking was, sorry, cross-linking was only an illustration, not just to make the point. But I'm also influenced by a number of experiments that we've done where there's a disconnect between the ability of the cell walls, the living cell walls to create, and the stiffness that you measure by these mechanical techniques. By these mechanical techniques. So, for instance, you get a young hypocotyl, you put blue light on it, the growth stops very quickly. The creepability or the modulus of the cell wall doesn't change. And so there's something, and our interpretation of that is, and the basic data is that there's a change in the acidification of the cell wall, which changes the activity of expansants. And when we change, And when we change the activity of expansions, we do not necessarily change the modulus of the cell wall. We can also demonstrate that in vitro experiments where we take a cell wall, we add expansion to the cell wall. When it's held under constant tension, it will creep. But if we take that very same wall and we do these stress-strain measurements, we don't see a change. So, what I would say is there are biological correlates between the softness of the cell wall, the stiffness. Softness of the cell wall, the stiffness of the cell wall, and growth. That's in some cases, it's true. That's true. In other cases, it's not true. So how do you interpret the case where some cases that correlation works, some cases where it doesn't work? My interpretation is the correlation is not a deep one, right? That there are other factors at play when the wall stiffness changes, and it does not necessarily tell you. Does not necessarily tell you the ability of the cell wall to creep or the ability of the cell wall to grow. Right, it's just that, I mean, that makes sense. And I think you, what the experiments you described fit very well with what I would expect. What I can swear is that when this estimation with osmotic treatment have been done and they've been done in the shoot meristem, the sepal, and the root, the growing root teeth. All of them show the Steve, all of them show the same correlation, so it seems what correlation exactly that you estimate a softer, wall and faster growing cells. Can I try and attempt to bring those two seeming contradictions together? So, you would expect a correlation for a given extensibility, you would expect a correlation. You would expect a correlation between stiffness and creep because it relates to the number of microfibrils in the wall, all right? So, the more microfibrils you have, all right, the more they will resist tensile stress and also the more or tensile force and the more they will, the less they will creep. So, but I think it depends on whether your extensibility is fixed or not. So, if you have a fixed extensibility, like take a Maristem, it need not be that extensibilities vary. Need not be that extensibility is varying within either within a cell or between cells. And so you're going to see this correlation. However, if you shine blue light and you have this rapid response, so expansins, what they do is they may be rapid responders, as it were. They give a rapid change in extensibility. All right. And so now you see a decorrelation between extensibility, the stiffness. And so I think it's a question of what's going on. So given that. Going on. So, given that expansions are constant, as it were, then you will see the correlation. However, if you now vary expansions, you'll see a rapid response that will totally decouple the two. So, it seems to me there isn't really a contradiction. It's a question of what is being fixed and what isn't. But from that, then, thank you, first of all. From that, would you predict that expansion is less developmentally regulated? I think that's an open question. To what extent the outgrowth, for example, we heard about the lateral root formation. Is that due to expansions, for example, varying the extensibility of walls, or is that due to a slower process of remodeling of the walls? Now, I think a time scale can tell you a lot because to remodel a wall such that to alter its mechanical properties take To alter its mechanical properties takes time because you've got to replace or allow sufficient growth to occur to replace your wall or significantly alter your wall properties. If you're seeing a response that's going happening with the order of hours or six, I mean, a short time scale of less than a day, I would expect you're dealing with something like expansions. If you're dealing with something on a longer time scale, then probably would. Then, probably, wall remodeling is involved. So, I think it's very much dependent on time scale. I don't think time scale tells you, but it tells you for sure a rapid response cannot be due to laying down of microfibrils. So, and moreover, laying down of microfibrils, you have to stop laying them down in order to weaken the wall, to make it more extensible. Whereas expansions will give you instant joy of increased extensibility. So, that is one way of describing. So, that is one way of discriminating. Before giving the word to Brima, I would just make a comment and maybe reconcile what you showed us yesterday in Rico and what you showed this morning, Daniel. Because, I mean, if you say I have, okay, very simple image of these two fabulous interaction, lateral interaction, would make some point elastic behavior. But at some point, also, you can loosen this and have movement. So then. Movement. So then, if I go back to Enrico's number of fibers that are bearing the stress you are applying on your material, so if at some point you have a low number of material, then short time elasticity is weak because you have just few fibers. Long term, you get sliding and also the apparent viscosity is also low. So, I mean, if the material has less fibers like this, we just Have less fibers like this with just this model, then you will get at the same time short-time scale low elasticity and long-time scale, low viscosity. So you will also grow very fast. And the other way around, of course, if you have more fibers, then it's more stiff at short-time scale and also more viscosity at long-time scale. So slow growth. So, yeah. We know, please. You're muted, Poino. Sorry about that. I just wanted to say just the same thing that Endrico Nicis said. It's also a matter of people looking at change over development versus change driven by the environment and rapid changes and it's a matter of time scale. But the point here that I wanted to add is that a proper model of growth should handle both because plant has to handle both. Because plant has to handle both. So I think it's a real challenge to our model of growth that you handle both of them. And that's just the only point I wanted to make to add. Thank you, Gutenberg. Yes, I mean, this is relevant to Gabriella's presentation, right? Because how she kind of had formulated growth mathematically, as I understood this basically. I mean, if I got it right, I mean, I know. Okay. Actually, I think now, given time, we can ask Sarah to prepare her screen.
