Hello everyone, I'm Dong Yuan, second year bioinformatics PG from UCRA, and my advisor is Dr. Jinyi Jessica Lee. And today I'm talking about pseudo time D, which is the newest method for identifying differential extract genes along pseudo time in single cell RNA sequencing technology. RNA sequencing technology. And here is a brief illustration of our method. So for single-cell sequencing technology, compared to traditional box RNA-seq technology, it can measure the expression of each individual cell. So you can see here a lot of different cells, and they have different colors and different shape, which represents that they belong to some continuous transition types. Types. And here, slow time is the underlying unobserved variable which can describe the graduate transition pattern of the single cells. So people have different pseudo-time inference methods to try to infer this time. And we call this pseudo-time because this is not the true time or age of each cell, but only some underlying variable which is inferred from data. And one natural question is that people want to. One natural question is that people want to use this two time as the X covariate and the gene expression for specific gene for S Y covariates, so they can perform like a traditional regression analysis to test if this gene is changing along the strew time. But the problem of this approach is that people treat the X covariate stew time as fixed, but this is not true because stew time is inferred from data. It is not the real time. So it actually contains a lot of uncertainty. Actually, it contains a lot of uncertainty. So, our method is the first method which can capture the uncertainty of the store time. And our approach is very simple. We sub-sample in the cells and divide them into smaller samples, and we perform the store time inference on each sub-sample. And then we permute the cells so that we break the relationship between the store time and each individual cell. And so we get the non-cases, and then we perform the NBRC. From the NB or DRE fleet, NB generalized additive model on each individual samples. And thus, we get the non-distribution of the test statistics and get the valid p-values. So here is a plot showing our results. And the first plot is a quantile plot which compares the empirical t values and the uniform. Values and the uniform distribution under the norm. So, here we can see our two-time D method is the method closest to the diagonal line, which means that it perfectly follows the uniform distribution under the null. But compared to other methods, all the other methods actually generate anti-conservative p-values. And this disadvantage is actually reflected on this plot. And here we use the beach procedure to try to control the FDR at Control the FDR at 0.05 level. But here we can see only our suitime D can successfully control the FDR, while all the other methods fail to control the FDR at the 0.05 level. And last, we want to compare the power of different methods. So we use, since the beach procedure does not work here, so we use the empirical FDP at 0.05 level and we can see like our method also generates a high Our method also generates the highest power. So, this is only the simulation results, but we also have plenty of results on real data. This is our R package implementation. We will very appreciate if you will try to our newest R package and give some comments. Thanks. Hey, thanks very much, Dong Yuan. And we'll immediately go on to our next speaker. Immediately go on to our next speaker, but I encourage you to ask Dongyan any questions that you might have in the breakout sessions. Our next speaker is.
