So I'll explain why. So I think my title was two problems. So this is a workshop on random algebraic geometry. And to me, random algebraic geometry presents the opportunity of a nice link. Are of a nice mixture of techniques that come from algebra and that comes from analysis, something that one doesn't see too much in other areas. So these two problems that I want to talk about today are examples in which I'm personally involved and in which there are ingredients from real algebraic geometry into problems that I would consider problems in analysis. In analysis. And one of them has already been mentioned, so it has direct relations to this workshop. Namely, so maybe I should say what these two problems are. And then I will spend the rest of the time split halfway between the two problems. So the the first problem is the problem of estimating the volume of a tube around a given real algebraic Around a given real algebraic variety. And this has come up several times last week. This week. So here's the picture almost and the picture that we saw last talk last afternoon. So this is my real algebraic variety. And remember, a real algebraic set can be defined by an arbitrary number of polynomials equations, but I have always replaced it by Have always replaced it by taking a sum of squares and just by one equation. Even though Frank would say that this is a very bad thing to do, but then if someone gives me this equation, then that's all going to happen, right? Anyway, so that's real algebraic set in Rn. And then, so suppose I'm given some point and I consider a ball. Ball of some radius here. That's a ball of radius sigma around this point. And the problem is to estimate. So suppose I also take media cube, an epsilon cube. Epsilon tube. I don't know what it looks like. And I would like, so this is all points at distance epsilon from given by ID. So let's call this epsilon cube here the epsilon neighborhood. And I would like to estimate A volume of inside the ball this epsilon neighborhood intersected with my ball interesting upper bar. Interesting upper bound on this number. Maybe since it's a workshop in random algebraic geometry, if we take a probability distribution on the ball choosing a point x randomly, point x randomly, uniformly in the ball. And this is the probability of The probability of this point being within epsilon of my given variety. So the kind of bond I will discuss is, so the important thing here is that suppose I assume that the real dimension of this variety is at Of this variety is at most n. We are in Rn. So the kind of bound that we will be looking for is something, some constant that will depend on the n, the degrees of the polynomial that defines the variety, sigma, but the dependence on epsilon should be the codimension. In fact, we found that I will talk about these four. One just make sure for sufficient this for sufficient is small as well. I will say it. I will say how it's official description. Remember that we are not as good as anything about the variety other than the fact that its dimension, real dimension is most n and that it's defined by polynomials of degree among delta. That's the first problem. And I'll discuss the history and so on. So yes. Notions like degree will be like degree will be for how constant yeah delta takes on the degree of the polynomial given by the zeros of some and the degrees the polynomials f bounded by verticals. It's cut out by volume also. So that's the problem one. You can see that's kind of thing that has a nice opportunity for interplay between algebra. You definitely expect all to be n minus n. That's actually the degree of writing. Well, but this I'm not assuming that this line is complete intersection or anything like that. Any number of polynomials, and we cannot say that this delta is a degree of. That this delta is the degree of the right. It's an upper bound for the degree of the compacts rightly. I understand the constant in the deep O, it doesn't depend on the equations. Yeah, no, this constant here is something like 4 or 4 times E or something. It's just some constant. And not E. Any second problem, which optimistically I'll get to? Where real algebraic techniques it's even simpler to state than the first problem. So we want to consider oscillatory integrals, which are something that's very deeply studied in the field of harmonic analysis. And they're humongous literature, so there's a book of Ilya Stein and like the last few chapters. The last few chapters on bounding oscillator integrals. So, the one that we are considering in this talk, by the way, I should list my co-authors. So, this work is with Merario and that's with rather unfamiliar names, Shanning Guo, uh Wu Jiang Zhang. We Jiang Zhang and Abel Zorin Kanich. They are all harmonic actors. And so we are so suppose we have continuous semi-algebraic functions function. Function of complexity, and I'll put this complexity in quotes. So a function is semi-algebraic, if its graph is a semi-algebraic set. And by the complexity of a semi-algebraic set, I would mean the take the form. Take the formula defining the semi-algebraic set, and maybe take the number of polynomials appearing in the formula and the maximum degree and multiply them. I take the smallest such number. So, I'm not going to define precisely the complexity, but sine measures the sine of a multiplier reform that defined in the same kind of right side. And we are interested in an oscillatory integral of Oscillatory integral of the form integral over V2 Of course this modulus of this is one, so this is at most one, but One, but because of cancellations, because it's depending on the semi-algebraic functions, this can be very small. So we would like to have a bound that depends on some constant that depends only on d and k. So I'll write that kind of thing as this. So when I write this, that means there's some. So, when I write this, that means there's some constant inequality that depends only on d and k, independent of q. But it has to depend on, it cannot be an uniform bound like that one. It has to depend something on q. And our result is that many results of this kind, but this proves useful, and in a way, I will explain. In a way, I will explain later in the talk, but it depends on this quantity. When we take the soup over all real mu of this thing, so it's the measure, usual Lebesgue measure, of the set of all points in the cube. Such that the function, the semi-algebraic function, is between m plus 1 and m minus 1. So maybe I should draw a picture here. So this is my cube. I have my sympathy right. Sometimes you write functions, so maybe this is the level set where equal to mu. And we have a might be two, but it's not two on the other picture. So this is where And we take the supremum of these as new values. That gives you an upper bound on that integral. And well, that looks like a strange upper bound, but in fact, it leads to a very accurate result on something called the, which I'll explain later, the convergent text. That's one of the carriers problem. Here I'll explain this, which is a well-studied problem in harmonic analysis. And we get a precise result in dimension 3. And the proof, so I will not be able to explain how this leads to that, but the proof of this uses of this uses real algebraic values killing of it. So what it does use is result from all minimal geometry, which is an extension of semi-algebraic geometry. Statements. Maybe I. So how critical is just one here? Is that? No, that's not critical. Okay. We can choose with T. So we have we have taken 2Ï€ because it's here. Sometimes it's the same. Yeah, that's what I'll talk, but in harmonic analysis they split on this. Sometimes it's one. Okay, so those are the two problems I'll talk about, but let me come back to something about this one. About this one. I want to give you something, a picture maybe. And then I'll make a more precise statement. I'm going to request some history. I'll keep this here. So this problem has quite a bit of history. So, in the case when m equals n minus 1, so that means the dimension of the variety is only assumed to be less than n minus 1. So, this you can think of as a hypersurface case. And in this case, this result was already known, and it was proved by clear In this case, if you have Samuel Ralph, Peter, Philippe Cooker, and Martin Lott, so they wrote a paper which said the title, The Probability That a Slightly Porturb Numerical Analysis Problem is Difficult. And this appeared in Mathematics of Computation. And then, in Peter and Felipe's book, the extension of this problem, well, I'm cheating here a little bit because the actual problem in the book has relates to something called the ONIC condition number, which is a little bit different in the sense from the one that I wrote down here, because variety is stated on a sphere. Variety is taken on a sphere, and the distance is some kind of conic distance, but these are very much related. And this appears as problem number 17 in Peter's book for condition and then Martin Lodge That was in the proceedings of the AMS in 2015, considered the problem where the variety was assumed to be a non-singular complete intersection. So you are given. And the reason why such an assumption is important is because all these upper bounds on the volumes of tubes ultimately rely on techniques that goes via wild tube formulas, which calculate the volumes of tubes around many. Around Bondian manifolds because of some curvature invariants. But if your variety happens, so this is using and which we also do. And it is uh easier to use this uh techniques. Techniques from integral geometry, if you know your variety is non-singular. But if your variety is singular, then these variants can blow up at the singularities, and then it's not clear how to deal with the two kind of singular points. So the main obstruction to extending the non-singular case to singular case would be how. Case to singular case, we have to deal with these singularities of the variety when you are not assuming anything about the given variety other than is defined by a polynomial of degree at most delta and you are told that the real dimension is at most f. So, what did then, so this result here did not have any restriction on variety being non-singular. So, what did they do? Well, if your variety is a hypersonical Well, if your variety is a hypersurface, and so real algebra geometry has this feature that you can sometimes deal, if you are interested, for example, in the topology of a variety, that you can pass from the singular to the non-singular case kind of cheaply. So, for example, so if you have a compact variety which is singular, right? Which is singular. But then you can, and suppose you want to study its topology, so you can replace this value by a tubular neighborhood. It's a different kind of tubular neighborhood than one that I in the result, because this is not the epsilon to you, but you can replace by writing. By recording it like that. And then for a small positive epsilon, all small positive epsilon, you will get something which is homotopy equivalent to your given variety, but moreover has the feature that is boundary of this tube is given by some non-singular algebraic set. So you pass from singular to non-singular. Singular to non-singular, so if you want to bound the value numbers of the singular variety, it reduces the bounding value numbers of the non-singular variety. And this tubular label trick works very well when if you assume your given variety is already a hypersurface, because then the tube itself would have boundary which is a hypersurface. But if you have something of higher co-dimension, You have something of higher co-dimension and you're trying to replace it by a Q, then you will replace it by something which is already a hypersurface, and that will destroy the dependence of your bound on the code reventure. So that's the main obstacle that one needs to one needs to overcome. And maybe I take a detour at this point. At this point, that this is not the only time that you need to overcome this obstacle. There are other problems in quantitative functions in real algebraic geometry where this appears, including some problems that are open. So one of the classical results in real algebraic geometry is bounds on Benny number. Bound on bary numbers of real algebraic sets, and these callbacks will work on Olenik and Petrovsky and also Tom, sometimes attributed to Tom and Milner. And in our language, let's suppose you have a real algebraic set that's defined by a polynomial or some. Polynomial or some family of polynomials in Rn and the degrees of these polynomials bounded by T then the sum of the Bay numbers well let's say with Z2 coefficients and I'm not going to mention this. And I'm not going to mention this is bounded by, and now I'm going to use the notation theorem of my harmonic analysis quota, so any constants that just depends on n. But the dependence on degree is d s to n. And so the idea of proving this is very similar to the picture that I drew here. The picture that I drew you here. So you first consider by just take the sum of squares. So let f be the sum of squares of the polynomials in F. And then take maybe articular neighborhood. Then you get hypersurfaces, and you can found the bedding numbers of this. And you can find the Betty numbers of these hypersurfaces by using Mohr's theory. So you count critical points, projections to some nice direction, and then use Bezou bound to bound the number of critical points and you get G R S to N. No, G R S to N. Yeah. Because if you want To take critical points, let's say in the X1 direction, what we will do is we will set. I agree. Sorry. I agree. This is just. And the degrees here, according to what I wrote, are like that. But now suppose we are in a situation that it's a little bit That is a little different, and which came up really because of applications of these bounds. In fact, only on the boundary number of connected components, that is zero and very number. In problems, in incidence combinatorics, so I don't know if I'm not going to talk about these incidence problems, except that there's this, it starts by the first here. It starts by the first theorem is something called the Zemmar Ready-Trotter theorem, which puts an upper bound, Zemmar-Ready-Trotter, on the number of possible incidences. If you are given n distinct points in the plane, real plane or a projected plane, and n distinct lines, and you are asked how many and you count every time up. And you count every time a point belongs to a line, count it as an incidence, then you can ask how many incidences can you get. Well, theoretically, you have n points and n lines. Maybe all the points can belong to all the lines and might get n squared. But if you think about it, that cannot really happen. And this famous theorem says that the number of incidences is at most n raised. n raised to 4 over 3. 4 over 3 is a but sad then there are vast generalizations of these Ardosh type results and there was a technique that was invented by Larry Good and Katz. We are harmonic analysts and they go by the name polynomial partitioning for proving results like this. And initial paper you Initial paper, if you look at this paper of Zemari and Trotter, it's very complicated, but using this notion of polynomial partitioning that imported techniques from real algebraic geometry to such incidence questions, for example, this I'm already throttled theorem becomes maybe half a page, just some kind of a machinery that allows you to prove such things. But this polynomial partitioning Polynomial partitioning leads to, if you want to use it in a way inductively, in a way that I'm not explaining, but it leads to problems of the following kind, where you want to prove something that's a bit more refined than this all-electric rusty bar. And how is that more refined? So, consider this more refined problem. Suppose I give you a variety, you have an algebraic set. Algebraic set. And suppose I tell you that this is defined by. So now I will drop pretensions and you know every time I have a finite family of polynomials, I can take a sum of squares. I can always assume that it's given a zero set of one polynomial. And I'm told that the dimension, the real dimension of V is M. V is n and the degree of this polynomial is delta as the four. And now suppose I degree another polynomial, q of degree, let's say big b, bigger than equal to delta. And I want to bound the, let's say, the sum of the many numbers of mod of v. Or not of V, but V intersected with the zero of this other polynomial. So now you have two polynomials, one of small degree and one of a big degree. And now if you think about it, if Frank would approach this question, what would he do? He will say that. People say that, well, you know, let's suppose that these are complete intersection of defined polynomials of degree Gelsa. But they are n minus n of these polynomials. And then we have one more polynomial. And so if you look in the corresponding variety, let's say in complex projective space, and then it's a complete intersection of. Then it's a complete intersection of n minus n polynomials of BB delta, and another polynomial of B bigger than delta. And then these band numbers, there's a formula for the bed numbers in the complex projective variety, which we can compute using some, let's say, characteristic class computation. And I'm not going to write down this formula, but using my notation about something that depends on n, you will say that. You will say that at least the complex project, if this was complex projected, not singular intersection, this would be of the form delta raised to n minus n times d raised to n. So that would be the complex bound. And we know by Smith inequalities that if you have a complex variety and you have a bound on the Z2 Betty numbers, then there's an upper bound also on the sum of the Betty numbers. Some of the very numbers of the real variety. If V is the zero set of one polynomial or several. Yeah, or the reals, it doesn't matter. Many, many, but then you add additionally with the zero set of U. P is of dimension n and then it's cut. So that's the depends on the parameters 3 of q versus how the welcome of p versus 0. By the way, this is an open question. I don't know the answer to this. That's what you would expect. Didn't you say that this folded by instance inequality? If you have a small, similar, complete intersection. Yes. Non-small intersection. Complete intersection. Then it holds. But suppose all you are told, like in our tube example, that prevention n. Yeah, with this sort of the data, then that's an interesting open question. But if you can have this upper bound for the complex zero set, then by Smith, it would follow for the Yeah, that's good. But how are you going to prove for the complex case? In fact, I don't have time to talk about it, but the problem of bounding betting numbers of complex similar varieties is even worse. Sorry, Shannon. You probably saw it earlier. Is Q a um real polynomial? No, not generic polynomial. Nothing is generated here. And nothing is generated here because maybe the application in polynomial partitioning is as follows. And by the way, since it's a random algebra geometry, then, of course, a random polynomial, you can assume all sorts of good processes. All sorts of good problems. Yeah, that's not generic. It's just given by one polynomial. And you don't know. So the section might be singular. Might be singular. The diversity system might be singular. And so, first of all, there are varieties that we have already seen which are not which are singular, like discriminant varieties. But moreover, in the polynomial partitioning method, Method. So, what does it do? So, you are given a set, a finite set of points and some parameter R, and it produces a polynomial such that if you look at the connected components of the complement of the hypersurface defined by this polynomial, that somehow partitions this given set of points equally, evenly. Of course, there are parameters involved here. So, if you're given a parameter r, you can find a polynomial of degree r raised to 1 over. Polynomial of degree r raised to 1 over n that does this. But this polynomial is coming from some application of Bolshevik-Coulomb theorem, and you have no control over it. You cannot perturb it a little bit. So you don't know anything about this polynomial. So this polynomial, most of the time it will be very simple. So you cannot assume anything about these. Yet you need a bound like this for the machinery to work to polynomial partition. Polynomial partition minions and so on. So, what we do know is that if I only insist on the zero L Perry number, so only on the number of connected components, so then this is a theorem. If I improve something stronger but much more refined than just two polynomials, you could ask if there are several polynomials of increasing degree and some dimensions, can you improve upon many numbers? But for the zero devicing number, we can, and this is true. And this is true in exactly with the assumptions that I wrote down that this is some constant which depends on n. You two Peron and myself and so. Why am I telling you this? Well, the main technique in proving this bound over there is the following proposition, which I'll write in the language of the tube that with these assumptions, in fact for us, this for the application in the tube, this part, the part below this line is irrelevant. The part below this line is irrelevant. So back to the case when you have one polynomial defining a real algebraic set of line. So there exists a family of dt, one parameter family of non-singular complete intersections. Defined by polynomials of degree cutout at most twice the degree of the polynomial that we started with. Such that for any wall, you could take, so I'm going to write it in for the individual. For the heading of the tube. So if you take the Holosho limit of this Vt intercepted with my ball, that will give me, that's equal to V maybe that was like V here. That's too long. Very good. And that's enough for the two case as well as in the topological case. In the topological case, that's enough to prove an upper bound on the zero at any number. But this limit does not control enough the topology of these non-singular complete intersection. And so we are unable to extend this to the higher value numbers. So in this case, what you will do is look at this Vt, look at its complex band numbers. Look at the complex value numbers, the sum of the complex value numbers will then be bounded in the way that you get a bound on the zero value number. Okay, so this and that allows us to pass from the given singular to this non-singular, and then we can use same similar techniques as was done in other ways. Some other ways. That's as much as I wanted to say about the queue. If there are no questions, I'll take the remaining maybe 12 minutes to talk about the oscillatory integrals because that also injects a new ingredient. But before I say much about the true ingredients, I should say something about what is this carries from. What is this Carrie's problem, which is one of the main applications of this result for the convergence of the Carrie's problem? So I learned from my harmonic analysis, this waters, that so if you have this map Which we will call here the Veranasi embedding of the cube into the monomials of, so this map which will take a point, so this will be some big part and decay. And if you take this to the top of Which is the tuple of all alphas. So the image of this map, they call it just a fun. You can call it whatever you want. So they call this the parcel Vinogrand of manifolds. If you see this Parcel denograph, that means image of the Q. And they are interested in something called the Fourier extension operator. So suppose you have some subset, W, maybe some kind of my subset here, and then corresponding to this and D and K, you have this Fourier. You have this Fourier extension operator that takes a function that lives on W and produces a function that lives on this Rn by taking the Fourier operator, right? So it's integral over D, f of Z, and the exponential of I times the dot product of X. X with A that produces a function f, so it calls state function f. And in fact, the function that is important in this problem is just the identity on On the in the cube, so W can be taken to be this one. So you want to look at the extension operator corresponding when W is whole cube, function one. And the number, let's say, is the increment over all p. Over all p such that the L P norm of this function is finite. The L P norm in R L So Yeah, it shows the W Here the W as on the left hand side, but where where does it go? So what's it's an open subset or no? So it's some subset which allows you to integrate. So maybe you can take the surface. It doesn't matter here because it takes a whole lot of stuff. And yeah, so to obtain this I wrote on the history, it's pretty long, so it goes back to papers of Luke Ngua from 52 and 58, who posed this problem of obtaining the value of this W. And he proved that P1K, when in the one-dimensional situation, this is a post Some number, which would not be meaningful for you. And then there's a long sequence of work by Archipop, Chubarikop, Karatsuba. They have a big book on harmonic analysis. And as a consequence, one has these inequalities. That is, are quite tightly bounded from up, from above, and from below. And bigger than and in the case where k is two, so we are looking in the reality by degree at most two polynomials, Mochenhaupt, who was in fact my colleague in John Gotette for a while. Uh I did know that he uh obtained an exact for P D two so we know this that is two d plus one for every d so we know this for k equals two for every d, every dimension, and what our oscillatory integral bound proves is the complement. Are bound to since the complementary result of this. So we are able to show that so this is on the archive and what uh implies is that uh for Is that for if you fix d to be two and for then every k you have an exact expression for the convergent vex form So that is the mean inverse defined on the oscillatory integrals by the way so we call this the So we call this the bounding auxiliary integrals to the standard method in applied analysis is something called the stationary phase method. So if you think about it, it's clear that the part of the domain of integration that contributes most would be where the Would be where this exponent function has vanishing derivative, right? That's where it stays, this function stays the calculation for a long time. And so we call our method, which has to do with these strips and the volumes of these strips, as a stationary set estimate. So we're thinking of these strips as sets, and we are looking for that strip which has the maximum volume. Of that script which has the maximum volume. So the paper has stationary set in a side vault compared to this. So let me remind you what the stationary set estimate was, which is that we take the we have this we have this continuous semi-algebraic function. So we are looking at the possibility of integral. possibility integral and we are saying that up to some constant that only depends on d complexity of this function q this is bounded by the soup over all real numbers of the measure of the script which is all the elements in the cube such that the measure Such that the measure such that Q of zeta is between mu plus a constant and mu minus a constant. So maybe I have just maybe two minutes. I will just sketch where real algorithm is geometry enter. So we take some delta zero, which has to do with maybe this one. Do it, maybe it is one, but let's take something between something safe, maybe between a half, maybe. And I'll replace this integral by multiply it by some factor. So we choose this constant in such a way that this integral is not zero, it depends only on delta zero. Delta zero and some number which is not zero. And we take this product. So bounding the model of this is the same as bounding the model of this product. And then, okay, since I'm running out of time, there is some calculus, integral calculus. Integral calculus step that I am going to omit, and which is an exercise. That these are all equalities, so it's okay, they're an integral calculus set, there's no, that this product integral is equal to a one-dimensional integral, which is this one. And where this m of beta is the measure of this triple of delta 0 minus delta 0. And the main trick here is that I'll just take 10 seconds, but integration by parts, and this is My pass, and this is also an integral calibration exercise. It boils down to bonding I'm not going to be able to say the punchline. The punchline is this A of beta, which has to do with volume, is not a semi-algebraic function. It's because we are integrating. Because we are integrating. But it turns out that it is still nice enough, meaning that it's a definable function in a certain o-minimal extension of the structure of semi-algebraic sets. And what that buys you is that there is a finite partition of r into finite number of intervals which depends only on d and k on which this function is monotonous. So we can break this integral into sum of some finite number of integrals over intervals. Number depends only on d and k in which this function is monotone in each interval. And once you know this function is monotone on one interval, then you can do integration by parts to prove that, at since this modulus or this function is one, at most, that this over one interval, the modulus. Over one interval, the modulus is bounded by the soup of this n. So this no, so that gives me the soup, this quantity here, and the constant here has to do with the number of intervals in which I can say this function m of beta is more common. That's why I take these non-trivial results in ominous geography. Thank you.
