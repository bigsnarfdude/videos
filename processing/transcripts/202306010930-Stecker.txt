So, the next talk will be the understicker telling us about hello signing reducible G2 structures and solutions. G2 structures and solutions to the heterotic G2 system. Okay, thank you for the introduction, and as always, thank you for the organizers for having me at this wonderful conference and giving me the opportunity to present my work. So the project I'm going to present is on the Hetero FDG2 system. It's a joint work with Mattier Baliano. And sadly, we tried, but we didn't manage to put a preprint on archive before, but yeah. Before, but yeah, hopefully soon. So I'm kind of lucky because, well, Marco presented the heterogeneity G2 system, so the first part will be basically a recap with slight differences to the system he presented. So the heterogeneity G2 system is a system that involves a G2 structure, of course. Two structure, of course, with induced metric and orientation, as well as two connections. So, this is kind of the well, not the main difference because, as Marco alluded, this kind of so the name is Mario. Thank you. Sorry, sorry, sorry. You also like the name Marco? Just no, sorry. So, the Marco alluded to is. The Mario alluded to is there it can also be written there was one connection, but we'll have kind of the typically typical system that is we have two connections. One of those, theta, is going to be a connection on the tangent bundle. The other one, A, is going to be on an arbitrary vector bundle. Then, well, we have our G2 form, and we want it to be. G2 form and we want it to be well in this class tau zero plus tau one tau three in terms of the intrinsic torsion or in other in other notions one that the co-closed condition is well satisfied up to a one form and well not equivalently but look we want it to be that it is co-close up to the Co-close up to an exact one-form. And in fact, we're going to deal only with those which are co-closed, so I shouldn't have told you about this. We just want it to be co-closed. Well, the other structures we have are curvatures, FA and R theta, so one for the arbitrary connection, one for the tangent bundle connection. And with these two, we can define the first two equations, which are just the instant. Equations, which are just the instanton equations we've seen multiple times over the week. So everything as we had it before. And then just to be clear, the solutions you're going to find in so on, they are closed, but this is not the definition of the heteroctric G2 system, right? It's but with constant dilaton. Yeah, specifically generates that side. I should have mentioned it. So um Mention it. So that's kind of the trick when I change. We're looking for something happening on the slide. No, I'm sorry. I should have mentioned, yes. This penal case is considered this case of constant dilaton, so specifically when this phi here is constant. So that's considered a dilatone. So this is the constant dilatone case. Are state a data metric preserving? Sorry? Is data metric preserving? Is data a metric connection? Yes. I mean, in our case, it will be. I don't think in general it has to be. But yeah, it will be in our case. Exactly. Then we have the heterogenic Yankee identity, and that's kind of the key component of this heterogeneous GTS system. So, where we have these. So, where we have these squares of the curvatures FA and R theta. And well, one, so I put them with the trace metric, and then we want them as a four-form, so we have to undersymmetrizo over, yeah, the square. And what's TC, just some three-form? Specifically, I'm coming to that. So that's kind of the last part that's not on the slide, because that's the most important. Slide because that's the most important part, at least what I'm considered. So, yes, the alpha prime is just a parameter that's called the string parameter. Physicists, this is important to physicists. In particular, they want solutions for small alpha prime. Small positive, yes. Your alpha prime is free to be. Yes, it's free at this point. I will later come to kind of how it relates. I will later come to kind of how it relates to research. So, yes, as you mentioned, the important part is what is this TC? That's the only part I didn't mention. And that's, so I think Mario called it H, so just to compare in your notes, but I'm going to call it T C, and this is one. So if we have a G2 Have a G2 structure that is not torsion-free. Well, then the Liby GV connection certainly does not preserve the G2 structure that's literally conditioned to be torsion-free. So, well, we probably should consider also other metrics except the Levi-Q-Vita connections. And in fact, this will be the only time in my talk that I write a Levi-Q-Vita connection of our seven-dimensional space. Okay, so what kind of connections, metric connections with torsion could we consider? And those that are particularly well-behaved, that are good to work with, are connections with skewed torsion. So if we construct a torsion with the metric and then we have a three-zero tensor, and if this is in fact fully anti-symmetric, that's what we call. The anti-symmetric, that's what we call the FQ torsion. Now, in the G2 case, the question: when does such a connection exist? was thought by Friedrich and Ivanov. And it in fact admits a unique such connection if and only if, well, it's co-close up to a one-form. So exactly the condition that we had in the heteroatic G2 system. If you relax if you change the condition of the torsion, I mean, there could be other cases where you have existence, but not uniqueness. No. In all the cases where we have existence, it will be unique, and this is the only case where it exists. Okay, so, and this is, I mean, this is a technique of general G structures. So, if such a connection exists, we call it characteristic connection. So, this is the characteristic. A characteristic connection. So, this is the characteristic connection of a G2 structure. And for this characteristic, the C comes into play, and that's exactly the C we have in the heteroptic G2 system. In the case of co-class G2 structures, there is a relatively simple formula on how to compute the characteristic torsion, and I've written it down here. Okay, so let's consider. Let's consider previous solutions. I think Mario also did that. So, this is also basically a recap. And the first solution, at least to my knowledge, is by Fernandez, Ivanov, Ugate, and Villa Kampa. And they had essentially two types of solutions. One just being the product of a six-fold with circle as just a product and trying to lift solutions. And trying to lift solutions to the six-dimensional Carlstr√∂minger system to the seven-dimensional case. And the other type of solution is on the seven-dimensional Heisenberg group. I should mention both solutions are purely co-colos detail structures. As Mario alluded to, this was kind of the classical condition, but nowadays also solutions would Solutions with T0 and non-zero are considered, and specifically, those are the ones we'd be interested in. So, yeah. The next solutions were by Tark, Mario, and Tibler. And well, they find solutions on Taurus T3 bundles over K3 surfaces. And again, these solutions are co-close G. Co-close G are purely co-closed, so they have tau zero zero. Next solutions by Jason and Anik. So these are the first ones with tau zero non-zero, but they are approximate solutions on, well, up to the argument we had on Monday, but for now I'm Friendly exchange. Sorry. Anyway, they found solutions on Contact Calabiao. And finally, and that's kind of where the project I am having with Matteo Gardean started is his paper with Xenia de la Osa. And they looked into solutions on squashed homogeneous trees. On squashed homogeneous three-Sasaki manifolds, and we've already seen how they relate to three-alpha delta Sasaki. And then coming to that, here tau0 is non-zero, and well, they sadly found a mistake in their computation, so the only exact solutions are for various, for specific values of alpha prime, not for arbitrary values. Are they positive alpha primes? Yes, they are for positive alpha primes. Can you choose an arbitrarily small? No, they can't. Their solutions can be chosen arbitrarily small. See, nowhere yet, sir. No. In their solutions, they just have fixed values for alpha prime. Yes, where they have exact solutions, yes. Okay, so one common theme you could see when you look at all these solutions is the following. Solutions is the following. So they kind of all are reducible. So some are more obvious, like products or here's just consider T3 bundle. But then we also know that contact Calabiu is an S1 bundle over Kalabi Al and Squash from the GSP Sasaki is a SU2 bundle or SO3 bundle over quadranionic hellis. Over quaternionic hellises. So, kind of, there's a common theme in all these solutions: that is, they are reducible. So, the connections are do not come from the base of some vibration. Yeah, it's a bit difficult, but I mean, just this and but I mean this but this is kind of where we started, where we were motivated uh made it to to look into. Well, it's just a vague notion at this point. So, I'm considering what we try to do, and this does not hold for all of them, but what we then did was this. So, what we try to do is also finding something reducible, and in the sense of the following theorem. And this is a theorem I'm that has some history, so I worked in several papers on it. And the first version is like by Is like by Clayton, Marianne, and Zemelmann. And then later we made it easier or more applicable version with Julia and Elka. And then this version I'm going to present is by my most recent preprint from last year. So suppose we have a metric connection with skew torsion, but not only arbitrary skewtosion, but parallel skewtors. So we assume that the torsion of this connection Nabla is parallel with respect to. Nabla is parallel with respect to Nabla itself. So that's kind of the main hindrance or the main difficulty to find such connections. And then suppose that we have the polydomy representation of this connection being reducible. So it has to split into two summons. One of them we call horizontal and the other vertical for good reason, as you see in a moment. And then there's a third, which is A third, which is kind of a small condition, that a specific part of the torsion. So, if we split it up with respect to vertical and horizontal part, then we have this twice vertical, once horizontal part, and that has to vanish in the torsion to make this splitting applicable to the theorem. And if we have such a splitting of the tangent bundle, a reducible holonomy, then it turns out there exists a little. It turns out there exists a locally defined remaining submersion with totally geodesic leaves along the vertical distribution. And on the horizontal part, so the purely horizontal part of the torsion will be projectable, so we can push it down. And on the base, it will give rise to another connection with total symmetric torsion. Tortion and this new connection will have again parallels Q symmetric torsion. So we kind of push the entire geometry down. And then the final one, which is kind of the formula that gives us most of our results, or kind of that induces lots of structure, is that the connection on the base is then just the projection of the connection. The connection we had up top by this formula. So we just lift our vector fields x and y horizontally, take the covariant of a little bit, the derivative up top, and then push it back down. Sorry, can you? What is the what is eight? So these are just this. So, these are just the splitting. So, the only difference between these two comes into play was this part that is vanishing. So, no, it's not symmetric. So, the only part that is kind of the part that is not symmetric is this part of the torsion vanishing. So, if you have like the twice vertical, once horizontal part has to vanish of the torsion. In fact, if you have the symmetric thing. If you have the symmetric thing also vanishing, so the twice horizontal vertical part, then you can get back into a known setting where you have just the Diram type splitting theorem. And Nabla here is data from the form. Nabla is here is a connection. So it will be in the first place the characteristic connection of the G2 structure. G2 structure. So this is general for any Remenian manifold. This is for any Remenium manifold. This is not in dimension 7. This is just connection with parallel skewtors and reducible holonomy. Okay, so what kind of subgroups do we have of G2 that could be reducible? And well, I guess we're all aware of this nice footing. So what we're going to focus for the first part is. First part is the left-hand side, so we want the subgroup sp1, sp1, and g2. And the culprit here is the alpha-delta-Sasaki manifolds. Luckily, we also heard about these, so I don't have to introduce them in the first place, but just as a short recap, they are given by a metric Riemannian manifold Mg there was a Together with three triples of structures, which consist of a rig vector V œài of unit length, it's dual and on its orthogonal complement we have these phi i, which are almost Hermitian structures. And the final thing to be almost the contact metric manifold is. Contact metric manifold is we want them to satisfy compatibility conditions. In this case, they just mimic the quaternions and the quaternionic relations. Then we define, well, again, V and H, which turn out to be just the V and H we need later on, the span of the rate vector fields, and its orthogonal complement, the intersection of the curves. And finally, we define. And finally, we define, as usual in Keller geometry or similar, the fundamental forms by just taking the contracting the metric for almost embedded structure file arc. Okay, now to get from an almost three contact metric manifold into the case of three alpha delta Sasaki manifold, we take constants alpha and delta, alpha non-zero. Delta, alpha non-zero, delta arbitrary, and assume that the almost recontact matrix manifold satisfies the differential equation. So we take d eta i equals 2 alpha phi i, so that that gives you the standard Sasaki condition. And then we add a vertical interplay between the structures, so we add this term to alpha minus. Well, we add this term to alpha minus delta eta j of eta k. And as I said, kind of the first condition is the standard Sasaki condition. So if you just set alpha equals delta equals one, then you get back to the standard, to Sasaki case. Okay, so we want to have one of those. Let's consider how to get to more the alpha that has SAS architect structures and kind of the user bit. And kind of be a bit flexible in alpha and delta. So start with the metric. So the metric, well, we have the vertical space and the horizontal space, they are orthogonal, so we can kind of look at the metric restricted to those spaces, to the horizontal and vertical space, and now we can do scaling. So we do it individually. We scale the horizontal part of the metric, we scale the vertical part of the metric, and if we scale the vertical metric, metric and if we stay the vertical part of the metric we have to adapt the ring vector fields and contact forms to to to satisfy that they are still a unit length but if we do so um then well i can julia have shown when they introduced these tripha that has structures that this kind of deformation keeps us within the class of triopha that has structures but it changes alpha and delta. But it changes alpha at delta. Namely, it changes alpha by c divided by alpha. So kind of c is the c square is the multiple we put out the vertical space, and a is the horizontal scaling. And delta changes just by 1 over c. And well, if you notice these two formulas, then one thing is comes to have property, that is, if we multiply alpha and delta, Multiply alpha and delta, then the sine of that will be preserved under these kind of deformations. So, up to, and well, it turns out this is the only thing that is preserved, so up to atiometic deformations, we'll only have three cases. We can always fix alpha to be one, and then we have the cases delta is plus, minus one, or zero. And those we call positive, negative, or degenerate cases. Okay, so let. Okay, so let me give you a short overview over the cases. So, this is kind of our plane of alpha and delta. So, you cannot be on this line, but everywhere else you can be. And then we have the positive three alpha delta Sasaki manifold up here with this three Sasaki manifolds line, the line of kind of three alpha Sasaki manifolds. Then we have degenerate ones that are just on this line and negative ones down here. And then there are kind of And then there are kind of probably right to here. So we kind of have two directions where atriomotetic deformation can go. And there's kind of the radial direction, which just corresponds to global rescaling. And there's kind of hyperbolic movement. And that will be considered relative scaling between horizontal and vertical space. Horizontal and vertical space. Okay, so let's think about connections on this. And a fact that was proven by Jacqueline and Schuler in their paper on the average of cycling manifolds, basically the motivation how they came up with this, they have a good connection. So, in fact, they have a connection with parallel skewtosin, so that's just the type of connection we need, and this connection And this connection, well, it does not preserve all of the defining structure tensors, but it at least preserves the bundle of those. So similar to quaternionic Keller geometry, where the Levy-Thivita connection preserves the quaternionic bundle, so it preserves just the bundle of the almost complex structure here, and also preserves just the bundle of the almost complex. Of the almost ambition structures on where I define. Up to this constant beta, so there's kind of a constant beta in front, which is just given in terms of delta and alpha. And there's one special case, kind of beta equals zero, which would correspond to delta equals to alpha. Would correspond to data to alpha, where it in fact preserves all the structure tensors. In this case, the holonomy reduced further, but in general, we have the holonomy just reduced to spn sp1. And then, well, if we come to the seven-dimensional case later, this is specifically sp1 sp1. So, where indeed where I promised you we would be in this left-hand side of the picture before. Okay, so we've seen we have the kind. We seem we have a kind of a reducible hogonomy, so let's apply the submersion theorem I showed you before. And well, what does it tell us? Well, it gives us a locally defined domain in submersion along the rim orbit, so the space spanned by the rib vector field. And the base is, we can show it a quaternionic Keller space. So where the quaternionic Keller structure on the base is. And data structure on the base is just defined by, well, trying to project the fire eye downward, which is not entirely possible, as you expect for a quadrinary kind of manifold. But if we plug in this section, then it will work. And well, the bundle at least protects the output. Furthermore, we have a relation between, from the subversion theorem, a relation From the submersion theorem, a relation between this connection in the base and the total connection. So, what is the connection in the base? Well, I did not write you down the torsion tensor, but at least its purely horizontal part is vanishing. So, in fact, on the base, we here get the Levitica connection of the base, the Levichivita connection of the quadrature manifold on the base. And that is just the projection of the canonics connection on the total space. Canonic connection on our total space. Now, the quadronia and kettle manifolds are generally, well, behave differently depending on the sign of the scalar curvature. So this is kind of how to sort them, what to expect, where to find the the alpha deltas like the manifolds. We can compute the scalar curvature of the base, and we see that it's up to a positive multiple, just alpha times delta. Delta. So it specifically corresponds to the cases of positive, negative, and degenerate the alpha-data Sasaki manifold. So yeah, let me kind of give you some constructions where to get the alpha-data-Sasaki manifold. In the first case, and probably best-known case, is the positive case. That is, we start with a positive quaternion-Keller manifold. So that means we have the So that means we have this three-dimensional bundle spanned by almost finition structures. And this bundle, we take the frame bundle of this. So we take orthonormal frames of this. That's what's denoted the Kunichi bundle. And it's well known that you can get a 3-Sasakian structure on these. And if you atiomatetically deform them, you get positive 3-alpha-delta-Sasaki structures. Okay, so some examples. We've seen the Aldovaloch space with K and L equals both equals to one. That works. We have the standard seven sphere, S7, and then maybe some more complicated things. So this would be the Essenberg B quotient. And on some of them, we also get them. However, we don't get them from this construction because the quotient of this will be vector. Because the quotient of this will be like the quaternion kind of odd befold, not anymore a manifold. Okay, so let's look in the negative case. Well, it's pretty much the same. Now we start with a negative quote in the Keller manifold. We take its Kanishi bundle, still exist, and then we can show, well, it doesn't provide a 3-Sasakian structure anymore, but it provides a negative 3-alpha delta Sasakian structure. Some examples here. Some examples here. So SU1, 2 mod S1, that is essentially the dual to the Alofala space, in some sense. And then also some more complicated example here. So if you know negative quaternion Keller manifolds, they can get wild. And for example, we have Alexeyevsky spaces. And well, we can basically just construct negative 3 alpha data signifies on top. Negative 3 of a data is likely many fort on top, and this is kind of the first one of those that is not symmetric. And so the base is not symmetric. Okay, and now the kind of most interesting case is the degenerate case. So how do we construct something here? We start with a hyperkela manifold because we've shown before that we have to have locally hyperkela on the base. And now we have to assume a bit more in this case. A bit more in this case. We in fact have to assume that all the Keller forms are integer forms. So in this case, we get for each one of them, we get an S1 bundle on top of our hypercalum manifold. And now we just take the product bundle, so we get a T3 bundle over a hypercalum manifold. And this T3 bundle can then be equipped with a degenerate affordator for circumin. Generate the afforders of Sarciman. So, the only example I'm going to write here is the quaternionic Heisenberg group. So, we can create the alpha that is a psychic structure. And this is clearly non-compact. But yeah, well, I don't have good notations for these ones coming from here. One thing that is kind of interesting to me, and maybe something for the problem session, in general, these have. In general, these have to be at least semi-regular, the fibrous structure. These don't have to be. So, semi-regular, we could get some. There are some ideas how to get these. And for irregular ones, I don't know. And I'd be interested to find irregular examples of that. What do you mean by irregular structures? So we have this. Exactly. We have this vibration, and well, locally, it works. And well, it's locally it works, but if you kind of want to exactly it's like now free action in general, the red vector fields here, and we just, yeah, they could be non-closed in their orbits. By the way, these last ones are related to the ones that. Are they related to the ones that Mario and so I can allude to this because this is very interesting because we will eventually find solutions to the heteroxyggy two system on these spaces specifically. So in fact their examples I will find solutions on these spaces, but compared to their examples we take these can These Klaus classes to construct their S1 bundles. They specifically don't take the Kerler classes to construct their S1 bundles. So they're not related, specifically the structure we define, the G2 structure we define on these will have tau0 non-zero equal to zero. Okay, so let's come back to G2 structures anyway. So there on the other side is ACI manifold. On three other Sasaki manifolds independent of positive, negative details, we always get a cultural d2 structure by just setting, well, eta1 to 3 is just eta1 that eta2 which eta3, and then adding eta i that phi i, so kind of the standard construct when you get the two structures. And it's a very nice thing, so we have a co-closed structure, so we get a characteristic connection, but the characteristic connection in this case just agrees with the canonical. This case just agrees with the canonical connection defined on the upper data. So I can report. One special case, just to mention it, we've seen it before. If delta equals 5 alpha, then in fact, this is the second Einstein metric or the nearly parallel G2 structure on C-SOS-ICI manifolds. Okay, so let's come back to the heterotic G2 system. G2 system. Here's how to create kind of lots of connections, which we hope at this point that some of them might be instatons and some of them might solve the heterotic Yankee idea. So we start with the canonical connection, Nabla, and then we want to deform this connection. So we by setting kind of the torsion. By setting kind of the torsion. So we have the torsion of the canonical connection and add something that is not skew symmetric. So we expect that there is no, I mean, we know that the connection with skew torsion is unique if it preserves the structure. But these, if we add something that is kind of not skew-symmetric, then well, that is still possible. So we kind of add. So, we kind of add this family, and I explain to you why this is the right thing to add in a moment. So, it turns out that these are, in fact, G2 compatible, so they are G2 connections, and they satisfy a similar equation to the canonical connection in the sense that they preserve again the bundle of almost Hermitian structures phi i. Phi i, but now they do it up to this coefficient beta plus lambda. So we just had a lambda there. Sorry, quite confused. Why are you saying this is relatively simple? Because we kind of depends kind of on which part of verticals and the number of horizontals and you just move them around, you have some multiple of five. So yeah, no, but if you if you it depends on where you put it If you if you it depends on where you put the vertical and the horizontal ones. If the original T is not skew symmetric, original T is completely skew symmetric, it's just this part that is not. So the only thing where it's kind of if you if you plug in yes, exactly, if you plug in X vertical here, then it's zero. So that just destroys you the skew symmetry. So these connections are very nice, they satisfy this kind of They satisfy this kind of quaternionic type, Keller type relation, and they preserve again vertical and horizontal space, and all of them project, in fact, to the Levitim Vita on the base. Okay, so how did we come up with these connections? Well, there are two constructions we used, and they turn out to have the same, give us the same answer. So one of them is So one of them is, and now I should draw this again. So this is alpha and delta. And we kind of, if we have a three-alpha delta-Solaki structure here, we have these two directions. So one is the hypothetical director and one is kind of the radial direction. The radial direction is just scaling. So scaling shouldn't change the connection and it doesn't. But the other But the other type of atiometric deformation does change the direction, so we get kind of one parameter family here. And this agrees with our family, but we cannot do it like we cannot get the entire family, only we get lambdas that are greater than minus four of them. On the other hand, so there's a general construction principle to get good connections or G2 connections for. G2 connections for a G2 structure. And well, it gives us, in general, a two-parameter family. Since tau one is zero, we have a one-parameter family, and that will work. And it should work everywhere, except for the case delta equals five alpha. So in the near-power case, well, that would work. But these agree, except in this case where they don't exist, also with our family of connections. Connections. So let's compute the curvature. And it turns out the curvature has this very nice form. It splits up into two parts, R1 and R2. And so the R1 part is very nice because we get it completely explicit. We just have all the things, and I don't explain you how this matrix, what this is supposed to mean, but we have a completely explicit. Our two-part. The R2 part is nice because it, one, does not depend on lambda, so it is completely independent of that. And secondly, it essentially comes from the base. So whatever the base is, it's completely encoded in the R2 part, and the three alpha data society structures kind of all pushed into the R1 part. Okay, so how about the leave of How about the lever understanding uh how you are thinking of the curvature? Uh so I'm thinking of the curvature here as a curvature operator, so uh map from two forms to two forms. So kind of it maps like if this one maps up to some uh constant maps phi i to uh phi i. Curvature. Curvature and double curvature and dominance. Cover chain number space. Does that answer your question? Yeah, what is the matrix? Okay, okay, then I'll go into it. So kind of this part, so where this act splits up into two pieces, namely this has kind of two paths lines. can have two paths lambda twice vertical and lambda twice horizontal and phi i restricts to the purely horizontal and the purely vertical part and kind of this matrix are the coefficient matrix depending on whether we kind of want to map the horizontal part of this to the vertical part of this or horizontal to horizontal and and so so the second matrix should have zeros everywhere the second one really has like a matrix in front but with zeros everywhere and one With zeros everywhere, and one on the lower right. There is no matrix in the second. Yes, but in the second, yeah, because we I mean, the second part will just it should be a stream by stream matrix and the and this and the R2 is on the lower right part, right? Yes, yes, essentially that that's what's happening, yes. Okay, okay. Um, so yeah, the So, yeah, the R2 part just does not care. So, the purely vertical part does not act on. That's in the kernel of R2, so we don't care about it anyway. So, can you remind us what Gn is? Gn is the metric downstairs. So, this is the curvature, the remaining curvature of the Richmond connection on the quaternion Nuclear base, basically. Okay, so. Okay, so how about instantons? Well, we can just compute it. And it turns out we get this very, well, these elements are non-zero and up to constants lambda and beta plus lambda. So there are exact two instantiles in this family. That is, if lambda equals zero or if lambda equals minus beta, then we get instantiles. Now we could have guessed that these two are the special cases, because if we just go back here, one of the things that we have. Just go back here. Oh, one more. Here. One of those is the one that preserves all the structure tensors individually, and the other one is the one with skew torsion. So those are kind of the two special ones in this table. And indeed, we find that those two are instatons. So let me go to the heterotic Yauke identity. Go to the heterotic B okay identity. So, what about that? Well, if we plug in for A this connection nublum minus beta, so one of our instantons, and let the other one just vary, we find that this solves the heterogeneous Bianchi identity, where lambda is kind of the second one we have to choose, is 2 delta, and alpha prime is related to 1 over something related to delta and alpha. So in particular, we can, for any alpha prime, we can fix our solutions. Don't you need the lambda to be zero? Because you want to eat the plasma to be some. That is exactly the next part. So if we want an integer solution, these are just solutions here to be angry identities. We want the integer solutions, then indeed we want lambda to be zeros and therefore delta to be zero. That is the case of degenerate the alpha delta. So psychiatry. Of degeneral 3 alpha data Zachi manifolds. So, in fact, we find that for degenerate 3 alpha data Zachary manifold with their G2 structure, we find a solution to the hetero G2 system with these two connections and alpha prime being just 1 over 12 alpha square, where we can fix this one by rescaling. Exactly. So, let me just give you how these kind of identities. How these kinds of identities come to be. So, and this kind of alludes back to the question you had before. So, we kind of split up our space of two forms. So, we split up the space of two forms. And at first, we just get the vertical, the purely horizontal, and kind of the mixed part. And the mixed part just matters for the curvature because it preserving the horizontal and vertical space. Horizontal and vertical space, we see that, yeah, this will always be the kind of the curve. But this decomposition is not quite sufficient. We need to first decompose it. Now, we use the fact that we're in the horizontal part is four-dimensional, so we kind of get to split in the self-dual and anti-self-dual part. And then this is exactly how our splitting comes to be. So the R2 part of our curvature operator just acts on the Operator just acts on the anti-self-dual part, and the R1 part of our curvature operator acts on the vertical and self-dual part and mixes them up. And well, what we can show is that the anti-self-dual part does not even matter if we just batch this with psi and this is zero. So we can completely forget about the R2 part, and we just get an. And we just get an equation on this R1 part, and well, that gives you the statement I've told you before. So, in particular, this tells you why it does not depend on which base space we have at all. Okay, so how about the heteroid BIC identity? Basically the same trick. So, if we try to compute this square of the curvature operators, it does something, which is essentially the square of the R1 operator and the R2. And they are two-part. And those don't interfere because, well, they don't like each other, they are orthogonal to one another. So we very much have the splitting. And now, in a heterogeneous Bianca identity, we pin two of these connections against one another. Our two parts cancel each other. And we just have these parts in front. And well, they give us two algebraic equations. We just have to sort out. Sorry? How many free parameters do you have? I mean, in this entire system? I mean. So I mean, I have lambda to fix, I have alpha and delta, which I can play with. So if I have alpha prime, then there is just and I want an exact solution, there's just one value for all of them. Sorry, when when the lambda equals data. When lambda equals minus beta, they all vanish an interpretation. Yes. Exactly. This this part i is essentially just vanishes if lambda equals minus beta. So this is the sim connection. It's the same one. So yeah, we pin two of those connections against one another. One of them is the minus beta connection. So kind of that's how we get this simple formula by just saying, okay, one of the connections, all the front part vanishes and just gives us this R. Part vanishes and just gives us this R2 plus R2, R2 part, and the other connection has to then kind of give us the algebraic relations. Okay, so let me short dive into the other part, which is a bit more complicated, but we wanted to do it specifically to relate our results to JSON and Nick's results and see if we can do something here. Here. So now we consider we have a G2 structure and a Sasaki structure, and they are related by, well, we kind of have a part eta of H phi, and then we have kind of the rest, the purely horizontal part, that we compile to œÉ. And well, I should have said we assume we have a conclused G2 structure and then we get a characteristic connection, and the Sasaki structure always. And the Sasaki structure always gives us a connection as well. So we kind of have two connections and we can pin them against one another. So will that be the same? Well, no, sadly not. So we kind of have the torsion of the Sasaki connection on the right-hand side and we have the torsion on the left-hand side, which is something and then something related to sigma. So they are not the same, but sometimes they are. Oops. So when are they? So, when are they? And in fact, they agree if this connection, and in that case, both connections the same, have holonomy in D2 insecticules, U3. So I remind you of kind of the part we're looking at. Because Sasaki structures and the Sasaki connection lives in here, in the U3 part. The D2 connection of The G2 connection, of course, lives in G2. So, kind of they agree if they both live down here in SU3. And Thomas Friedrich investigated this case when that's in fact true. And this is true if we are in the Sasaki-Einstein, not Sasaki, Ita, the Ita-Einstein-Sasaki case. Thank you. With fixed coefficients, so the Ricci curvature is just 10 G minus 4 eta. Minus for eta tensor eto. So now we have this case. This is like with this setting, it's an if and only if. So let's figure out. So this Eta Einstein's activity is particularly interesting because also the contact colour BL lives in fact in this family. So kind of we were like, okay, let's focus on this family. Like, okay, let's focus on this family. And indeed, we find if we have Eta-Einstein, and now we also scale the Sasaki, so we have Eta-Einstein and Alpha-Sasaki manifolds, and they are, and there we again get a family of metric connections that preserve, in this case, only the Sasaki structure. So what we can do, we can kind of find a family here in one way by this purely representation theory construction, and we can find a family kind of over here by this construction. Over here by this construction. Now, the method of kind of going down and what we did in the Piraba Deta Sasaki case requires us to look at the Sasaki construction and look at connections here and not over here. So yes, this is... I would assume this is essentially why here we don't find exact solutions. But anyway, we at least find a family that is well preserved, so that preserves the solution. Deserved, so that preserves the society structure, in particular, deserves the splitting of the one red vector field in this case, and it's for six-dimensional horizontal. And we can again compute the curvature operator, and it turns out it has a very similar form. So we get something and then phi tens of phi. So this should be the analog of R1 plus an R2 part. A is just some parameter. A is in fact the parameter in the eta. In fact, the parameter in the eta-Einstein condition, the A parameter, so the horizontal Einstein. And as I just alluded to, these connections, however, do not preserve the G2 structure. Okay, so as in the pre-operative second case, we can just find that this R2 part does not contribute to the instanton condition. So, well, this will be an instanton if it only just first part ven. Instant on, if it only just first part vanishes. And that just comes down to this equation: 10 alpha squared minus 3 lambda alpha minus a equals 0. In particular, there's exactly one instant on in this family. Now, what about the heterotic Bianchi identity? Well, we cannot deal with any of the Zigmas. We project always to the Levi-Chibit connection in the base, so kind of the strategy. Connects in the base. So, kind of the strategy we go with does not work with any of these CPUs. So, we have to assume something to get rid of them. And there are kind of two conditions that seem natural. The one is this condition, where just those two terms in the toilet cancel. And that is exactly the case of Fiedrich that we investigated. And the other condition is: well, in the Heterochenk identity, it only appears as dt. appears as dt so if d sigma vanishes well then all the problematic terms also vanish and this is the contact LRBR case so in fact we find solutions to the Heterotic Bianchi identity was plugging in the special connection lambda knot and letting the other one vary for this SU3 holonomy case or the Friedrich case and the contact halabion case. And that's all I wanted to say.
