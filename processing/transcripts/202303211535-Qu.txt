Just starting this January. And this presentation is mainly from my PhD work at C Boulder with Dale Henry and my postdoc work at Harvard with Daniel Jacob. So I'll start with this cos function right away. So we have the prior term and observational term in the cos function. And in a simple two-dimensional case, the minimum of this cos function The minimum of this cost function corresponds to the minimum that lies between in between the minimum of these two terms, and it's a balance of the observations and our prior estimates. And to estimate the minimum of this cost function, we can either calculate the first-order derivative, setting that to be zero, which is solving it analytically, or we can use Fradient descent approach to search for the minimum iterative. Search for the minimum iterative. So, with this analogy from 2D space, we can easily extend that to a high-dimensional case, where we can also solve for the minimum of this cost function using an analytical solution. But that requires the model to be linear, and in that case, we can reduce this operator H to a Jacobian matrix K. A Jacobian matrix K, and we can solve for the state vector X using this equation. Strength of this analytical inversion is that we can rigorously characterize its posterior error covariance matrix S, and we can also calculate an averaging kernel A, which describes the sensitivity of this solution to the true state. Alternatively, we can also search for the minimum iterative. For the minimum iteratively using a gradient descent approach, which is 40 bar. It can be applied to species that have nonlinear chemistry, but the challenge is that it requires an add-on model to calculate the sensitivity. So of course, there are several other approaches that can be applied to solve for the minimum of this cost function. But in this presentation, I'll just focus on these two approaches. These two approaches. So, in the first section, I'll talk about our application of this analytical inversion to estimate methane budget. So, the atmospheric processes for methane is pretty straightforward. The sources of that come from both anthropogenic sources, which is from human-made, and also natural sources. So, major anthropogenic sources involves livestock, oil and gas exploration. Oil and gas exploration, coal mining, etc. And wetland is the largest natural source. The sink of methane is mainly through its oxidation by hydroxyradical OH through these reactions. And the differences between sources and sinks contribute to the changes of methane concentration. In our model and probably many other models, the OH concentration is from a pre-system. Concentration is from a prescribed field. In our case, that's from a full chemistry use simulation. And in that case, the sensitivity of methane concentration to its emission is linear, and we can apply this analytical solution to estimate methane budget. The budget of methane is particularly interesting. You might feel familiar with this picture, which you have seen several times during this workshop. During this workshop, we can see that methane concentration has been increasing, but we're not clear what is causing this. And of particular interest is this surge of methane concentration in 2020. It's a record high. And then in 2021, again, another record high increase of 16 ppb. And we are going to apply analytical inversion to evaluate the drivers of this recent trend. Of its recent trend. Our analytical inversion framework is based on Geoscam chemical transfer model, and we use GOSAT methane observations. Our prior estimates of emissions come from our state-of-art estimates. It represents our best understanding of emissions from the bottom-up inventory, which can be separated into non-vital emissions. It doesn't have a lot of seasonal variations. It doesn't have a lot of seasonal variations. And for wetland emissions, it has strong seasonal variations. Our state vector includes 40-20 non-whitland emission elements. So these are these grid cells at the model native resolution. We estimate that at the annual scale because it doesn't have a lot of seasonal variations. And we also optimize monthly wetland emissions. Monthly wetland emissions over these 14 subcontinental regions, which are showing these boxes. We also estimate two elements of hemispheric OH concentration. And so this Jacobian matrix K here describes the sensitivity of each gold set observation to the 4190 state vector elements that I described here. So, to investigate the trend, we perform Investigate the trend, we perform an analytical inversion for each individual year from 2010 to 2021, and that is the periods that go set observation are available. And here we perform a linear fit of methane emission from each year over this 2010 to 2021 period. So we can see that the largest increase is from Africa on the right-hand side. Africa. On the right-hand side, we are looking at emissions. We further break it down into contributions by anthropogenic sources showing red and contribution by white ones showing green. And the shaded areas here represent the spread of emissions from an ensemble of 10 inversion members, which have different assumptions of prior errors. And that is actually another strength of this analytical inversion, which is that. Analytical inversion, which is that after constructing the Jacobin matrix, we can easily adjust the error estimates and apply that to evaluate how sensitive our inversion results are in response to different error assumptions. In Africa, we can see this particularly large increase from both wetland and anthropogenic sources in 2020 and 2021, and that partly comes from. And that partly contributes to the surge of methane concentrations that we have seen previously. The second largest increase or largest growth rates is from South America, which has one teragram per year growth rate. And here we can see that this is mainly contributed by emission changes prior to 2020. So it doesn't have a lot of contribution. Have a lot of contribution to the methane budget increase in 2020 and 2021. Another place of interest is over Equatorial Asia, and we can see from here that it has particularly large increase in 2020 and 2021. Similarly, for India and Pakistan, we can see this large increase in the recent two years, and it's mainly due. Years and it's mainly due to increases of anthropogenic emissions. So, based on these posterior estimates, we can see that the increases of emissions in Africa, Africa, Asia, and India and Pakistan mainly contribute to the increases of methane emissions in 2020 and 2021. That partly explains the surge of methane concentration that we have observed. That we have observed. But then you might ask about what happened to OH concentration. So here we show our estimates of methane lifetime against oxidation by OH. The blue line is our prior estimates. Since we are using the same prescribed OH field for all of the years, we don't see a lot of variations. And the posterior is showing red. Posterior is showing red, and we can see it's basically within the uncertainty range from the prior estimates. And we have an average of 10.9-year methane lifetime based on our post-year estimates. Of particular interest is this very high lifetime in 2014, 2015, and we think that's mainly because of the increases of CO due to peatland fires in Indonesia in 2014. Highest in Indonesia in 2014. Another interesting year is 2020. What we see here is that OH concentration does not have a lot of response to the COVID-19 shutdown. It's actually within the natural variations during this period. So you may ask about, in that sense, how much does the changes in OH concentration and methane emissions each contribute? Methane emissions each contribute to this increase of methane concentration in 2020. To answer this question, we performed a mass balance analysis using our posterior estimates. So the methane growth rate, DM over DT, can be expressed as the differences between emission E, the chemical losses through reactions between OH and methane Km. And methane, Kn, and other minor losses, L. And the acceleration of methane growth rate, which is what happened in 2020 when we see this surge, is the secondary derivative of this first equation. And we can define the first two terms in this second equation as the forcing of methane away from its steady state. So, to think about this intuitively, this is. About this intuitively, this is basically the changes in emissions and the changes in the reaction rate between OH and methane as a result of the changes in OH concentration. Based on our inversion, we found the forcing is 36 tg per year, and 86% of that comes from the increases of methane emissions. So, here I'm showing the differences of methane. The differences of methane emissions between 2019 and 2020, you can see Africa pop out. So, actually, African wetland emissions drives 50% of this methane emission increase. And we also found independent evidence from inundation data that shows increased precipitation and inundation over Africa in 2020. In 2020. And to evaluate the uncertainty or the accuracy of these estimates, we also use our inversion ensemble, and we found the range and magnitude is consistent with our base inversion. As for the sink, we found the global MENOH concentration reduced by 1.2% in 2020 compared to 2019, and that accounts for 14% of this increase. 14% of this increase in methane forcing. So basically, this increases of methane emission is consistent with what Laurie presented yesterday of the increasing microbial activities. And the message here is that we might see the response or feedback of greenhouse gas emissions in response to climate change. So, that is one application of this analytical inversion for trend analysis. Another application of this analytical inversion is to evaluate or compare observations from different instruments. So, Laurie also showed something similar yesterday with this Chopo-Mi-Golsak algorithm. With Chopo-Mi-Maden observations, we have increasing numbers. Note here that the Note here that the color bar are in log scale, so these are huge differences in number of observations. So, intuitively, we would expect to have more accurate constraints on emissions and getting more information from topomy observations. And we can evaluate this using the averaging kernel from the analytical version. So, here I'm showing that averaging kernel and also the Averaging kernel and also the degree of freedom for signal or DOS. So, DOS here is the trace of the averaging kernel matrix. It represents the pieces of information that we can gain from observations. So, what we found is that at a global scale, we actually get fewer pieces of information or smaller dots in the trouble median version compared to the GOSAP one. And this is especially an An issue over South America. And the reason behind this is because when we perform inversion or data simulation, we usually do regularizations. And the regularization parameter we usually apply is the same value across everywhere. And so when we apply this regularization parameter to scale down the impact from observation terms, for instance, over Africa. For instance, over Africa, it actually degrades the information that we can gain from observations over regions that already have significantly fewer observations over regions like South America. And so consequently, when we estimate the methane emissions, here I'm showing the ratio between posterior and prior methane emissions, we can see like over regions like South America, the Chopomi inversion does not adjust emissions. Inversion does not adjust emissions as much compared to other regions or compared to Gaussian alterations. So, this is one application of using this analytical inversion to compare information that we can gain from different instruments. And another application of that is through the work by my colleague Xiao Lu. So, what he did is to apply this analytical inversion to evaluate the complementarity of inversion. The complementarity of information that we can gain from satellite observations, which have large spatial coverage, and in-situ measurements, which are more sensitive to methane missions at the surface. So he performed two individual inversions that use in-sided observation only and GOSAT observation only. He also did a joint inversion that includes both satellite observations and institutions observations in the system. In the system. So, what he found is that the sum of DOPs from the previous two independent inversions is pretty close to the DOPs of the joint inversion. So, what that suggests is that the information provided by these two data sets are complementary to each other. We do not get too much redundant information from these two different data sets. In another application, I'm going to talk about this analytical information. About this analytical inversion is by my colleague Daniel Van Ron, where he applied this analytical inversion to frictional scale. And this is on the Amazon AWS. And the reason we do this is that we are trying to provide those users who do not have the expertise of data assimilation or access to the computational power to easily estimate emissions using observations. So here, in So, here in this example, we are using this cloud-based analytical inversion system to estimate methane emissions over Permian Basin in the United States. This is a region that have a lot of oil and gas emissions. And in this system, we can both estimate the methan emissions and also the information content that we can get from the tropomy data. So, to summarize for this section, To summarize for this section, the analytical inversion can be used when the Ford model is linear, and this is feasible for species like methane, which has relatively straightforward processes in the atmosphere. It can easily quantify information content and generate an ensemble of inversions to quantify the uncertainties of our estimates. So, we apply this approach to estimate methane emissions over 2010 to 2020. Over 2010 to 2021, and we found the largest increase are from South America and Africa. Of particular interest over this period are the methane surge in 2020 and 2021, and we found this is mostly due to emission increase in Africa, South America, and Alcatraber H whereas the impact from OH is relatively small. Next, I'm gonna switch to Next, I'm going to switch topic to 40 bar estimates of atmospheric composition that have more nonlinear chemistries. So the strength of this 40 bar is that it can accurately estimate sources of atmospheric composition that have more complicated processes. So, in a previous study, we have applied it to estimate max emissions at the global scale. Maximums at the global scale. Here we are showing the differences between our estimates and the bottom-up inventory, and it can help us characterize the biases in these inventories. But the drawback, one drawback of this approach is its computational cost. Usually it would take about a few weeks to months to estimate emissions for just one month. So it would be intimidating to think about applying this 4D bar approach. Applying this 4D bar approach to emission estimates over a long period of time. So, in this example, what we did is to combine 4D bar with mass balance to estimate the trend of NOx emissions over a long period of time. And we evaluate the performance of this hybrid approach by using a simplified L C and our posterior estimates from the hybrid approach, showing red line, have very Showing red line have very similar magnitude and trend compared to the true emissions shown in black line. So this represents the good performance when we combine the accuracy from 40 bar with some approaches that are computationally efficient. We also evaluate whether including multiple species observations in the 4DR system can help us better resolve the emissions. The emissions. So, in this specific example, we include both NO2 and SO2 alterations in the system and optimize their emissions at the same time. And we have seen larger decrease of errors shown in blue bar in this joint inversion compared to inversions that we only include one species in the system. And this is mainly because we are able to address the chemical interactions between NO2 and SO2 through OH when we include both of their observations. Include both of their observations at the same time. So these are the previous applications. One limitation of this previous analysis is that it doesn't optimize the sectoral profile of emissions. So for those audience who are not familiar with the emission inventory, here I'm showing the sectoral profile of the true emissions on the left-hand side. True emissions on the left-hand side, and then estimates from bottom-up inventory on the right-hand side. And we can see that prior estimates from bottom-up inventory can underestimate power plants emissions and overestimate transportation emissions, but still have similar total emissions compared to the true emissions. And in aversion in atmospheric chemistry communities, usually what we optimize is the Usually, what we optimize is the total emissions. So, we're thinking about how we can address these issues or errors in the sectoral profile. And another limitation in the previous estimates is that we cannot identify whether the errors in the emission is from the species emission factor or the activity rates, which are two components that lead to the calculation. That leads to the calculation of total emission in the bottom-up system. So, to resolve this, we developed a sector-based inversion where we optimize the species emission factor and activities in the inversion system. Devin talked a little bit about this yesterday. We are able to separate different sources because each source has different Because each source has different emission profiles. So we're able to, so we can use the ratio of NO, SO2, and CO to help us separate emissions from different activities. Here are the mathematical formulations. So in the species-based inversion, we apply a scaling factor to adjust the total emissions. So here, K is the index for different sectors. Different sectors, and the total emission is the product of activity rates and emission factor from all of the sectors in the system. And in the existing 40-var approach, what we did is to estimate or optimize this scaling factor for the total emissions. And in this new sector-based inversion, what we are doing is to apply two scaling factors. They can implicitly They can implicitly optimize the activity rates A and the emission factor F. So the point here is that we don't even have to have these two components separated in the model, but by adjusting, by applying these two scaling factors and characterizing them in the cost function, we can implicitly adjust them and evaluate their magnitude and trend. So, in the host function here, we have two prior terms. The first one is the deviation of scaling factor for the activity rates in sector K, and we sum up over all of the sectors. And the second term is the adjustment or the deviation of scaling factor from the prior for emission factor for species L in sector M. And we have sum up over. And we have sum up over species and sectors. Devin talked about the evaluation of the posterior from this approach yesterday. We have seen better agreements with independent data. So here I'll focus on some applications. So here I'm showing the emission adjustments for industry sector, for NOx, SO2, and CO. We can see consistent upward adjustments. Upward adjustments over North China plan for all of these three species, and that is mostly due to the underestimates of activity rates in the bottom-up inventory for the industry sector. And for those locations that show differences between these different species, those are places that we adjust the species emission factor for these different species. And something I really like about this. And something I really like about this approach is that we are able to quantify emissions by sectors and how they change over the years in response to different regulation policies. As an example here, I'm showing the trend of long-term SO2 emissions in China. And we can see that their trend or variations are mainly driven by energy sector shown in red, and industry sector shown in blue. In blue, whereas for CO emissions, it's mainly driven by the residential sector and industry sector. If we apply this approach to another country, like in India, we can easily see that the emission profiles are different compared to China and also their trends are driven by different sectors. So, in the future, we're planning to apply this sector-based inversion approach. Based inversion approach to other species to better quantify emissions from different sources. So, to sum up for this second section, for 40 var, it's good to be applied to emission estimate for species that have nonlinear chemistry. It's computationally expensive that this computational cost could be reduced by compiling that with some other methods that are more. Some other methods that are more computationally cheap. And with the strength of this 4DR approach, we designed this new sector-based inversion framework and we applied that to estimate emissions over East Asia. We found better agreements with independent data sets and also provide a new perspective to evaluate the bottom-up emissions by sectors. So that's all I have for today. I have for today, and I have an advertisement since I just started in this position. We are hiring PhD students and postdocs. So, if you know anyone who is interested in this type of work, please spread the word. Really appreciate your support on this. Thank you very much for your attention. Questions for Dan? Because I didn't understand how you introduced the mass balance to 4D bar. Can you apply 40 var for one here? So you see this one magenta dot. So that is the 40 var posterior. It adjusts the spatial distribution. It adjusts the spatial distribution of emissions from the bottom-up inventory. And then, for other years, we use this 40-var posterior as the prior for mass balance to recover the trend. Just kind of like two steps, 40-var for spatial distribution and mass balance for trend analysis. That helps us reduce the computational cost for multi-year analysis. Bitten too small for me. Where did you get the information of the mass balance? What's the information source for the mass balance? Okay, it's also satellite observations. So, yeah, maybe your concern is that we are using the observation twice in the first year, but for other years we do not apply 40 bar. Very quick, short question. Your pie chart in the beginning, livestock does. Livestock. Does this also include wild organisms or is it only uh animal husbandry? Uh so your question is whether livestock includes wild livestock. Does this also include wild ruminants or is this only animal husbandry? I think it's only animal husbandry. I guess in Africa there are lots of news and so it's So are you suggesting that in Africa the increases might also due to a lot of stock? That's not only about the increase, but it's also about the basic sources of ruminants they are not insignificant. Yeah, I should double-check about what are exactly in the inventory. I think I've had to. I get back to you. But you do have that other category, right? On your wheel there. Oh, yes, right. I should double-tag what are exactly in each category. Other category? The red switch. Or the dark red. I have my doubts that together with the rest of the sources does not reflect the Reflect the amount of wild mammals. That's a good question. I'll double-check that. I thought that wild animals were actually a really small source, like something like five paragrams, not really that much. Of course, the estimate could be wrong, but that's what you get out of something like But that's what you get out of something like Edgar. Might be many continents, but maybe in Africa there's a substantial part of dominance. Also, here the deer also rules. Yeah. Right. It may not affect our total. It's not so important. So it's just from. I thought it's from my personal ignorance that, but I expected Oni B is not aware of this. Not any criticism on it. Thanks for the question. We are ahead of the past time, but let's. We were past time, but let's take one last question from Simon. Thank you for the presentation. Just a quick question. You mentioned the problem with Troconi degree of freedom. And so we know that we get much more data from Troconi rather than CONSAT, but the idea is much lower, it's lower. And is this a kind of a problem with the method? For example, you have one regularization factor for the group. And is it possible, for example, you have? Is it possible, for example, you have multiple regulars of router for different regions based on the density observations? Right. Yeah, that's a very good question. I've been thinking about that too. So I think one way that we can address this is to apply specially variable regularization parameter. If I scale the regularization parameter by a number of observations, that can help me improve the estimates over regions that do not. Regions that do not have as much observations as in other classes. Let's uh than Jania.
