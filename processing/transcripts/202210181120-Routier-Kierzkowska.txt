Okay, so thank you. Thank you very much for inviting me. So, actually, I prepared these slides yesterday because I realized that I wanted to show you something really fresh in my lab, and that I wanted to show you something with an open question. And so, yes, so I hope that there won't be too many mistakes. There won't be too many mistakes in what I say. So, okay, so today I'm going to present you some ideas of how we could model the hook growth, the apical hook growth in the hypercotyl. And so this project actually came from the fact that from a bit more than one year now, there's a postdoc in my lab with Christopher John. With Christopher Johnson. He got his own funding from Sweden to join our team, actually. And Christopher is a specialist on hypocritical hook development. Actually, he did his PhD in Rich's Ballero's lab in Sweden. And he did his PhD really on oxygen transport and the hood development. But now, what we want to do is to go a bit deeper into the mechanics of Deeper into the mechanics of that. And the first thing to understand for us is how the growth at the cellular level actually influence the shape of this hook. So with Christopher and Rishi, we recently wrote a paper, a perspective paper, actually about folding. And so that's very convenient because it will give Very convenient because it will give me some way to introduce you to the problem. So, okay, so what we noticed when we were writing this paper is that there are basically two different ways of folding an organ, of bending an organ. And the most classical way we can think of is what is presented here on a carnivorous plant is you have a small part of the organ which is actually changing its curvature. Which is actually changing its curvature. So, which you can see here, hopefully, with the pointer, if it's working. And so, this small part of the organ actually works a little bit like a hinge. And so that's why we called it hinge-like bending. And so, in this classical way of bending, well, if we think about what happens at the cellular scale, we would expect to have one side of the organ which expects. One side of the organ which expands a little bit more, so the outer side that would expand more, and then the inner side that would expand less. Of course, this could mean that the outer side could have a high positive growth, and then the inner side could have a very small positive growth or a very small negative growth. Or you could have as well the outer side, which would have a normal growth, so to say, and you just have contraction on the outer side. And you just have contraction on the inner side. But so, how was this model? Because, of course, there have been some models of organ bending. And so what we realized doing this prospective paper, we realized that, well, basically, there's so far kind of one common framework. One common framework for modeling bending, and that's what we call the rod-like models. And so, in this kind of modeling, what you consider basically is that you have a very thin organ, a very slender organ. And well, you just look at how locally the radius of curvature is changing. And so, you can look at this radius of curvature on the entire length of the organ, for example, the stem during gravity sensing. The stem during gravity sensing. And so, this modeling framework is very powerful because what you can do is that you can link this change of curvature with some signaling that would come from gravity, for example. So, gravity sensing could occur at the top of the stem and then it would feedback on what is happening below. And so, that would occur through signaling, of course. And then you could have. Course, and then you could have some feedback between this local curvature and the gravity sensing because you would change the angle of inclination up on the stem. And so that would be some kind of, that's what we call the geometry feedback. And then, of course, the change in curvature locally also could be sensed by the organ, and that's what called the pro-prioception. And so this can. And so, this kind of modeling has been very powerful because, well, basically, it can, with very simple assumptions, can predict what could happen if you have different strains of signaling or the graphic sensing versus proper reception. And so you could have, for example, overshoot of the stem, so the stem would not be straight anymore, or you could have something that would behave a bit more realistically. So it has been used by many. So, it has been used by many different groups, actually, and to solve many different questions. And so, that's a very powerful tool. Now, what is the most interesting aspect for us, actually, is how to relate the local growth to the change in curvature. And so, if we look a bit closer at one of these kinds of models, what we What we see is this that so what they say is basically: well, we have a very slender organ, and we say that there can be a difference in elongation. So that's what is written here. This symbol would stand for elongation rate, basically. And so we can have a difference in elongation rate at the bottom and at the top of the band. Of the band. And basically, what they say is that the radius of curvature, which you see here, is related to this difference in elongation rate on both sides of the stem. And most often, what is supposed is that, well, you would have a positive elongation on both sides, but you would have a bit more elongation on the bottom than on the top if you want to have this. And on the top, if you want to have this curvature forming. So that, of course, fits with the illustration I've shown you before. And basically, you could have again expansion on the outer side or contraction on the inner side. Okay, so if we come back to the applicable root bending now, well, so we could imagine that, yes, so during the Yes, so during the apical hook formation, during the apical hook development, basically, you could have a phase of hinge-like bending. So you would start from something straight and then you would progressively curve. Then you have a phase which is called maintenance, in which the hook is just conserving its shape. So the angle stays the same. And then you would have the opening phase. And then you would have the opening phase, which basically means opening the hinge. And so you would progressively go back to a straight hypocoty. But well, actually what we can ask is, well, during this maintenance, do you really have a hinge here? Because actually, it seems very simple here. It seems like, well, nothing is happening much in this rook, but that's not actually the case. And actually, I'm not even sure that this phase of formation. That this phase of formation and opening really behave as a hook as well. So, why we think it's more complicated? Well, because if you look at other organs which form hooks like that, they behave quite differently from a hinge. So if you look at curled leaves, for example, so this is a compound leaf which is curled at the beginning of development, and then progressively you see that the leaf is You see that the leaf is uncurling, but the way it's uncurling is that basically you have this part which is curved, which is moving relative to the leaflets. And so you see that at the beginning it's quite close to the base of the leaf, this curved part, and then it moves progressively towards the leaflets which are more at the tip of the leaf. And of course the leaflets are not, they have a fixed position relative to the ray case. Fixed position relative to the radius. So then, what this means is that, well, basically, it seems like this kind of hook shape is maintained, but in reality, the leaflets or the cells are passing through the curved part. So, in this sense, it's very similar to a laminar flow in a fountain. So, if you think about a fountain, you know, which is making this You know, which is making this beautiful trajectories. Of course, you know that each droplet of water is moving through the band, but you get the illusion of having something which is static. And so if we look at what is happening during hook development, actually during this maintenance phase of the hook, so these are some unpublished data from Christopher. So if you do a time-lapse on that and So, if you do a time-lapse on that and if you identify the cells, well, what you can see is that here the same colours mean the same cells. So, if you can see that this orange one, for example, first it was situated at the left part of the hook and then progressively comes to the middle of the hook. And the green one was first at the middle and then progressively drifts towards the right of the hook. And so we can see that the cells are really going through the hook. Going through the hook, just like in the fountain, basically. So, now what is very interesting is that we can, of course, with morphographics, we can quantify the cell growth, the cell expansion, which is associated with this growth. And if you do that, actually, what you can see is that, well, you would have a region of high growth before the hook and on the And on the other side, from this region, you would have a region of smaller growth, so which corresponds to what we have seen with the hinge-like bending. But then, if you look at what happens after the hook, you have something unexpected. You have high growth on the left and then low growth on the right. And so, you have this kind of growth pattern, these curves of growth patterns that actually look like the mirror of each other. So, this brings me to the modeling ideas. So, I thought that, well, maybe we could use the modeling that we've seen before for gravity sensing to actually model this maintenance of the hook in the hypocotyl. So, the first thing, if we look at the hypocotyl when it's at this maintenance phase, that we can notice that, well, if we look at the At the kind of skeleton of this, you have two regions. You have a first region which corresponds to a positive curvature, and so you can associate it with a certain radius of curvature. And then you have a second region, which actually would be associated with a negative curvature and which has a much bigger radius of curvature. So So I thought that, well, maybe we could model that with the framework used for gravity sensing. And basically, we can ask, well, maybe this asymmetry in growth gradients that we've seen, maybe can explain how the fountain growth is maintained in this hook. So, how can you have cells which are passing through the hook? And so, if we look at again at the Look at again at this data. Well, we could say that we could model maybe the hook by saying that, well, we have this hypocotyl, which at first is straight, and then we would impose some different two growth gradients, basically, on this hypocotyl, which would again be a simple rhoda. So we would say that we would have on the left side, we would have fast growth more towards the base of the hook. The base of the hook, Hook at the base of the hypocoty, sorry, and then on the right side we would have fast growth very locally on the tip of the hypocoty. And then maybe, and then of course we could, sorry, we could relate this difference in growth rate between the right and left side to the change in curvature. And so maybe with that, we could obtain this kind of shape. Obtain this kind of shape that we observe in the actual hook. And well, we could maybe explain how these cells are traveling through this shape, which should be maintained in time as the organ is growing. But an even more interesting question would be, well, here if you notice, you have two regions, but actually there's a third region, which is a transition zone B. A transition zone between the zone one and the zone two. So you would have the transition from a very pronounced positive curvature and a less pronounced negative curvature. And so my question would be, can we predict the growth patterns in this transition zone? So if we have this input, so if we say that, well, we have this growth gradient on the left side and this growth gradient in the right side, we would We would know exactly what happens in region one and region two. But that's kind of not very exciting because, of course, we can link the difference in growth rates on both sides to the change in curvature. So it's basically if you give the input, you know what kind of output you would get. So that's not very exciting in some sense. Very exciting in some sense. What is more exciting and seeing is what happens in this transition zone? Because in this transition zone, you only know from the data what is the change in curvature. But maybe we could predict from that what and from having some more working hypothesis, maybe we could predict what is actually the growth. The growth patterns in this transition in this transition zone. So, to finish, I would say that, well, of course, we didn't do, I am definitely not a specialist in this kind of modeling, and I know that there are people in this workshop who are definitely experts in that. And so we are looking in collaborators for this project, basically, and so of course any input is more than welcome. Input is more than welcome. Thank you. Thank you. So we have time for some questions. In act, I'd like to start with one that's really fascinating. If you go further down, so once the, you know, after the curvature, are the cell lengths similar? Like, would the final cell lengths in your tissue be equal? Or do you still see asymmetry? Well, so if you go really more down than yes, there's no visible asymmetry. I would say that there's a problem with going further down is that then you end up studying the elongation of the hypocrites itself, which is kind of a different topic. So I would just leave that aside. My question is more like: is it valid to assume that every cell will grow to a cell? That every cell will grow to a certain terminal length, but the ones on top they just started earlier and faster, and the others have a little bit of lag. So maybe this, this, you know, this red and blue is also a compensation of what a star would do in its natural life, this tree given that. So just when we when we are looking at this heat map here, this is not a heat map of cell lens, this is actually a heat map of cell elongation. Heat map of cell elongation extracted from the time lapse. So if I may. I can talk to you about it later. I see there are many hands up, so I should say. Yes. Thank you very much for this very nice talk. I was a bit confused in the beginning when you showed the hypocety in the stationary phase. I don't remember exactly how you call it. I don't have the impression. I don't have the impression that anything is growing. And then you see in this cell, the cells are displayed from one position to the other. I cannot reconcile these two things. So in this slide that you see here, if you don't see the dots, it doesn't give the impression that it's growing as well, yeah? But then if you see the dots which are showing you the Dots which are showing you the same cells, then it is you see that it is actually growing. You see that the cells are actually growing through the band. And then, if you quantify the cell elongation, you can see that, well, actually, they are growing indeed. So it's very misleading here. The tip is sort of getting away from the basis of the plant. Because it's not obvious on the image, let's say. So so if you you are talking about this this time lapse here? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so the hook the hook is actually getting away yeah, it's getting further away from the base of the plant, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. So question for Zoom, maybe, uh, Enrico? Yeah, thank you, Annalisa, for that very interesting talk. The um so although the cells are moving through this hook, The cells are moving through this hook. So, I think if one part is like the region that it's bending, and the other bit where it's straightening, and the cells are moving through, the growth pattern is not moving. Okay, so the region, the hotspots are fixed, but the growth pattern, the cells travel through. So, they're not carrying the growth with them. So, that implies that maybe the apex is positioning these growth patterns. They're being positioned relative to the cotyledonal, the apex. To the cotyledonal, the apex, which would predict that the distance, although the cells are moving, the distance of the apex of these growth zones remains fixed. Is that the case? Well, we have to see exactly because we have to see what is happening in the growth in because, of course, for it to work, you need to have this zone here, which is elongating, yeah, and it is a little bit. Yeah, and it is a little bit elongating, but not that much. Actually, I'm not so sure that the growth patterns are so are always stationary. So we have to see about that. We have to look at the it might be worth though measuring their position relative to an anchor point for your agents just to see how they're positioned in relation to that. In relation to that, yeah, from the picture on the screen right now on this plant, you can see, in fact, that the distance in that case at least from the tip is not the hook between the hook and the tip is not fixed. It's more and more here. The one from the Johnson and Riguer. Oh, so yeah, so that, yes, so that's a slightly different thing, yeah? A slightly different thing, yeah, because here you have actually it's not completely a fountain, I agree, but it would be a fountain if you would have a lot of elongation on the tip part. Yeah, so if you would have at the same time that you have this curling and uncurling happening, because that's what's happening, yes, you have some parts which were straight, which become curled, and then some. were straight which become curved and then some parts which were curved which become straight if at the same time you had this uh whatever is below d basically would elongate at the same time then you would get you could get a real planting so it could stay at the same distance from the tip of the leaf thank you and so i have a question from yeah thank you uh thanks annalise for um for this talk and i'm very glad to see you joining into this To see you joining into this part of this area of research. So, welcome. And so, I have two one reminder and one question. I guess you're familiar with the work, Daniel may record them, of Wendy Silk on this description of the. So, she really showed that it was like a steady shape from changing cells. So that's what we are back to. And I'm very glad that you jumped on that. And I'm very glad that you jumped on that. And my question is more in the modeling part. And so, the question you show at the end, what I think is just a starting point for the equation, you use standard derivative, but here you have to make also material derivative, consider them because of this motion of the cells. So we developed within the models you cited in your references, one is called the ACE. One is called the ACE dot model, and this one has time which is with a derivative attached to the cells, so the material derivative of curvature. And I think it's worth considering this. And so that's just a warning on that. And by the way, I took the advantage of saying that all this issue of considering material derivative and also the opportunity equation is also important when you're looking for others, when you're looking, for example, Others, when you look at, for example, a concentration of whatever protein you're interested in in growing cells, because sometimes you can be confused with dilution of or displacement of them. And there have been publication on that showing even for gene expression. So that's just a note, but my advice is consider the material derivative here. Thank you. So let me check it for the last question. Thank you, Ann Lise, for a very nice talk. And I have a question. Well, as you mentioned, there have been models done before. I am in particular familiar with this model in the paper by Zadnikova. And the question is, what are the new questions which you try to address compared to what previous models were shown, already showed? Shown already showed. So you are talking about the model of Appik and Hook? Yes. So you refer to this paper by Vadnikova and from Eva Benkova's lab. Yes. This one, yeah? Yes. Yes. So I don't think this model was looking at Looking at growth on the cellular level? Okay. So that's our question, yeah, because here the thing is that to obtain the same shape, again, if we come back quickly to that, you could obtain the same curvature by assuming either this or this. And that's the problem. Yeah. And that's the problem is that here we want to relate the actual cell elongation, the patterns of cell growth, because we can measure them to the change in curvature. And I think that's the new thing about that. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you. Okay. So I should end. Okay, I think there is no more discussion. Yep, so thank you very much for that. And now it is indeed Annie. So Annalise, it says
