A motivation or a corollary of that. So, in a statement, I'll set up the following data: let S be a quasi-projective irreducible variety defined over Q bar and let pi from A to S be an abelian scheme. From this data, we can define the sort, we can define the subset atol, which is the fiberwise defined torsion points. Okay, and non-zero, right? Yeah, and it's non-zero. Thank you. And the theorem is as follows: Let X be an irreducible sub-variety such that it satisfies a natural mild assumption, which this assumption is if we let Assumption is if we let the geologic, if we consider geometric generic fiber, I'll use x eta bar, I'll use eta bar to denote the geometric generic point. This generic fiber is not contained in a proper any proper. A proper any proper sub of the geometric generic fiber of the abelian scheme. So this abelian, so this A eta bar is an abelian variety defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. And by talking about subgroups, we allow reducible subgroups. That means we can have different components. We can have different components. So, what I'm really asking is that this geometric generic fiber is not contained in any torsion coset of this abelian variety. We assume that then if x intersects at all, is the risky dance in x, which then Then the dimension of x is greater or equal to the relative dimension of the Abeline scheme. This is the conclusion. All right, this is a theorem joint with Philip Habakkuk. And this actually has a name. It is called relative many manifold conjecture. proposed by Pink and Zanyi, especially Zanye in his book. Okay, so here it's very important to assume that X in the geometric generic fiber is not containing any translate any torsion cosets. This is certainly wrong. A remark for the theorem is that, first of all, it is proved by in a series of work by Master Zani Kohara Master Zani. If the dimension of x is one, If the dimension of x is one, so if x is a curve. Secondly, the conclusion is optimal in the realm of algebraic geometry. That is, if we just want to express the conclusion in algebraic geometric terms, The conclusion in algebraic geometric terms, then we cannot do better. This can be seen as follows. Of course, one can fabric examples of isotrivial or even trivial abelian scheme. But now here, I want to give an example of non-trivial ability scheme. That is, let's consider the Laurent family, which is here. You have white. Which is here, you have y2, p1 with three points removed, and you have the elliptic curve here, such that it is defined to be y square, that the affine coordinate is this one, where lambda is the parameter from y2. Let's consider a section of this elliptic curve or of this family. So, sigma is a section. We know that if sigma We know that if sigma is a non-torsion section, then sigma of the image of sigma it satisfies this condition. The geometric generic fiber is not containing any proper subgroup because it's not going to be a torsion point if we look at the generic fiber. So it satisfies. So it satisfies the assumption. And secondly, Manning's theorem of kernel tells us that X really contains a Zariski dance and even density the usual topology of torsion points. And this is even true in the usual topology. But in this case, we have that dimension of x is one, and it really equals to the relative dimension here. So we can't have better. So this bound is really optimal in this sense. Okay. This is called the relative many manifold conjecture. Of course, if we replace this fiber. If we replace this fiberwise torsion points by fiberwise small points after fixing a polarization of the family, then you can also formulate the so-called relative Bolomolov conjecture. It will be exactly the same conclusion, except that in this assumption, this set of fabric torsion points is replaced by small points. I won't go to details for that, but here I want to give a corollary of this. A corollary of this theorem, which is also a motivation why we're interested in this in such a result. The corollary is known as the uniform mining manifold conjecture for curves, which now is a theorem of large genome. It says. It says that for any g at least two, there exists a constant depending only on g such that for any curve C, smooth, projective, geometrically irreducible, okay, irreducible defined over q r and any point algebraic point in C. C. We have that the cardinality of C minus P intersects with the torsion, torsion, algebraic torsion points of the Jacobian of P is great is bounded above solely in terms of the genus. The genus is supposed to be the genus of the curve? Yes. Okay, so let me let me go through some history of this corollary because I think it's better this corollary is better known than the theorem. Before Lars Kuno proved this uniform many manifold for curves, the Marko, Krieger, and Ye proved this result for G equals to bie elliptic curves. Okay, I guess that the conclusion is reasonable. You can ignore me. I just, I just, I just, and I know you know this. I just, I just. I know you know this. I'm just wondering why. Thank you. Thank you for the comment. Okay. Let me continue. So, before Lars Kuna proved this result, when G is two by elliptic curves, the case was proved by the Marko Periga here using arithmetic dynamical systems. And then Lars Puna proved this result. And a second proof after Lars Puna given by Yuan. Given by Yuan. But following the mainstreamline of Lars Kuna's proof, except that in each step they prove something, some middle results, and these middle results were proved using different techniques. Using, for example, this here, he uses the idyllic line bundle over quasi-projective. Varieties developed by Yuan and Zhang. Okay, so here our proof is the third proof, but all previous proofs use equity distribution. Actually, use equity distribution as a main technique in these proofs. Technique in these proofs. This is also why all the current proofs are not so effective. It's because this secret distribution results are not very effective. Well, our proof does not use secret distribution. So it's a genuinely new proof of this corollary. And also Of this corollary. And also, of course, our proof also works if you work with arbitrary dimensional arbitrary sub-variety inside variety, and we consider the number of torsion translates of torsion cosets containing X. It also has that as a corollary. Can you get an explicit value of C of G? That's a very good question. So currently, no. I don't know the, I'm not sure about the Markov Krieger and yeah, but I'm sure, but for Lars Kuno's proof, you cannot. And for Yuan's proof, you cannot either, at this stage, at least. For our proof, I need to check. I think because we don't use equity distribution, so there's good hope that we can actually compute a CG with this new proof. New proof, but I need to check something. So, before moving on, I would like to explain how the theorem implies the corollary. Okay, I'll just sketch that. The proof is not very hard, this implication. So, first of all, let's consider we want to find an We want to find an abelian scheme and a sub-writing inside this abelian scheme. So the ability scheme we will take is constructed as follows. We take Mg1. This is the modular space of curves with a fixed point. So pointed curves. So for example, all points here, they look like C P. Like CP or a pair. So you have a curve and you have this P. And if we put a high level structure on that, then we have like a universal curve, frac CG. This is the universal curve on that. Universal curve on that. And this is actually the X over S that I would take. Maybe I write. That I would take. Maybe I write it in here. CG, this is universal curve. And for A, I will take the Jacobian of that, the relative Jacobian of that. So here we have the abelian scheme A over S. And then after this construction, the CG naturally maps into A. Naturally maps into A by sending this curve, the fiber to C minus over C P. This map is C minus P inside this Jacobian of C. So we do have a natural inclusion here. This is the advantage of fixing the base to be a larger space with one fixed point. Fixed point and this is the x that we want and then the dimension of x is easy to compute is easy to compute and you can see that the dimension what we want at the end is we want the dimension to violate this one to violate this this inequality. But currently it doesn't. So we do the usual trick. We take fiber power. We take fiber powers. I will use this to denote the fiber power. Fifth fiber power. Okay. And this is also the fifth fiber power. So actually, in the end, this is the x, this is like the new x, this is the new a. Okay. Then we can compute. Um, then we can compute the dimension of x5. What is that? Well, we have the dimension of s, which is the base, so 3g minus 2 here, plus 5, which is 3g plus 3. And it is smaller than 5g, which is the relative dimension here, if g is at least 2. So after taking the So, after taking the fixed power, this means that by the theorem, this torsion is not Tsariski dense in X5. And then we can proceed as follows. So because Because inside a curve, because each x, the fiber here x over s is a curve. So the cardinality of that is bounded above uniformly in family. Uniformly in family. And then this is a uniform bound. Of course, here at the end, I'm doing it sloppily because if this is not RC dense, then we have two cases. Either in the fiber is already not dense or it happens on the base, but then we can do reduction on the base, reduction of dimensions on the base. So induction of the dimension of the base and then conclude. So here I'm just writing. Conclude. So here I'm just writing here. I will just write the main idea here. If this is not Zara C dense, then already in this intersection, it cannot, it is bounded above in family by the degree of X, by the degree of this closure, etc. So actually we see that this uniform many manifold for curves is not so hard corollary of the relative. Hard corollary of the relative many manifold conjecture. And similarly, for the Bogomov question, it's also the same. Okay. Now, I will go back to the theorem, the relative many manifold conjecture. Our proof does not use equal distribution. We really Distribution, we really follow the Pilatanier method to study special points on certain sub-varieties. And here, our ambient space will be this A, the total space of the abelian scheme, and the special points will be those fiberwise total. Those fiber-wise torsion points. And yeah. But in this case, it's slightly more complicated because at the end, we want to say that those X with Zara C dense torsion points are special, but then two special sub-varieties, their intersection might not be special. So it's a bit more complicated, but we still follow this framework of Tila and Zhanyi. Framework of Tila and Zanyi. So, in this framework, usually we are divided into four steps, which are whose order are whose orders are interchangeable, but also related, these four steps. So, these four steps are a large Galois orbit, which I will use LGO to denote that. Usually, this is a very hard step, it requires a very serious. It requires a very serious aesthetic input. And we also need some version of a suitable version of functional trans a suitable version of the Pilar Wilkie counting result and then. And then a suitable functional transcendence result. And another geometric input is the study the so-called weekly anomalous or whatever it is called locus. I will explain in our situation what they are, but already let me point out that this Pilar-Wilki counting result that we will use is the one proved by Hewegger and Pila, which is called the semi-variant version. And this functional transcendence is the mixed X-Ranu. Proved by me. Okay. So now let me start with this large Galileo orbit thing. Because actually in this question, we really start with this art Galois orbit and then see what we need later on. Large Gala orbit. First of all, philosophically speaking, large global orbit is always a statement in the following form for any X special The Galois orbit The size of the Galois orbit is bounded below uniformly. Well, here I'll just write down Cx uniformly only in terms of the special in X in terms of the sub-variety fix. In terms of the sub-variety fixed, but not depending on the point, times some geometric invariant of the small x. This is really the general form. For example, in many manifold conjecture, this is just a torsion point contained, a torsion point contained in this sub-variety and this geometric invariant. And this geometric invariant is the order of x. This is for many manifold conjecture. For the Andrea conjecture, this is a CM point or a special point. And this is the delta invariant of the CM point, etc. So in our case, of course, here I'm writing down for any X special in XQ bar, but in reality, we only need to prove this for. For special points coming from a fixed Tsariski open dense subset of X. And this is what we will do. In our case, this geometric invariant, well, the special points are X inside XQ bar in intersect Atall, the fibrosis torsion points, and the geometric. Points and the geometric invariant of x is just the order of x. This and x, I use capital NX, you know, the order of the torsion point. So this is what we want to show. We want to find a constant depending only on the sub-variety, such that this lower bound holes. And then we start with the theorem of Simo-David. Of Simo David in the 80s, and that's the following thing. If we have an abedic variety defined over a number field, and we let X X be a torsion point to emphasize that we're taking Q bar option or torsion points. I write down a Q bar tool. This Galois orbit, which sometimes denoted by this, is bound. Is bounded below in terms of CG the vaulting height of A to some power delta prime G times times the order of X. Oh, sorry here. X. Oh, sorry, here I need to introduce also a delta X. So polynomial bound is good. This is capital X. So this result is proved by Sino-David. It is a quantitative version of Master's result on the lower bound of the Galora orbit of torsion points. So it's written in this way. So it's written in this way. So let's compare this goal and this known result. Well, here we want something to be uniform in terms of capital X. And here, well, we already have something rather uniform in the way that this constant is uniform in the dimension. And this constant is also uniform in the dimension. But here we have the faulting height of A. Of course, when we work in the family of abelian varieties, this faulting height. Family of abandoned varieties, this fountain height varies. And if we want to get a lower bound on the Galois size of the Galois orbit, then here we are asking for an upper bound of the faulting's height, which does not exist in general. But then this is where our height inequality comes in. So This is heightening quality. We still have this Iberian scheme and an irreducible sub-variety X, as we would have now. Everything defined over Q bar. Then assume X is non-degenerate. I will say a few words about the nan degenerate later on, but not now. Then there exists a constant C depending only on X and U is a risky open dense subset. So this is what non-degenerate requires. Degenerate requires, it says that this U is non-empty, such that if we consider the fiberwise height, it is then bounded below. Okay, I'll use this term to denote this one just for our purpose. Just for our purpose, it is bounded below in terms linear in terms of the height of the base point here. But let me just write this in this way. Okay, it's not exactly the height inequality that we proved, but it's true. For any X. X inside u bar. So let me explain these terms on the left hand side. This hat, this is the home tape height on the fiber. This is the nehontic height on the fiber. And this one, um, it's actually the modular height of the modular height of the or the height of the base point pi x with respect to some ample line model but by a then it is comparable linearly comparable with the modular height of this of the abelian variety which it parametrizes and by a theorem of vaultings the modular height is comparable to the vaulting height up to a log term quasi-linear Term quasi-linear comparable. So I'm writing down in this way because I want to combine the theorem of Sinudavid and our theorem. Okay, now in our situation, we just consider torsion, fiberwise torsion points. Then this number. So, this fibrillized height is just zero for any torsion point. So, if x is non-degenerate, then we do have that defaulting height. Do have that the faulting height is bounded above uniformly in this family in terms of only this sub-writing capital X. And then combined with Davies' result, we get the large Galois orbit. So So, this means actually this very hard step, if we can assume that X is non-degenerate, then we're done by combining these two results. Of course, each one of them is not trivial. Similar base result and our height inequality, neither of them is trivial, but still we have everything. We have everything if X is non-degenerate. But then the question is: whether we can assume that X is non-degenerate or not. Well, if you know the proof of uniform model long and uniform many manifold and so on, proving or constructing a nanogenist sub-variety is actually a very serious step in all these applications. And this is a new feature that I want to present also in. Feature that I want to present also in this talk. In previous applications of the height inequality above, height inequality above we always started by constructing. By constructing some non-degenerate sub-variety for example, this applied to our result of the uniform model lung for curves and also. Uniform model alone for curves and also cutiness result. And later on, we have this uniform model along for arbitrary albino varieties. And even in Yuan's proof, he also constructed things like this at the beginning. Yuan's proof of another proof of the uniform model law for curves, he also constructed something non-degenerate, although he didn't call it that. Don't call it that. So previously, the first step is really to construct something non-degenerate. But in this new application, we actually change a bit the philosophy. We prove the theorem in two cases. Well, the case either X is non-degenerate, so that the heightening quality holds true, or X is degenerate. Or X is degenerate. So the height inequality does not hold true. So actually, we divide into these two cases, but it's not a simple division. Okay, we proved it when X is non-degenerate, and then we try to prove it when X degenerate. It's not that simple. This is realized by a more careful study. Of the weekly anomalous locus, or in this case, we call it the degeneracy locus. So, in particular, in this proof, we used everything that we did before in this work, Dimitrovgal and Havegar, but we basically use exactly these things. It's the same exactly these things without the equistribution, but we do things more carefully so that we actually we're allowed to prove the relative many method conjecture in two cases, either assuming the height inequality or without the height inequality, when the height inequality doesn't hold true. Okay, then of course, it is a question to see how this can be realized by this more careful study. By this more careful study of the non-degeneracy locus, the degeneracy locus. And this corresponds to this part four, study weekly anonymous locus. In this case, we call them degeneracy locus. Okay, to introduce degeneracy locus. Degeneracy locus, I'll temporarily go back to the simple case of a single Abenian variety. So if we now have just an albino variety defined over Q bar or over C or and an irreducible subvariety, we call weekly special sub varieties. Of A, they are precisely the translates of Abelian subvarieties by a point. So it's a coset. And here we allow arbitrary point, not only torsion. Not only torsion point. If we require torsion point, then they are called special subbrieties and there are extra arithmetic information here. But now we just allow the translation by any point. And then fixing an X, we can consider those translates that are containing X or those translates whose intersection with X is not small in dimension terms. We also want to do the same. We also want to do the same thing for family of ability varieties. Now, in our case, we have a family of abandoned varieties. We also want to consider the translates, but here one needs to be more careful. We won't we we still allow those translates by torsion sections. But then we want to for the other terms we can't allow translation by an arbitrary section but only by constant sections or isoconstant sections. Or isoconstant sections. That means if we have a family of abelian varieties, we consider the isotrivial part, and for the isotrivial part, we can construct isoconstant sections. Like if an example is if we take still the previous case, this La Rant family, because this is a simple abelian scheme and the Scheme and the trace is trivial, so it has no non-trivial constant sections. By non-trivial, I mean non-torsion. If here we have just S and S cross A, where A is an abandoned variety, then the constant sections look like S times A. These are all the constant sections. So in this translation, we only allow torsion sections and constant sections. Actually, there are many ways to see why we only allow these things. For example, Things. For example, one can see this by again by using Manning's theorem of kernel. If the betting map is constant, then the section is either constant or torsion, or by Yvonne's semi-simplicity theorem or the normality theorem for variation of mixed hot structures and so on. So yeah, anyways, here, just I want to emphasize that we only allow torsion sections and constant sections. Torsion sections and constant sections. The thing is, after these translations, it's still something looking good in geometric terms. It's like an abedian subscheme, really rigidly embedded into this A. Okay. By abuse of notation, I will call them weakly special sub-varieties. 12A. Okay. Then now I can define the degeneracy locus. I will define two of them. I'll start with this x stag for any sub-variety x inside A or S. I'll define X stag as the following union. Is the union of certain sub-variety, irreducible sub-varieties of X such that the dimension of Y is greater than the dimension of, I use this notation. Where this YWS is the smallest weekly special sub-variety of A containing Y. So, in particular, if we look at this Y. If we look at this YWS map to pi y, so this is containing a, this thing itself, it's more or less, it still looks like an abelian sub-scheme, an abelian scheme. And here, this difference is just the relative dimension of the abelian scheme, of this abelian scheme. And I'm asking that the dimension of y is greater than that. So this is. Greater than that. So, this is called the degeneracy locus. And a remark is now I can say what I meant X is non-degenerate if and only if X does not equal to X stag. This is one definition. This is one definition. Previously, we used this using. Previously, we used this using Betty map. The definition used Betty map, and then this is equivalent by mix X shining. Anyways, for the purpose of this talk, you can take this as a definition of X being non-degenerate. Okay, so if X does not equal to X deck, then we can apply the height inequality. Then for X deck 1, in the purpose of standard. In the purpose of studying relative manifold in this talk, we will define another design of C locus called XTAG1. We introduce a new parameter. So it's still a union looking like this. And here we go. We just put a one over here, and then we need to extra assumption that the dimension of y is not a point. In this definition, we don't need to add this one because the second condition, this condition already implies that y is not a point. But if we add a one here, we need to add this extra thing. This extra thing, okay. Um, they are very much related. Well, obviously, it contains XDAC. This is just by definition. This is just by definition. And previously, in previous work, we proved that this X stag is closed and also X tag one is closed. Closed and if x is defined over q bar, then both of them are still defined over q bar, etc. And the good thing is maybe I'll write down a proposition. Okay. We have an intermediate theorem, which is as follows. If x intersect at all, it's our ski dancing x with the same assumption as in relative many manifold. Then x equals x deg one. x equals x deg one. So we call this one intermediate theorem. It's actually this theorem that we prove in our paper. And previously, I showed that if the theorem prime holds true for all x in A and S, actually for A in S, actually, for all X inside the universal ability variety, then relative many manifold holds true for all X. So, and this proposition is really proved by studying this non-degeneracy locus. So, in the end, this proposition allows us to just To just prove the theorem prime. And then to prove the theorem prime, we really divide into two cases: either x is non-degenerate or x is degenerate. If x is non-degenerate, we run the machinery of Pila-Zanier method. We can apply our height inequality so that we have this large Galois orbit bound. And then from this large Galois orbit bound, we can construct a curve. A curve which is defined, which is semi-algebraic in one direction, and then apply mix X-Genu to do the computation so that to prove that indeed X1 is Sarisky dense in X. So we're done. And if X is degenerate, then just by definition, this holds true. So this is why we can divide, we can prove the theorem just by dividing these two cases and nothing more. And nothing more. Okay. All right. So, this proposition allows us to prove relative many manifold in two cases. Either x is non-degenerate. X is non-degenerate, namely X does not, X does not equals X, or X degenerate, but then X is already X tag on by definition. So there's nothing to prove in the second case. So, in particular, in this new proof of uniform manual fault, which is Uniform menu, which is this corollary. In this new proof of colloquy, also the constants in the height inequality are not involved because at the end of the day, it doesn't matter whether the height inequality holds true or not. We can prove it anyways. So the constants in the heighting quality also does not show do not show up. Okay, and why this proposition holds true? Why this proposition holds true Well, this is by the criterion It's by the It's by the following criterion. So I still assume that X, the geometric generic fiber, is not contained in any proper subgroup of eta bar. Then X equals X stag one is equivalent to the following thing. To the following thing. If it equals, then there exists a Benny subscheme B of A over S such that if we consider the following diagram, the first diagram is the quotient. By this albinic subscheme, and the second diagram is the modular map, where this G prime is the relative dimension of A minus the relative dimension of B. I'll use iota to denote that, such that for this diagram, we have the dimensionality. So, um, this holds true. Okay. Um yeah or so from this one we can see uh so why why is this why is this useful? Um let's look at the left-hand side. The left-hand side is the dimension. The left-hand side here is actually the dimension of The dimension of a generic fiber of this map restricted to X. This dimension is that. And on the right-hand side, it is GB minus 1. In other words, just to make things look more like the relative mining manifold, I require. Relative mining manifold, I replace this one by greater or equal to gb in inside in this operation of first of all taking quotient and then doing the modular map. What we are doing is on the vertical, we lose things on the vertical direction, on the abelian direction, and on the horizontal direction, which is the modular direction. Okay, we lose things on the abelian direction and on the modular direction. And the thing we lose is the left-hand side when we restrict. Is the left-hand side when we restrict to x. And on the abelian direction, what we lose is precisely the relative dimension of b. And this thing says that, okay, if x equals x dag one, probably we do not have that for this particular x, maybe we don't have that dimension of x is greater or equal to the relative dimension of the abelian scheme. Of the above scheme. But this is not far from being true after some simple geometric operation, which is first of all taking a quotient and then taking the modular map. This is true after a simple geometric operation. This is also the same philosophy for the criterion for x deck equals x. Although in general, In general, x dag equals x doesn't mean that the dimension of x is larger than the relative dimension, but after some simple geometric operations, it's reduced to that case. So here we have the same philosophy. And actually, also from this one, one can see that we really did not use, we have not used the full power of the assumption of relative manifold, which is the which which is the uh which is the fact that the the torsion points are zaruski dense uh on x um because even after even after this this this operation we still need to use that assumption again and again so a question that i want to ask here is is this statement true If the torsion point is RC dense on X, if and only if the battery rank Of X is 2G. This is a question to ask. For example, the right-hand side, this direction is very easy. It's also proved by André, Johara, and Zani. And the proof is quite simple, actually. This direction, then of this direction, Of this direction, it implies relative many manifold because if the Betty rank of X is 2G, then the dimension of X is at least G. This is basically by definition of the Betty map. I'm sorry for this, maybe in the audience. Not everybody knows about Betty Map and Betty Rank, but this is for, but I'm sure that some of you do. And this is a question that surely deserves. Surely deserves an answer because in the statement of relative many manifold, as I explained, in arithmetic geometric terms, this is really optimal already. But of course, we want to have really a criterion. And this is then a natural question to ask whether this really holds true. Okay, I think I'll stop here. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe we'll start with any questions from the Zoom audience. How about from the room? Are there any questions? Yeah, so what is the main obstacle to making this constant CG totally exploited? It's the question about computing this CG. Yeah, basically. Yeah, actually, it's, for example, if one has an effective version of the degree of extent. Effective version of the degree of XTEG one, then
