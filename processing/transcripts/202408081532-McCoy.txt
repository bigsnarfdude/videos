Okay, so sort of when I heard the mandate of the conference, sort of a trick, occurring theme or light motif, I like Jen did not know what a light motif is, but I certainly know what tricks are. And so I performed a rigorous statistical analysis of my papers, and I concluded that in 52.8% of them I'd used Donaldson's theorem in some capacity, at some level. Some level of lattice analysis. However, I was then trying to think what tricks do I use, and I thought, well, most of them are so silly you can't spin them out until a 45-minute talk. But there's one trick that I've used repeatedly, a very nice trick about comparing the shortest elements. But I thought you still can't possibly give a nice talk about that. So I was very happy to be proven wrong on that front. So instead, what I've decided to do is sort of work my way through some of the things. Through some of the things you can do with Donaldson's theorem, sort of excluding the sort of more sophisticated things Josh discussed, where you get d invariance involved and things like that. I just want to use Donaldson's theorem and a little bit of algebraic topology to explain some things, give some examples, and find some examples. So Olsen's theorem is a theorem that needs no introduction. That needs no introduction. So I'm going to remind you what it is anyway, even though we've already seen it twice at Easter's conference. More to establish some notation than anything else. So let's take X, a compact, oriented Want anything else, not really. Connected Shore. Really connected. Everything's connected. Four manifold. And if you use Poincaré duality and the cut product in homology, co-homology, well, you get a pairing and homology. In the integers, and then I always find this mildly barbaric, but you quote and direct like torsion. And you get what we call the intersection pairing on your manifold. And I'm going to call the pair the short qx. So that's just going to be short this guy. So a free obedient group with a symmetric by A free abedian group with a symmetric bilinear pairing, also known as a lattice. And then Donaldson's theorem says, I know I'm among cultured people because I can just say Donaldson's theorem. No one's going to ask which one, because for us there is only one. If you add the hypothesis that x is That X is also closed. The boundary is simply plus 3. Same conclusion. And this intersection form on this guy has an orthonormal basis. So I'm going to write it like this, where n is the second Betty number of the manifold. Second Betty number of the manifold. I'm equipped with a pairing. Looks like this. And I'm just going to write Zn shorthand for all this. That's sort of. That's a fantastic theorem. But I. Yeah, I can prove a lot more things like this. Just plays on my mind. Oh yeah, isn't this getting even better? That's a good job. Good job I tried to remind you. I'm reminding myself. Smooth, closed, and intersection form is positive definite, then you get the actual conclusion you want. So what I want to do though is I want to apply this theorem to so I'm going to take y to be a rational homology three sphere. You can do variations on this where y is not a rational homology three sphere, but you have to everything becomes a little bit more delicate. You sort of have to be careful about some of the things you're doing. And I want to assume that And I want to assume that, well, y is the boundary of some manifold P, which is smooth and positive definite. In the section form, positive definite. And what I want to use do is I want to use the existence of this positive definite manifold here to study. Well we have four manifolds Z, which are smooth and positive definite bounds which bound sort of y of the opposite orientation. So equivalently, you can also think of this as study. Equivalently, you can also think of this as studying negative definite fillings of y. So, what are we going to do? Well, let's form a closed manifold. So, let's glue a manifold by gluing P and Z together along Y. And, well, because I was careful to Careful to set up my orientations like this. This makes sense. It's oriented, closed, smooth, positive, definite, and so diagonalizable. So if we look at myer Victoria's sequence rhomology, what you get? Well Yeah, I'm not creeping into here. And because this is a rational homogeneous sphere, this is zero, and so you know that this map here is injective, and moreover, because we And moreover, because we defined our sort of pairing over there using all sorts of natural things, it's going to be preserved by maps induced by inclusion. And so, what you actually get is, well, you get an induced map of these lattices, which takes the intersection form of P plus the intersection form of Z. Maps it are injectively the intersection. Intersection form effects, which we happen to know diagnosable. And so, what's the hope? Well, the hope is that by Well, the hope is that by analyzing the possible maps of the intersection form of this manifold P, which I'm assuming you sort of understand, by analyzing all these possible embeddings into here, you can get information about possibilities for this other manifold, for this other manifold Z. Now, these kind of lattice embedding things are not usually the sort of thing I want to do in public, but this is a special occasion. Let's do some examples. So, do we have anyone with a favourite manifold who'd like to admit it? Three manifold? Moncrey homologies. Yeah. Fantastic. What a fine choice. Don't worry, no one said that. I had a whole string of booty and salts lined up for the audience, but I already used P. Let's call we have an A homologist here, and this is famously. So I'm Sport the boundary of a manifold get by plumbing things a bunch of disk bundles according to this thing. And so you might like the Pointer A homology sphere with the other boundary, the other orientation, but otherwise we'll take this one. We'll take this one. So now, someone the other day asked me, what does it actually mean to do a lattice embedding? And so the easiest way to think about it is, well, first of all, I guess I should tell you what this, what this, well, the easiest thing to do is pick some basis for one of the lattices where you understand the pairing between all of them. And then what does an embedding mean? Well, it means some choice of vectors here. Some choice of vectors here that you can send these to that respects those pairings. And so in this example here, we have eight of these vertices, and the diagram here means that, or the zoom indicates that each of these elements has self-pairing two. The elements that have an edge between them have That have an edge between them have pairing minus one. And if there's no edge between two of these vertices, then the pairing is zero. And well, there's eight of these. That's kind of big for a first example. So let's start with something smaller. So first, what happens if we just have one vertex with a weight two on it? What are the possible embeddings we can have? The possible embeddings we can have? Well, we're trying to go into Zn of some description, and we're trying to find something self-occurring 2. But if you want to write, so that means you need to find something which ways in which we can write 2 is the sum of 2 squares. It's not a challenging problem. And so what you find is that there's basically one up to automorphisms, up to automorphisms. Up to automorphisms of Zn, there's only one way to do this. And by automorphisms of Zn, I mean you're allowed to sort of permute coordinates or flip the signs on all of one coordinate. And I should also mention, I guess, that represent this thing by a matrix. I'm writing this as the transpose of that matrix because I don't know why. Well, that was easy. What happens if we have two of these things? Well, you still only have one choice for the first thing of to automorphism. So now what about the second thing? Well, we need something that bears my Well, we need something that bears minus one in this, but also has self-pairing two. Well, there's only really one choice again, and it turns out to be that about three. Well In this case, we might as well start with the thing we had for the first two, and now we need to find a second one. In this case, it turns out that there are actually two possible things you can do. You need something which pairs 0 with this and minus 1 with this. And it turns out that this works. This one also works. But then you panic because you think what happens if it carries on like this. And you have loads of loads of possibilities at every step. But good news, it's all fine. Turns out that, well, what happens if I try to add a fourth thing? Well, it turns out that these two guys here are congruent to each other, not two. So anything else has to have same. Anything else has to have the same parity varying with this guy and this guy, if you try to extend this one, and so this sort of branch kind of dies. So, Doug, I understand something, Terry. The pairing between the second two has to have minus one, right? Thanks. Thank you. What happens when you try to do your E8 examples? It's all taking longer than I was expecting. So we won't do 4, 5, 6, and 7. I will just tell you that this is the one that extends. And so what happens when you try to embed this pair into Q? Well, you find that. Well, you find that the only thing that works is this kind of thing. So this is the only way to embed the sort of spine here. Then you try to embed this guy here, and you discover, well, for example, you try to find something which pairs, say, two with. To find something which pairs, say, two with this guy, because this is sort of three in from the end of the spine, one with this guy, but zero with everything else, and you get rapidly sort of stuck. So what is the conclusion? Well, the conclusion is that for the point-grade homology sphere, it bands this positive definite Q, such that there doesn't actually But there doesn't actually exist any of these embeddings. And so the conclusion is that for the Poincaré homology sphere, there are actually no Z's which are possible until you've recovered the well-known fact that the Poincaré homology sphere bounds a map manifold, definite manifold of only one sign. And I should add that there is definitely much more sophisticated ways to do this. But special occasion. Is there any of I want to just check up some You know, if I want to just check if some lattice, you know, is diagonalizable, like if there's just some can I just put this into Mathematica if I knew the right sequence of commands, like if this is an easy way to do it? I think I can just, for example, compute a deep variant or probably some diagonalization type. I'm pretty sure I'm blanking on what precisely what I would do here. But you mean just like take the take the step? Like, take the take this with this maximum overall characteristic covectors. Is that what you mean by? I mean, you won't be computing the D invariant, but you'd maybe be computing. Well, lattices have a D invariant. But ah, sorry. Yes, this is sort of algorithmic. So I meant to mention, actually. So first thing I do is I would want to. So this guy has discriminant one. So the first thing you want to check if something is action diagonal is to check the discriminant. And then GAP has a. And then GATT has a command which will, given any lattice, will compute all of these embeddings, which is actually quite useful because you don't want to do this too much on examples. Our first conclusion is that, well, so this was sort of, I guess, Donaldson level zero, is that we can prove that there are no fillings at all just by checking whether or not one of these things exist. Of these things exist. But maybe we want to go a bit further than that. Thompson level one is that, well, the first bit of data that we can read off is we can read off lower bands on the Betty number here. So after taking zero to be checking whether one A zero to be checking whether one of these things can possibly exist. The other thing, next thing that we can do is we can bound below e2 of z. And you can do that then by sort of looking at what's the co-dimension of the embedding. So here, this is something rank one going into something of rank two. So the co-dimension is Dimensions. So this tells you that any, you can't have any, for example, rational law filling of the boundary of this guy, which you should mention is, the boundary of this guy here is RP3. And more generally, we're going to use this example anymore. Dumb anymore boundary of Ln1 is the boundary of this linear chain here with, say, n minus one vertices, dimension one, same for this guy. This guy simply this is an embedding in three dimension one, whereas this is three dimension zero. And so that tells you that the lens space L41 has a hope of bounding a rational homology ball, which is of course true. It does. So if you sort of turn on this strategy, Strategy, sort of quite aggressively, then you can get, for example, as Liske did, or classification of lens spaces and actual knowledge rules and slice-proven conjecture. Conjecture with two bridge fields all sort of all fantastic, but what else can we deduce from this? Can we deduce from this list of embeddings? Well, the second Betty number, but maybe we want to know something a bit more refined. Maybe we want to know what's the intersection form of, or the possible intersection forms for this manifold Z. So you might want to calculate the intersection form here. Well, Well, look at this embedding we have here. You notice that the intersection form for Z, if the image is going to be contained in the orthogonal complement of the intersection form, the image of the intersection form for P, turns out that you have some relatively mild hypotheses on the on P. So So page one of p is zero, I think it's worship free works more generally. And actually, Z is one of the nose isomorphic to the orthogonal complement of the here. So, where does So where does the sort of the extra hypothesis needed? Well you know if you look at the images of the images of these two here is a full rank sub-lattice here, and so you know that this guy here That this guy here has to be finite index the complement here just a question of calculating that index and hoping that it's actually one. What can we do? Let's look at the inclusion of Z into X, which was union of these two. What comes next in the exact sequence of the paper? It's this, which the other algebraic topology course, which I guess you probably have isomorphic by decision this. which by concurrent duality concurrent duality is just going to be second homology of P. But if this guy here is torsion free this thing here is also going to be Portion three. So you realize that the index here has to be one, otherwise when you quotient out like the image, you're going to pick up some torsion. There are a few we can. Is it one or is it greater than one? Sorry, if the index were greater than one, then When you quotient this by the image of this, we pick up some torsion which we're going to have to survive into this group. So, what do you get when you apply it to these examples here? Well, for example, if I look at the orthogonal complement of, let's say, this guy here, well, you see that it's going to be generated by something that looks like this. So that tells you that for any filling of For any filling of this example here, which I guess is VZ filling this guy here, which would be, I guess, minus L through 1. Well, QZ has to be isomorphic to get something of s to give 3, and then Pairs to give three, and then maybe you can always blow up to add on a whole bunch of extra ones. And so you look like this for some and you can do sort of similar things with the other examples and say sort of what is the what is the upshot. And of course, I should mention that this example bounds a This example bounds a manifold with this intersection, this intersection here, since this is going to be this minus L minus Ln1 minus 12 L31. Well, that's once you square away the signs, surgery on three surgery on and on not. So you can prove sort of stated Donaldson's theorem as a Stated Donaldson's theorem as a theorem about fillings of S3, you can actually take Donelson's theorem to prove Donaldson's theorems about other manifolds if you so wish me. Are there examples of lattices so that we sort of know that the code mention is some examples? Can I give you some examples? I don't really want to. Okay, they get a bit messy. They get a bit messy, but they certainly exist. And can you see them because they're arbitrarily large? Yeah, so for example, something that myself and Jennifer Buck found is there exist length spaces. Maybe I should phrase it like Maybe it's easy I should phrase it like this. For any positive integer there exists a length space L K such that's e positive definite filling. Respectively, any negative definite filling filling is called instantaneously dead plus and minus satisfies that the second 30 number has to be large. And so we were sort of motivated by what we wanted to show these. By what we wanted to show in particular that LK is not smoothly embedded into CP2 connects on A minus one CP2 buzz. So you can produce very big examples in which are very big on both sides. Very untidy. Let's move on to, that was Donaldson level three. Sorry, that was level two. Let's move on to level three. What else could we possibly deduce about Z from just this information here? Well, I could have told you that this co-dimension zero embedding here corresponded to the fact that the manifold on the boundary of this can bound a rational homology ball. And a rational homology ball always has non-true, well, because of the homology here, any rational homology ball banning this has to have first homology non-zero. However, The a priori, you might think, well, what happens if we sort of just puffed out the co-dimension a bit and looked at just some filling whose intersection form was just purely diagonal? Could we somehow magically kill the sort of torsion that had to exist when you just sized it with a ball? And the answer is that the way to obstruct that, so this is. To obstruct that. So, this is almost in level 3, which is to check: well, is one of them filling zero? Well, the obstruction is the following. Well, represent if we if you represent If you represent the map from with respect to some basis, represent the map from QP to Zn by some matrix A. So the transpose of what I've written here then Which I only say this I first saw in a paper of Josh. I don't know whether you found this somewhere else. But, well, if h1 of z is zero, 1 at z is 0, then take this matrix here and take your transpose. It represents the surjective integers. Now I need to refer to my notes. Now I need to refer to my notes because talking about cosmology, so I should just turn the arrows around, but never quite that simple. What's the proof? Well, again, it's a simple, I guess in more sophisticated language you would mumble something about some dual being surjective, but we've got some matrices, so let's talk about those. Talk about those. So, what are we going to do? Well, if we look at the pair for x and p, I just want to remind you that x is what we got by blowing together p and our sort of hypothetical filling z. If we look at the sequence from the pair in cohomology for this, we end up with this thing. You may not have this thing. And if you look at the pair for Z and Yobita sequence, you end up with one small part of it. And then the inclusion and naturality gives you a commutative diagram that looks like this. Like looks like this. Happens to be an isomorphism by excision. Relevant version of duality tells you that this is just H1 of manifolds you're studying, which we're assuming for the purposes of this to be zero, or I think torsion free also works. Also works map here with respect to appropriate coordinates of the dual of the inclusion map. So we're representing this inclusion by A, so to get the dual beta transpose. However, we know that this group here, since we're dealing with a rational homology scale, comprises purely of torsion. I think you already showed it. Yeah, I matched together a lot. I took a more general version of the proof. Or took a more general version of the proof and then accidentally simplified. Yeah, sure. Ignore that. What's the conclusion? You want to conclude that this is zero and so that's subjective. Great, we can do it. Homework. And so what happens when we come back to our example? Well, you check that this matrix is not subjective. And so And so over the integers, well, for example, you can compute the determinants and this is a square matrix if that's not one not going to work. The integers, and so what does that tell you? It tells you that if you take the intersection, the filling of this guy with diagonal intersection form, it's always going to have some torsion at some point. And what's this trick good for? Well, I'm only really aware. Well, I'm only really aware of sort of one application of this, but I feel like it should have more. And so this is one of the reasons why I wanted to mention it is that, well, Josh used it to show that there exist Kavanaugh homology thin non-quasi-alternating knots and I'll add. And Arnadisa used it to classify positive alternating Montasinos names. But I sort of feel like it should have an application to things which are more interesting than quasi-alternating things. I should have stopped the recording for that one. So that's level three. Ah, I have. Wait, when did I oh, I have four minutes or sort of. Okay. Great. I was worried I was going to go short. I guess we had we had levels 4A and 4B. We'll just go with level 4. We'll just go with levels more. So, well, what's better than one lattice embedding? Exactly, two lattice embeddings. And so, what happens, you know, another of my favorite applications. Of my favourite applications is if you ask which one's phone or is that the phone? So to ask more, which three manifolds embed into S4? So I really mean smoothly embed into S4 because we're using Donaldson's theorem, so I can't really hope you say much about topological embeddings. Say much about topological embeddings. Well, if this happens, if you have such an embedding here, then what does that do? Well, it cuts S4 into two pieces, which I'll maybe call Z1 and 2, along Y. And so, given this setup, what can you do? Well, you can form two closed manifolds, x, say, let's say x1 and x2, and so you get Until you get two embeddings of one represented by a matrix A1 and the appropriate dimension, they're going to be co-dimension one embeddings. So these are going to be rational homology bore fillings. So you've sort of a priori got all the lovely obstructions. A priori got all the lovely obstructions that you might have from that problem, but being able to take two rational balls together and rational balls and group them together to get something which is S4, or even an integer homology, or is really quite specific. However, you sort of know that these two balls are not completely independent because they glue together to give you. Or take you together to give you give you S4. So, at the level of first homology, what you end up with is actually that you get an isomorphism like this. Isomorphism like this. In fact, you know a little bit more. You know that by Alexander duality. You know that these two groups here are isomorphic, so you already know that this takes quite a strong form. But the fact that this is an isomorphism here actually translates quite nicely in terms of these embeddings here and the way it manifests itself. Well this was sort of, I should say, this is originally due to Andrew Donald, but I guess interpreted by Ahmad and myself, put it in the following form, is it turns out that if you take the dual of both of these two Act them sort of next to each other. You have one big fat matrix, and its conjecture is surjective. Here is conjective. Again, over the integers. And what can you do with You do with what can you do with sort of an obstruction like this? Well, Andrew Donald used it to classify when you connected sums of lens spaces and bed into S4. And I'm Adam myself plus Clayton MacDonald. So in this talk, you've got a multitude of donalds in various forms. Well, we used it to classify. So Armad and I were able to use this obstruction here to sort of come up with a candidate list of things that doubly slice because if you doubly slice the double branch cover embeds into S4. However, we looked at our list and thought, most of the We looked at our list and thought, I have most of these, well, they came in sort of nice families up to mutation, and we could identify one element in each family, except a couple of elements in each family that were doubly slice, and we figured the rest were probably not W slice, but it was probably really hard to prove that they weren't. And so we didn't really try, and then Jason came along and just, oh yeah, they're all W slice, it's easy. I should say that uh I should mute I should mute this, but you can also do things which are much more interesting than this with this obstruction. It's just, you know, because what we were really interested was embedding cyclic tilted spaces, and we got some results, which I think are quite nice. The problem is they're just basically unstatable in a talk. So I think the upshot of this talk is: I think there's a lot of things you can do with Donson's theorem. With Donson's theorem, and I feel like probably still ways in which these sort of neat obstructions can be applied. I just don't want to do it. I would like the percentage of Donaldson's theorem papers to dip below 50% at some point. I guess I'll carry on. Briefly, I just mentioned that the biggest. Mention that the biggest disadvantage of doing this Donaldson theory stuff is that as soon as you write one of these papers, everyone figures it's fair game to send you the rest to referee. I think I'm done. Questions now? It you actually compute the fifty two point eight percent. Yes. Eleven out of twenty-one, I think. It was a couple of days ago, so like might have changed. Well, no, no, the number of papers and things might have changed, but like my memory of what the figure was might have changed. All right, let's think down again. And just as a reminder, there's one more talk tomorrow morning at 9. Danny Ruberman will tell us about his favorite spot. But we don't know what that is. We don't know. So there we go. So there's nothing to ask if we can catch all our other questions. Like, one thing is like, so here's an algorithm. Like, so here's an algorithm. This suggests what I would do in general. I would say the latest question. Like, so like analysis. Of course, we've learned a lot. Yeah, I thought it was a name. Oh, yeah, I thought it was a little bit more. I was like, ultimately, or something else.  Yeah, that works because the hand food that we've customized for my hands is just that much very small side bigger. That's interesting. I mean, and so you mentioned like you have three. Um and so you mentioned like you have a de invariant a lattice you mean sort of like you take maximum overall for vector because the thing that says the de invariant bounds from a lattice but like you know and you know I think maybe for like some psychic fighter manifold maybe beyond that like you know that obstruction you know so so you get some obstruction to dialogue like positive say a small atmosphere I thought it was having much of a lapis. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So nobody just understood. Well. Oh, yes, I think I guess I'm getting there's this question that I piled out. Wild pile, where there's I guess there's also kind of like the conditional stern R variant of coming from whether or not like the same obstruction as Donald said if he's saying you're the first person to ask this question. Yeah, no, yeah, I know. Well, I mean, you know, Norman is able to ask us as well. Yeah. I mean, somehow, I know that I wasn't the first guy. I needed it for something, and so it's helpful to say at the time. Do you know where that got resolved? How much of my registration? I'd say it's human understood the same because I think this is what is true. So it's based on proof that if that definite amount of Found a definite manifold the central point on the central vertex is one which I believe is equivalent to the construction signal positive. That's that's much pa that do you have a number of papers, but I know yes I have I have the three is a little longer substitute is basically. Substitute a space to have something that happened. I can send you the, I can actually send you the. Yeah, I mean, at this point, somehow what I wanted it for is a long event, but nonetheless, it's just nice to sort of have that thing closed up here on my mind, so I don't have to worry about it. That turns out to be a good idea. Yeah. Well, I think it's the one that's my sample.
