Today I will talk about a set of skeleton dynamics. The first one is this talk includes three stories. The first one is about microtubule, and the second one is about acting, and the last one is about the submechanics. So, as you may know, chromosomes and two centrosomes can self-assemble to form this bipolar structure called spindle, like this. However, if there are multiple centrosomes inside of the cell, they can form multipolar spindle, including three, four, five, or even more smith poles. And the multipolar spindle is a remarkable feature. Remarkable feature of many cancer cells. In other words, the frequency of the multipolar spindle is really high in many cancer cells. And most of our knowledge about multipolar spindle comes from the individual culture system, where cells can grow freely on two-dimensional surface. However, in our body, cells usually Purely subject to the mechanical confinement from adjacent cells and also the extracellular matrix. Therefore, their adhesion, migration, and also the mitosis are totally different from the initial cultural system. In dormal tissues, actually, the chromosome segregation defects and also the aneurology. So, the aneuroe is actually very low. But after these cells are dissociated from these tissues and captured on the two-dimensional surface, the high frequency of chromatin segregation defects and the unemployed can be observed. This means the mechanical confinement from the normal tissue architecture can prevent or rescue the multipolar mitosis. In contrast, in tumors, the frequency of multipolar spindle is really very high, maybe induced by the highly brought three-dimensional matter environment due to the uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells. And also, the height confinement can also result in the multipolar spindle. So, you can see the influence of the mechanical Of the mechanical confinement from normal tissues and the tumors is totally different. But what's the difference between this mechanical ferment and how various form and degree of mechanical ferment influence the behaviors of multipolar spindle is still remain unclear. To mimic the various forms of an degree of The various forms of and the degree of mechanical confinement we use PDMS to fabricate micro channels like this with different height and width. Therefore, we have three cases, no confinement, two wall confinement, and forward confinement. So in this talk, I will mainly focus on the forward confinement since this is similar to the removal epicillial tissues. So you can see. So you can see we can control the shelf very nicely. And it's very convenient to observe the multipolar spindle. And from this movie, you can see clearly see the five-pole spindle. For example, here, this cell will split once and finally become three cells. In this cell, the spindle split twice. been split twice. And this one, first split and then cluster again. It's not this is in very narrow channel. So we found without any confinement, the frequency of a multipolar spindle is about 5%. However, under the two-fold confinement, as the cell becomes more confined, the frequency of multiple The frequency of a multipolar pindo can increase to 60%. And the formal confinement is totally different. As the cell becomes more confined, the frequency will decrease from 12% to 4%. Under the zoo for confinement, we found the post-submitting increase. Splitting increase. I saw in this figure. And the forward confinement, the post-splitting is inhibited, and the pole clustering is enhanced. So the behavior is totally different. And during the metaphase, without any confinement, the chromosomes can form this ring-like structure. However, under two-wheel confinement, that's cell becomes. Confinement, as cells become more confined, the chromosomes will become more scattered. And the turbo confinement cannot accommodate the equatorial plate during the metaphase. And so in this movie, you can see initially the equatorial plate is very short and thin, and then it's bent to a long and thin metal phase plate by splitting twice. Under formal confinement, the situation is totally different. The formal confinement rarely results in the scatter distribution of chromosome during the metaphase, and the formal compartment can also accommodate all the chromosomes by tilting the plate during the metaphase. Here, I must emphasize this. Here, I must emphasize this conclusion is based on the appropriate forward confinement assumption. So, this fist diagram gave the definition of the appropriate forward confinement. So, if the wise and the height are both high, this is the unconfined case. If the one of them is small, it's a two-wall confinement, and this one is a four-wall confinement. So, the third reason is So, the shadow reason is an appropriate forward confinement, which means it should be big enough to accommodate all the chromosomes during the MET phase, but it should be small enough to limit the chromosome scattering during the pro-MET phase. So, this is just like the spatial confinement of normal tissues. So, to better understand the To better understand the behavior of multipolar spindle, we develop a computational model like this by considering the pole splitting and clustering. And initially, we have one pair of posts clustered together and two single posts. Therefore, we can study the clustering and the splitting of the multiple spindles. So you can see our simulation can nicely reproduce. Nicely reproduced the experimental data. And very sweetly, our model predicts that the formal confinement can control the cell shape, which can effectively in turn regulate the equilibrium configuration of a multipolar spindle. For example, tripolar spindles are usually regular triangles in wet channels. Triangles in wet channels, but they become obtuse triangles in narrow channels. And in very narrow channels, the spindle may even become a straight line. To get motion inside, we develop a simplified theory. So from the simulation, we can calculate the purple force without any cortex. Cortex and the data can be fitted by this function. After integration, we can get the pairwise purple interaction, which is a double-well potential with two minimum representing the two stable states. One is a cluster state, another is a split state. So it's just like a reversible chemical reaction. The splitting and the cluster. And clustering needs to overcome this energy barrier happen. And also, we have this core cortex index. Based on the simplified theory and experimental data, we can get the energy barrier. So we can see as a trend west decrease, the energy barrier for the pulp clustering decreased. And the answer barrier for pole splitting increases. In other words, the clustering becomes easier and the splitting become difficult. So this result can be easily understood by these physical pictures. In red channels, all the spindle poles are far away from the cortex. Therefore, after the Therefore, after the splitting and the clustering occurs, the pole-cortex interaction, the change is very small. Therefore, the total energy is mainly determined by the po-co interaction. However, in narrow channels, the distance between the pole and cortex is small. Therefore, after the splitting occurs, the pole-cortex interaction will increase a lot. Therefore, the double-walled potential will change. And if the And if the channel is very narrow, the double well potential may even become single well potential. Therefore, we can conclude that the enhancement of the pole clustering and the inhibition of the pole splitting and the forward comparement are induced by the pole cortex interaction. So, to further verify this mechanism, we inhibit the pole-cortex interaction by depolymerizing. Interaction by depolymerized the asteroid microtubule. So we found actually after the inhibition, the pole subplitting increased, but the clustering decreased and the multipolar spindle increased. Therefore, we conclude. We conclude the pole cortex interaction indeed regulates the pole splitting and the clustering, especially in the narrow channels. So the second part is about the peri-nuclear acting rings, which can serve as septic belts. So many experiments have shown that the big Many experiments have shown that the mechanical loadings and the osmotic shocks can result in DNA damage. And the DNA damage is very important for the cell aging and the process. In fact, epicili tissues are usually subject to the challenge of mechanical loadings and osmotic shocks. For example, oveilla suffers a cyclical. Veli suffers a cyclic strain up to 15% during respiration. And the episode tissues are subject to the strain of 30% or the strain rate for 100% per second during heartbeating. And after we drink or eat, the osmiotic pressure can change an order of magnitude in one minute. However, how the epicidal cells prevent DNA damage and reduce aging and apoptosis still remain unclear. So to answer this question, we apply osmotic shocks to the MTCK cells. So you can see after osmotic shock, there's an acting ring is formed around the nucleus. The nucleus and sort of after it disappears. And in monolayer and even in embryo, the acting ring also exists after the hypotonic shock. If the amplitude of the hypotonic shock increases, the probability of The probability of the acting ring formation increases and also the generation time of the acting ring decreased. And we notice that hypotonic shock can lead to water absorption and increase the particle tension. Therefore, we speculate the change of if we directly apply mechanical force to the cell, can we trigger the acting reflection? Trigger the acting reformation. To test this idea, we use AFM to indent the cell and then withdraw. We found only fast loading and fast unloading can trigger the acting reinformation. If the loading and unloading is slow, then there is no acting reinformation. And we noticed the application of mechanical force or the osmotic shock on cell, usually accompanied by the activation of calcium ion channels. Therefore, we speculate maybe calcium is involved in this process. So actually, we found after the hypotonic shock, all Hypotonic shock or AFM indentation, the calcium concentration in the epithelial cell increased immediately. And also, very interestingly, the peak of the calcium is earlier than the peak of the actin, which indicates the calcium may be very important in its process. Actually, to further confirm the effects of Confirmed the effects of calcium. Actually, we do a lot of experiment. We found the increase of calcium concentration itself is enough to induce acting ring formation without any osmotic shock or mechanic force. And the acting ring formation requires the depolymerization of the acting activated by the castle signal. By the casu signal. And here we also show that the acting re-information requires C-actin diffusion. For example, here we load the cell, then the acting diffuse to the periphery of the nucleus, and then go back. So, to get more insight, we developed a computational model by considering the acting polymerization and the polymerization, and also the contraction of the acting network induced by mice. So, you can see from the simulation, you can see we can reproduce the experimental phenomenon. Experimental phenomena very nicely, including the formation and the disassembly of the acting ring. So, the following question is what is the physical logical significance of this phenomenon? So, we found the spreading area of the nucleus first decreased. Nucleus first decrease and then increase after the hypotonic shock. And also, the Young's modulus of the nucleus transitively increase when the acting ring exists. And also, we found higher nuclear surface roughness, which means the surface tension of the nuclear envelope is lower. Is lower and by bow experiment, we prove that the peri-nuclear acting ring can prevent nuclear amyloid rupture and the DN damage, cell aging, and also the pop tosses. So to summarize, the perinuclear acting ring just like a septic belt to protect. septic belt to protect itself from the the the the the aging and the apoptoptosis and both both the the acting ring and the sift belt respond respond possibly and they only work when the act external force is fast enough and big enough so finally uh i will introduce the the I will introduce the hemato polytechnic reconstruction strategy based on cell mechanics. So actually, the hematopoietic stem cell transplants are the most effective treatment for the leukemia. Since the HIC can differentiate to almost all To almost all the blood cell and the immune cells. In China, there are only 17 substant HIC donations. However, there are 25 million people wait for HIC transplantation. Therefore, the HISC expansion is urgently needed. However, there are only There are only less than 0.2% of HIC can home into the bone marrow. Therefore, we need to solve two challenges. One is difficult expansion and another is in substant homing. In other words, we need to improve the quality and the quantity of the HIC transplant. Usually, people use Usually, people use drugs, try to find some drugs to solve this problems, but this method has some limitations. For example, the expansion rate is low and the cost is very high. You can see the price of these drugs is very expensive. And most importantly, the effectiveness of these drugs is short-term. Short term. Recent experiments have found the HIC behavior and fate can be regulated by the cell mechanics. For example, these ECM stiffness can regulate HIC stemness, and also the decrease of the cell stiffness can make HIC escape from the niche. Therefore, we wonder whether we can develop we can develop a habitopoietic re-extraction strategy based on cell mechanics. In other words, by using the actual cellular macro environment and also the mechanical properties of cells, can we realize invival homing and the vivo expansion of HIC? The answer is yes. In fact, during the human process, the HIC initially The HIC initially adheres to the endothelial cells without this blood vessel and then migrates to a suitable location and finally across this blood vessel wall to reach the bone marrow. Therefore, the low adhesion, slow migration, and the insufficient deformability may induce May induce the homing failure, just like I saw in this movie. So you can see this HICC tend to across the blood vessel wall, but finally fill. So fortunately, we found the molecule search which can significantly enhance Significantly enhance the adhesion, the migration speed, and also the deformability of the HIC cells. And we used two photon imaging to further evaluate the effect of CRH. We found faster migration in the CRH group than the control group. And besides, and And besides the migration speed, we also found the more HIC distribution in the book marrow in the stars group. Okay, so the RNA sequencing showed that the upper regulation of the ECM. Of the ECM remodeling genes, especially THPS2, which is an ECM protein. And we found the CRH can induce the activation of rho, can induce the row activation and also the YAP choice location, nuclear choice location, which in turn lead to the PHPS2 upregulation. And we also found the TH TS2 can interact with integrin alpha5 bit3 and the inhibition of the integrin will reverse the yapp translocation and also the enhancement of the Hesion migration deformability and also the homing. Precise. So I will skip this part. So I will skip this part. And in the bone marrow, actually, we can observe a repeated collision of the HIC with neighboring cells. So we want to ask, can the collision from the microparticles affect HIC behavior, especially the stemness and also the expansion? So the answer is yes. The answer is yes. We found the co-cultured micro particles with diameter of 500 nanometer will significantly increase the expansion by 400 times. And also we found the mechanical size of channel FISO1 is very important in this process. The collision from the 500 nanometer microparticles can Microparticles can activate the PIS1 channel. And also we found the co-culture after the expansion, the HIC can enable the hematopolytic reconstruction in mouse and also maintain the stemness and the reconstruction capacity in multiple transplants. Multiple search plants. The relapse of the AML actually are thought to be induced by the leukemic stem cell, RIC. However, it's very difficult to identify the RRIC. To identify the IRIC in the experiment. It's just like we know there are some criminals in this room, but we don't know what he looks like. So here we found the small cells have stronger stemness and drug resistance. Therefore, in other words, the cell size can be a physical marker of RIC. And the small cells, and here we found the small cells is softer. And the expression level of acting is lower, which means the cell stiffness also determines the cell stemness. So, therefore, we can enrich the RS. We can enrich the LC by microfluid device. So, here with only the self-stimulus or self-size as a marker. So, single-cell sequencing, we use single-cell sequencing, we identify ARDH21A1 is very important, which can alter the cell stiffness. And by combining ARDH21A1 and the cell standard, ARTH 211 under the self-size, we can increase the LLC by 80%. And if we increase the stealth stimulus, we can reduce the stemness and also the relapse capacity. Therefore, we can develop strategy targeting self-stimulus, which can Cell teams, which can kill AML cells and also immovable much more effectively. So, combining the commonly used drugs, we can kill ourselves more effectively. Okay, so this is the end of my talk. Thank you.
