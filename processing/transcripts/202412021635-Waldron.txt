You can't leave. Please go ahead. Correct. Renormalizing. There's a video of your own self up there. That's pretty fucking. Who is that talking to? Renormai Signals Energy, so our co-conspirators. Re-alphabetize, so it's Yong Bing Seng, Emmanuela Pettini, and Rod Gova. If you know these numbers to this accuracy, you can find the relative papers. Relative papers on archive. Okay, the structure. So, this talk is quite close in spirit to the previous talk, even though the setting will initially look quite different. It's very close. Some sort of aim, sort of motivation. Linear algebra is important, vector space. But you know, But you know, we're all teaching these linear algebra classes. Maybe someone else is teaching it over there. Here and there, we need a notion of space. There it is. You're teaching linear algebra there, I'm teaching it here. How do we know we're teaching the same subject matter? Well, you need to be able to take a vector there, move it over to there, and decide whether it's the same one. So you have to study connections. And arguably, this is one of the nicest structures in all of geometry. Okay, since this is a manifold, it's got a boundary because, as far as we know, the Earth is flat and ends somewhere. Okay. Um okay, next we would like to study sort of complete metrics but we would like this to be compact so we sort of do remove from the previous talk and study the conformally compact structure. So we want to give this manifold a metric on its interior. Plus, in any positioning of plus, will mean the interior of that manifold. The boundary will be called sigma throughout the talk, and g plus. And g plus will be a conformally compact manifold, meaning that if you're able to multiply it by a defining function for the boundary squared, so that the coinormal being the d for that defining function, function vanishes along the boundary of course, you get a so-called compactified metric that goes to the boundary smoothly as a metric. Goes to the boundary smoothly as a metric. Same structure as in the previous talk. Now, of course, you could use a different compactified metric by choosing a different defining function. And there's a whole set of those by multiplying by any positive function. So let's upgrade the space of compactified metrics and the space of defining functions by making the symbol a bit thicker. So this is now a conformal class of metrics that you get here. Class of metrics that you get here, and you get a nice conformal geometry here. And of course, you can pull this conformal class back to the won't use a conformal class on the boundary, so you have a conformal class there. Okay, so that's conformally compact, and so the data for the problem, if we want to study a vector bundle with a connection on a conforming compact. Compact manifold, so we want the data of maybe, however, you like it. You could give a data of this or maybe D, as you wish. Now, the aim is to study special connections. How do you pick out nice connections? That was 1954. Yang and Mills, they were wanting to do particle physics with this stuff, asked this connection to obey some kind of Yang-Mills equation, which I'll write down later. That Yang-Mills equation. That Young-Mills equation is variational, so it has an energy. Functionals, as we've seen, on conforming compact manifolds or PE manifolds, if you like to make this PE, let's call this CC for conformally compact. And let's use PE for Poincaré-Einstein, and that just means that the Schauten tensor, which has been called A. Which has been called A, I, and now P today should be minus one-half the singular metric. Yeah, so if you write the energy functional for the Young-Mills equation, well, I'll be mostly interested in the P case, that will not make sense. Make sense because this metric is becoming simpler here and you'll have to renormalize that energy. And that is the aim of this talk. It's to give you a formula for the renormalized energy. This is going to rely heavily on the, I'll call it CQY, but that's the Cheng Ching Yang argument that we saw in the previous talk. And Is the goal clear enough? No, I told you that, I told you that. Oh, there is one other thing that inside without the square root, inside this class of defining functions, there is a particularly nice one, I guess the Graham-Lee one that was in the previous talk where the Where the defining function also gives the geodesic distance r to the boundary. And that will give you a special compactified metric, and I'll put a little C on it to indicate that, because that will appear. And will be used to define a renormalized energy. So what type of Linux are you tell? The B? What kind of B? Oh, any vector space. This setting is very, very general. Just pick any vector bundle. Any vector bundle. Do you have a symmetric group or anything like anything? No, no. Pick your favorite vector bundle and study connections under it. But you have a metric downstairs, so you can write a Yang-Nose condition. And that's all I do. But it is very general, which is good, I suppose. Okay, so Yang-Nose. So you've got the data, new M. Sometimes I'll put an A here, that's not an index, that's just labeling which connection there is. I'll get different connections. A is a name for connection. So you've got a vector bundle with connection. Connection. Let's call connection you get C C Y M cubic centimeters. No, conformally compact Yang-Mills. If the connection obeys a condition, you take curvature. So do remember that the curvature of a connection, F is the wedge square of. is the wedge square of, sorry, the curvature of connection is the wedge square of the connection. I'm going to start using indices, but there's nothing wrong with doing that because all the indices are abstract. Just labeling which sort of tensor I have. Take the inverse, I'll call G plus the singular metric typically, CA, so you're taking a divergence of this two-form. Of this two-form. This two-form, of course, takes values. This lives in nu m. Tensor, of course, I don't know, on the lambda 2. So it's measuring what happens to vectors as we move them around. Take a divergence of that and ask that to vanish. That's the first condition. And the second condition is that I want. Is that I want na blah a long sigma to smoothly give you a connection null bla bar. And if you want to set up a problem, you would give me this boundary connection and then try and solve that condition. So Y-mils is huge in physics because it describes the forces between particles. It's big in math, I guess, four manifolds and Donaldson and instant tons and all that kind of stuff. Donaldson and instant tons and all that kind of story. Less studied in this conformally compact setting. There are results of Ucula and Lopus de Lima on deformations. Relatively little is there. However, if you were to sort of take, I don't know, take the list of all the classic results for Bunkerie-Einstein structures and ask whether those results have analogs for the Yang-Milson. Analogues for the Yang-Mill setting and the answer is typically your favorite conditions. This word smooth, so everything is going to be smooth except where I indicate that it's not and where it's not I'll sort of say what the regularity is and it will be important if I forget somewhere in the middle. Yeah. Is it important to you the main point is four dimensions? No, no. Although I will be focusing on six for reasons of that where our current metal is. I think if you do was to really ho down on it, you'll probably be able to do it without this. Divergence would respect the divergence. So this connection would be G plus coupled. You would need Levi Chavita coupled to take this divergence, yes. All you have there is a singular metric and you have this connection. So this is the curvature of that connection. You ask it solves it. Connection, you ask it solves a divergence condition. That's the Young-Mills equation. In vacuum. If they're particles, you put stuff on the right-hand side. That's with every session, the chair gets in the way. Young mills energy. Yeah, so it would be nice if this was variational. So let's take now M D mult G just for money. Would have been good for mathematics if Riemann had had a shorter name. And F is the curvature of Curvature of some label I, then there's an energy, depending on all that stuff. The minus is to make this positive. I said this took values and endomorphisms, so if I'm about to square it, you'll be able to trace it, and that's what the trace means. And I need default is here such that if you He is such that if you trace the product of endomorphisms, you typically get something positive. Conformally invariant already in d equals 4. Interestingly enough, we scale the inverse matrix and the volume cancels out. Variation gives the gang Mills equation that I wrote down earlier. What's this one? For a class of connections such that the trace is not degenerate. We've got a fine print there. Typically, not important. Oh, and You always have a Bianchi, huh? A Bianchi. The usual Bianchi. If you study the energy M plus G plus for a conformally compact structure, I'll define I'll define the d greater than 5 because it will blow up. Just like the curvature integrals were blowing up in the previous talk. Okay. Why is it not blocked for D equal to 3? Poll or 3 is going the other direction, you've got the inverse metrics, and the volume factor is not strong enough to hurt you. Sigma cube playing against a sigma to the fourth, if you put those sigma powers in that I wrote earlier. Okay. Formal solutions. So the equation that I think ill-advisedly erased there, you can think about what its asymptotics looks like if you're trying to solve formal. This gobbly goop is trying to take This gobbly goop is trying to tell you take the conformally C C Y M the conformally compact Young-Mills equation I wrote here for any defining function defied by a power of that defining function, you still get an object that goes to the boundary in a well-defined way. We call an almost YM equation. Ym equation at the script J that's a regular J you take a divergence of a curvature people like to call that a current the current of the connection The current of the connection. And I'm just rewriting the equation I wrote for you before in terms of objects that are all well defined and smooth everywhere. This n here was a co-normal I've raised an index using any compactified metric. This equation is written with respect to any compactified metric defining function here. Set this equal to zero. This is the same system that you were solving. And now you can see from this equation why you might be able to write down a nice asymptotic solution. So you're going to give me some connection on the boundary. Along the boundary, sigma vanishes. So you just have to make sure that normal components of curvature die. That's your first step in solving this thing. Then you compute this object. This thing, then you compute this object and you try and fix a mistake here and you build a recursion. So there is a nice recursive solution that works order by order in powers of sigma for a while. Any other theorem about that? Those people, whoever they are, who want D greater than equal to four dimensions, you give me the connection along the boundary now. Then there exists unique. Unique modulo fine print, and fine print is unique modulo gauge transformations. Conjugate the connection with an endomorphism, u and its inverse. And that you would call a gauge transformation. Now I'm interested in asymptotic ones. That should be enough to vaguely understand that. Such that, or we can do ST. Early J, which is the equation we're trying to solve, you can achieve that it's your defining function to the power of sigma to the d minus 1 times k. So k will be some endomorphism value vector. K is going to obstruct you from solving further. So it's the obstruction to smooth solutions to the problem. So this is called So this is called K is the abstraction current. Sounds like a reason that went down the wrong way. Actually, I went to bar it, and that's K restricted to sigma. All that construction current. It's built from just the conformal class of metrics on the boundary. The conformal class of metrics on the boundary and the boundary connection has it's local. It's conformally invariant too. So this thing is local, seem variant. What else should I say? Oh, and it's variational. It itself comes from some kind of energy. That brings me to talk about the asymptotes of the energy functional that I wrote down earlier. Longer, but it doesn't work. That doesn't work on that side. Sometimes you wonder whether it's you yourself who isn't working. E can stand for energy, asymptotes can stand for asymptotics. Let's say something about that. Again, there's a theorem: usual people. Let's do deep branding for the five. I guess we have M G plus conformally compact. The abbreviations are brutal here. G could be sigma squared G plus, say, that's the compactified metric. Then, in the asymptotics, oh, of course, I said that this thing's not defined. Here's M plus. You've got some defining function. Let sigma to epsilon cut this part of the manifold off and integrate over that part of the interior and you get something like that. You don't have to use the GL defining function, family one, if you don't wish to. Okay, then what So you want to view epsilon as small and you just get some nice Laurent series in epsilon to start off with with some coefficients. The coefficients are integrals of local quantities actually, but not conformally invariant things. Epsilon. They'll call those divergences. Those are things that blow up when epsilon gets smaller. And you're typically wanting to throw them away. Then you get a term involving the log of epsilon. That's the integral of a point Y is conformally invariant that they like to call the anomaly. It's an integral over the boundary, which I was calling sigma. Kind of sigma. The object of our focus, so we normalized energy. Okay, this is say invariant that's part of the theorem, right? Right. And the point-wise invariant, what do you mention here that something we're grading 4 so that stuff happens? You want T to be 5, so you don't care though? Greater than equal to 5, yeah. And the CC is really just compact. Does it need to be X pack? No, but I will want to focus. No, but I will want to focus on the Einstein case where nicer things happen. Also, parity mentioned there doesn't have a parity card. Yeah, it does no parity. If you were like, if you were to pick the Graham-Lee defining function and make this PE, then you only get every second term here, and nice things would happen. And then this thing would be absent half of her time. All those things that you might have expected do happen. Let's run that on. And so this renormalized energy here is depending on how you're cutting the manifold off. So maybe I should put a little tilde. Let's try and make it more canonical and we'll remove the tilde when that happens. Well, let's use the canonical things back. Canonical convectified metric, which is, I think that was mentioned before, it's determined by a metric in the boundary conformal class of metrics. That's all you need. This guy here... It would depend on it, but it doesn't depend on its details enough. This. This is conformally invariant and D is even and G plus is P E and the connection narbler A is putting the colours. Is I'll put a little A there, C C Y M Conforming compact yang mills, perhaps asymptotically with a sufficient border. You could put an A over here too, I guess. So this is relying on an evenness property, just as what you do for conquering Einstein structures. And we're not doing volumes. The boundary is the R dimension in your case. Yeah, just the same as for PA. That's correct. That's correct. But you're still saying the uh the the coefficient in front of the log is still a couple milligrams? It goes away. Goes away in that case. I could have put that into the form. There's another theorem that says that. Okay. That is true. Okay. Aren't equals anomaly.  There is a universal formula for the anomaly integrand, A? Well, this is the term in front of a log, that is this is the term in front of a log, that's right. And here That's right. And here, to write this formula, I need to keep volume compact. The way I've written this formula is so telescopic that it's next to useless to you, but it is actually very useful. Very useful. So you take the square of the curvature with respect to a compactified metric. This is the so-called Laplace or twisted Laplace-Robbin operator. I won't write it up or say it. This is some generalized degenerate Laplace in that I could talk more about. No, this is a holographic formula. This is something you compute in the interior, restrict to the boundary, and it gives you all the innovative integrals. And it's manifestly conformed. And it's manifestly conformally invariant is construction. Okay, that's part of it. And now I want to say more. And seven G plus AA. I'll give you a formula. There we go. I leave off all the indices, so you have to imagine what these mean. Everything is written with respect to some connection, A or B connection, and you can pick the fed metric G. You square that current to minus one half. Alright, take minus one-half, take the gradient, squared, or you could do it like this, I suppose of F, 6. See how intensor and this object. I'm just building scalars in all possible ways and then telling you the coefficients roughly. Gradient is the current, optimized curvature, W the file. W is vial, two curvatures looked into, Young-Mills curvatures looked into vial, and twice the cube of F. P, this is the obstruction in seven dimensions of the bulk. Well, this is the anomaly, this is the object you would have to vary actually to get the obstruction current that obstructs you s from solving the Yang-Mills I call it C C. The Yang mills are called CC, conforming compact Yang mills, equations, and there it is. Okay, moreover, specialize so D equals 6 again G plus P E The renormalized energy is the one computed by cutting off with respect to the canonical compactified metric is the integral over some local quantity. This is the bulk now, you integrate over the entire bulk. Here we've re-normalized something and we're writing down a fine. Something and we're writing down a finite expression just as in previous talk, where? The answer for E ran is that it's A. In seven dimensions. This formula. Write it down. So in seven dimensions, you integrate this along the six-dimensional boundary. In six dimensions, Boundary. In six dimensions, you integrate it over the six-dimensional bulk with the same formula. And that's a renormalized energy. Okay. Something good has happened. I've reached. That's the big theorem. And then the rest is saying as much as I possibly can about the proof. That will go. That will come. That will come. Yeah. The interesting The interesting part of the proof to talk about is this six-dimensional statement. Because this is a really non-trivial thing. This is picking up global data. That is certainly the most interesting object. I like the colour sink and white jenger. Finger, it's a game with the blocks. When I first looked at that CQY proof for anonymous volume and I put that paper next to the Anderson one, oh yeah, I understand Anderson, this one seems complicated. I had negative emotions. Then I understood that paper and I thought, oh, sick and white paper, that's really nice. But the thing that bothered me is a whole bunch of blocks, a whole bunch of ingredients, all the famous results we got. Of ingredients, all the famous results from conformal geometry get used, and you take any one of them away, and the whole thing crashes. But then you start to see this argument getting used in different places, and you realize even better, it's robust. And then you're sort of a bit in awe of it, and you're like, well, that's so that's the idea. And I'm just going to write down all the Yang-Mills analogues of the various pieces of the argument. And the first one, I think, is what Jeffrey. And the first one I think is what Jeffrey wanted is a Q-like object. Let's call it a Branson curvature curvature. This is not the Branson Q curvature. This is work with Rod and Tom did together on the Young-Mill system, but it's a Q-like On the Yang Mill system, but it's a Q-like object. And Pinderson, Slay, and Gold also have work in this direction. Is this quantity? J is. J is the trace of P, A, or I Q, that's Q. Scalar object, not conformally invariant, integrated conformally invariant, however, with interesting conformal transformation rules. Gives integral Q M second variant boundary of M is empty. That's proof. Proof is to conformally vary that object. We're in sixth dimension, so a factor of omega six is your friend here. These square brackets are my notation for doing a curl. So that's how, that's the conformal transformation of this Branson Goldway name mills title. You can integrate this, and you can integrate by parts, you can integrate by parts connection in general. But yeah, you've got Bianchi on your side, and then you can vanishes. If this hadn't been there, it would already vanish. And that parts of the unknown curvatures have no curls. Curvy things shouldn't be curly. So downgrade it to a remark. Integrate Q over M in the case of DM that has no boundary. It's the normal A. Hey, this is Q. Anomaly versus cute picture. The anomaly was a pointwise, there's a limmer. Pointwise conformally invariant. If Q wasn't, what's the difference? It's that, and that will be useful. The proof, it's sort of some fights and bucky type maneuvers, but it's just things like calculator. K to the CQY argument or A key is Q curvature and picking or trying to find a conformally compact metric with the right regularity that brings the Q curvature to zero. So a Q flat compactified metric. I've written down the words inhomogeneous Schrödinger, which seems to have nothing to do with that problem find G tilde compactified. Well, I've written a deal. Well, I've written a data. So that's going to be some defining function squared times g plus smooth enough. The sigma tilde might not be infinite. Should somehow be exactly right. Such that, I don't know, here, such that if you integrate Q of G tilde, you get nothing. You get nothing. You could try and point wise bring q tilde to zero, but that turns out to be too strong. Integrated to zero is enough. Now, if you gave the clock, I've already looked over two. Okay, here we go. Eventually, we'll get to some kind of inhomogeneous Schrödinger equation that we have to solve to find this BGQ flat compactified method. G Q flat compactified metric. But before doing that, I need to tell you something. For regular Q curvature, in the previous talk, there was a factorization result, or maybe it was for the... No, I guess it wasn't. Was there a factorization result for Q? We had some factorization result, maybe for GGMS. Anyway, this is the analog of that. If you're in six dimensions and your PE and your And your C C Y M, your connection Then the Q curvature with respect to the P E metric for the C C Y M connection is just the object that you want to re-normalize. And let's conformally rescale this. I'm going to write e to the 2f, I don't know quite why, e to the 6f. I've just exponentiated a capital omen I had before. Then this is the object you want to renormalize, thing that you can. thing that you can form and transform plus more some kind of a plus operator but it's twisted by the connection I'll write it down I guess acting on the length of F plus times F plus some kind of divergence it won't be important since it's a divergence of something. Divergence of something. So connections the same? Yeah. It's the connect. Let's imagine that you've solved that CCYM. Imagine it's like the conversion term is not important just because it's a lower order. We're going to. Yeah, I said I don't need Q to vanish point-wise, just integrated in that one. And that one, if you study it carefully, you'll go. So I'll break down formulae. At some point I need to just say words, I think, but I will write this down. This is this twisted. This is this twisted Laplacian. There's a dot here, I guess. If you know the formula for the Laplacians, this looks like it, but somehow it gets twisted by the connection or its curvature. So I should have said in the theorem that we were trying to prove, we do need. Theorem that we were trying to prove, we do need to assume this quantity never vanishes. Well, we don't want an everywhere-flat solution, probably, so it's not too strong. And maybe this could be relaxed. Does it never banish or does it batch everywhere? A well-studied operator is the Laplace operator on the Poincaré-Einstein manifold. Very well understood. There's a scattering theory behind it. It's known to be some kind of Schrodinger operator. You can think You can think about scattering is if you think about the operators, etc., etc. This operator starts off with that. And there's a mistake. Okay, so chair, I think I do need to. Yeah, I think I do need to perform the exit strategy. This is your Schrödinger operator. That's your wave function if you're into physics language. This is inhomogeneity on the left-hand side of the equation. You need to find f that makes that vanish. You need to appeal to scattering theory. You need the Prometheus method. You have to steal. Method. You have to steal fire from the gods. It's the work of Itseo, Melrose, Graham, Swordsky. And then there's Sar Bareto and Joshi. The point being is this is very well studied. This just adds a potential term, a short range potential term studied by Bareto and Joshi. You need to show that you can solve this problem to find this nice compactified metric. Then you need to study its regularity and To study its regularity and its asymptotics and check that it's just right. There are a few other ingredients that I need to say, although they are just versions of, they are things that appear in CQY. And then you are kind of done because you get that this is zero when integrated and you check the asymptotes of this F and you see that it knows about the renormalized energy plus Plus the anomaly expression that I showed you before. If you like, that's the Yang-Mills-Alexakis type piece. That would be okay to think about that that way. Oh, if I'd really ended, I'd have ended, to the bitter end, I'd have ended with two examples. One is the integral of phi L squared in six dimensions. That was in the previous talk. This method does get that result. Check. Another method is to. Check. Another tip is just to take a complex line bundle, then you are doing photons. You have a Maxwell system on hyperbolic space where you can write down explicit solutions for equal and then just check that the formula works. And that happens as well. I think I can be done. Thank you. No problem.
