So I'll talk about the particular aspect of my recent works with my beautiful set of collaborators kind of everywhere spread out in the world. Of course, I'm not going to actually cover all three papers. It's going to be a specific aspect of us here and there. I put a live slide, let's see how far we can actually get them. But that'll be touching both the hitching system aspect and the 3D duality aspect. Aspect and the 3D duality aspect, as Multiple asked me to give from the physical perspective how they link to one another. It's a clue on the contrast. So the title of today will be Finding Isomorphic Superconformal Field Theory. Don't worry if you don't understand superconformal field theory. I'll explain roughly on why I care about that as a particular set of theories. It's not so important to know the details of it per se. So, mostly the reason why I'm really interested in this is to, coming from the motivation of physics, to answer this question, which I won't be able to actually answer such a huge question today, but is when do two quantum field theory really describe the same physics? Meaning, let's go back to the original title, as I said to finding isomorphic some-part theories. Meaning, if the two Meaning, if the two theories are isomorphic, then can uniquely identify such a theory as a unique physical system. And if we can do such a thing, it'll make sense to consider a quantum field theory. And that would be the great way to actually explain the beautiful world that we live in. As our ultimate goal as a physicist, we're doing pretty bad at it, but we're going to do our best. And that's going to be where the things appear. So not where we actually live in. So now where we actually live in, but it'll be in the context of superconformal field theory, which actually describe an explicit physical system. So how would we a priori answer such a question if we are superhumans with every toolkit we have in the world? Well, the most obvious way to answer such a question would be if they have the same local operator spectrum and all endpoint coordination functions. Now, whatever supercomputer you have, that's not going to be an endpoint. Computer, you have that's not going to be answerable. It's not even disruptable, and all the known auto kits will fail very tragically. So, we can't actually answer this question, it's absolutely not tangible. In fact, I'm actually a little bit hiding something because if I'm putting a fixed background as a sub vacuum, this is not even enough. You have to consider extended objects like rules and lines as additional, all possible order loop correction of objects. Absolutely not possible to do. Now, let's do some of the cases that we are very familiar with where we can explicitly answer such a question. So, what would be a particular restricted setting that we can explicitly identify and meaningfully associate such a theory? Would be when we consider a TQFT. Easiest case that can come to our mind is trans seignment theory and therapy. I believe most of the people here have worked on transignment theory, so I don't need to really address what trans segment theory is. Transcendent theory is. So, transcendent theory is a TTFG, so it means fundamentally it has no local operators. But we have extended operators. The only thing we're allowed to have is a one-dimensional extended operator, which physicists will call loss and minus. Now, what does that really do? That's the only thing that we need to have. As remember from the previous slide, that we need to actually have correlation functions and all of them involving the extended. Them involving the extended operator, which is now called lessenoids. Can you compute them explicitly? Yes, otherwise, this would not be a restricted setting that could answer such a question. Now, what would that be? To compute the correlation functions of these Wilson lines, the Wooden has identified very nicely as a given particular representation of it, as a not because it's written, you can embed it, and that can give rise to a very nice path word setting the robot to path. Setting the rule out to path, and exactly looks like an option. When, let's do an example, that when g is an explicit s2, then the bottom line, although that's not okay, the correlation function is explicitly identical to the Jones polynomial. That was a beautiful paper, and that was fantastic. Now, when g is bigger than s u2, so that we have now s n bigger than 2, a correlation function can be then shown as this g humpling point. This G Humpley point polynomial. So Humphrey polynomial can be computed explicitly. Now I'm a little bit lying because this is only true if it's fundamental representation of them. If it's not fundamental representation on this closing one, then we'll need to consider colored Hompled polynomials. But we can compute them and consider all of them. And if they're identical, they are exactly the right theory to be identical. Meaning, this is explicitly the invariant that you're allowed to have. So for example, Allowed to have. So, for example, if we are considering two different groups, so G and G primaries, we'll say different groups, then the polynomials are attributably different. So the two different trends theories will be actually distinct. So you can have explicit all as a non-invariant, and that kind of finishes the whole story that we're about to have. Now, if we lived in a TQFD, that would be such a beautiful world. It doesn't really explain much of a physical system at all. At all. So let's do going to a slightly better theories where here we actually exhaustively could come up with it, but the important part, how we answer them, is maybe the thing that we should learn, is that we came up with invariants. Maybe one way to really approach this problem is what will be the minimal set of invariants in a restricted, more natural setting to apply such a technique. To apply such a technique, it would not be enough invariant, of course not, unless it's topological QFT. The whole point is, you're going beyond TQFT. So, I'm going to consider, as you heard from the title, superconformal field theory, just a particular type of a conformal field theory. Why would I care about it? Well, the conformal field theories are existing at the fixed point of the artifact between the two different quantum field theories, so it's kind of like this. Field very, so it's kind of like this. Under C of Ts. So we have additional conformal symmetry. So that makes things more tangible and computable, but at least they are not TQFTs. So it's more of a reasonable system. It appears naturally in condensed matter systems that are more applicable than what I work on. But it's really a more physical theory. Now, of course, physical means hard. It's a lot harder to deal with. If I could answer for all generic CFTs, I would love my life for it. CFTs, I would love my life for it, but I cannot do it for the day. But how would we have done it a priori to answer such a question? Well, instead of doing such a difficult task earlier, it's still impossible, but we could potentially have some form of conformal data through just two-point correlation and three-point correlations. And if you compute all that data possibly from the theory, we can actually answer such a question. And I started by saying that it's not 10. Started by saying that it's not tangible at all. So, then, what if we have some form of invariance to come up with and try to come up with such a minimal set to answer such a question? And in order to answer such a question, you're going to really use both algebraic and geometric toolkits today to answer such a question. And the physical way of saying that is we're going to use higher dimensional origins. So, I like examples. I'm a physicist. So, let's start with easy examples that we can really work with. Easy examples that we can really work with. So, N4 super young males is a great theory. We know explicit Lagrangian. Everything is exact, we can compute this. It's great. And I actually wrote in a clever way, so it's going to depend only one specified coupling, that's tau, to come classify coupling. And I wrote it in a way because this is a way how you're going to rheumatize it, to view it, to show that there are different bears that can be just identified in the same way. In the same way. So here is the question that we'll be able to answer by having that. Are the theories with SO2 kg and SO3 with now minus 1 over tau, are they the same theory? Well, let's say we are from like 80s and true particle physicist. Then one might say they have very different vector bottlene spectra, so in principle they might actually look like a different theory. Different theory. But this is why we live in 2023. We can actually answer this question and say that that's actually wrong. How do we do that? So one theory, how is really controlling the coupling? So that's at the weak coupling, the other one is at strong coupling and vice versa. So that's spec, and from a particle perspective, the spectrum of massive delta bosons and BPS monopoles are actually the same. And inter-particle forces also even look the same. So you then naturally think. The same, so you then naturally think that, oh, maybe it is really the same theory. How do we actually show that? We're going to prove this by using higher dimensions, as I was pointing out, to how to give this as an example. Our top-down perspectives generally give insights via geometrization. And this is how we're going to solve all the questions today. It's basically how we're going to really approach everything. And this is going to be the resulting 3D duality as well for today. As well for today. So, what's the philosophy here? We have a higher dimensional theory, so we have capital D dimensions. It's very important we're going to have a lower D dimension that's strictly smaller than the capital D, and have a compact manifold, or something that's non-compact, but here it's compact manifold. So, a particular way of answering this is things that's so hard to see here, like any pool scores supporting mills like those, it becomes more manifest by using this. Manifest by using this explicit compactifying space as an additional manifold. That's the capital D minus D dimensional manifold that what this will really characterize, which is what the invariance of that manifold is giving us as a theory. In fact, a good example then approaching here is the SL to Z duality. Really, you see the complex coupling. I put it in the form for a reason. That's complexified. It literally gives SL2Z. So from this So, from this perspective together, you can see that as coming from some 62,000 supercontrol filter, it's a black box for you guys. What it gives you is a particular algebra. This is going to be here. That gives us one single input there. And you're compactifying on T2. T2 is the one that's giving rise to SL2Z. That's the complex structure that's going to give rise to torus. And that's the one that's being identified. That's the one that's being identified to be manifestly seen as the coupling constant that gives rise to SL2Z. So, from this perspective, we can actually control SL2Z. So, weak coupling to strong coupling, everything is all manifest together. And this is how we really verify how we started with the two different theory. They're actually identical. It's because SL3 and SU2 are same gauge algebra. We don't actually need a group here. And that's the SL2C keeping right, says that complex coupling town. A coupling towel. Now, that would be already answering the easy question, and that was already clever. So, let's really try to use that philosophy to a more difficult question today, which led to the current title of superconformal field theory. In fact, I'm going to try to answer for the last set of super symmetries, that's n equals 2. And as the general philosophy goes, less symmetry, harder question. So, normal symmetry, which is So, no symmetry, which is a generic CFT, very difficult. So, I'm going to try to address the question then in the half amount of supersymmetry. So, there are literally half amount of superchargers that generating such a superconformal algebra, to be close. Now, I'm going to specialize a particular subset of such a theory that can come from two different 60 origins. One was a compactifying space from punctured Green and Surface, which I will first explain where that's coming from. So, this is famously in physics literature known as class S theory. And Ron is smart enough because Ron has definitely wrote a recently paper out last week on this theory. This is by Gayota and Gayoto Mornitsky. Unfortunately, Andy's not here, like he liked it. So, this is the one input that came up with gauge algebra. That's the 62 kilometers AFD, the black box. And where it's going on, the capital D minus small D dimensional. D minus small d dimensional in the middle manipul. That's the punctured Riemann sphere. This G is went through a math fraction, which is actually led to me to try to make sales today. That's the genus. That's the Lie algebra. And N is the amount of punctures you're allowed to have. And then that will be n amount of different punctures. These are two-dimensional two defects that you're allowed to have. So how do they really give rise to it? So this is where the So, this is where the Hitchin system really decorates to come in to give rise to class S theory. So, this punctured ma surface with this n number of punctures have to satisfy the Hitchin equation. So, this is the familiar Hitchin equation. I don't have to actually explain Hitchin' system today, which is wonderful. Everyone's an expert in this room. So, the spa is called Higgs, right? It can be actually poles at given marked points. It's nicely drawn on orange X's. It's definitely marked points. X's, it's definitely more points, and it becomes pools on this Riemann surface, so we call them punctures. The reasons why we call them punctures is that different kinds of pools lead to different type of punctures. So by just being into that, we can categorize what different types we're allowed to have. For the simplicity of today, I'm going to just look at the regular, the simplest puncture today. But actually, the story works for a lot of other irregular punctures as well. But you don't have to think about it today. So for today, this is the Thing. So for today, this is the only thing that we're going to look at. So it's going to be categorized as P over Z. That's the any simple element of G, and it's 1 over Z. So that's locally around the Z equals 0. That has to be the one that's satisfying, so it's very easy. It's something that we can actually have easy tangible computations with. So for here, the regular functors has a very nice quality, which is that they're parametrized by the nil-pook molar bits of G. So what I really resolved with is And what I really resolved with is we need to really cleverly deal with this data to understand this compactifying space that will give rise to a set of invariants. So from here, we're going to actually use explicit building blocks so that you can generate all different type of theories because we don't want to deal with actually n different number of punctures. So each puncture agreement surface has a pair of pens decomposition, as it's famously known, so that the nth I know, so that then every this Freeman punctured surface, I memorize CGN, it's always decomposable with now three punctured spheres and then gluing in together like that. So then the three punctured spheres are the building blocks, and because of this, the person came up with individual characterization. There are lots of tables that give properties of them. It's called tinker toy theories, because as a toy, it's the one that you can build a lot to hang out with. Block to hang out with. So then we have explicit non-gena zero, three functions, that's just three functions speed is how we're going to actually use with only three quotiment two data as an input, and additional input as a Lie algebra from 62,000 conflicts. Those are the only inputs you have for a given tinker toy theory. So that will be an easiest set of invariants. It's a minimal set that you can come up with, for maybe that's going to work for certain settings like we consider and this context. Like we consider in this context without Spark. So the first one is central charges called A and C. The iter used to 2D CFTs. The one that plays the role of C there is the one single central charges, A. A is the one that's tracking deepest freedom. So this is a bio tensor, and that's the Euler density. And we're just having a bad edge controlled by just those two. Now, if you're familiar with more number of vector multiplets and hypermultiplets, they're just linear relations to one another. To one another. It's literally just identical information you're allowed to have. And these two control entirely for a conformal symmetry that we manifest. This conformal symmetry is basically trying to just give way this equation. And that will be true whether you have supersymmetry or no supersymmetry. Now, we have additional global symmetry group that in physicists we call flavor symmetry to distinguish the one that's coming from super conformal algebra. And that one comes with how much of the That one comes with how much of the global symmetry group is really acting with, which call it levels, or the flavor central charges, that just says Ki. So these are the, we have three invariants as an input. In addition to that, we have cyber-witten curves that we can analyze nicely, and that gives rise a cool branch operator spectrum. This we can always compute for class S theory, nicely for any setup. Now, this is the one that I'm going to really review here. You will need additionally. Here, you would need additionally Shurindax and Holiday with index. The reason is because naturally you would think there's cool branch and Higgs branch. Higgs branch opera spectrum to be comfortable exactly is a very, very difficult trick. If you hear the Lagrangian theory, yes, but they didn't say it's a Lagrangian theory. It would be generically non-Lagrangian theory, strongly coupled, and usually you won't be able to actually compute them. So these two would be much easier things of computer. And I'm going to now give an easy To know, they're the easiest way to define them. So, what is the sure index and how little index? But generally, when you say index, it's exactly the identical to partition function graded with minus 1 to the f. Because of minus 1 to the f, we can actually compute them. That's the whole point of considering the index. Of course, it's different, but they are identical for BPS contents. So, the other short multiplets are exactly identical. And these two are Identical. And these were specific regimes of it. If you're used to vertex upper algebra, sure index is the one given by it. But I'm not going to do that today, but that itself will take a whole hour. This is the easiest way to actually compute them. So for a given Tinker toy theory, right, you only had the algebra and then there's three quote-dimension two punctures. And for them, and the punctures are then labeled by the quote-words. So that, or if you're more familiar with So, that, or if you're more familiar with that, you can just compute by the embeddings of SG2 to this G up to X and up to a conjugation. Then, both two can be just given as this linear combination, so that it has a series decomposition. This is the character, so it's representing these characters, and this is the one that's associated on top of it. So, first, it comes with a summation over this. So, that's the sum over highest weights, labeling the finite-dimensional irreducible representation of G. Irreducible representation of gene. And if you notice, they share the same form and it's based on the AI. Those are the flavors you get studied. So that's the one that's controlling the global symmetry I was telling you about. And it's associated to the number which puncture it is. And determined by the composition of the fundamental representation under this embedding of SU2 that I was just telling you about, based on three quadration departures. Could mention the punctures, and that's also going to give you the remainders, and those are the remainder of the trivial puncture guesses. So, that's going to be everything in the parentheses, the labels are all given by it. Now, then you should ask, what is the K? KS and KH are. Right? The blue one. So, those are determined by the now restriction of the add-doint representation to this embedding. So, we can have dj. So that we can have the J component that's giving us the SU2 part going on here, and the remaining part is the R part. So that this has to be reducible, and since this can be decomposed with like SU2 plus or any more other things, that's reducible in practice. Oh, those are the ones that you can has a parameter that labels such, like so SU2 will have a label. That's the figures that you can have as it's You're guessing that you can't have as a determinant. So it's like the Q as a series of decomposition that you're allowed to have. Right. So upon the decomposition, this is the easy speed rate. That's platistic exponential. So it looks very simple elements of two sums. Of course, in practice, you have to compute them as order by order. That's very difficult to compute for most spirits you're allowed to have. But nevertheless, you can have this explicit formula so you can. Can have this explicit formal, so you can compute it in principle. In fact, this is these indices, are the first time that I made me use cluster for the first time in my life to compute them. That's above the degree 6. Now, this one is clearly composing out with respect to all the character decomposition. What is the one corresponding here for the Hall Littlewood index? That's called Hall-Littlewood program. That's called How Little Wood polynomials, and that one is weighted by this basically the wild root that you're allowed to have, and you're producting all of the perspective the positive roots. So it kind of looks exactly like a composite version as a new different bases you're allowed to have, that is not the character. So with that together, you have now two different index explicit formula, I can just readily plug in and compute them. That's beautiful. That's beautiful. But you should probably ask, but they're not casey branch, I got that, but what does that really mean physically? Because it was coming from physics origin. So these two are actually closed sectors of given deer. So let's say Higgs branch is having a particular type called V hat. Short index counts a little more than V hat, and Holo counts a little bit less than V hat. But these two are closed sector, which are very special about it. It's a particular limit that you're allowed to have these decompositions. You're allowed to have these decomposition with many, many, many help of years of physicists. And that's because the full entire index is often not computable. It's a more computable, closed vector quantity you're allowed to have. If you're familiar with physics language, that one gives the E hat, C hat, and D, and that one goes E hat and D temple. Higgs branches only giving E hat. No. Wow. So if you remember, this is how. So if you remember, this is how we started with it. We threw the invariant, then naturally what you would have thought is, that's already very difficult, but it's computable quantity, blah blah, so maybe we can actually remotely identify them. I'll give you bad news first. This will not work in high-ranked theories. But the whole point is that in the low ranks, these data, or even the subset of them, suffice to uniquely characterize a theory. And as I just probably highlighted very nicely, Highlighted very nicely, very difficult to compute. So, if you can remove this and put it to something extensible, that would be even more ideal. So, let's look into what are the explicit restrictions that we want. We have to even remove that condition and then make it as a conjecture. If such true, this would be always identical. Especially that we can only compute the order series, not the closed-one formula. You can never actually know if it would be really the same, even though it looks t. The same, even though it looks tau to the 10th order, the same, you never know, be tau to 170 order the same. Right? So I like examples once again. So let's start with a very, very, the easiest example you'll see in physics. Just call it Minahan-Namashansky theory. For string theory, this is one of the first things you learn in like the first year of grad school. Ah, this is a rank one, as you get it. That's easy. Rank one, n equals to superconform, Philip here. The easiest coulomb grant to just. The easiest Coulomb branch generator, and then this is the central charge. That's the one that we needed. So, with just that little data, they're unique. In fact, this is the one that's satisfying as the Inahen-Mushans meteor. This was recently shown, like two years ago. So, there's like a multitude of distinct realizations of this particular theory, and I said you can write in literally so many different ways. And what we know by that is whatever you write in a different puncture set with many different data. Puncture set of many different data, they're actually isomorphic, and they're exactly the same unique column field theory. Now, for higher-ranked cases, I told you they're not sufficient, but the whole point that I was giving you as philosophy is that we're going to use higher-dimensional perspective, and we're going to bypass all this so that we can answer easily by using the compactifying space as an analysis. So, this is the other slide that I was starting by. I'm going to look into. site that I was starting by I'm going to look into actually the subset of beers that has not only the input because it classes from 62 comma zero but also different site that has 61 comma zero it means that it has half amount of supersymmetry. The reason why I'm using this is this, I can cook up a model from algebraic curves. So it makes it easy to actually compute and build an explicit baseball. So where it comes with it is, remember that the n equals four separating mils was d at t2. was via T2. Third Melville was something very similar. So just have a T2 from this theory up to 61 comma 0. So n equals 4 superior miles was doubly specied, so it was 2,000, but it's half involved. And these are called minimal conformal years, and then as the g, g to give rise to that g is this the algebra g. It's exactly the one that's coming from it. And physics right, this is realized as the world volume, the string theory type of uh construction. Type of construction program in the orbital singularity of C2 mod gamma and which we'll not use that today. So that's just for the record that you can see where it's coming from as type 2B based context, whereas earlier classes you can see from type 2A based context. Remember, mirror symmetry is coming from two different areas of origin. Now, this one can come from, and this is where the geometric engineering really comes to. This is a smooth tea tree, not going to really add anything onto it. On to it. Then, this is how we're going to get by an elliptically fiber non-compact collabio 3 tool. If it's compact collabia, you're never going to get conformality because you have a scale. So you have to absolutely have non-compact. Now, on its own, of course, would be wild. And that would be not really computable, but not all of them will give rise to this. The superconformality of this restricts several conditions on top that we are allowed to have as curves. In fact, the curves have to be negative. In fact, the curves have to be negative definite intersection matrix. Each curve would be one. And the singular fiber above the points where any two curves intersect has to be absolutely minimal. And then I'm going to then come from two different perspectives. So this was the one that's given the class S, the one that was coming from the data G, giving rise to the punctured human surface cupum. This is what I just flashed you that you're going to build with the elliptic fibered Columbia. Fibered columbia three-fold down, and then the top going to be on top of the T2. Then they gave rise to the same theory, or the only theories they're going to consider today. Because they're going to use not just this data, but also this data as well to just answer the system. So this side of the 60 perspective that's going to give us just a reveal when they're really isomorphic or not. And this context when they're the same are only shown on this recent work. Shown in this recent works with three different things. And for the H-Brench flow, we worked it out that coming from this H-Brench flow and the H-Brench flow, so the RP flow that we're allowed to have is given by when you have this partially closed. So this is smaller than this. You can have that flow always, then it corresponds to same one here. And they'll be explicitly once this is isomorphic, their flow is explicitly isomorphic together, as long as this is exactly the same input. Exactly the same input one another, and we could explicitly write that for all ADE type of gene. So, with this context, then what it really sufficed to have is then show everything from this perspective is identical, then this is always identical. Just a philosophy of how we're going to actually do. Alright, so then I should ask, how is a 4D invariant? If I'm going to answer by using the 61. Answer by using the 61 comma 0, there must be a huge benefit by doing so. The reason is here we have a very unique set of invariants that's already known and that'll characterize entirely. In fact, the anomaly polynomial is the one that's giving us from the gauge bundle structure, number 60, is uniquely classifying everything. Look at it, that's just turn numbers and quantry eigen numbers. That's all we're allowed to have. And that's compositing all possible degrees, and that's the whole thing. Possible degrees, and that's the polynomial. But just all the alpha, beta, gamma, those are the coefficients, and what it really resorts to is finding that attribute. And from there, we also need the total symmetry that's being identically done. Remember, the g, g was identical to the algebra that corresponds with g. So we need that information. And we're not going to address this today, but now we are allowed to also have Zn, type of all discrete, type of global symmetric loop as well, which Global symmetric loop as well, which can be just uniquely determined altogether. Now, that looks like a lot of data that you should complain. You promised me that I will give you a minimal set of invariants. That's a little too much. Absolutely correct. In fact, entire thing was going to be replaced by the curve configuration. The elliptic curves that are going to build one another is going to be entirely giving you it, and that's the only thing I need to know to uniquely specify for those 61 comma zero beer. 61 km there for the given interest. Now you can argue, well, I want to have a very complicated theory with additional oriented faults. Sorry, you're not going to do that today. You can sometimes answer those questions too, but I believe in easier parts first. So let me highlight that first. And in fact, all these information will be included in there. I'm not going to focus on this today, because this one's a lot more subtle. I'm going to just focus on the other two parts, where we do not have the disconnect today. Have to disconnect you. But actually, when you add it, it'll actually all work too. So then we should understand how we're going to build that curved configuration. What do you mean by curved configuration? So if you remember, I was telling you the F theory on elliptically fibered Columbia theory, and this data entirely specified the 6D theory. And what do I mean by that? So individual curves have negative definite in the social matrix, and where I was also telling you the singular. Is also telling you the singular fiber of both of the points, where any two distinct curved intersect is minimal. Now, individual curve is P1, so you have compact curves in the base of the fibration. And individual, each of the curves is a singular fiber. So we can put algebra over it to make it singular. And you're going to consider that to be possibly doing it for the algebra of A, B, C, D, E, F, G. All the whole time. So then, what it really gives you is that. So then what it really gives you is that we have configuration of P1s as a curved configuration and that uniquely specify everything. I'm not going to actually tell you today, because it's going to take several hours, how you can get the flavor algebra and all this global group and every information can come out, how that matches an anomaly polynomial. If you're interested, I can tell you the detail about it. But this is already all done by my collaborators. So then what it suffices is that we need to just build a base of this minimal elliptic vibration. Of this minimal elliptic vibration, and that will be sufficing enough, and that's the only invariant that we need to have. And because we already proved that the Higgs branch of 6t1,0 and the Higgs branch of 4D of our class of interest is explicitly identical, we just show it here on everything, then it just shows the 4D, this is also the same class of quantum field theory. Now that's fascinating. So how do you actually then do these curved configurations? This is the technical slide of the day. This is the technical slide of the day. I know it's a lot of information. Just take it as a block box if you don't want to know. But these are the building blocks we're allowed to have as curved configuration. And we can glue them with E strings that's given us this curved configuration of rank Q. So if it's rank one, just a minus one curve. And all these are just minus of the degree. So this is minus degree, two curve, minus three curve, and minus two curve, and they're next to each other, meaning that intersects. Each other meaning that intersects. And if the algebra is over top of it, that means, like, for example, this one, minus two curve is a singular curve because that has a SU2 algebra over it. So that we can build in together like this. So everything composited needs absolutely this rank Q E string. And Q have restrictions. If both left and right are gluten, or just the right is glued in, then you're allowed to have either Then you're allowed to have either rank one or rank two only. These are the embeddings specified with it. Now only let this wood, so it ends with the E string, Siq. Then you can have arbitrary Q's. So you can just end this with it, which makes sense because Longzone is a sensible herb configuration. Sometimes it naturally enhances for this human theory, but it happens extremely rarely. We're not going to really focus. We're not going to really focus on each other, but we can always know when the happiness is. Could you try to connect this remotely with geometry? These are building blocks of elliptic vibrations. We're building a decorative base. What dimension? Oh, this is the... The base is complex two-dimensional with the decimal fibers. We're building threefold elliptically fibers of surfaces. Base is not a pressure. Base is not base is not compact, the fibers output. Yes. Fibers are absolutely compact. So because the curves are compact curves, as I was flashing you, aren't they? They're compact curves. The base of the fibers. This is how you're building the base. The complex two-dimensional base together. So each of these is a particular example of a separation of a non-compatible base, and then you could all to get a compact base? Yes. These are the only ones that are allowed to have to build right to 61,000 supercontrol field here. You won't come as your superconformal field area to close the algebra. But you need theory in superconformality districts. As long as if you add orientifold and stuff, yes, it's very comfortable here. But if you don't have any orientable, this is complete. And the Higgs flow, right? We were talking about this milk-wooden puncture as a partial closure to give y1 to a sub smaller y1 tilt. How do we do that? There are three different ways to categorize. There are three different ways to categorize it from the configuration. You literally get the smaller algebra in, so one way. Or I like to call this vanishing minus one curve. So you have a minus one curve blue. This is a rank one E string. Briggs minus one and how many minus twos that you're allowed to have here. So if it's rank one, just minus one. So when that happens, it reduces the degrees in both, and I reduce g to g prime. I reduce g to g prime and h to a prime just subsets. Or you can do it on only one side. Or sometimes E string splittings happen, meaning you have this E string, right one, and you can have the split go left and one another. These three are the only ones that you're really allowed to have to provide all the Higgs code. Alright good. Now, you might say, you're asking me for so much granted to leave me entirely. Believe me entirely. I would love to explain you the whole detail. I do, but that's going to take five hours at least. So let's not do that. And you're going to use that to actually then derive and how you're going to answer certain questions as first configuration as the unique invariant. Now, but then what are the specific pairs that we're going to look at? Remember, we're determining when two PFTs are isomorphic. So the pairs of class S theories that are going to restrict our residents. Class S theories that you're going to restrict over, the genus of the Riemann surface is the same from class S description. 62 known as your origin, so the V algebra that decorates over it is the same. And all but two of the end punctures are the same. So I like pictures because I can actually see it visually. So this is what I mean. So you're considering these two theories. See that only these two polymers are different, so with the near, with the prime, and all the rest are exactly the same. And all the rest are exactly identical. Genus is the same, number of puncture is the same, this here, so the AWG is identical. So, really, the only input difference is just this O1O2 into O1 prime O2 prime. Now, that's a little too much. Remember, we needed to have some restrictions that we already knew from conventional invariants. Some of them, it's easy to know. So, we need to consider when their central chart is order safe. Central chart is what we say. The global symmetry algebras and the levels, like the ki's that you saw, that has to be the same. The Coulomb branched dimension is easy to compute, so we can compute them. Hex branched dimension, that's very easy to compute. So these are super easy things to compute in comparison to our very difficult index and operator spectrum. So these are the only ones that are going to really restrict. On top of one more thing. So for any of these, So, for any of these classmates theories, the complex structure moduli of the puncture emanal surface parametrize exactly marginal deformation of the supervisible field theory. So, we can take the degeneration limit. So that what it really happens is that when we have the original theory, you can decompose like this. Really gluing out. So, they are exactly the same as what we have seen as here. Now Now, then it reduces down to this. All the tail is exactly identical, so we don't have to worry about it. We can just compare this two. Just very puncture spheres. And remember, Tinker Toy theories, we have a lot of great handles on them. So Regis down to just this. And remember, we want to actually keep the flavor symmetry identical, so the global symmetry has to be the same. So the suitable pairs that we're allowed to really have, to have same conventional variants, requires. To have a contained conventional invariance, require that f of O1 plus O2 prime, O2 is identical to f of O1 prime and F of O2 prime. Another way of writing is just this. So if you put them together, that this and this is exactly the same, meaning the same way. So then they will all have the same conventional invariant. This has been shown by my collaborators. They actually computed everything on the computer. It's quite remarkable. They have like a full category. You can actually go through JACT to website. You actually go to JACT to website, you can play with the full result. It's a degree, so you go to website and click into literally all parts of the computer data, and you can see that it's fascinating. So, but you might also say, you don't know when they're really sufficient to know that when they're identical by just looking at Shure index because it's going to be only computable to like maximum 10, or even if you've run the cluster for two weeks. So, we're going to now use a 60. So, we're going to now use the 60 uplift. So, 61 whether the curved configuration is going to now answer you this question. So, individually, on T2, these are the ones that's coming from the F-theory on non-compact collabia three-fold analytically fibered. And these are the two cases. So, remember, the alpha remain the same. And these are the data that we need to possess. And the number of functors are identical. Of pumpers are identical. And n minus 2, because we only left them 2. Because all the rest were identical, if you remember. In fact, in order to do that, we just put them as n minus 2 simple functors from the original this functor data, which is identical, because simple means that's the functor associated to the sub-regular nilpot multiplayer. Or you can take the closure, it'll have the minimal dimension that you're associated to. That's identical. So then we can have this explicitly. Have this explicitly computed to be what type of curve configuration you're allowed to have. So then, when do the interacting sectors of this XT theory, which is the curved configurations, are identical as what every leader wants to answer to determine the original this to be identical. So then, as I was telling you, high ranked these really don't work. So, we're going to only do when n is small. Small. And this is how it looks like. This is actually another reason why I ended up using slides. I didn't want to write this and make mistakes. I'm not really important. So remember, these are the curves that intersect one another and can support ultrasound, as singular fibers. And if you look at this and this and this, they clearly look different. Of course, they're different theories in general. They do not match, right? And that makes sense. As I said, high end may not match, but then it's large. Large, but n is large. Now, when you put red n equals 4, it's low enough, right? For now, as you can see, this one on the left side looks like this, on the right side looks like this. Don't they look exactly identical for you? The curve configuration is really identical, and you can compute and analyze what that matches as between the height flow of the curves, and then to the orbit. You can all do that, and that would be exactly the same. Can all do that, and that would be exactly the type. And this is well a Carter notation. I know it's a terrible notation, but it's only consistent to have that we can actually categorize it. So this tensor branch descriptions explicitly mentions 16. How fantastic! So we can determine they are isomorphic. Now, just to enlighten you, if you notice there is a Z2 automorphism, diagram at level little one another. In fact, In fact, we can actually associate them from core particle physics computation that this is the one that's giving you the two different Higgs things as a red vacuum. And this 2, this phi and phi prime as a vacuum, that you're taking, is literally where the Z2 automorphism really acts. In fact, remember, it goes down to 4D description, and these are the theories that we will get. It's a class S description, right? Three punctured spheres. Punctured spheres. So recall that all the Higgs flows are exactly identical and isomorphic from 60 to 40. So then because of this, we show that these two 40 periods are isomorphic and that all Higgs flows are all isomorphic. Isn't that fantastic? So we exhaustively worked out for type E7E7, because we believe in examples, it needs to work, even though, you know, the formation notes abstractly all works in sound. Frankly, all words in sound. This is n equals 3. That's all n equals 4. That's all the H12 that you can do. You can easily see how that comes from. If you know, it has the Z2 isomorphism every time it goes down there when that happens. So Z2 automorphism. So whenever there's the identical theories that lead into them from two different distinct theories, we always find the Z2 automorphism that we find. That's n equals 5, 6, and 7. That's all we are allowed to have. So let's summarize how we answered this as a lot. So this is how we exhaustively worked out E7, E7, but of course, we've tried some A and D cases just to be saying that it does work. But that was already so difficult, so we didn't go beyond to compute all of them. But we just checked that it sounded really works. So we showed that this methodology actually works for all sorts of different types of AD. All sorts of different types of ADE, and also computed for some exhaustive other cases as well. So, this is the overall methodology that we act. So, you had the question, when would this two different classes theory behave similar? Class S meant, it comes from this two different Riemann poctor surface, where the Hitchin system is well supported, and that describes with the HQ. And they can have the T2 coming from this other origin that was uniquely given by a curve. It was uniquely given by a curved configuration as the invariant. And it always comes from another H flow from here to there. So the remember three different types of flowing the H flow from the curved configuration. And you found that there's always Z2 automorphism between the two and a lead to these two theories that are exposed to isomorphic for low enough n. And this is how you really got all of them. Then naturally, a conjecture that happens. If you notice, we didn't compute. That happens. If you notice, we didn't compute the share index or how little it worked. In fact, my collaborator is super into computing them, called Jacques Dissler, and added his student to compute computable order up to like five, six, seven orders, depending on different theory, to have to check that they're all isomorphic in that way as well, and it was. But what that means is that the sure index and the literature index, it's extremely difficult to compute, and we currently don't know how to compute all the closed form formula, would be a Closed form formula would be always isomorphic between the two theories because they're isomorphic theories from the 60 unique curve configurations and all their H scrolls are identical as well. Now, if you remember, I worked in the subset of theories that can admit 61,000 description that gives the curve configuration. Now, not all for the n equals 2 theory we can write with a 61 comma 0 description, so there would be the natural. From a zero description, so there would be the naturally set of theories that you should ask: how would we know them if they don't have the curved configuration as its origin? So the other this generic class S theory. But we learned one thing, that we had required a Z2 automorphism. And then we can expect that that thing needs to be also a right type of Z2 automorphism is what we should really look for in 4D context as well. So this is a particular example that does not have the 681. Does not have the 61.0 output, so it doesn't have curved configuration. And the sponsor can be chosen among these that are already in quite the explosive and any of four of them will suffice and they look like they have maybe some form of correctness into amorphism. But we never know. Actually, that would be sufficing, right? We don't know that. We computed the Schur index. To compute this, I learned to use cluster for the first time in my life. For the first time in my life. This took three weeks on the cluster at Caltech, and this is what it happened. From both faces, it looks identical up to the tau to the 10th order. So it looks like it might be actually the same theory, but I don't know. It can be different in the other higher order. We don't know. But we don't have a method to actually prove it either because we don't have 6D uplift. But we found that by just looking at guessworking solids into automorphism group to exist with one another. So it gives like a big Leather. So it gives like a big conjecture that maybe if there has a correct Z2 automorphism, then maybe these two theories are just identical and maybe you should just search for that and that would be sufficing them to be the case, which is a stronger conjecture. I wouldn't hold my life for it, whereas the previous one I would have. That's the main difference between the two. Now, these curve configurations are super powerful, right? Those are the ways that we have to prove. Those are the ways that we have to prove that it was identical, isomorphic to one another, it was weak continuation. It gives a huge mileage actually that goes beyond. That these new 61,000 perspectives will actually re-release certain 3D dualities, 3D simple epidemicualities, very explicitly. So let's see how we can actually see them. So this is the theory that I'm going to describe as this is the Higgs branch of rank N, capital N, SUK, SUK, SUK, SUK control matter, remember? Because it was the G, G. That's just the algebra, SUKK is in it. And H can be done from both left and right, so I can have OL and OR. I'm fixing the notation the same way because I've used O1 and O2. Now, this is the same description in the 3D quarter as a cool branch of this. It's the proposal by Hanani and Zafurir from a few years ago. That's very specific. Years ago. That's a very specific example for the theory symplectic duality that looks like maybe it could actually be true, right? It doesn't sound so crazy like some of the other more generic ones. So now this is the 3D cover. So these two are the 3D theories defined by Gairo-Witten sense. So this is taken as trivial, so that's just one to the K as the nil-button over it. So we can just omit it. And that's the nil-button overit that we're taking as real. So these are the 3D theories. So these are the 3D theories that you have, and then it's just gauged 111. So for example, then this can be just concretely written by just this one line as a proposal. Higgs of this theory is the colon of this theory. And that loop means there's an adjoint hyper of SUP. So we actually, using this 60 perspective, derived, tweet, true, you're literally writing this very, very, very long. Literally writing this very, very, very long draft. Hopefully, it'll be out soon. It's apparently more than 100 pages, so we're trying to shorten it really hard. So, what we argue is that this proposal is consistent for the Higgs-French RV flows we construct specifically from 60 perspective. In fact, that will hold for not just type D and but also type A, but I'm not going to talk about it today because you have to modify this proposal by much more difficult things because it's autosymplectic SPL. So, what would be a good example from this proposal? Let's consider then H branches, I don't know, my bad, of one of our isomorphic pairs of the 60 from this 30 perspective. So let's call this a theory A and this is theory. So if you notice that there's both SU6, remember we keep the same rank, the same age out, right? Same age group. And this is two different pairs of. Pairs of Nilpoten orbits. So these are the OL and OR, OL and OR here. And the Nilpoten orbits are in one-to-one correspondence to integer partition. So I wrote it in this format, which is different from the biological colour label that I was using earlier. This is more enlightening. So it's integer partition. So 3 plus 1 times 3 is 6, which has to be 6. And this also, 3 times 2 is 6, which has to be 6. That's an example. You can see it a little bit. That's an example. You can see it'll also work out here as well. Now, they are the same for capital N equals 5. So, let's see that, because I mean, that's a pretty bold claim. So let's, then we can find what we're really finding is that the height front of the Coulomb will be this, and the heights of the Coulomb will be this following the proposal, which you write it explicitly. And that n is going here. So for arbitrary n, you can tell that they'll be extremely different. When n is When n is 5, they're the same. But you cannot see that at all. Because in order to show that, we need to use the full language of this Gairo-Witten, right, the same Gairo-Witten, what you're really allowed to do in this limiting context. So why? So let's remember this was the case. So when n is equal to 5, something very special happens. So this node here, now this is U6, U3, U3. says U6, U3, U3. It's like it's all U because it's 3 online 4D. This node becomes ugly in the sense of Gaioda Wood. So what is that? Physicists are funny sometimes, so we call them good, bad, and ugly. It's invented by Gaiotwood, but please don't blame me for it. So for that, we compute something called the balance of a. So if you have a UK node, the K would be the number here, is defined as minus 2 times a K. This minus 2 times a k plus the sum of neighboring notes. And if this balance, which is strict integer, is non-negative, it's considered good. Good means the Coulomb branch is particularly simple. More explicit, what it means is that the Coulomb branch is the space of dress model operators of the quiver. So it's the equivalent of when that kadima actually defines it. So when this is explicitly minus one, it's a little bit different from. This one is a little different from otherwise, and that's called ugly. So, ugly means that Colon branch now is not so simple. It has a slight subtlety because some of the molecule operators actually decouple. In fact, what happens, which is the biggest portion of this guy or Witten theory, is that the Coulomb branch is basically the product of good interacting quiver and, in addition to it, a free Coulomb branch, which is just a number of copies of people. Which is just number of copies of each quaternionic space. And this, to get this, and that looks absolutely non-trivial, is called the dualization algorithm, which is what we need to use to actually show this, because remember, it becomes ugly. So what we really need to do is we have to now look at this and then see how that works. Very simple. I'll highlight it. And just before doing that, this is bad. We actually work with some of the bad theories here, and 60 perspective naturally gives it. Don't forget, 60. Naturally, gives it. Don't forget, 6T never needed this notation. So, whatever 6T uplift exists, all of those of course do exist. We can just answer them without demonstrates. But, nevertheless, bad things just become a mess, so I'm not going to really explain. So how does the then dualization algorithm really work to show that theory A and B actually then matches up with the same Coulomb branch of the same quiver? So remember, it's ugly. So let's compute the balance of this U6 node. u6 node. That's minus 2 times 6 plus 3 plus 3 plus n. And you can do the repeat the same. And that is identically minus 1 if this is 5. Then the dualization algorithm is easiest way to write them is replace uk with uk minus 1 and add a free specific hyper. That's the easiest way to write it. So let's do it. This was the ugly note. So it becomes Note, so it becomes came as what? So it becomes 5. And then we added a twist of the typewriter. Now, if you look here, this become ugly because that's 3. So minus 2 times 3 is minus 6, plus 5 is minus 1. So we do it again. So this become 2, and additional twisted hyper comes up. Now, all know this could, so we stop here. So let's do the same for the other side. So same has an issue here, as you can tell. Same has an issue here, as you can tell. Remember, it was ugly. You apply it, and then this node becomes ugly, apply it again. Then we stop because now all the nodes are good. So if you look here, aren't they, oh wait, that should be five, oh my god. Aren't they exactly identical? So this is how you know from the dualization algorithm and doing all this protocol together to know that they are actually the same theory. So in turn, the Higgs branch. Theory, so in turn, the Higgs branch of the interacting part of B and the interacting part of A, throw it together, exactly identical to this, so thus they're all the same. That's a nice proposal as an example, but I picked this theory because we could actually use that from a 60 perspective. In fact, we get exactly this from a 60 perspective. Otherwise, I wouldn't have highlighted this. In fact, we actually said more than this from the 60. It really gives you a huge mileage. We don't have to do any of this. We don't have to do any of this. I mean, good, bad, and whatever. We don't have to care about any of this. Tixty says that the sensor branch of the interacting sector of the both theory is just simply this, which is identical. So we're done with them. And that's exactly, we can write it down as a class S description, because remember these are the shared theories, and that's this. And let's call that a theory C. Let's write that as a theory cover, and that's exactly just this. So then, we know without any of the dual license algorithms, Without any of the dualizing algorithm or anything, just looking at the curved configuration and knowing what that then results into, which is all done by our 6D explicit paradigm. We get the same entire quiver without doing any of the difficult trigger whatsoever. In fact, this is not like requiring any improving beyond because we just do everything from this. So, bullet proof, just done from this curved configuration, and exactly the same. So, the 60 mileage really gets you afar. This is a very good. It really gets you afar. This is a very good example that I want to discuss. But this works for all the pairs that you saw, like all the exhaustive lists for anything that admits 60 explicit realization, the class has context. And as long as they're the same, it will actually give you exactly this. So a little more extra, because you do a little bit better. Sometimes we have a bad routine age notes, and that's how things become an absolute mess. So this is way more subtle than other. This is way more subtle than other good or ugly things involving type of cases. And there's many different ways that physicists came over the tune to lies. In fact, this came, I think, this month, if I remember correctly. This came also this year. And that one came two years ago. And they all differ. They propose something different because they differ by the different points of the modules based they toolize. So then the question is: what would 60 So then the question is, what would 60 perspective really tell us? Interestingly, our 60 perspective matches with H2, and this one was not doing so much, and this one does a lot more. That's actually a single eye. I don't know how that happened. And this came out, as I told you this month, it literally matches entirely with this particular approach. And I was talking to the authors here and they're very fascinated by the fact that you could actually just do this. And it really gives the rise to the same thing. Rise to the same things that they come up with for the bad theory, which does it for the limited cases of bad theories, but of course, as long as 60 upwards exist, it doesn't care what the bad, so it probably approaches beyond set of bad functors here. But of course, this works for generic all of class S theories with a different set of restrictions of being bad theory. So it complements one another as an approach, so we can one to learn another. But the powerful trick here is that we really just built everything as the base. Built everything as the base, and we didn't have to hand away anything to come up with it. Thank you for listening. I hope you enjoyed it, and I think I have just finished the one hour. Also, I guess dinner time. Do I click anything to and we have another we have time for discussion later on, right? So we can take more questions from Market without the point. Thank you, Maudi. Thank you. I can quite compare the idea. Now I do need to this has to be sort of external.  Oh, you don't have to say that.  Are classified by something that are just and there is actually saying that the same pattern is higher if you allow more taxpayers and data and the truth if we have two hundred and fifty. So some people still say that even though you're in some cover so I feel about the one I think. That was like a little bit of a drink. It was incredible, though. I'm not using my thing. Are they? Am I playing for rainbows or something? No. Ah, so many. Well, no, do you went there once in the space? Well no, you let their ones down. My goal for this year. To learn them. To learn these papers. I didn't have to do it. I tried to do it. Five years ago, something like that, and at some point you say, okay, categorical machine learning is still inside.  But yeah, it might just be different like that. I mean, do you need to consider people that are talking about the market? What is that direct? Not just equality, also inequality. The problem is that the line is from the point. The line is the same as minus points. The tweet is just a composed line as of one semi-axis with another semi-axis and a point, and then you do this is equal to this, blah blah blah blah, and then you solve the question. Marina, Angel. Let's go for the hashtag as well. I was about to say first of the project. Last time closing the words, so now I'm very much happy. It's last time I have a lot of work. I watch my work. Very much happy. I have a lot of people. I have four tap I usually
