Well, I'll start it. So, first, I'd like to thank the organizers for inviting me to speak. It's very unfortunate that I'm not able to be there in person. I, you know, various things have conspired against me. So, yeah, so I'd like to thank them for allowing me to speak. And also for, you know, I guess speaking on a topic that I don't often get to speak about and a topic that I have lots of questions about. So hopefully, you know, this leads to possibly good discussion. To possibly good discussion later in the day today. So, yeah, so I'm going to talk about the cohomology of log symplectic pairs. So, everything that I'm going to talk about is going to be in terms of sort of algebraic geometry. It's going to be over complex numbers. So, you know, keep, I guess, maybe keep that in mind. Okay, so just as a brief outline: so, is everything visible? Outline. So, is everything visible? Are you seeing everything just fine? Like my slides and stuff like that? Is that all right? Yeah, that's good. Thank you. Okay, please shout if anything goes wrong. So what I want to sort of do is I want to start by talking about K3 surfaces and their degenerations. I'm going to talk about Hodge's theory of the degenerations and sort of what the geometric structure looks like a little bit of the singular fibers of these things. I'm going to talk a little bit about how. I'm going to talk a little bit about how this generalizes to higher dimensions. So, if you generalize a K3 surface to higher dimensions, you have several different options. I'm going to talk about the generalization to, say, hyperkalar manifolds or varieties, compact hypercalar manifolds. And I'm going to talk about the geometry of their degenerations a little bit and the corresponding limit mixed task structures. Then, sort of as flowing out of that, I'll talk a little bit about. Following out of that, I'll talk a little bit about log-symplectic pairs and log-symplectic pairs which satisfy this property that I'll introduce later called pure weight. I'll present examples of these and I'll talk about how that's related to degenerations of hyperkalar varieties and I'll talk about their cohomologies. Then hopefully I'll have a bit of time at the end to just talk about some questions that I've been wondering about for a long time and hopefully are interesting to you as well. You as well. Okay, so that's basically the idea. I guess we can sort of get started on that. Okay, so first let's talk about semi-stable degenerations. So a semi-stable degeneration is going to be a proper flat surjective morphism. So here X is going to be, well, for the moment, this is just going to be a complex manifold. And delta is what I'm going to use to denote the disk inside of C. So this is just the disk, unit disk. Okay, so it's a proper flat surjective morphism so that the fibers away from zero are smooth complex manifolds. Of course, this is a holomorphic map. And so that the fiber over zero is normal crossings. And finally, I want the map. And finally, I want the map pi to vanish to order exactly one along each component, each irreducible component of the fiber over zero. So these two things, the last two conditions, are equivalent to saying that I want my pi to locally be represented as a product of coordinates. So x1 to xl locally. Okay, so that's essentially what this is saying. Okay, so that's essentially what this is saying. Let's see. Yeah, so there's not much more to it than that. These things are things that have been studied quite a bit. So for instance, people have studied very deeply the semi-stable degenerations of curves and also surfaces, the degenerations of surfaces have been studied quite well, in particular K3 surfaces. So maybe I'll make a little sort of small Maybe I'll make a little sort of small comment, or just give a small example before moving on to a bigger example. It's that if I have maybe an elliptic curve, an example of a semi-staple degeneration is a map so that the smooth elliptic curve degenerates into a union of P1s, so a cycle of P1s. So if you've studied, say, elliptic vibrations or things like this, this is the Geda eye. I1 or IN, sorry, degeneration elliptic curves. This is sort of maybe my favorite semi-stable degeneration. Okay. So when we talk about semi-stable degenerations of K3 surfaces, we have quite a bit of theory to talk about. So if you take To talk about. So, if you take a semi-stable degeneration of K3 surfaces and you make the assumption that the components of the central fiber are all Kalar, and you also assume that the canonical bundle of the total space here, so here S over delta, that the canonical bundle of this complex manifold is trivial, then the central fiber, so this is the fiber over zero, has one of the following three types. One of the following three types. So, this is the theorem of Kulakov, Person, and Pinkham. So, in the first case, we have just a smooth K3 surface, not much to say there. In the second case, type 2, we get a chain of surfaces meeting in smooth elliptic curves. So more precisely, you have something like, you know, so you start with like a rational surface with an anti-canonical elliptic curve inside of it, then you have a Inside of it. Then you have a chain of ruled surfaces. And you have another rational surface at the end. So you have two rational surfaces at your endpoints. And then inside you have a chain of ruled surfaces over an elliptic curve. Okay, so this is the type 2 degeneration. And so a very simple example of this is that if I take a quartic in P3 and let it degenerate into the union of a cubic surface and a hyperplane intersecting in a smooth cubic curve, then this, once you resolve singularities of this degeneration, you get a type 2 degeneration of K3 surfaces. In type 3, so this is sort of the most complicated. So, this is sort of the most complicated and most interesting example. You get that the degenerate fiber is a union of rational surfaces, so whose dual intersection complex is a triangulation of the two-sphere. So, for instance, I guess it's maybe the example is a good illustration. So, if I have a quartic, a smooth quartic inside of P3, and I let this degenerate to the product. This degenerates to the product of all coordinate variables on P3, the homogeneous coordinate variables. So, this is now four different hyperpoints meeting in smooth rational curves. This is a type 3 degeneration once you do appropriate resolution. So, in this case, you have that the thing you degenerate to sort of looks like a tetrahedron. And so, I mentioned this thing called the dual intersection complex. Dual intersection complex. So, anytime you have a simple normal crossings divisor, you can sort of encode the intersections of each of the components of the irreducible components of this divisor by a simplicial complex called the dual intersection complex. So, to each irreducible component, to each component of the divisor, you assign a vertex. To each intersection between two components, you assign an edge. Two components, you assign an edge, and so on and so forth. So, for instance, in the case that I drew above here, the dual intersection complex would be assigning a vertex to each of these things and then drawing a line between them. And in this case, the dual intersection complex is just sort of the dual of the tetrahedron, which is also a tetrahedron. So I have a vertex here for each of these things, and I draw edges, and I get another tetrahedron. Okay, so I'll talk a bit about dual intersection concepts. So, I'll talk a bit about dual intersection complexes. So, maybe it's hopefully clear what that means. Yeah, so maybe I think. Maybe I'm not sure. Should I do it in person or? Yeah, do it in person. Yeah. Okay. So, I wanted to ask a question about the resolution. When you resolve simplerity, you remove it altogether, you just reduce. All together, you just reduce something that is normal current. Okay, I only partially heard that. The question is: what do I do when I resolve singularities? Yeah, I guess the question is, when you resolve singularity, do you obtain something completely smooth or normal crossing in there? Yeah, so what I get if I do this is so I get a family living over the disk, so something. Family living over the disk. So something like this. And in the central fiber. So I'm the total space. So the manifold that I map down into the disk, that's smooth. But the fiber over zero is still going to be normal crossings. So the resolution that I mentioned in here comes from the fact that if I take, say, a quartic plus put a parameter t in there, and then I take x, y, z. Take X, Y, Z, W, and I let this be some sort of family inside of the disk product with P3. So Q means quartic in this case. So if I just take the subset cut out by that equation, that's going to be a singular hypersurface in the disc cross P3. So in order to talk about this in terms of the things that I was saying before, I need to find a resolution. Because this total space isn't smooth. So it has. This total space isn't smooth. So it has, in this case, I can't remember the number, but some collection of isolated singularities, 24 isolated singularities. And then I take very small resolutions where I replace each node with a copy of P1. Does that answer the question? Yes, thank you. Thank you. Oh, okay. Yeah. So there's something a little subtle. It's not direct here, but we'll sweep it. But we'll sweep it under the rug a little bit. Are there other questions at this point? Okay, so yeah, I know it's sort of an awkward situation, but I mean, I guess feel free to shout at me. I don't know. I don't see any hands up at the moment. Okay, I see there's like a little thumbnail of the room. And so I'd never be able to tell if there are hands up. So feel free to just yell. But feel free to just yell. Okay, so this is sort of essentially, you know, in a nutshell, the theory of degenerations of K-through surfaces. Types one and two are easy, generally speaking, and type three is, you know, it's fairly complicated. I mean, the idea of like finding, even just on a combinatorial level, understanding triangulations of a sphere is kind of a difficult question. Okay, so you can also try to understand this in terms of. To understand this in terms of maybe the monodromy action on the smooth fibers of the degeneration. So, if S of T is a smooth fiber of pi, so this is still in the context of degenerations of K3 surfaces, we can distinguish the three types of degenerations based on the monodromy action on the second cohomology curve. So, H2 of S of T. In fact, maybe I should, I'll leave the Q there. I don't need a Z. Q there. I don't need a z. Okay, so of course, you have this is going to be a locally trivial vibration over the complement of zero in the disk. So you have a monodromy diffeomorphism on your fibers, since it's a proper map. And so you can take this diffeomorphism in acronym cohomology, and that gives you this operator that I'll call T here. So this is the monodromy operator on this. And then, so by Ethereum that goes back to, I think, Landman, and then Clemens has a version of this as well. Probably Grothendieck proved this somewhat at the same time. You know that this operator T is unipotent since it's a semi-stable degeneration. So, this is going to be a nil potent operator N. So, if I take the logarithm, I get a nil potent operator. So, if I have a semi-stable degeneration or a nice degeneration, Or a nice degeneration like the ones that I had on the previous page, K3 surfaces, I can distinguish the type that I gave you before, the geometric type of the fiber that I put in the center, from the monotromy. So if the monotromy operator was trivial, I get type one. That makes sense. If the monotromy operator satisfies this condition, so it's non-zero, but its square is zero, then I get type two. And if I get 2. And if I get the square being non-zero and the cube being zero, then I get type 3. Okay, so of course, this is just some statement about the structure of the Jordan blocks of this operator n. So you can distinguish it this way. And if you know a little bit about mixed hot structure, this tells you something about what that looks like. So I'll dive into that a little bit now. So I want to explain sort of another way of interpreting this monodrome-y. Way of interpreting this monodrome A condition. So, to do that, I want to sort of introduce to maybe some of you who don't know what this is: what a mixed hodge is. So, a mixed hodge is a triple consisting of a rational vector space VQ, a filtration F, and a filtration W. So, F is a decreasing filtration on the tensor product of VQ with C, and W is an increasing filtration on the rational. An increasing filtration on the rational vector space VQ itself. I should point out that I want this to be finite-dimensional. So I want this also to be such that when I take the induced filtration by F on each graded piece, so Wi modulo Wi minus one, I get a standard pure hot structure. So this is what a mixed hot structure is. It's sort of just a some sort of way of talking about extension. Of way of talking about extensions of pure hatch structures. Okay, so examples of mixed hatch structures appear all over the place. So, but the main ones are the following two. So if I have a variety over the complex numbers over C, then the cohomology group of X admits a mixed tide structure. So that's true for any variety, singular, compact, proper. Singular, compact, proper, it doesn't really matter. But if x is proper, then I know something about how the weight filtration behaves. So this tells me that if I have a proper variety and my weight is greater than i, so the i is here, then that weight disappears. And if I have a smooth variety and if I have my weight less than i, so j is less than i, then that weight disappears. That weight disappears. So, putting this together, we see that if X is smooth and projective, then the mixed hide structure on this cohomology group is actually a pure hide structure. So, maybe this is backwards from the way people often talk about this, you know, for any Kaler variety or a compact Kalar variety. Any Kaler variety or a compact Kaler variety, you have a manifold, you have a pure Hodge structure. So it's sort of seeing this, how it sits inside of this bigger machine of Deline. Andrew, maybe for the people who aren't familiar with Hodge theory, could you just quickly say what a pure hot structure is? Sure, yeah, of course. So a pure hot structure, so maybe just a note. So there's two ways of thinking about a pure hot structure. The most basic one and the one The most basic one, and the one that I remember thinking about for a really long time, was that a pure hatch structure is a pair consisting of a rational vector space and a decomposition of weight w and a decomposition of the tensor product of v q. Tensor product of VQ with C as a direct sum of spaces of the form HPQ, where P plus Q equals W, the weight, so that this behaves nicely with respect to complex conjugation. So if I take H P Q and I take its complex conjugate, I get HQP. So this is sort of the basic idea of a pure Hodge structure. So this appears on the cohomology of a Kaler variety. So if you have a Riemannian manifold, you can represent your classes in the dynamical homology via harmonic classes, harmonic forms. And if you're actually Kaler, Um, and if you're actually Kayler, then these forms behave nicely under complex conjugation, and you get this type of structure. So, there's an equivalent definition of a pure Hodge structure that comes from basically packaging all these HPQs together for particular values, and that gives you this description in terms of a Hodge filtration. So, this is some sort of analytic characteristic of the cohomology of Kaler and projective varieties. Yeah, so this is the idea. And so a mixed hodge is sort of tracing through what this sort of thing, I mean, and all this stuff about mixed hodge that appears here is sort of at its core is this statement about pure Hodge structures appearing on the cohomology of compact projective varieties. There's nothing really more. It's just sort of, you know, this sort of this Hodge decomposition plus, you know, Composition, plus, you know, homological algebra. That's all that sort of goes into this. Are there questions about this? Is there anything that's unclear? Everyone's sort of hopefully welcome to ask. Okay, so there's another common source of mixed taught structures, which is degenerations or semi-stable degenerations. So, according to work of Schmidt and then. So according to work of Schmidt and then Steenbrink, if I have a semi-stable degeneration, I get a mixed Hodge structure. So the collomology of each smooth fiber of this degeneration emits a pure Hodge structure. So this nice filtration or decomposition of its collomology groups with respect to complex conjugation. And as I let the fiber go towards the degenerate fiber, this Hodge filtration. This Hodge filtration can be traced. You can find a limit of the Hodge filtration. And you can also find a weight filtration on this cohomology that comes from the action of monodrome. So the Hodge filtration is in the limit. So it just takes, essentially, you do the proper thing to take the limit of the Hodge filtrations on each fiber. And the monodrome. And the monodromey filtration, so monodromy on each fiber gives a weight filtration. So given any nil potent operator, you get a filtration on the vector space that it acts on. And so in this case, that's our weight filtration. Okay, so it's sort of. Okay, so it sort of puts together the analytic data of how Hodge filtrations vary as you vary a family of varieties and composes it with the topological data of monitoring the action. Is this okay? Okay, so you can sit down and you can, for a semi-stable degeneration of K3 surfaces, you can look at, you can see. And look at, you can see what the limit mixed hot structure looks like. So, this is the limit mixed hodge structure. Can I ask a question? Yeah, of course. So, on the previous slides, you mentioned two results, but they provide two different mixed structures. They provide two different ways of getting the same mixed hodge structure. This is the Schmidt and Steenbrink names that I gave here. Yeah. Here? Yeah. Yeah. So Schmidt does this purely analytically in terms of what's called the variation of hot structure. And Steenbrink gives a geometric way of constructing this. But the results are the same. Yes, yes, they are. This is yeah. Thank you. So yeah, so you can look. Yeah, so you can look at what these things look like for semi-stable degenerations of K3 surfaces. And I've drawn sort of this type of picture that I have here. So I have my weight filtration, my weight-graded pieces drawn here as this sort of as the rows. And each weight graded piece has its own Hodge filtration. And I've told you what the graded pieces of that are in these rows. So, Um, in the type 2 case, you see that the zero graded piece, I should just write zeros whenever there's nothing, but I've sort of forgotten that. In this case, the graded zero piece is zero, the fourth graded piece is zero, and these two graded pieces are sort of similar but shifted, and this one just sits in the middle. Okay, um, and in the type 3 case, we have that the odd graded pieces banish. The odd graded pieces vanish, and the even graded pieces are concentrated just in one place. So, this type of hodge structure is called a hodge tape hodge structure. And that just means that odd pieces vanish, and the only things that appear in the even pieces are right in the center. Okay, so we can see from this. Okay, so we can see from this, and so this also reflects the structure of the monodromy operator. So the monodropy monodromy operator n, since this one has order three, sorry, this one here has order three, this goes a long way, it goes from here to here, and it jumps up like that. Since this one has order just two, it only goes a little bit. So that's in some way reflecting that data. Okay. Okay, so you can generalize this to higher dimensions. If you generalize the K3 surface to a compact hypertail variety, then you can also look at the limit mixed hat structure, so semi-stable degenerations of such things. Again, they turn out to be, at least when you think about what they do to the second cohomology group. So the second cohomology group of ah. Of a hypercaler variety is of rank, well, some sort of rank, it's not necessarily clear, but sort of it behaves in a lot of ways like the cohomology groups of K3 surfaces. So there's a similar trichotomy here. And so in type one, there's not really anything interesting going on. There's a type two case where something Where something similar to the K3 case occurs, you have this, and a type 3 case that appears like this. It's very simple. Okay, so this is a very, if you know what the cohomology of a second cohomology of a hypertail variety looks like, then this is a pretty obvious statement. There's no real work to be done here. But there is work to be done if you want to see what the geometry of these. Of these degenerations are like. So there's some relatively recent work by Kolar, Lassas, Saka, and Woisin, which generalizes this theorem of Kulakov, person in income that I mentioned earlier. So I have some sort of technical terms here. So I'm going to start with a slightly worse than semi-stable. So these two words, minimal and DLT, these are sort of technical words. These are sort of technical words from the minimal model program. So, this means that this is slightly worse, but more natural. So, this is just more natural if you're a minimal model programming person. So, if you assume that it's minimal in DLT, then you can distinguish the geometry of the And you can distinguish the geometry of these things very much the same way as Kulakov, person, and Pinkham did. So, if you have type 1, then the central fiber can be made smooth after base change. So you pull back along some very simple map your entire family, and then after doing this enough, you can just sort of by some blowing up and blowing down, you can remove that singular fiber so that it becomes smooth. In types two and three, In types two and three, you don't get such nice results, but you get similar things. You get something about the dimension of the dual intersection complex. So you get that the dimension of the dual intersection complex of the central fiber, it's either of dimension equal to that of V of T. So this is now the complex dimension here. And this is the dimension of a Of a simplicial complex, and that's this is what we get. So, just going back to the original Kulikov-Person-Pinkham case, this is a very natural generalization. So, in the first case, if I had a type two degeneration for K3 in type two, dimension is two. Dimension is two. So the dimension of the smooth fiber is two and two. Then in type two, the dual intersection complex, as we saw, is just a line. Well, it's just something like this. And in type 3, for K3 surfaces, our dual. R2 intersection complex. is a sphere S2. And so this is similar. So that tells us the dimension. And in fact, the Kolar-Laza-Saka-Goisin theorem tells you more. It tells you that in type 3, the dual intersection complex of the fiber over zero is actually going to be. zero is actually going to be it's going to be something that has the same rational homology as pn where n is the dimension of v of t okay so it tells you something very specific here so that's very similar to the result that we had for k3 surfaces because well p1 Surfaces because, well, P1 is just, or sorry, Pn2. P1 is just the S2. Okay, so you have this very nice geometric classification, and you can also make statements about how limit mixed tau structures behave. So this is, maybe I'll say something about the history of this theorem because I have a lot of stuff there. So this was something that was conjectured. So, this was something that was conjectured by Nagai maybe 10 or 15 years ago, and it's now been all but proven by a collection of people in various cases. So, I don't entirely know how edifying it would be to really go through this, but I'll just read it out for the sake of doing it. So, this says if we have a type 2 degeneration, I have to get their manifolds, then if my weight is high enough, If my weight is high enough, I'm going to be zero. And the same thing holds for type 3 degenerations, or a similar thing holds, and this says that this is the, well, the highest possible non-zero weight is non-zero. That second statement follows from the statement about the dual intersection complex, is that right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So there are two proofs of the second statement. These are given by Solbatankov and Kolar, Laza, Saka, and Waza, the same people who I mentioned on the previous page. So these two, maybe I'll say Say prove the second statement. And then the other two prove these statements. And so I'll maybe just say in words why this is an all, you know, this, this, this approximate symbol means this is all but proved. So Green, Kim, Maza, and Robles proved the first statement for all known classes of hyperkalar varieties. So there's, we don't know the classification of hyperkalar, compact hyperkalar manifolds. Hypercaler, compact hypercaler manifolds. But for all that we do know, they proved it. And then Huybrex and Mori, more recently, proved the second statement under sort of a very small assumption, which can be checked for all known classes of hyperkala varieties. So up to some very, very small ambiguity, or, you know, or depending on what you believe about the classification of hyperkala varieties, this first statement is proved. And the second statement is completely proved. It's fairly easy. Is completely proved. It's fairly easy. Okay, so this is our cohomological characterization. Okay, so this is the end of my sort of introductory part here. And so the goals with the rest of the talk are to do the following things. I want to basically study the irreducible components of the central fiber of degenerations of hypercaleer varieties. And so maybe I should be careful and say maybe this is a dream application. It's not an actually actual application, but this is sort of one of the things that I think about when I think about these things is that if you can understand the pieces of the central fiber of a good degeneration of hyperkalar varieties, then maybe you can use that to reconstruct hypercalar varieties. Hypercala varieties. This is something that can be put into practice or could feasibly be put into practice in some cases, but I think in reality is very much a dream. The second thing, which is maybe less a dream, but still unfinished, is to study the cohomology rings of the irreducible components. Of the generations of hypergular varieties, okay, of singular fibers. And one of the reasons I want to study the cohomology rings of such things is that they bear a lot of sort of formal similarity to character varieties and cluster varieties. Character varieties and cluster varieties in terms of how their cohomology rings work. So, if you can sort of formally study these character varieties, sort of the cohomology rings of these things that show up, and that I'll describe in a second, this might give you insight into things like the P equals W conjecture or give you insight into things about the chromology of cluster varieties. Okay, so these are cool things that I may or may not get to. Things that I may or may not get to. So, with that in mind, let's introduce sort of the things that we want to be talking about today. So, a pair consisting of a smooth variety X and a simple Nomer crossings divisor, Y. So, simple Noma crossings, this just means that locally in analytic coordinates, Y is just the vanishing locus. Just the vanishing locus of Z1 to ZL for Z1 to Z2D a analytic coordinates. So I assume that my divisor looks like this locally. This pair is called log symplectic. If there's some sigma, which is a Which is a global two-form on X with log poles on Y, so that when I take the highest possible wedge power of this width itself, I get something inside of the, well, okay, so if you do this, what you end up getting is something inside of the canonical bundle of X vanishing on Y, or sorry, maybe poles on Y. And if this is a non-vanishing section of this bundle, Is a non-vanishing section of this bundle? We say it is a log symplectic form. Okay, so maybe just a little bit of what this means. So if I have local coordinates of the form that I have on the right-hand side of the slide here, then the sheaf, omega 2x, log poles on y, this is just locally the span. This is just locally the span over homomorphic functions on an open set U of things which are second wedges of things that look like D log Z one to D log Z L D Z L plus one D Z two D. So it's just things that look like that. So second wedge powers of things had to have logarithmic poles along the divisor y and no poles anywhere else. Okay. So locally, this is a relatively simple thing to state. And so why does this fit with the previous discussion? No, I'll come to that in a second. Okay, I'll explain. Come to that in a second. Okay, I'll explain in a second how this fits with the discussion that we've been having, but first let's give a couple examples. So, if X is a surface, a complex surface, then the pair consisting of X and a simple number crossings divisor Y is a log-symplectic pair, even if and only if Y is an anti-canonical divisor. So, assuming that it's simple nomenclature, log-symplectic is the same thing. Log symplectic is the same thing as what's called log collabiat. And okay, so if y is empty, so if I don't actually have a divisor, then this is just Holmfick symplectic, right? There's no extra condition. It's just, you know, there's nothing kind of log pulls along. This is just a Holomorphic symplectic form. So examples there, I think. Maybe this is a little trick. And another example, I mean, I'll mention a couple. Another example, I mean, I'll mention a couple more later on, but another example that appears is that if you have the Hilbert scheme of points on a surface with a smooth anti-canonical divisor, so basically I assume that I'm in the first case here, and that this Y is a smooth anti-canonical divisor. And I take the Hilbert scheme of points, I can blow that Hilbert scheme up enough so that this, I get a log symplectic pair. So I won't go into too much detail. So, I won't go into too much detail about that, but there's a nice procedure for this. Okay, so now I'll tell you why I care about these things. So, if I take a nice class of degenerations of holomorphic symplectic manifolds, so these are what I'll call good degenerations. So, if I take such a thing, this is a semi-stable degeneration so that I have a nice tube form on all the fibers. Two form on all the fibers. So formally, my condition is that I have some sigma in the set of all global relative two forms. So that's what this means. This means relative two forms over the disk delta with some possible bad behavior along this, the divisor over zero. So this is a fairly natural condition to assume. This is some, you know, I mentioned this minimality condition earlier, and this is a fairly similar thing. Fairly similar thing. Okay, so if I assume that I basically have homo symplectic forms on each of the fibers of this degeneration, except maybe zero, right? So the non-degeneracy condition here is some sort of global non-degeneracy for these forms. Then we call this a good degeneration of holomorphic symplectic manifolds, varieties. Okay, so I can give you this sort of Okay, so I can give you this sort of slightly more, this is more restrictive than the condition that I gave when I quoted this theorem of Covar Laza Saka and Poissa. So it's a smaller class of things, but this is the class that I want to look at. So if I have this nice class. Look at. So, if I have this nice class of degenerations of holomorphic symphactic manifolds, then the proposition is that if I take an irreducible component of the central fiber of a good degeneration, and I take y to be the intersection of x with the single locus in this fiber over zero, then this pair is actually log symphytic. So, maybe just to draw a little cartoon of what's happening. Draw a little cartoon of what's happening. In the original case that I gave you, where I start with an elliptic curve and I degenerate to a cycle of P1s, the pair that I'm going to be considering for my xy is going to be one of these P1s. So that's going to be my X and my Y is going to be the points that intersect the other components. Okay, so the upshot of this all is that. So, the upshot of this all is that if I have a nice enough class of the generations of homomorphic symplectic manifolds in the context that I was thinking about earlier, then the pieces that this central fiber are made up of are these logs and plateau pairs. Okay, maybe I'll stop for a second. Are there any questions about this? I have a question about definition of good degeneration. So, this is V0. V0 is that allowed, it's allowed to be singular, right? It's not necessarily smooth. Yeah, it's generally going to be singular. And in the definition, do you impose any condition on how singular it is? So yeah, so since it's semi-stable, it has only normal crossing singularities. Okay, thanks. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay, so this is very nice. This is why one should care about log symplectic varieties if one is interested in hyperkalar varieties. If one doesn't care about pairs, symplectic pairs or whatever this is, and you only care about hyperkalar varieties, then there's still a reason to care about these things. So I'm going to get into something a little bit technical right now. Maybe I'll. Now, um, maybe I'll sort of say it quickly to be complete, but this is maybe, I don't know, I'll try to explain this in an intuitive way in a second. So if instead, so if we go back here, what you have is a degeneration of holomorphic symplectic manifolds. So the smooth fibers here are holomorphic symplectic. If you impose a If you impose a stronger condition that they're hyperkalaya, that they're irreducible holomorphic symplectic, then you get a lot more data about how things behave. So you get this strong condition called pure weight on the homomorphic symphlectic components of the degeneration. Okay, so maybe I'll sort of... So, maybe I'll sort of skip this and I'll just go to sort of a qualitative description. So, there are so I want to give a geometric description of what this pure weight condition means. So, in the case where fibers are hypercaler. Hypercaler, we get more data about components. Okay, and so this data comes in the form of Hodge theoretic data. You know, it was on the slide that was before, and sort of if that stuff, the stuff you understand. Sort of, if that stuff is stuff you understand, then you understand it. And if you don't understand it, then I don't know if I'm going to do a good job of explaining it in two minutes. But I can tell you sort of what the consequence of this is in terms of the geometry of these things. So the main consequences are the following. So if you have a, if your components have, so pure weight takes one of three values. It could be value zero, one, or two. These are the possible. Or two. These are the possible weights that you can get. And so if your log symplectic form has pure weight zero, then your boundary divisor Y is empty. So if you have a log symplectic pair which admits a log symplectic form of pure weight zero, then Y must be empty. If you have a log symplectic pair with Log symplectic form of pure weight one, if this appears as one, If this appears as one, then it tells you something about the structure of the dual intersection complex of the divisor y. So, in fact, this tells you that the dimension of this boundary divisor, or this dual intersection complex, is half the complex dimension of x divided by a minus one. And in the last case, you have a log symplectic form of pure weight two if and only if the dual intersection. If and only if the dual intersection complex of y has dimension equal to the dimension of x minus 1. And so the three basic examples in dimension two that you should think of are, so if I have, in this case, this is just like saying I have a K3 or a Belian surface. In the second case, this is like having a Case, this is like having a rational surface X and Y is a smooth anti-canonical elliptic curve. And in this case, this is like having a rational surface. X and Y is a cycle of rational curves. So in this case, you can think of P2 being your surface, and Y is just the vanishing locus of X, Y, Z, W. So that's your example there. Okay, and this is just sort of a vast generalization of that. So this is already known for K3, the generations of K3 surfaces. And what we're sort of seeing here is that this sort of geometric classification can be carried on to higher dimensions. Okay, right. So this is the geometric characterization of pure weight. And so I'll go back to this slide to say. This slide to say how this relates to what we were saying before, and I think I said this in probably just as many words, but I'll repeat myself. And so this is that if I have a good degeneration of hyperkalar manifolds, and if the and so the fibers are now hyperkalar, and if x is an irreducible component of the fiber over zero, and y is the intersection of x with the singular locus of Of x with the singular locus of v0, then the pair xy admits a log symptomic form of pure weight w. And the weight is related to the type of the degeneration. So if it's type one, then the weight is zero. Type two, then the weight is one. Type three, you get weight two. Okay, so this covers for you actually Collar, Laza, Saka, and Hoisin's theorem, but in a more restrictive case. more restrictive case okay so you have these these three classes um and so what i want to what i want to do is i just want to give examples um so um probably in the remaining 10 minutes i'll just spend time giving examples of these things okay so the first class of examples is maybe a very silly one which is that if i take any That if I take any toric variety of even dimension, I can give you a, I can construct from that a log-symplectic pair. So, a toric variety, if I, a projective toric variety, is always going to be a compactification of a torus C star to the power of two, some dimension, in this case, even dimension. So, if I take a torque variety determined by a fan, which I'll call sigma, living inside of a lattice. I'll call sigma living inside of a lattice m tensed with r. Then inside of this, I'll have this big torus. Inside of the toric variety, I'll see this big torus. Then I can construct two forms on the big torus very easily. So I can just write them in terms of coordinates on the torus as something like this. So something like the form that I have here, where my Where my alpha ij's, these are just elements in the complex numbers. So then I get a pair consisting of a smooth variety and a simple normal crossings divisor in it by taking x sigma to be my toric variety and y sigma to be x sigma with the torus inside of it removed. Okay, so if I had chosen this two form so that the form determined by these numbers alpha ij, so if I just write this, this is an alternating matrix. So if I take the matrix coming from this in cola A, and this is going to be an alternating matrix. And if this is non-degenerate, then this gives me a log symplicate pair of pure weight two. Okay. Then there's another example. So I learned this from a paper of Clauterian Pym, though I think it goes back to the work of Fagin and Odesky. And so this is constructed in the following way. So if I take a smooth elliptic curve, which is embedded in T4 by a degree five line bundle, so this is maybe a pretty nicely described elliptic curve. I can take the secant variety of that elliptic curve. So this. Elliptic curve. So, this is what I get by taking any pair of points inside the elliptic curve and taking the line between that pair of points. I take the closure of the set of lines, so the Z risky closure of that set of lines, and that's going to be my secant variety. So this is a quintic hypersurface, and it's going to be singular along the latticer E. So, this itself, if I just start with that, that's not a simple number crossings. A simple number crossing a log-symplectic pair. So you can have a broader definition of log-symphlectic pairs. And I think this broader definition will be used in Mikola's talk that will be after this. But this one is not quite SNC at the moment because my divisor, the secant variety here is not simple in the process. What I can do, though, is I can just take my XE to be the blow-up of P4 along. Of P4 along the singularity locus E. So this should say E here actually. Okay, so if I just blow up once, this now becomes, if I, the secant variety is resolved, the singularities get resolved. And so if I take the union of the proper transform of the secant variety and the exceptional divisor, so that's going to be a P1 bundle over the elliptic curve. I'm sorry, P2 bundle over the elliptic curve. Bundle of the elliptic curve, then the pair consisting of the blown-up variety and these two components, the proper transform of the secant variety and the exceptional divisor, this forms a simple number crossings, log symplectic pair of pure weight one. So this is one sort of nice class of such examples. Okay, so these are sort of nice basic classes of examples. Of nice basic classes of examples. And you can also sit down and try to construct new examples from old examples. So here's a theorem, which I don't know, I think I proved part of, but other parts of floating around in the literature for a fair while. So part of this I learned from hacking and keel. And I think And I think there's maybe parts of this that can be found in work of people like Polish and things like that. It says the following thing. So if I have a log symphlectic pair and I assume that sigma is a log symphlectic form of pure weight W, if I take Z to be the smooth closure of a smooth symphlectic leaf of codimension two, I assume that this is contained inside of one of the divisors, one of the components of The divisors, one of the components of the boundary divisor y. So, of course, this log symplectic form determines a Poisson structure on the variety, so you get symplectic leaves. So if I assume some sort of niceness condition about a codimension two symplectic leaf of this structure, I can blow that up. I can take the proper transform of the divisor y. And I can build a pair consisting coming from this data. So, this is all the stuff that I get when I pull back y under the blow up along z and I remove the exceptional thing. So the exceptional thing gets, doesn't it get included in y, y z. So if I take this pair, this is again going to be log symplectic, and the form that I get by pulling back is going to be pure weight w again. Okay. Okay. So, one very nice class of examples that one can construct this way are what you get by blowing up the symplectic leaves of toric varieties with a fixed symplectic form that I talked about before. So, if I have a toric variety, I can describe the symplectic leaves nicely in terms of the data that I had. So, the log symplectic Had. So the log symphlectic form, as we saw, corresponds to a non-degenerate alternating pairing alpha on m. So this is our underlying lattice that we use to define the torque D. The torque boundary divisor or a fixed torque boundary divisor corresponds to a primitive ray in the lattice M and the symplectic leaves have a nice description in terms of the pairing between this form and This form and the ray that you want to find the symplectic leaf on. Okay, so I won't go into a whole ton of detail on this, maybe just sort of say in summary that there's a very nice combinatorial description of these symplectic leaves. So you can start with the data of a symplectic form on your lattice, an alternating pairing on your lattice, plus a collection of rays inside of this lattice. And you can give the data that tells you how to blow up. Give the data that tells you how to blow up a toric variety to produce a log symplectic pair of pure weight, in this case, two. And some examples that one can get from this type of construction are, well, okay, so if you have, start with the adjacency matrix or alternating adjacency matrix of an acyclic quiver, and sigma is just the standard simplex. So this is just, you know, raise, you know, the standard basis of. The standard basis of a lattice. What you get by blowing up along all of the symplectic leaves coming from this data, the data of this alternating parent, plus the standard basis, this is what's called an acyclic cluster variety. So you can recover in this language acyclic cluster varieties. There is a slightly more general procedure. Slightly more general procedure from which a little bit more. You need to do a little bit more than just blowing up like this. You need some sort of like moving across walls and things like this to talk about this conception, but you can recover multiplicative hypertoric varieties this way. Okay, so in the remaining minute that I have, I will skip all that I had to say about the chromology here, and I just want to sort of bring up a question that That hopefully should lead in a little bit to Nicola's talk. So, which is to say that in a lot of ways, all the things that I've been saying are sort of idealized. So, in nature, one does not expect to see what I called good degenerations. They occur sometimes, but not super frequently. What one expects if one studies, say, the minimal model program is you expect your degeneration. Is you expect your degenerations to have singular components, and you don't expect the intersections of these components to be simple normal crossings. You expect them to be worse sometimes. But there's a nice stand-in for this called divisorial log terminal. That's this word here, DLT. So, what one should try to do is try to extend all of the stuff that I've been talking about to divisorial log terminal. Log terminal log symplectic pairs, or things that are just worse than simple number crossings, log symplectic pairs. So some of these ideas will be talked about by Nicola in the next talk. And the question that I have is, can you characterize and classify these DLT log symplectic pairs? Is there a nice class here? Is that the right thing to look at? And the second question, sort of. And the second question, sort of inspired by this, is that, well, in his thesis several years ago, Frank proved that if I have something that essentially looks like, this is, so what I mean here is that if I have something that looks like the central fiber of a good degeneration of hyperkalic manifolds, then it is, in some sense, a degeneration of hyperkalic manifolds. That is, this technical phrase, deformations are unobstructed. Are unobstructed. So he tells you basically: if you have your log symplectic pairs, you glue them together nicely enough, you can smooth them to get holomorphic symplectic varieties. So another question that's sort of inspired by this is whether, you know, if you can answer the question above and you can characterize the log symplectic pairs that occur as degenerations of DLT epigenetic or DLT degenerations, then can similar results Then, can similar results, sort of smoothing results like Hutke's, be proved for these worse than simple normal crossings or worse than troidal degenerations. Okay, and so for the sake of time, maybe I'll see. Yeah, I think I'll just leave it there. And thank you for your attention. Okay, thank you, Andrew. It's been a great talk. Are there any fetches? A little bit about the chronology risk. Could you say a little bit about the chronology risk? Yeah, sure. So I'll just sort of maybe give a quick outline here of what happens. So if you have a log symplectic pair of pure weight two, Then you can look at the cohomology of the complement of the divisor y in x. And so there, there's, you know, I have, I think, a sequence of three theorems here. But the main one is really that this cohomology ring has what's called the curious hard lachetz property. So this is something that came out of something that came out of work on the p equals w conjecture of Hausel and Rodriguez Villegas or well okay and subsequent work of Hausel Di Catalo and Midiorini. So this says that there's a really nice structure. So if you know sort of these old structural results about the cohomology rings of hyperkalar manifolds by like Berbitsky and By like Verbitsky and Luyenka and Luntz, you get a very similar sort of structural statement about this. And so, since we're now working with non-compact varieties, Verbiski's results tell you about this really sort of nice behavior, the Colemodu ring on some projective hypergillar varieties. But here we have a weight filtration as well, and so that weight filtration. Filtration as well. And so that weight filtration comes in, and we get this really sort of tight constraint. In particular, you sort of see that most of the Hodge numbers, so when I say Hodge numbers here, I mean HQ, omega, P, X, log, Y. So I can arrange those in a diamond. And so for a log symplectic pair of pure weight two, most of those vanish except for this corner. And you have a nice symmetry across. Nice symmetry across this diagram here. So there's some really, really restrictive results about how these Comology rings behave. In some ways, this reflects old results of Rubitsky and things like that. Yeah, is that a reasonable quick overview? Yeah. Okay, are there other questions? Yes. Yes, so you mentioned the example of a cyclic cluster varieties and so there are also some got by Thomas Le and Brius Weyer. Yeah. So in that case, right, so exactly in that case, this result that I have about the curious hard left shuts property, that was proved by them first. Yes. I mean, I can also prove that, but I mean, they proved more in their paper. They proved that the curious hard left shuts property holds for locally acyclic cluster variety. For locally acyclic cluster varieties, which is a much more difficult-to-control class. So their results are strictly stronger than mine. Can you see more connections between those two different approaches than yours? Yeah, so the approach that I'm taking is definitely by compactification. And if I'm trying to remember the approach that they take. Yeah, off the top of my head, I forget. Yeah, off the top of my head, I forget exactly the method they used, but they're doing something. I don't think it's by stratification. There are similar results for character varieties coming like in by mellet and stuff that prove curious hard lachets in generality by stratifying varieties. I don't think they quite use that, but they have some other approach that I don't remember at the time at the moment. So, I mean, the approach that I'm using uses a compactification of the variety, which is generally a difficult thing to do. That's something they work around. Thank you. Any further questions? Yeah, Rui. So, in this last slide, this more specific slide, you Uh, you still have the fibers are okay, and now what is but you don't have normal crossings anymore in the singular fiber. So, what is what is this function on the on the whole work like how the whole work sequentially generates that the fly right now? So, I mostly heard that question. Um, so you're so what is the what is the function? I can. What's easy to assume on the fingularity of the form of this complaint required now on the finger? Yeah, so maybe I will flip to another slide that I have. So I make a naive suggestion for a class of singularities that might be natural to extend this to. So I think yesterday there was some discussion of symplectic singularities. So I think you probably have. So, I think you probably have something like the following thing. You have some generalization of Boville's definition of symplectic singularities to log symplectic pairs. So it says something like you have a log symplectic form on the SNC locus of each component. So each, if you have a nice DLTG generation, then these components have big simple, there's a big open Zariski open set on which it's actually just a simple normal crossings pair. Then there's a smaller Then there's a smaller set where you have singularities and worse things happening. So I think you can maybe try to work with the definition like this, which says you have a log symplectic pair in the definition that I gave before on the simple nomo crossings locus. And once you take a log resolution of the pair, it pulls back to just a log two form. It doesn't need to be symplectic necessarily as long as it pulls back to a log2 form. As long as it pulls back to a log2 form, this should be sort of your what one could hope for for these things. But actually, I really don't know. I mean, I think it's, as I said, these are questions that. Did that answer the question or maybe no? Yeah, yeah. Is there any example you have in mind so that you are making this naive suggestion? No, I don't have too many examples. This is another thing that I want to, you know. That I want to, you know, I would really like to hear from other people about and to think more about. You know, examples that I would expect to see are things like there are natural compactifications of, say, like positroid varieties. So things like that might have this kind of structure. But I don't actually have anything in mind that I've checked. Mind that I've checked. I have. Thank you. Okay, thank you very much. I propose since we have a discussion session this afternoon, we can keep any further questions for them. Let's thank Andrew again for very long.
