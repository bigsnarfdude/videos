Organizing this and also inviting me. I'd also like to take this opportunity to wish happy birthday to Garrett. I don't know if Garrett is still here. Maybe he is, so happy birthday. Maybe he'll watch the recording later. Anyway, so we're gonna talk about uh I'm gonna talk about joint work with Boris Kessen and the title of the talk is I don't know what it is, but geometry of generalized fluid flows, I suppose. So I'm gonna describe briefly what those generalized flows are and then present some geometric interpretation of those. Of those. And there will be sort of two sides to the geometric picture. So there's an Arnold type description, geodesic flow and some infinite dimensional manifold. And there's also something along the lines of what Carnell described yesterday, there's this Wasserstein auto-type geometry there. So I'll talk about that as well. So let me start. So let me start with the model, and I'm gonna start. So, this generalized flow stuff, at least, the way we look at it, that's mainly due to Brigniev. He has several papers on that. Although other people, like Schneereman, also did a lot of work on that. And I'm gonna start with a simpler model, which I think was the first thing Brunier looked at. So, that's what's called the Looked at, so that's what's called the homogenized vortex sheet equations. And the idea is as follows: so you have a Riemannian manifold M and this Riemannian manifold M, well, we're doing fluid dynamics, so it's filled with fluid, and the fluid is going to consist of two phases. So there are two different particle types. Say there are blue fluid particles. Fluid particles and red ones, and so here I cannot draw them separately, but really both phases they just fill the whole manifold and they're completely mixed together. And two phases, they sort of move almost completely independently from each other. The only restriction being that altogether this is still an incompressible fluid. So if you each of the phases. Each of the phases is compressible, but if you consider the two densities together, if you add them up, then together this behaves as an incompressible fluid. And so Brignet came up with equations describing this. So the equations, they are pretty natural here. Well, first of all, each of the phases just satisfies the usual satisfies the usual form of the Euler equation. So we're going to denote the phases. So alpha is going to be the phase phase, so it belongs to 1, 2, because we have two phases, and V alpha is the velocity field of the phase. And then the equation is just the Euler Euler equation, the time derivative plus the derivative of the alpha along itself, that's equal to the minus. That's equal to the minus gradient of the pressure, which is the usual Euler equation. But we no longer have an incompressibility condition, so instead of that, you have the mass transport or the continuity equation. So these phases, along with velocities, they also have densities, and those satisfy and those satisfy the equation that the derivative of the density. Derivative of the density plus the lead derivative of the density along the alpha. That's just the usual transport equation that says that each velocity field carries its own density. And this two equations, well, the way I wrote it, these are uncoupled, but they should, of course, be coupled together. So these transport equations, they are coupled through the requirement that the sum of Requirement that the sum of the densities is equal to some fixed volume form on the manifold. So together they form an incompressible fluid. And these other equations, they are coupled through the common pressure function. So the pressure is not different for two phases, but it's the same pressure function. So this actually is not independent Euler equations, but they are coupled through that. And sort of the reason. And sort of the reason the motivation for Brignette to consider this, and the reason this is called homogenized vortex sheet equations, is because this also comes from the following model. So if you consider just the usual Euler equation on M and consider a solution of the Euler equation that has a vortex sheet in it, and the way the fluid moves, sort of you have two separate flows that sit on two sides of the vortex sheet. Two sides of the vortex ship. So it kind of reminds of this situation. So there are two fields that move independently from each other. And then if you imagine that this vortex shit just becomes very, very complicated, then, well, you could sort of pass to the limit and consider the idealized situation when the two domains are so complicated that they almost fill the whole manifold. The whole manifold, then in the limit, just from the usual Euler equation for this type of solutions, Brunier obtains this. So that was sort of his motivation for considering this. And there's also a slightly different point of view on this, which leads to this idea of generalized flows. So, specifically here in this picture, so at every point we have a blue particle and the red particle because they really feel anything, everything. Field anything, everything. And because of that, if you pick a point, you can trace the red trajectory from that point and the blue trajectory. So the fluid moves, there are really two trajectories eliminating from every point. And you can interpret this from a probabilistic point of view. Basically, you just flip a coin, and if it if you get heads, then all If you've got heads, then all particles take red trajectories. If it's tails, then it's blue trajectories. So it's kind of a random fluid flow. And more generally, this can be generalized. And well, this is random, but really there are just two options for where things can move. And more generally, you can replace this with alpha being in some space A, which is a probability space or a measure space, which means that instead of two phases, now you can say. That instead of two phases, now you consider a continuum of phases. And the equations really stay the same. So it's sort of the same model. The only difference being, I guess, that you should replace this sum with an integral over A, everything else just stays the same. And this is one point of view on what's called generalized flows. Flows so it's really the same equations, but these flows they actually show up in a completely different context. And so one of the reasons why people started studying them, it's related to what was discussed in this conference quite a few times. So for the three for the usual three D Euler equation, we know that it's a geodesic flow and the diffeomorphism group. The diffeomorphism group. And you can consider this problem of joining two points in the diffeomorphism group with a geodesic, which really means that you have one position of fluid particles and some other position, and you are asking whether fluid particles can move from one position to another. And in general, the answer in 3D is no, as Schneerelman showed, and as it was explained in this phone. Was explained in this conference already, well, a geodesic or at least a minimal geodesic in between two configurations may not exist. And then these generalized flows, they arise as some kind of a relaxation of this problem. So, okay, you cannot join two things with a minimal geodesic. Then you could ask, well, is there a bigger space that I can consider where I can still join? Where I can still join them. And then Brignier showed that: well, yeah, you need to consider this. So you look at these generalized flows, and if there's no classical flow that goes from one configuration to another, well, you can still find a generalized flow that does that. So that's sort of a completely different context, but that leads to the same equations. And there are slightly different notions of generalized flows in the literature. Generalized flows in the literature which are equivalent under some assumptions. So, this is not the most general thing that you can consider, but today I'll only be looking at this. And what Boris and I wanted to do, we basically wanted to put some geometry here. But it the density does not appear in the first equation or it does not appear. It does not appear. I mean, the order equation, compressible or incompressible, looks like this. So. I mean. So it doesn't appear there explicitly. If you want to solve for the pressure, which you do when you solve the Euler equation, it will appear in the expression for the pressure. Do you have a separate condition for the divergence of the For the divergence of B? No, it's it's it's it's well this this this this equation is basic if you arrive so here rho alpha I view it as a volume element if you view it as a function then here you will have divergence three right the su the su the sum will be then it's a sum of the alphas weighted by row alpha that will be divergence three but that just Divergence free, but that just follows from the microphone. So you don't have a compatibility. Emma, I don't hear you. Sorry, you don't have any compatibility between the volume and the mental. I think that was the question. You mean the volume here? Yeah. Yeah, let's say the volume is compatible with the yeah, that's the Riemannian volume that comes from the network. I mean, From the metric. I mean, so far, yeah, so then the metric appears here in this covariant derivative, but it's probably not important. But we were... It's like with the usual Euler equation, people normally assume that. I think it turns out that if you don't assume that, it still works in the same way. But you need to have dimensionally, you need to have a row on the left and side on the top equation. Otherwise, we have one over row in front of. have one overall in front of the screen. Yeah. Otherwise dimensionally it doesn't matter. Well the pressure is not really what people in physics call pressure. It's a pressure that's normalized by the density. So yeah, I mean it's it's I mean it's you can write it as a gradient of something, no? That's that's the running this. The sum of the densities is like constant or something. The sum of the densities is constant. The sum of the densities is from. Yeah, but it's like the usual Euler equation is also written in the same way. And then you can say, well, dimensions are clearly off in the Euler equation, but the thing is that the pressure is not the pressure. I think there is a term in physics for it's like pressure divided by densities. Sort of a. Okay? Yes. So here you Yes. So here implicitly you have some Riemannian metric that it's fixed. Yeah. So M is a Riemannian manifold. The metric is here because that's the covariant derivative. Okay, so is this clear? Can I go on? Alright. So as I was saying, so what we wanted to do is put some geometry. Wanted to do is put some geometry here, see if we can describe this as some kind of a geodesic flow. And well, turns out that this is indeed possible. And to do that, well, as people usually do, you need to sort of pass to the Lagrangian point of view. Instead of thinking about velocities, you should think about how fluid particles move. And usually, well, there is a And uh usually, well, there is a diffeomorphism that you can you can identify fluid configurations with diffeomorphisms. Here you have uh many phases which are indexed by the space A. So instead of one diffeomorphism, when you integrate equations, you also get a bunch of diffeomorphisms. Let's denote those by phi alpha. So each phi alpha is going to be some diffeomorphism of M. Of M. So any configuration of this fluid phases, you can encode them by a collection of diffeomorphism or a thing that sits in this infinite product of diffeomorphism groups. But not any collection of diffeomorphism is going to work because we have a sort of an incompressibility condition here, which is not the usual incompressibility condition. But what happens is you have some initial You have some initial densities, and well, we know that those add up to the volume form on the manifold, which is fixed. So, if you push this forward by phi alpha and you look at what you get, and you sum or integrate over alpha, that should still add up to the volume on the manifold. That's the same incompressibility condition that we. Incompressibility condition that we had. So, what we are really getting is not an infinite product of diffeomorphism groups, but it is some sub-manifold inside that, which is described by this condition. And then if you think about this condition for maybe a minute, then you will realize that these things do not form a group anymore. A group anymore. If alpha, if A is a single point set, then we just get the classical Euler equation. In that case, the condition simply becomes that phi preserves the volume form. These things, they do form a group. Here, well, if you try to compose, then you'll see that it just doesn't work. They do not form a group. So, this, yeah, it is a subset and some product of groups, but it's not a group anymore. Group anymore. But these things, they still form a group type structure, but actually it's not a group, but it's what's called a group oil. And the reason this happens could be pretty clear. So the way we can, so we can, we have this space of allowed densities here, and we could call them something like multiple. And we could call them something like multi-densities. So, a multi-density is a collection of densities that are indexed by elements of our measure space with the condition that they integrate to the volume form on the manifold. And we can consider the space of all possible multidensities, and the condition that we impose on diffeomorphisms is that, well, there is. That, well, there is a multidensity such that when we apply our collection of diffeomorphisms to that multidensity, then the thing that you obtain is a multidensity again. So there are kind of two multidensities here, and your collection of diffeomorphisms takes one to another. And then, well, you have something that takes this to this, and maybe this somewhere else, you compose them then. If you compose them, then what you get is a complete mess. The composition just does not preserve this condition. But you can clearly still compose if your second diffeomorphism takes this resulting multidensity to something else. And this is a structure that's known as a groupoid. So you can take composition, but not always. But basically, each thing here has a Each thing here it has a source and a target. So there is a multi-density here and a multi-density here. And two things you can compose if source of one of them agrees with the target of the other. And that's a structure that's known as a groupoid. And then, well, after you define this groupoid, you can play Arnold's game, but on this groupoid instead of a group. And you put a metric on. You put a metric on the group point, and the metric is just defined in the same way as Arnold defines it. So it's an L2 type metric, so it's basically a kinetic energy of a fluid. Well, here the kinetic energy is, you have many phases, so you need to compute it for every phase, then you need to weight that thing by the density you need to integrate, but that's an obvious notion. But that's an obvious notion of what a kinetic energy is. And then you create a right invariant metric on the group out of that thing. And there is a, well, unique, completely canonical way to do it, just like in the group situation. And then the theorem that we prove with Boris is that this generalized fluid equations or homogenized vortex shear equations, which is Vortex shear equations, which is the same thing, but with space A consisting of finitely many phases. So there are geodesics on this group point that I just described. And specifically, well, the geodesics of a right-invariant metric, a group point that's given by fluids kinetic energy. And there is also a different way to interpret this theorem. Way to interpret this theorem. So, because in Arnold's description, we know that this Euler equation can be viewed as a geodesic equation in the Lagrangian description, but if you forget about fluid particles, you go back to the Euler equation itself, then, well, this fluid velocity field that appears in the Euler equation belongs to a Lie algebra, which is just a Lie algebra. Lie algebra, which is just the Lie algebra attached to that group considered by Arnold. And what the equation is, it's a Hamiltonian equation on the tool of that Lie algebra where the Hamiltonian function is again the outlook. So here, again, this can be interpreted in the same way, but here, again, if you look, so we have this velocity fields Vα, and as was mentioned, the Alpha, and as was mentioned, there is actually some kind of a divergence-free condition there, which I didn't write, but it comes from integrating that last equation that I had over alpha. And such things, again, it's easy to see that they do not form a Lie algebra. You take a Lie bracket, it just completely breaks down. And that's not surprising because a Lie bracket is an infinitesimal version of group multiplication, so what flows here do not form a group. Here do not form a group. Your velocity fields do not form a Lie algebra. There is no reason they should, and they don't, so there's no Lie algebra here, but instead they belong to an infinitesimal object that's attached to this groupoid, which is called an algebraid. It's kind of a more complicated version of a realgebra, and I possibly couldn't explain what that thing is. You should just believe me that it's there. But do you have some explicit But do you have some explicit example? It's very describe what that algebraic structure is. And then you go, and so Lie algebra is a vector space with a bracket. And algebraic is a vector bundle. And then you go to the dual bundle. And on that thing, there is a Hamiltonian structure. And then this generalized fluid flow equation is Hamiltonian with respect to that structure. So there is also a To that structure. So there's also a kind of a Hamiltonian description that comes up as a consequence of this thing. So you specify like an inner product on the algebraid? Yes. So what corresponds to the inner product? Yes. So the algebra here is basically the space of velocities. Just like it is in the classic. It is in the classical situation. So, because it consists of velocities, you have an inner product there, which is the L2 inner product. But the right thing to think about this velocity is it's no longer a vector space because you think of a pair which is velocity and density. So it's a vector bundle over the space of densities. And in the fibers of that vector bundle, you have an inner product which is the L. It's a bundle matrix, exactly. Sorry, is it one velocity? Sorry, is it one velocity? No, it's a whole family of velocities. It's a family of velocities, yes. And can you put topology on this family of velocity, kind of topology on it? Sure. I mean, there are many, many different ones we could come to. But we do everything in the category of fresh manifolds, which is the easiest thing. The easiest thing you can do, I suppose, and probably not very useful from the analytic perspective. But I mean, I would imagine that you should be able to do all the same things you can do with the classical or lyrical. Okay, and as I promised, there is uh also some connection with uh this uh auto uh picture that uh oh, it was actually a class. It was actually Klaus who talked about this yesterday. I said it was Cornelia, but it was Klaus. So let me describe what that is. So we have this space that was already mentioned. That's the space that I call the space of multi-densities. And what that space is. And what that space is, it's the space which consists of a collection of densities rho alpha, where alpha is in our metric space and it satisfies this condition that if you integrate over H, that's equal to the volume form on the manifold. So, and really what that is, you have the space of densities of your manifold, you take infinitely many of such, and then that's just a linear. And then that's just a linear equation that you impose. So it's really an affine subspace in this sort of some open subset of a vector space. And on each row alpha, there is this Weisserstein metric that arises in the optimal mass transport. That's a natural metric on densities on a manifold. And well, here we just have a product of such things. Product of such things, so there is you can take the product of Wasserstein metrics and then restrict it to the subspace. So the Wasserstein metric, it still lives here. It's slightly more complicated than what the standard Wasserstein metric because we restrict it to a subspace. That's kind of a constraint. But basically, it's just the induced metric. And then the picture that we have, so The picture that we have: so, as the fluid, this generalized fluid flows, it moves inside this group oil. And as it flows, it also transports, well, all these phases, they transport their own densities. So there is also a flow that's happening in the space of multi-densities, which really means that we have a projection from the groupoid to the space of multi-densities. With a space of multi-densities. Another way to think about this, so when I define this group point, I said that everything in the group point has a source and a target. So this is just a target map for the group point. To every element, we associate the target of that. And then we show that here we have a precise analog of this auto picture in the optimal mass transport. So there is a metric here. So there is a metric here, that's just a metric from that theorem, that's the L2 metric, whose geodesics are fluid flows. So there is an L2 metric here. And there is this Wasserstein-type metric of multi-densities, which is the restriction of the Wasserstein metric. And then we prove that this map here is precisely what Klaas was describing yesterday and what arises in the classical optimal nest. In the classical optimal mass transport, that this is a Riemannian submersion type map. So, really, the Weissstein metric here is basically just induced by the Lpool metric on the groupoid. And the proof of this is basically just some general property of groupoids. If you put a right invariant metric on a groupoid, then this map is automatically a Riemannian submersion. In the usual Wasserstein setting you use the non-invariant altimetric, but you use the invariant optimization. That's a great question. So the Wasserstein... Okay, the Wasserstein picture, you can interpret it in the group setting or you can interpret it in it in the groupoid setting, where so instead of just considering diffeomorphism, you consider pairs, diffeomorphism and a density that it carries. Any density that it carries. And then, so if you consider diffeomorphisms that map one density to another. And yeah, of course that's a group because it's just all diffeomorphisms. But you could also think of this as a group oil, when you only allow to compose things when one arrow ends where another one begins. And then the usual metric that you consider in optimal mass transport, for the group it's not invariant, but for a group. It's not invariant, but for a group point, it is right involved. So that's actually kind of the meaning of that metric. Because, well, to me, the metric looks strange because it has this invariance with respect to a subgroup, but not with respect to a whole group. But in the setting of groupoids, it's actually very natural. It's a right invariant metric on the groupoid. So here it's it's exactly the same. Yeah, it's it is invariant, but in the groupoid sense not in the groups. Not under the space. I mean, can you realize any group point like that? I like flow. Can you also see that generalized flow to a group point in an abstract way? I don't think so. This is pretty special. And this group point, it's relatively simple from the point of view of general theory. I mean, it's complicated because it's infinite-dimensional, but it's but it is much more regular than things that people like to consider. So I would say... So that was my question if you could characterize somehow some constraints of how this would work. I mean this is very very specific group work, so I don't Group wise. So, I don't know if for general ones it's not very clear how to look at it and interpret it in that way. And yeah, so I'm basically done. Excuse me. So, one of the advantages of the big advantage, I think, of Arnold's picture is that you have Picture is that you have toy models like rigid bodies, and those teach you something about typical infinite dimensional systems. Is there a nice toy model for groupoids and geodesics? Like a finite dimensional ones? I mean there are definitely things where the configuration space does have that structure, but whether those have been worked out in detail, I don't think so. So I don't think that people So I don't think that people really looked at finite dimensional there are some examples that we logical and others. Yes. Yes, there are things where the natural kind of set of symmetries form a group oil versus a group. But I don't think it has been studied in detail. Studied in detail. So, I mean, it would, it's a great question. It would be definitely nice to have some simple toy models, but I don't think these are worth something which is movable. Take things which have an angle and uh the angle is the the the variable it would uh be the multi-density. That's good uh Something like that. Uh maybe, yeah. What what uh Boris was uh I mentioned if you okay you could consider things like some rigid body moving in a constant curvature space, then you also sort of lose loop symmetry there. So something like that, I guess, would work. Like I don't know, a hyperbolic surface and maybe a small Hyperbolic surface and a small disk, moving back, something like this. So, you have this picture here for the Masserstein on multiple densities. Is there a similar picture? I mean, for in a group phase, there's a similar picture for the Fischer-Rau for information geometry, that's also the power of it. Could you do this also in a group weight? Like a Fischer-Raule density picture or fungal picture for the group weight for instance and get a multi-density. Multidency, Fishero version. So for the group, what metric on the group induces divergence, divergence, write invariant. It's kind of a writing variant each one. Yeah, I think it should work. I don't know if it will have any meaning whatsoever, but yeah, I think it should work. Because you could also like go back, right? If you have a you have a metric here, You have a metric here, you should table. It's not going to be unique, but you can reconstruct something. And I was previously thinking about some problem that I call color transport. In this problem, I have like two colors, like red mass living here and blue mass living here. And in each state, I should never blend them. Yeah. So like I must have like here either red mass or blue mass. And And if one state is like red here, blue here, and my like end state, so to say, is like red here, blue here. So one path is just rotate everything so that they do not get branded. With this in mind, my question is, is this a Zeoda set on a Google Point? Or like is the Zodacy indeed like Is the zero decision indicated like these two settings? Do I have to blend red mass and blue mass? Well, I mean, here they are sort of already blended, right? Because the condition is like in the initial state and the end state I have like red and blue, they are not blended. No, I understand. Uh but this seems to be and you don't have any incompressibility condition. Have an incompressibility condition, I suppose. Here you can interpret this, so you can look at geodesics on the base on multi-densities. You can interpret this as an optimal transport problem. The problem is as follows. You have blue things and red things. You need to move them to another configuration of blue things and red things. But you have this tunnel incompressibility condition. So at each point of time, your whole space should be densely packed by blue and red things. Or, I mean, you can just. Or, I mean, you can just think about transporting blue things, but as you transport blue things, you're also sort of paying for transporting the air that surrounds the blue things, if you see what I mean. So, you're moving this shock to here, but as you're moving this shock to here, you're also moving air in the backward direction, and you're also paying for that. You're also paying for that. This is that type of thing. Yeah, my setting is like the space is filled with either blue or red. And I know that in your setting, blending can happen. Even if the initial state and the MSF, if they're divided. But A path is just voted for the thing. So can you imagine uh what kind of blending you get for like this particular setting? Particular settings? This was actually considered by Brignier himself and by Roeschker. So essentially, you have a vertic sheet, just a classical vertices, and the initial condition and the final position, like this. And then he allowed this variational problem to get from one vertex sheet to the other. So have a he considered homogenized vertex sheets. So on the way they could do N, and that's kind of generalized slow. That's kind of generalized flow, and in the end you would like to have an incompressibility condition. But I'm not sure, maybe you might just impose this condition, and then it would be exactly that problem. Because I mean, if you don't have an incompressibility condition, then you can sometimes explicitly solve, right? An optimal mass transport, many things you can just write down how things move here. Well, big bits basically like an Euler type equation. Equation, so I guess you can simulate this. I mean, like, as far as I know, like in the blended setting, like for short time, blending does not happen. But for a long time, like if I have very different configurations of that time, blending can happen. I don't know if this is the same. It's not going to be answered. Any other questions? No. Thank you again. Five minute breaks.
