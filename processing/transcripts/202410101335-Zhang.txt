Some of that's really good to really thinking very much about specific systems. But I think we've lost something in terms of thinking about really big picture questions. And one could say, one argument might be, oh, we've answered all those, but I don't think we have. That's maybe an optimistic view about there's really big things left to be done. And so actually, I went through. And so actually, I went through this and I thought, gee, let's look at a couple of recent years, and that's the next slide. And partly to my surprise, again, the most cited papers, again, these are from the American Naturalist. I think these might not be 10, but a little bit fewer. Again, these are all sort of big picture. If you were to look at the abstracts, which I did, not just the title, almost all big picture ones. Big picture ones. And this is a harder thing to do because to do a specific system, you just have to know that system really well. But to do big picture, you've got to know the literature really well in more than one area. So this is sort of the speech this morning, I guess, had the advice to the younger folks. And this would be that there's a tendency just to read about things. Just to read about things which are just specific for you and the problem you're working on now, but it's a good idea to look at bigger, broader questions and read much, much more broadly and try and think about big picture questions. And so I want to just mention this at the beginning because it is something that has struck me over the recent past, that a lot of people don't do that as well. That a lot of people don't do that as much as I think they should. And I hope that as we go through the specific bullets that are specific here is coming up, that we can think about some bullets that go under there that are not just narrowly focused. But maybe before we go on, should ask if there's any comments that you want to put on. Next slide, yeah. Maybe add bullets to this slide if there's anything anybody wants to add right now. Want to add something? I think we want to see your tent bullets. Maybe they go right in there. Yeah, maybe we'll do that then, and then we'll maybe come back to this at the end. Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Okay, so thanks, Alan. Okay, so I'm going to leave this in this mode. Hopefully, everyone can still read it. So we got to. Still read it. So we got together. That was Chris and me at lunch yesterday. Tried to find areas that were highlighted at this meeting, possible future directions. That was what the goal was. This is a brainstorming session for ideas to include in each of the 10 areas. And we're looking for just your immediate responses, not have fun. We will use a timer, a loud timer, and tell us what's on top. And tell us what's on top of your mind. Just go ahead and give a three or four word description. We will enter what you say in real time, be concise, and make room for all voices to be heard. So if you've come up with your favorite idea, make room for others to come up with theirs before you continue on. And that's all there is. And we have 10 slides, and if you can start the timer. And Scripts, if you need people to repeat, you can feel. You need people to repeat so you can do oh, I can't uh type Mark where typing that oh you're typing okay so I'm not typing. Okay, anisotropic movement, linear features, pathfall. What are some big ideas here? Exit times, arriver times? Paths that are made versus paths that are. Okay. At the road field kind of approach that I won't try to do it justice, but it should be in there. Let's have new approaches to heterogeneous media. Okay. Homogenization? Homogenization? Role of Dochasticity is small numbers of individuals in scaling up. Excellent. And Sebastian, I just was saying individual behavior, which is subsumed by what Alan said. Yeah. Great. Awesome. Multi-scale. Multi-scale. Yeah. Okay. And that ties in with the homogeneous. Okay. And that ties in with the homogenization approach. Yeah. What geometry of the domain that you're working with? Yeah. Sounds great. Optimality, notion of sure, yeah. Especially with tying in with the first passage time kind of approaches, you know, for predator prey. Maybe predator-prey. Connections with data. Are you getting it all, Fritchau? Are you getting it all, Fritch Hot? Wow, this is going so great. Can you arrange it that we see the updates on the screen? Well, I no, because I can't type it in. You can fit you up right in the same document. That would be nice. I'm not sure. Two of us writing. Yeah, but none of you are showing. So we're thinking about memory, learning, optimality, reliability, social learning for social insects, those kinds of things. How fast ch things change and how things vary. Going from individual to collective. I'm gonna guys keep going. I'm gonna see if I can. Sure, it's not economic. This might be related to what Beau said, about predictability. And how big the environment you get the sensory, but the information, like local information, globally. It's sort of reliability versus optimality that I think came out of Bill's talk that was fascinating. Came out of Bill's pockets fascinating. And applicability. Applicability? I mean, which scale we have to consider by the cognition or learning? Did the figure go off? The timer or something. It's allowed to sell 24 seconds. 24 seconds. Okay. So it's learning a memory relevant for cells and tissues. Right. Yeah. Not just free megafauna. Is memory relevant for biocontrol agents? That's a great question. Navigation in very uh complex environment or like plumes where you have trouble. Is actually uh Like a turbulent environment, so interactions with the physical world. Getting information about something which is very turbulent. Yeah. Which means you have to have a range memory. Our time is up. Okay. Complex dispersal processes in space and time. And we were inspired by, I think, initially by Noel Saf, you know, animals moving C. Animals moving seeds and things like that, and yeah. Impact of fragmentation. Okay, yeah. Networks of interactions and networks dispersal influenced by the network. Influenced by other populations. Right, yeah. Non-local environment? What? Climate change? Climate change? Yeah. So you're thinking about how that will help. Plants respond to climate change. Multiple modes of dispersal? Yeah, multiple vectors for the same modes of movement. Oh, that's great. Movement processes affecting the environment or creating complex environments. This sort of feedback. Feedback. Like evolution, phenotypes. Like evolution, phenotypic plasticity, transgenerational plasticity, affecting how individuals choose to move general effects, stuff like that. Personal success, but whether the success depends on it. Please to estimate the effective dispersal kernel. Simplify the model from marginalizing over the mechanisms. Another flavor to that is model choice. What kind of model do you use to capture what kind of expressive process? I mean this ties in with spreading speeds as well because they're like we saw Noel's talk that they're infinitely sensitive to the model choice. Oh that was us. Okay. Okay, so this came up many times but was inspired partly by Alan's talk. So connecting spatial patterning processes across multiple disciplines. So we saw a very nice example there. So we saw a very nice example there of physics and ecology, kind of this interplay. That was the Ising model. But there's other ones like Voter models and so forth that are in discrete CASER processes. Well here connecting things, both IV models, voter models, to other ways of representing Other ways of representing spatial problems. So looking for commonalities and differences among reaction diffusion and discrete time and integral difference and these stochastic spatial approaches. Remote sensing is a way of understanding spatial approach. I would include technology transfer. So with the icing. Transfer. So, with the Ising model, there'd been a lot of work that then could be applied. Crodynamics? Coral. Crow. Crow. Crowd. Biology. Sociology. They do a lot of different things. It's a different population. You may have things. Yeah. May have been on on on that language dynamics, how languages are going extinct or sociology, social dynamics. Are we good? Okay. Let's go on to the next one. Uh dispersal impacts on population growth. Impacts on population growth. And so I think the first talk we saw that, well, I don't know which first was, but for example, UN Louvre's other talks, many other talks talked about getting the right amount of dispersal to save populations, but not to homogenize everything. And Shang's talk, so on and so forth. Recommendations conservation management with Patch models and PDE models, trying to kind of find more connections between the three. PDE and what was the other one? Patch models and PDE models. Commonalities. That's a great one. A lot of advantages of Mortality from dispersal and benefits from dispersal as a function of landscape. Open cranes, for example, you've got the opportunity for exploration to have a positive influence on population growth if they happen to end up someplace. But if they end up at a crappy place, that's a lost depends on the dynamic. Yeah. Just kind of a trade-offs kind of. Switching of movement modes as topic. Very nice. Temporal variation in dispersal patterns and how that impacts population button. Yeah. If there's anything you don't get for a chop, just follow up. Yeah, you're good. Okay. Yeah, you're good. Okay. Great. Environmental impacts on the as an example, like in worm dispersal of plants, which uh-huh and um there you go. Population growth also, I think. That ties in with Celeste's talk, I think, a little bit. Yes. On this topic, I would say phenology. On this topic, I would say phonology, but just like because individuals depend on environmental coups to start dispersing, but well, is there a time up? Yeah, okay. I'm blowing up. Okay, we'll move on. I know there's a few hands up, but we'll just keep going. Okay, free boundary problems and related formulations. And I know many were in the, let's focus on the spatial ecology ones as much as possible, because it may come up elsewhere in other discussions. When there's range expansion or contraction, you could think of that as where they are as a free boundary. Optimal spatial pattern regarding to the square free shooter. Affected by climate climate change. Climate change and grandiose species. I was just going to say, based on what we saw in one of our talks, was just the effect of species interactions on a focal species sort of range. Can you reformulate as a food-bound food problem? Yeah, that was very cool. Yeah. I suspect there's maybe many other economies you could choose. And I know Howe's talk, I don't think Howe's here, but his talk tomorrow will talk about the boundary conditions, getting the boundary conditions behaviorally based. Interface conditions changes things. Chris Steph, I want to come uh patterns development of boundaries between different uh subpopulations of the same population. The same population. Yeah, okay. Never thought of that. It's a free boundary, but it's related. It's related. Yeah. Where is the dividing line? Yes. Something I'd like to learn more about is this crambid method for the growing domain and its relevance to the free boundary problem. Are they going to give the same result or different results when and where? I know very little about either one of them, just kind of curious about how the one's going to shake up. Bottom-up derivations of this battery. I don't know if this is correct, but in this category, but even just like critical patch size with a fluctuating line, I assume that's a rebound problem. I'm not sure about that. But even patch size with in a fluctuating domain. I don't know if that's appropriate. Okay. Thanks. Thanks. Non-local interaction models, both indirect and direct interactions. Well, yours in mine. Here is in mine. Active communication. I think most of the models have more or less passive input, actively sending out things. Actively sending out signals. Quorum sensing. Quorum sensing. Connecting non-local interaction models to a local movement, which has to be the basis. Information sharing. Like pattern formation and fronts. So you're going to have these sitting fronts, sort of like a trendline wave. Proceeding front is sort of like a traveling wave in the front kind of thing. Pursuit and avoidance type behavior. What kind of possible internet simulators like HAP kernels versus Gaussian? Yeah. The self-generated gradients. Oh, yeah, yeah. Perceptual limitations. Non-local information, if you will. Two seconds? Okay, all right. Next one. Population and evolutionary processes under global change. And evolutionary rescue? Evolutionary rescue. Yeah. Pathogen would be the complement for the same thing. Pathogen emergence is sort of like. Like variance might be more important than looking at the meaning, but we don't have a lot of data for the variance. Some of those are theoretical and we can build models of that in this case. And see if it fits anything. Well, we need a mechanism. A breakthrough rule and say of realistic stochasticity, not just normal distribution, not just essentially Gaussian other noise. Mutualistic mismatch of mismatch, yeah. Okay. Like some of the model, like species distribution model, they look at a mean usually and protect. But what about various local is not capturing those type of models? We use it a lot. Even different modes of evolution, whether it's like asexual populations versus diploid populations, those different modes, or the structure of the genetic architecture, to what extent does that matter for these? How about evolution versus plasticity? It's a tough one, right? Evolutionary versus plasticity versus the... Transgenerational plasticity. Yeah, yeah. That's right. These methylation type of things. I was going to say the role of standing variations versus to noble mutations in those current data. Excellent. Yeah, exactly. Excellent. Okay, spatial evolutionary ecology. So ideal free distribution, dispersal, selective direction. I was going to get a few things this morning that I did get to. One is when you have a You have a resource that is positive in one place and negative in the others, and the stuff that Chris had done, there's been some additional work, but that's still got the ways to go. And you can also think of this in terms of foraging theory as much as long-term things, that may be useful. As long-term thing, that may be useful to think of as well. Or a sink population? Sort of sink populations of several species. I'd like to think about what Sebastian was talking about with the temporal and lower population. About the temporal and mode of population dynamics with regard to this kind of idea in terms of spatial patterning as to what's going to lead to positive growth and negative growth. Alternation from time to an alternation in space. Yeah, it would probably fit into that, yeah, but in the context of a pattern. I'm thinking of what is the biological meaning of the selective direction. How to define the direction? What is the direction? Biological interpretations. Just time variable, evolution of time variability, as is Sebastian's thing, but also the role of stochasticity since we walk. Stochasticity, since we will only see single realizations in natural systems. Fine of the ideal-free distribution, sense of incomplete information. Great. No, I'm more sensitive to the timer now. Transients in ecological and eco-evolutionary processes. I was excited about the evolutionary transients, the significance that they could play. We don't often think about them. Or I don't. How to tell if you're looking at a transient? Finite individuals and demographic stuff, yes, they see that stuff. Finite individuals, discrete and finite scale analysis of establishments in America Probability of establishments. Probability of establishments. Version of time skills. Or what happens when you can't separate time scales? Expansion load, why do you accumulate the literature rotation into the full acceleration as well? Front acceleration, yeah. The possibilities of physiological plasticity versus different scales, I guess. Individual of disturbances during transients. You know, disturbances do when you're at equilibrium, but in transients, that is the transient of the transients. And the transient of the transient may also be disproportionately in transient in adaptative dynamics where the where it's time varying in Randolph, where the mutation comes through the time probability may matter. We have seen that in one talk. And you have to average the probability. Then you have to average the probability of each other across uh uh a cycle, right? So, dealing with cycles? Yes, when you have cycles, the the time at which the mutation occurs, they matter. And then when you can compute your probability of invasion, you have to compare the driver range and the probability quasi-stationary and non-autonomous systems. Okay, so we have got to the end of our list, and I want to thank everybody. One last thing I want to do is if anyone wants to make comments about generality versus specific things in the context of what we've talked about, we could add those comments too. I think we promised Alan we'd come back. I think we promised that when we come back to this at the end. Yeah. I was going to say maybe we can ask audience for something.
