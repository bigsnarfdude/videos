For having us out here, I've really enjoyed the talk so far, and mine is going to be sort of in the vein of what biochemical systems can sense, how much information they can acquire in a limited amount of time. So this is a topic that interests my group, and we've asked this question sort of motivated by different experimental systems in a variety of contexts. I'm going to focus just on one system. I'm going to focus just on one system today, and it's illustrated in this picture you see on the title slide. This is actually one of the main results of the talk. This is a calculation of a concentration field. This is a molecule, the concentration of a molecule that's secreted by a cell, which is represented by the circle, really the sphere in the middle of the slide here. And so I'll tell you about the experiments and the cell type and everything in a second, but suffice it to say that this is the steady state concentration field, and everything that goes in is fully parameterized by the experiments. And the important point here is that the thing that the cell is doing is attempting to detect the direction of a flow. So there's fluid and it's flowing in a particular direction, and the flow is biasing the And the flow is biasing the concentration field so that it's not symmetric. And if I were to ask you then, okay, in which direction, up, down, left, right, is the flow flowing, I don't think you'd be able to answer. And so that's the challenge that the cell faces, and it's sort of a matter of whether it has enough information to detect that direction. This is the same solution just shown as a contour map, instead of a heat map. Shown as a contour map instead of a heat map. And I think in this representation, you can see that things are slightly biased to the right, and indeed the flow is flowing to the right. And there's actually another point to emphasize about this result, and that is that the concentration itself is incredibly dilute. So these are molecules being sourced by the cell, but they very rapidly diffuse away. And so that leads to a steady-state concentration at the Leads to a steady-state concentration at the cell surface in the femtohole, right? Or getting even smaller as you go out. And so, just to put that in perspective, this is not to scale, right? Molecules are much smaller than this, if this is a whole cell. But over the entire volume encompassed by this slide, that means there would only be three molecules present at any given time. And so the task is that the cell is essentially. The task is that the cell is essentially secreting these molecules, presumably isotropically, and then because of the flow, it's also detecting them, but with a bias. And that's, you know, it begs the question, does it have enough information to detect that bias with soap molecules? We need thumps down molecules, and it also has receptors. Yes, exactly. It has receptors that are cognate to the very molecules that are. They're really bad formal solar. Yeah, or you know, what I often like it too is, you know, throwing grass in the wind. Is throwing grass in the wind or something, and your eye is the detector on which direction the grass is. But diffusive sonar works too. So, okay, so what is this system? So, for a little bit of context, so these are cancer cells, and so, you know, what stage of cancer are we talking about? So, these are cells in the lymphatic system of the body, and for cancers of this type or any sort of like soft. This type, or any sort of like soft tissue, including breast cancer, then, well, you know, what generally happens is that a tumor forms, and then there comes a point where cells become metastatic, meaning that they sort of acquire a motility and they find their way from the primary tumor into a vessel of some sort, be it a blood vessel or in this case a lymphatic vessel. They circulate around the body and they come out of the vessel and that seeds a secondary tumor, and that process as a whole is. And that process as a whole is called metastasis, and that's usually the most deadly stage of cancer. And so, in this process, there are a lot of different cues that guide the cell from the primary tumor to the vessel. And they include things like chemical gradients, or cues from other cells that are sort of hijacked by the tumor, or mechanical cues like deformation of the matrix. Like deformation of the matrix, or other mechanical cues you could say, like fluid flow. And that's what's really driving the process in the case of the lymphatic system, as I'll show you, because you essentially always have this background drainage, this background lymphatic flow that is sort of always heading toward the vessels. And that's what the cell capitalizes on in this case. So that was vividly shown in an experiment from In an experiment from 2007 by the group of Melanie Schwartz, where they were interested in this metastasis, this invasion to the lymphatic drainage. And what they did is they reconstituted the system in vitro. They exposed these cancer cells to a flow that mimicked the flow speeds in the human body. And they showed that when there was no flow, then the cells did not migrate. When they turned the flow on, When they turned the flow on, then the cells did migrate, and then importantly, when they blocked the receptor that was cognate to this ligand that was known to be secreted by the cells, then the cells stopped migrating. And so that led them to hypothesize this mechanism where the cell is secreting something that's biased by the flow. And they dubbed it autologous kinotaxis. And they checked that indeed. They checked that indeed the ligand that was secreted by the cells is also found on the cell surface, and they verified that indeed actin was polymerized at the forward direction of the cells. So this was sort of an active process in response to that ligand. The nice thing, though, about this paper, at least from the perspective of the theory group, is that they were very quantitative. So they actually measured a lot of things that could help us characterize. Things that could help us characterize the challenge that the cells are up against in this detection problem. So, first of all, they showed that the flow is slow, and what that means in quantitative terms is if you calculate the Peclet number, which I've called epsilon here, because it will soon become a perturbation parameter, then it's small. And the Peclet number, for those of you unfamiliar, is a dimensionless number characterizing ballistic effects to diffusive effects. And in this case, that would be. And in this case, that would be of a molecule secreted. So it's the flow, the velocity of the flow times the length scale of the cell, the cell being the detector in this case, over the diffusion coefficient of the molecule. And all these things are known for this system, and it's an order of magnitude less than one. So that means that diffusion is dominating over ballistic effects, and that's what I mean by the fact that the flow is slow. They also measured how many molecules were secreted by the cell. Many molecules were secreted by the cell. And you come out with an estimate of about 5,000 molecules an hour, which is about a molecule a second. And so, you know, to compare that, the entire experiment that they ran was only 15 hours. And so presumably within a couple of hours, these cells are beginning to migrate in the chosen direction. And so the cell is dealing with only a couple thousand molecules. And the question arises: is that enough statistics or information? Statistics or information for the cell to have as it's redetecting these molecules to know that, oh, okay, it's at this angle, the flow is going in this angle and not that angle. So this can be thought of as a generic problem, a pretty general problem of information acquisition. We've seen already today different ways to think about this problem. The way I'm going to think about this problem is drawing from a history of physicists thinking about sensory Physicists thinking about sensory biology that arguably begins with Howard Berg and Edward Purcell, when they were thinking about similar questions in the context of Berg's expertise, E. coli bacteria. So many of you know that E. coli have these flagella that allow them to swim and their swims take the form of runs and tumbles. So they swim in a straight line and then you know their flagella are synchronized and when one of them sort of rotates in the opposite direction. Sort of rotates in the opposite direction, then it reorients the direction of the swim, and then they go in another run, and tumble and go in another run, etc. So these are microorganisms that essentially do random walks. And they have detectors for various nutrients and attractants. And the random walk can be biased by the presence of a gradient of that attractant, essentially by the fact that if an attractant is detected and the And the bacterium is going in that direction, then it simply extends the length of its run. So Burke and Purcell were interested in how much information a bacterium was getting about an attracting in this process. And so they turned it into a very basic question about the precision of how of how to calculate the precision of a cell detecting a uniform concentration of ammonia. Detecting a uniform concentration of the molecule. So they said, forget about the gradient, forget about all the biology of bacteria. Let's just assume that they're a permeable sphere, and that sphere can magically count how many ligand molecules are within its volume. So on average, the number would scale like the volume of the sphere times the background concentration of molecules. But of course, this is a stochastic quantity characterized by Poisson statistics because diffusion is a Poisson process. Diffusion as a Poisson process, so the variance in that average or in that number would be equal to indeed. But of course, then they recognize that diffusion is also a dynamic process. So if the cell is willing to wait, then these molecules diffuse in and out, and after a certain amount of time, there'll be a whole new batch of molecules to count, and that will constitute an independent measurement. And so the variance would be reduced by that number of independent measurements. And that number would be the total amount. And that number would be the total amount of time the cell is willing to wait or integrate its measurements divided by that characteristic diffusion time for a molecule to sort of diffuse out of the cell. And so if you put these things together, you get basically a noise to signal ratio, right, which is a relative measure of the error that the cell would make in estimating the concentration. And that, they found, goes down with the square root of. Found goes down with the square root of the time the cell is willing to wait, the diffusion coefficient of the molecules, the size of the cell, and the background concentration of the molecules. So we wanted to take a similar approach for our problem of detecting a flow. Oh, I should also say that not only did they calculate this, they compared it with actual behavior of bacteria. So they argued that a bacterium in the course of one You know, a bacterium in the course of one of its runs needs to estimate the difference in molecules detected from the end to the beginning of the run. That's bigger than the standard deviation in either one of those measurements. And you can turn that into basically a bound on how long the bacterium should run. And that bound is in terms of all things that Bird could measure in his experiments. And the prediction is that they should run for more than half a second. Than half a second. And how long they do run is about a second. So that argument says that bacteria are subject to this bound, but they're actually approaching it quite closely. All right, so we want to do a similar thing with our flow sensing problems. So we're going to sort of take the same approach. We imagine that our cancer cell is a permeable sphere. But because we're interested now in direction of a bias in the molecules. Of a bias in the molecules due to a flow, we imagine not counting the number of molecules in the sphere, but subtracting the count in one half versus the other one. And so once again, we're going to think about the average and the statistics. In this case, those things can be estimated by just thinking about all the processes that I told you in terms of rates. So there's a rate that molecules are secreted, and I'm Molecules are secreted, and I'm calling that nu. There's a rate that they diffuse away from either half of the cell, right? Given by the diffusion coefficient divided by the length scale of the cell squared to get something with units of rate. And then there's, because of the flow, there's a rate that molecules from the left go to the right and that molecules from the right go away, right? And that's going to create a mismatch in the counts. And so, to get the mean of the difference in counts from right to left, we just take for each half all of the arrival rates over the leaving rates. And so you get this difference that you can write in terms of this Peclet number, epsilon. And if it is small, which I showed you it is, then this is approximately this. So the difference in molecule number would go up with the Peclet number, it'd go up with the Pele. Up with the Peplay number, it'd go up if the cell secreted more molecules, if it's bigger, and it would go down if the molecules diffuse away faster. Okay, so that's the mean. Now the noise, we actually just assume, because the Peclet number is so slow, that diffusion dominates the noise. So once again, just like Berg and Purcell, we take the variance to be equal to the mean in one of these halves because it's a Poisson process. Because it's a Poisson process, and then divide by the number of independent counts that you get due to the diffusive regression. And so when you put this together in the same way, you get these molecules are diffusing through your cell. Yeah, that's a huge problem, which I'll correct in a slide or two. Because as you know, it's already a problem for Berg and Purcell to assume that a bacterium is just a permeable sphere. But for us, to say that it's also. But for us, to say that it's also permeable to the fluid is an even bigger problem. Because we know fluid goes in sort of laminar flow. And yeah, so I'll talk about that. Maybe this is just a small problem, but why are you partitioning the cell with a vertical line? And why not a horizontal line or a line to some other angle? Unless the flow is either always to the right or always to the left, that line could be anywhere. Yeah, exactly. So the short answer is that will. The short answer is that will induce an extra factor of three in the variance because any direction the cell chooses randomly can be decomposed into three components and we just happen to be choosing one of the components here. Yeah. Which is important though and we accounted for that in the final comparison with experiments. Very good. So our noise to signal ratio then becomes this, right? Then becomes this, right? So the noise would then go down once again if the Peclet number were higher, if the cell secreted more molecules, or if it waited longer, which I think are all sort of reasonable physical things to expect. Now, the problem that was just asked about, right, so what gives us the right to assume this is permeable? Not only does the flow go around the cell, but there's a no-slip boundary at the cell. So the velocity of the flow is actually. So, the velocity of the flow is actually zero at the cell synthesis. So, presumably, that means only molecules that actually diffuse a ways out and come back are acquiring information about the actual flow velocity. So, what does that do? Does that make this scaling wrong? Does it just introduce a pre-factor larger than one or three as the case may be? Does it change the problem? We need to find that out. So, actually, we went beyond. Actually, we went beyond, similar to Berg and Price, we went beyond and actually calculated something more rigorously than just this back-of-the-envelope estimate stuff that I've been telling you by first solving, well we didn't do this, the Navier-Sooks equation in the appropriate limit was already solved for flow around the sphere. And that limit, by the way, is not just low Reynolds number, but also the so-called low permeability limit because Limit because, um, yeah, the usual problem is sort of Stokes flow, that's the infinite permeability limit. But for you know, the experiments and in the human body, there's like all kinds of extracellular matrix that is sort of blocking the fluid and creating a porous media, basically. So, anyway, that problem was solved, that was fine. And so, what you end up doing is taking that flow field, plugging it into a diffusion infection equation, and solving that. Equation and solving that for the concentration field. So I'm skipping the details, but this is an equation that's linear in C. We can solve it in steady state, and we get the concentration field that I showed you at the beginning. But we can't stop there because we need to account for the noise, the fact that this is not a continuum field, it's made out of actually particulate molecules. Particulate molecules. And so you need to actually add noise on top of this PVE and account for the, you know, account appropriately for the spatiotemporal statistics of diffusion as well as the randomness of secretion and so on and so forth. Again, not showing you the details, but we essentially use a Langevin approach. Go into Fourier space, come back, and we get the noise on. We get the noise on top of the field, and then we boil all of that down into a measure of anisotropy. So, my analog of subtracting the right half from the left half is to essentially integrate over the surface of the cell, presumably when the information is coming from the receptors, against a cosine to weight receptors on one side positively and receptors on the other side negatively. And that produces a number between minus one and one. Between minus one and one, which we call the anisotropic heat. And so we're interested now, again, in the noise-to-signal ratio of this anisotropic heat measure. And so when all the dust settles, we get indeed something that looks a lot like our back-of-the-envelope estimate. It's got the same scaling. It just has indeed a larger prefactor and some other terms that are important, but that go to zero if you assume that the binding is strong, right? The binding is strong, right? That you never lose information by not binding the problem. Or is it bind in release? It is bind in release, yes. We actually looked at both cases, reversible binding and also perfect absorption. Sorry, not perfect absorption, imperfect absorption. If you absorb everything you secrete, then no molecules ever leave. So it turns out that bind and release is more precise than absorption. Absorption. Because, basically, for what I just said, by even absorbing imperfectly, you are reducing the probability of a molecule going far away, rebinding maybe, and sampling the far field before actually giving you the information about the bias. So the ones that are released after being bound once are biased a little bit in the correct direction, and kind of amplifies. Yes. Exactly. Exactly. Okay, so this is that expression, right? So this is the standard deviation over the mean, our measure of percent error, essentially. And all three, well, no, two of these things were measured from the experiments, as I showed you. So we can plot this as a function of integration time. As I said, the experiments only lasted 15 hours, so this is sort of irrelevant. Is sort of irrelevant. And what I want to point out is that by the time you get to just a few hours, the percent error is reduced, but only to 70, 50%, something like that. So as our intuition had suggested by these sort of, by the fact that there are so few molecules and the and the flow is very slow, it seems like even after just a few hours, cells are operating with even, you know, Are operating with even tens of percent error. So I've ignored a lot of biology that may add noise, but it must not add that much noise because it's just really close. They presumably have to be operating pretty close to this theoretical bound to know which direction the flow is going. Sorry, the goal, you're thinking of this as the goal of the cell is to migrate in the direction of the flow. Yes. And if they're off by 10%, they'll go there. Yes, to find out the direction of the flow with, you know, and if you're doing that with 100% error, it means that, you know, half the time you'll get it wrong, right? And the fact that, whereas if you're doing that with 1% error, it means 99% of the time you'll get it wrong. So the fact is that this theoretical bound we've calculated. This theoretical bound we've calculated, it only gets to like 30% error, no lower, in the entire time of the experiment where these cells were observed to migrate in the direction of the flow. You know what I mean? So it's impressive, is what I'm saying. Maybe you covered this in the experiment, but did they do like a knockout experiment where they prevented the release of this ligand so that, like, because in some sense the cell can literally go with the foam, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, so there's two. Yeah yeah yeah no so there's two answers to that. One, I'll show you a I believe I'll show you a knockout in subsequent experiments where i i they don't go with the flow. If you block these uh well okay the experiment I already showed you if you block the receptors they don't migrate in the flow direction. But is that one of the flow receptor? Sorry? Can you exclude that that one is also sensing the flow? Ah yes, these cells have a direct mechanical way to sense the flow. Is that what you mean? Yeah, I mean the receptors could do different things. Yeah, I mean the receptors could be different. They do. I'll tell you that in a second. There's actually a competition because the mechanical sensing that these cells employ actually has them go upstream. So anyway, there's this chemical thing. where your ligand binds or is that you know a whole market of the entire receptor? Oh, no, uh I don't know, actually. Uh I don't know actually. Because you know if the receptor had like a dual function right then you could kind of simply argue along those lines that maybe they maybe after all they are not sensing they are doing it via the nigga they are doing it directly the information information. I guess it's it's it's down to how much no I don't know that I don't know I don't know how they biotechnically knocked it out. But the other thing is you can estimate the speed the cell would need to go if it just was like flowing along with the fluid. And it's much faster. With the fluid. And it's much faster. So these cells are, you know, they're not along for the ride, is what I hope. They're going faster. They're going slower. They're going slower. I'm having a hard time thinking about this profero probabilities. Can you convert that to like a flux? Because you have a finite time, and can you say that by that time there would be because like sort of the each time you detect it correctly a move for us, you dig Correctly move for us, you get incorrectly voted. The other way can you do that? Uh I don't quite know what you mean. Like a s okay, I mean 100% error means zero flux because you have 50-50. So, but like 50%, I'm just saying that I think there's that error you can convert it to a flux. And that's what they measure experimentally, right? The flux of the cells. Yeah, I'd have to think about that. I think it's a monotonic. I'd have to think about that. I think it's a monotonic relation, right? So if you get zero percent error, you have 100% of the cells going in the right direction. If you have 100% error, you probably have 50-50. But I I can't think. Probably some saturated function. Yes. Yeah. You, oh, sorry. Do you think it would help? You had shown that when the cells moved, the actant has polymerized on the side of the act. What would happen if the release is also unassertable? If the release is also an aspect of it, it gets positive feedback from the content itself. Yeah, I think that actually might be happening, because I think that would help. We don't have an analytic way to deal with that. And we haven't done simulation. But you could imagine, like, you know, yeah, receptors which receive more molecules are clustering together or something, and that's helping it not be an isotropic reception process. So we have checked what happens. We have checked what happens if receptors are like patchy, and it doesn't really matter. Well, I meant the release of the leader. But patchy. Oh, that's true. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, but you can imagine there could be some ramp-up process of feedback and that things get more and more precise as the hours progress. So that should improve the bound. Okay, very good. So I think I'm almost out of time, right? I think I'm almost out of time, right? Okay, so I will just leave you with one follow-up experiment, right? So four years later, as I mentioned, these cells were placed in a microfluidic device where a little more control could be had, where not only the flow speed and things like that, but also the cell density could be controlled a little bit more. Controlled a little bit more. And what this group, the group of Roger Cam, found is that when cells were at low density, then the same thing happened as I've told you before. The cells migrated with the flow. But when they were at high density, they migrated against the flow. And, you know, sparing the biochemical details, they basically showed that these were because of two competing mechanisms, and the migration against the flow was due to direct mechanical sensing via, you know. Sensing via focal adhesion kinase and endogrins and things like that. And in fact, when they blocked the focal adhesion kinase, then cells once again migrated with the flow, but much more weakly. So essentially, what their picture was, is that there's these two competing mechanisms, and at high cell density, mechanical sensing takes over, at low cell density, chemical sensing is the dominant thing. And so, you know, what we've focused on next is trying to just understand why chemical sensing, as I've talked about so far, would fail as cells become denser and denser. And I think it's fairly intuitive, right? If this cell is trying to detect a bias in its own secreted molecules, but it's getting lots of hits from molecules secreted by other cells, that's essentially providing a background concentration of corrupting signal. Concentration of corrupting signal for that for any given cell of interest. And we've done more calculations, which I'm going to skip. And essentially what we found is that indeed the anisotropy that we've calculated does fall off as a function of cell density. And that agrees with simulations where we actually get the fluid flow field right, et cetera, et cetera. But the most important thing is that the two experimental densities that I showed you are sort of at this sensitive point where the curve transitions from just being always good at sensing to down here where the error is so bad that nothing could be sensed. So we've sort of taken this experiment, asked what our theory would predict, and seen that it's sort of right in the quantitative ballpark. Of right in the quantitative ballpark to explain this process. Alright, so skipping over this, this is sort of what we're doing currently. Ask me if you want to know. And what I've hoped to have shown you is that, you know, simple arguments, a la, Berg, and Purcell, when applied to complex behaviors of cells, can actually tell you something about what they can and cannot do. And that's my time, so I'll leave it at that.
