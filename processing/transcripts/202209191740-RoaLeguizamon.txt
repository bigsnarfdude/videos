Thank you, Frank, and thanks to the organizers for the invitation and for the opportunity of this talk. So today, I'm going to talk about certain topological and geometric properties of the modular space of vector bundles on surfaces. In particular, I will define the segregation for round-to-vector bundles on surfaces. This is a joint work with Hugo Torres and Aletisa Mora, and the final version of this work can be found in Advances in Geometry. Well, so I had divided the talk in four parts. In the first part, I will recall some definitions and results about the modular space of the turban surfaces. Turban surfaces. Then I will define the segregated invariant for ranked to vector banana surfaces. I will show that this invariant induces a stratification of the modular space. And I will study the stratification when the surface is the project plane. Finally, I will show some applications of this stratification. Of this stratification related to Brill Nether theory. Okay, so I will denote by X a smooth, irreducible, complex project surface. So let H be an ample divisor on the surface. And I will say that a vector bundle on X is a stable on Moon for Tachemot stable. Of moon for tachemoto stable, if for all proper sub bundles the slope of the sum bundle is less than the slope of the vector bundle, where the slope is defined as the degree of the vector bundle divided by the rank of the vector bundle. So, I want to emphasize that the definition of stability depends on the choice of the ampo divided by. On the choice of the ample divisor. So, in the 70s, Maruyama, Giseke, Simson, Itakemoto proved that there exists a modular space of stable vector bundles with rank n and fixed check classes C1 and C2. So these modular spaces had been. These modular spaces have been of great interest for their connections with several branches of mathematics, principally with differential and algebraic geometry, simplectic geometry, and mathematical physics. However, there are a lot of problems that remain open. So the following questions. So the following questions are open in general. Determine for which values of the rank and the fixed chart classes is the modular space non-empty. So determined topological and geometric properties of the modular space, such as connectedness, irreducibility, rationality, the dimension of the modular space. Dimension of the modular space. So, for these questions, there are results that call for any surface. For instance, it is known that the modular space is empty if the discriminant is less than zero, and the modular space is not empty if the discriminant is big enough. Is VNO. Also, Donaldson, Lee, O'Grady have shown that the modular space is reduced, smooth, and irreducible whenever the second chart class is big enough. And there are other results for specific surfaces. For instance, the geographic flooring has been answered for Been answered for K3 surfaces, a variant surfaces, the projected plane. And when the surface is rational, the modular space is reduced, irreducible, and rational under certain conditions on the rank and the HR class. So now, the first thing is that the class is the Now, in order to get topological and geometric properties of the modular space, we extend the concept of the stager invariant for vector bundles on curves to run to vector bundles on surfaces. So let H be an ample divisor on the surface for a run-to-vector bundle. The segregated The segregated variant is defined as the difference between the degree of the vector bundle and two times the maximum degree of a line subbundle, where the maximum is taken over all subline bundles of the vector bundle. So the term invariant is used because Is used because it doesn't change under tensor product operating bundles. And it is easy to check that the, oh, it follows that the vector bundle is stable if and only if the segregation is greater than zero. The segregation is always a finite number because the degree of all suline bundles. Of all suline bundles is bounded above. So, and we say that a line sub-bundle is maximal if it computes the segregation and for this for this bundle, for this line sub-bundle, maximum, the vector bundle can be written. The vector bundle can be written in this sub-sequency where the quotient is a torsion-free and I see the ideal chief of a scheme of co-dimension two. Okay. So, an important property of the segregated variant is that the That the second invariant induces as logos in continuum functions on families of rank two vector bundles parameterized by a variety. In particular, this property implies that implies that this property induces a stratification of the modular space. modular space of the vector bundle or the modular space of vector bundle into locally closed subsets according to the different values of the to different values that the function can take okay in what follows um i want to study this stratification when the surface when the surface is the projective plane so any questions so far Support okay. So okay recall that for please recall that for vector bundles on the project plane, there is a unique notion of stability with respect to the line bundle of one. Line bundle O1. So by a boost of notation, I will denote the degree of the vector bundle as the first year class. And I will write the second variant as the difference between the degree of the first year class and two times the maximum degree of all suligned values. Also, Also, because the segregation doesn't change under tensor profile binders, we can assume that the degree is equal to minus one or zero. It depends if the degree of the vector bundle is odd or if the degree of the vector bundle is even. And we restrict our attention to the case sig one equal to zero. one equal to zero. That means the degree of the vector bundle is even. So the case when the case C1 equal to minus one is similar and we obtain similar results. So when the degree of the vector bundle is equal to zero, we can write the segregated variant as As the as minus two times the maximum of all shoot line values. Okay, so again, I'm interested in studying the stratification when the surface is the projected plane. So among the different questions, the different questions in which I'm interested related with this stratification I'm interested in the following question so what which which possible values can the function take or what numbers can appear as the segreg invariant for a random vector bundle on the projective plane for those values for those For those values, for those values, for the different values of k, are the stratonom empty? What is the dimension of each stratum? Is the stratum irreducible? What is the segregated variant of a general bundle in the modular space? And finally, I want to use this certification to get in. Get information related to Brillotter theory. So, any question about the questions related to the stratification of the Wingular space? Okay. So, the answer for these questions, for the four first questions, is given by this. Is given by this theorem. So, in this theorem, we prove or we determine all possible values that the function can take. And for each of these values, for each value of k, we prove that there exists a stable vector bundle such that the segregation variant is equal to. Is equal to 2k. So additionally, we prove that each stratum is irreducible and we compute the dimension of each stratum. And we prove that there is a stratum with the same dimension, with the same dimension of the modular space. That means that there is a strat that there is a stratum. There's a stratum that contains the general bundle. So let me give the idea of the proof. So for the proof, the idea is to use circuitspondence. So circurespondence is a method for constructing run-to-vector bundles. So the idea of the strategy is Or the strategy is choose a scheme of coins, two such that this pair satisfies the Cali-Baccara property. If you recall the previous talk, Pedro explained very well the Caliba-Baccara property. So we, so for our theory, we need to the Determine a scheme such that this pair satisfies the Kali-Baccara property. So we prove that if C is a skin of co-imension 2, such that C is not contained in any curve of degree 2k minus 1, then the pair O2K minus 3 satisfies the Satisfies the Caliba Cara property. Then we have an extension where E is locally free, and since C is not contained in any curve or degree 2k minus 1, we can prove that E is stable. In this point, we need to prove that O minus K is the maximal sudline bundle for the vector bundle E. The vector bundle in. For this, we use again that the skin of co-imension 2 is not containing any curve or degree 2 chi-minus 1. And we conclude that with this condition, O minus K is maximal. Is maximal for the vector bundle in and it follows that the segregated invariant is equal to 2k as we decided. So in order to compute the dimension of this stratum, we note that any element in the stratum can be written in this Can be written in this sequence. So the elements in the stratum are parametrized by extensions. So the dimension is obtained by counting parameters of these extensions. And we conclude that for each possible value of k, the stratum is irreducible, non-empty, and Non-empty, and we compute the dimension. So with this theorem, we answer the first four questions. And as corollary of the previous turing, we prove that we determine all possible values of k. That the function can take when we consider the modulus space with first class equal to 2r or equivalent, the degree is even. In this case, we compute the dimension of each stratum, we prove that each stratum is irreducible, and And we determine conditions for which this number, this number k, can appear as the segreg invariant for a run two vector bundle with this invariance, with round two, first class equal to two r, and the search class greater than or equal to r squared plus two. Okay. Okay. Since any element in the stratum can be written in this sub-sequency, the segreg invariant is naturally related with the vector bundles that admits at least the number of sections that admits. That amid the sudden bundle. So the second invariant is related with the brilliant letter theory. Recall that the brinetor locus is the determinator variety consisting of the vector of stable vector bundles that admits at least three independent sections. So, using the segreg invariant and using the stratification, we prove that, okay, we determine certain breeding letter loss size, which are non-empty. We prove that for the second child class big enough, the dimension of certain brain nettle loci are Brilliant loci are bigger than the Brinnetter number, and we again we compute the dimension of certain Brinnetter loci. We determine the dimension that the dimension the abound of the dimens of the sections that emits a vector. Admits a vector bundle in certain stratum. And finally, we gave an alternative proof that the modulus space of vector bundles satisfies Webblineter. So the advantage of our proof is that Workproof is that we describe the open set that satisfies with brineturing. So I will stop here. Thanks very much for the nice talk. Are there any questions from the audience here in our hacker? Yes. Take time. So you mentioned something about codimensions to set. Yeah. Remember? Yeah, remember in the cariba cara property, yeah, exactly. So, uh, for P2, do you have an idea where how this set should looks like or okay for P2, the skin of convention two are points, so we need to ensure that these points Points that not contains in any curve or degree 2k minus 1 in order to prove that there exists a stable vector bundle such that this line bundle is maximal, but we don't have more information about the configuration of that points. We only We only can say that these points are not contained in any curve for degree 2 minus 1, but can be interested in studying the configuration of such points. Yeah. So do you have at least an idea of how many points should there be in said or something? No. Because I mean, you written like that, it could be just one point. It could be just one point, yeah. No, and that's of course false. I mean, one point will not work because it could be contained in a core, but the you could choose, I don't know. Okay, okay. No, I'm not sure about the configuration of points. Okay, no. Are there any other questions in the audience here in Oahaka? I had a question. I mean, what about other algebraic surfaces besides Pay2? Can you say something about that or some product surfaces? Okay. Actually, I trained to make to study this stratification for historical surfaces. Okay. It's the next step for that invariant. Do you know already what you could expect? I mean, you can calculate those invariants. I mean, you can calculate those environments, you think? No, no, no, I don't have resources yet. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Are there any top questions in the Zoom audience? Thank you. Thank you, Frank. Hi, Lel. Can you repeat, please, what do you say about Greek pre-nether? Okay. Chad, did you have an alternative proof? Have an alternative proof, okay? Yeah, yeah. So, uh, Gautian Hilsho wish proved that the modular space of run-to-vector bundle satisfies we brand, we bring netter. We bring nether precisely with those numbers, with those c1 and yeah, yeah, c1 greater than zero and c2 equal to two plus this number and. And we gave an alternative proof for this theorem? There's something a little bit odd about C2 because that's C1 squared plus C1. Shouldn't that be a cohomology class of in H4? Or am I confusing things? Yeah, yeah, I confusing. Can you repeat the question, please? Can you repeat the question, please? I don't understand. Right, there's something so so you have C2 equal to 2 plus C1 squared plus C C one. That C1 is odd. I think that we real letter, real letter is the commonly vanish. H zero, H one and H two is equal to zero. I think that the definition is is wrong. think that the definition is is wrong the condition of c2 is equal to 2 plus square c1 plus 3 c1 over 2 is equal to the Euler characteristic is equal to 0 okay Oh, I see. So that oh, I see, I see. So that's a condition on the Euler characteristic of yeah, yeah, yeah, with these numbers, the Euler characteristic is equal to zero. We prove that, okay, the opening statement. Are those the conditions, the conditions of Gotche and Hirschowitz? Yeah, yeah, so are the same. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. All right, so you gave an alternative proof for that precise theorem. Okay. Yeah, and the this and this equation. The advantage of our proof is that we determine the open set that satisfies we bring letter. Yeah, we describe this open set. And this open set is the stratum with the maximum dimension. Stratum with the maximum dimension in our stratification. Okay. But you still have... Okay. Maybe I can ask you later. Okay. In case there are more questions, I don't want to monopolize. Any more questions in the audience or in Zoom? Yes. Juan, let me give you that. I don't remember if the segregated variant was defined only for stable or is all vector wonders. Okay. Okay. You can define the segregated variant for run-to-vector bundles. In fact, the segregation is defined for higher run-to-vector bundles on curves. And we only define the segregation for run-to-vector bundles on surfaces. For run-to-petroleum on surfaces, because we use the circle respondence, and the circle respondence is only for is a method for constructing run-to-vector bundles. But you can define the second invariant for any run-to-vector bundle. It is not necessarily stable. Stable. If the vector bundle is stable, the segregation is greater than zero. If it's semi-stable, the segregation is equal to zero. And if the vector boundary is unstable, the segregated variant is less than zero. Okay, that was my question. The values of the segregated variant. And does this stratification separate this stable, unstable, and Stable, unstable, and substable, or that is not reflecting in the okay. We are only interested for a stable because we have a family of rand two vector bundles parameterized by the modular space. So, the idea is stratify the modular space in order to get topological and geometric. Topological and geometric properties of the modular space. Okay. It can be interesting to study the segregation for unstable or semi-stable vector bundles. Okay. And the last question is for the non-empty stratum, do you know some properties that for the vector bundles in each stratum? In each strata. So, for example, in a stratum, the vector bundles living in that have some property different from the other, the state, the vector bundles on the other strata. Okay. Okay, if I understand the question. Okay. Okay, the second invariant. Okay, the segregated variant can be okay for the mole space of vector bundles, the segregation has be positive, but not all numbers can be attained for the segregation. It depends the degree of the first class of the vector bundle and the rank. For instance, for rank two vector bundles on P2. to perturb P2 only the numbers that of the only the numbers two to k can be can be appears can be appeared as the segregation for rad to bento boundary okay that thank you You had another question? No, no, I can. I think I we have still time. Okay, if there are no more, nothing in the Zoom, okay. There are no more questions. Thanks very much, Leonardo, for joining us. It's a pity you are not here, but thanks very much for your nice talk. Okay, and this finishes. Yeah, we should give applause.
