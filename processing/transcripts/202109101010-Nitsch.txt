I want to talk about several papers. It's a joint work with Bella Pietra, Scala, Trombetti, but also I want to mention some work in progress now with Dorim Tukur and Nahon and possibly also others. Also, others. So, I want to start with a very simple example. So, consider a set, smooth set omega, and we have a temperature distribution, and the temperature is one inside your set and zero outside. Okay, zero is just a reference temperature. So, you have to think of, I mean, a couple. A cap of t so constant temperature and then the outside temperature. Okay, we fix it to zero. And assuming that the heat exchanged, the heat is exchanged via convection, which is one of the most important mechanism, then the heat loss rate is basically proportional to the perimeter of the set. So the convection is, I mean, with conduction. I mean, with conduction is the most common, I mean, heat transfer mechanism. And usually you have convection when you have a solid body in, I mean, inside a fluid, which can be water or can be air. So, I mean, the cup of a tea on the table is a very good example. So, the heat rate loss. The heat rate loss, so it's, I mean, it's the heat flux across the surface, so it's something which is proportional. I mean, you have the ux and then the sigma, which is the surface element, and it is something which is proportional to the value of the temperature times the surface element. And then you integrate over the boundary. Of course, since you are integrating, I mean, using the trace of U from the inside of omega. From the inside of omega, so basically, this since u here is one, it's telling it's just a perimeter. So, and then I will use a constant beta, which is something which is has some physical meaning. So, beta integral of u over the boundary of omega will be the heat rate loss. Okay, so of course, for this very simple example, then by the isoperimeter. Then, by the isoperimetric inequality, both minimize the heat dispersion among sets of given volume and some and temperature. Okay, so that's something which any cat knows when sleeping, okay, achieved this round shape. So, at this thousand of years before the prince dido. So let's make it just a little bit more Just a little bit more complicated. So I take a set omega and okay, still, and a set A, which contains omega. And then they are both smooth for simplicity, okay? And U is one inside, and then U is harmonious. The U is harmonic, okay, over here, and then and then U satisfies this boundary, okay, condition on the boundary of A. What does it mean? It means that I'm taking my set omega and I'm insulating my set omega by adding something on its boundary, and so this. And so, this has to be understood as an insulator. And so, now convection is on this external boundary, and there is conduction. Conduction means that the temperature is basically the temperature is continuous, and the heat flux is also continuous. Okay. Okay, in this case. Okay, in this case, okay. Why I'm choosing this condition, okay, but the Robain boundary condition and beta is the same constant I used before is actually this means that okay, the heat flux is proportional to the temperature, okay, okay, so. So this robent boundary condition is the one which encodes the convection. Okay. Okay. So somehow the cat we was considering before now needs a coat. Okay. I'm placing a coat outside the cat. Okay. So how can I look at? I mean, when I look at the solution, I can handle. At the solution, I can understand the solution as the minimizer of this function. Okay, among what? Among among okay, it's a minimizer of the gradient of v square in A plus the integral of V square on the boundary of A. And then here is the parameter beta. And then Then v is h1 in h1 of a, and v is greater or equal than one in omega. Okay, so when I minimize okay, this functional in this class, then I get a solution to this problem. Okay, okay, okay, and then so what So, what is this f of v, this functional I'm considering over here? Okay, let's call this f of v. Then, if I compute the functional on the solution, then I get beta integrated, beta times the integral of u over the boundary of a. So, and this is the heat raise loss. So, this is the heat. So, this is the it okay, and so without the insulation, I have beta times the parameter. After the insulation, I have beta times this integral, and it is not immediately clear that insulating is something good, indeed. Okay, this is a Okay, this is a. I mean, if we consider instead of convection, so the Dirac Lay boundary condition, so conduction, I mean, it's immediately clear that insulating in the same way, it's always something good. But in this case, no, because since the heat rate loss is something which is proportional essentially to U, but also to the perimeter, when I add some insulator. I mean, for instance, my set omega is a convex. I mean, I'm always increasing the perimeter. Okay? So, and this goes, I mean, this goes to an increasing of this, I mean, hey-trace loss. On the other side, since U is harmonic here, and there is one, and the normal derivative. Is one and the normal derivative on the outside boundary is negative, then u is less than one of one on this boundary, outside boundary. So this goes in the right way. So there is a competition. On one side, I'm increasing the perimeter. On the other side, I'm decreasing u. And it's not clear that it's always winning in the sense that the heat rate loss after insolution is better. Okay, so. So, and okay. Next question is: assuming I give you a not, I mean, it is related with what I was saying, but assuming I give you the set omega and I give you a certain amount of insulator. Okay, so is there an optimal way to choose A? So, the displacement of the insulator? Display at the displacement of the insulator among all possible sets, okay, of given volume. So I give you a fixed amount of insulator and I tell you, use it all and use it at the best possible way. And I mean, this problem is ill-posed. So the answer is no. There are some cases in which, for I mean, for instance, if I take a small disk. A small disc, and they give you, and I give you a small amount of insulator. And I, I mean, let's take a disc. Okay, let's take a disk of whatever radius, and I give you a small amount of insulator. So, a small amount of insulator with respect to what? Small amount with respect to the parameter beta. Okay, so then there is no way. Then there is no way you can place the insulator around this disk in order to decrease the iterate rate loss. And this is something which engineers know very well when they insulate a tube. You always see this pipe, okay, with a huge amount of insulator around. And sometimes you can see pipes which are insulated and the diameter increases twice, like in this case, but sometimes even three times, four times. Times, even three times, four times, five times. You will never see a small disk around the pipe because they know that then you might do something worse than not insulating at all. Okay, and this is something which can be explicitly computed for the disk, okay? Because you, I mean, you have the solution, it's explicit, and you compute here the integral of u over the. integral of u over the over the boundary of a and then you realize that there are situations in which it is somehow uh it's it's not uh i mean a good and it's not good to insulate if the insulator is not enough okay so okay uh and this regardless the the way i use the insulator okay so the shape of a and so this problem is is ill-posed because i mean Because, I mean, in the end, I might find out a solution which doesn't use A. So I have to do, I mean, a weaker, I have to give you the freedom not to use A, the insulator. So is there an optimal way to choose the set A among all possible sets of volume not greater than a certain value. Greater than a certain value. So I allow you to use, I mean, not a full amount of insulator. And then the answer is yes. And it's kind of surprising that this very, I mean, fundamental problem, I would say, found an answer only in 2016 by Kafarelli and Krimstoff, this paper on communication on partial differential equation. And okay, I want to. And okay, I want to explain why it's sort of kind of difficult because, okay, you look at the variational formulation. So somehow you consider the functional f v functional of v and a. So this functional depends on the set A and depends on the function. And it depends on the function v, and somehow you're minimizing among all possible v and a. Okay, so v is a function which is h1 in a. It is greater or equal than one in omega. Omega is given, okay? And the volume of a is less or equal than a certain constant with zero, okay, okay. Okay, so it's clear that if you are in this setting over here, then as soon as A loses, I mean, regularity, you might be in trouble in defining all these quantities. So, what they did, they found this clever, weaker formulation in the Formulation in the SBV settings. Okay. So V is a function in SBV, and then V is between 0 and 1 in Rn, and V is identically equal to 1 in omega. And then they have a penalization term over here, which is the one which somehow fixed the amount of insulator, in which way, adding to the functional, I mean, the set A in this case. Set A in this case is just the support of your function. So the set where V is greater than zero. Okay. So this is a penalization and lambda is greater than zero so that you are somehow you are not allowed to use as much insulator as you want. And then, okay, okay, this is the absolutely Okay, this is the absolutely continuous part of the gradient, and then this, of course, is something which replaces the integral of v over the boundary of omega. And then I consider, they consider just a sum of the square of the upper and lower limits of V on the singular set, SB. Okay? Okay, so this is a weak affirmation. Now you can somehow use compactness in SBD, but you need some clever estimate. Just, I don't want to enter into details, but I mean, the idea they had is that they actually proved that whenever you have a minimization sequence, you can always replace it by another minimization sequence, which is strictly greater. Which is strictly greater than some constant delta zero, which depends only on omega and nothing else. So in that case, this one turns out to be a perimeter term. No, so I mean, yeah, somehow is the perimeter of your set omega and A, and then you gain compactness. I mean, once you know. I mean, once you know that these two guys over here cannot be bought, I mean, can, okay, sorry, I might say I replaced, they replaced it with a with a minimization sequence either V is strictly greater than zero or V tilde. Okay. Sorry. It identically zero. Okay. So this means that This means that these two guys over here, they cannot be both very close to zero. And so, and this allow you to, I mean, have compactness in SPV, okay? Because the singular set cannot be too big, okay? Okay, so okay, so So then we very recently asked the following question. If we fix the volume of omega and we allow omega to vary among sets of given value volume and we fix an upper bound for the volume of A. Is there a set omega tilde and a set A tilde such that the heat loss Such that the heat loss rate is the least possible. So I'm somehow asking the same sort of isoperimetric question I was considering in the beginning. Is there the best possible set omega and the best possible set omega A? So that I allow you to, I mean, to use any omega. To use any omega of given volume and any A of volume, which is less or real than a certain constant, and the answer is yes. And maybe it's not surprising, but it was quite a bit of work to prove that indeed it is always, I mean, the ball is the set omega is omega tilde is a ball. Is a ball and then A is either a concentric ball or it is so A tilde is either a concentric ball or it is omega tilde. So either I use the full amount of insulator or I don't use insulator. And so you have this change of regenerative. Change of regime. So, somehow, okay, if I want to, I can enter in the details. So, somehow what we are doing, okay, let's get stick to Libsheet's domain so that we can use, okay, this formulation over here. I'm considering, okay, I repeat, I have a function u which is one inside omega, and that it it is harmonic in between omega. It is harmonic in between omega and the external pulmonary, okay, in this in A minus omega, it is harmonic, and then it is continuous, of course, across the surface of omega, and that there is, okay, here a robain boundary condition on the boundary of A. Okay, so the heat loss is this one. So whenever I choose a couple omega. Whenever I choose a couple omega and a, then I can call omega sharp is the ball having same measure as omega. Okay, this only shard and then. And then you have two different regimes. So you have if, okay, this ball has a radius which we can call r, and then if r is less than n minus one times beta. Okay, if r is If sorry, okay, if r is less than n minus one times beta, then sorry, okay, see, okay, yes, okay, then there is a R zero such that if I have enough amount of A to I mean enough amount of insulator to uh to such that A becomes a ball of radius greater or I mean or equal than R0, then it, I mean, I will choose A to be a ball. But if the volume of A does not allow me to, I mean, take A a ball of radius larger or equal than Radius larger or equal than R0, then it's better to have A coinciding with omega sharp. Okay, so basically, I mean, there is a threshold value for A such that below that the threshold value, I don't use insulator above the threshold value, I use the full amount of insulator. Okay, then in if R is greater than n minus one times beta, then I mean I mean omega sharp omega oh sorry then I will always I mean you use the full amount of insulator and I will use the symmetrical configuration okay so it's both omega shar on both omega and A are both okay so these are the I mean somehow these are the two regimes These are the two regimes. And so the proof is a little bit complicated. I don't want to talk about this. It's still a work in progress. And I want to go a little bit farther. And I ask myself, I mean, okay, what if the temperature is not constant in omega? Okay, so what if I make a little bit more complicated and I use More complicated, and I use the stationary heat equation inside omega. And I consider this problem over here. So now, I mean, I have a heat source inside omega, and I'm considering the stationary heat source inside omega. Then u is harmonic in between, I mean in omega, in sorry, a minus omega, and then high. And then I have convection on the exterior boundary, so Robin boundary condition on the exterior boundary. And this is a continuity of the heat flux. I mean, since I'm considering a domain omega, which is some solid, conductor solid, and then I'm considering some insulator around, it's quite reasonable to think. Quite reasonable to think at these two solids to have different conductivity properties. So, if the conductivity of omega is one and the conductivity of the insulator is delta, and delta is to be understood much less than one, since an insulator has a low conductivity, then across the surface of omega, so if I consider the trace of u. Consider the trace of you from the, I mean, from the inside and from the outside of the boundary of omita, then I have to consider this boundary, this condition over here, which is the I'm preserving the heat flux, but there is a jump in the normal derivative of the temperature. Okay, okay, so and now again, I want And now again, I want somehow to discuss the optimization. So, how should I displace the, I mean, if I fix omega, how should I displace the insulator around omega in such a way that I'm optimizing? I want to discuss in which sense the insulation. Okay, so the temperature in this case, U. In this case, u is a minimizer in H1 of A of this function over here. Okay, so if you work out the Euler Lagrange equation of G, then you end up with this system over here. Okay, and so here is where the parameter delta, the conductivity, appears. Appears. Here is the heat source. Okay. And if u now minimize, I mean, if you is a solution to that problem, so it's a minimizer, and then I compute this guy on the function u, which is a solution to the PD problem, then, okay, you integrate by parts, and then you end up discovering that g this time is minus one half. Minus one half f times u integrated over omita, which now is not the heat rate loss, it's what we can call heat content. Okay, if you think of, I mean, the most simple case f is equal to one, then you end up with the integral of u, which is the total amount of it. So with the minus. So minimizing g means. means maximizing the heat content. So in this case, a good insulation is one which makes the temperature as large as possible in this sense, in the sense of integral of Fu. Okay, so now, I mean, I want to change the shape of A in such a way that G of U becomes the least possible, so the heat content is the biggest possible. It's the biggest possible, okay? Now, now, okay. Uh, let me, oops, let me do, I mean, this problem is, I mean, a little, I mean, it's more complicated than the one we have seen before. So, we want to analyze a very particular case. So, let's consider. Let's consider sigma. I mean, let's parameterize A, I mean, in this way. So I call now sigma epsilon, because A becomes just a tiny layer around omega. Okay, so and epsilon is somehow the size of this thin layer. T goes from zero to epsilon. goes from zero to epsilon. h is a function defined on the boundary of omega. Omega is as moot as you want. And then so epsilon h is this length over here. So epsilon is somehow the order of the size of the layer, but then it's h which describes where it is thinner and where it is thicker. Okay, and fixing the amount of material, I mean the insulator means that I'm fixing basically the integral of h over the boundary of omega, over the boundary of now. Let me let me see, let me write this is omega sigma epsilon. Now, sigma epsilon now. Epsilon. Now, sigma epsilon now is just the layer outside, okay? So, and okay, in the function h can be even just a measurable function, okay, in what in our computation, okay. Positive measurable function. Okay, so uh, so we fix this m and then. And then you consider the functional g is a functional of v, but then I explicitly write here epsilon delta, because these are two small parameters. This delta, I remind you, is the conductivity, and epsilon is the sides of the, I mean, the insulator layer. And so what we want, what we What we do now, we consider somehow the limit as epsilon and delta go to zero. Okay, and we want to, I mean, get rid of the sigma epsilon sigma epsilon and to somehow look at the problem asymptotically. Okay, so what is the limiting problem? And this has been done in the past by for similar problem, but starting with Similar problem, but starting with a Diricle boundary condition outside by several authors. I mean, Brezi Friedman Caffarelli, but also Acherbien Butazzo, Cawall and Huligu. And so now we are doing this starting with the Robin boundary condition outside. So now, of course, epsilon and delta can go to zero with different speeds. Can go to zero with different speeds, but there is only one regime which is interesting. I mean, if epsilon goes too fast, then it's like not insulating because it means that the insulator is disappearing. Okay. So, I mean, what does it mean pushing epsilon and delta to zero? It means that I'm using less and less insulator, but an insulator which is, I mean, I mean, as delta goes to zero, the insulating properties increase, okay, because the conductivity is decreasing. Okay, so this limiting problem is actually kind of useful if you think, I mean, I'm insulating a building, the building is huge solid, but the layer I'm using is few millimeters sometimes, centimeters. So the volume compared to the volume of The volume compared to the volume of the solid is negligible. Okay, so if I can use somehow a limiting problem, it can be, I mean, of help because, I mean, even numerical simulation, because I cannot compare the sides. Okay, so okay, so the only interesting case is where basically epsilon. Basically, epsilon and omega are the same or are proportional in the limit. Okay, so they go to zero with the same speed. And if you do this, you can perform the gamma limit. This gamma limit is performing in, I mean, delta epsilon is going to one. So if you do this, if you do this, if you do, if you perform gambling convergence, then you realize. gamma convergence then you realize that this function gamma converges to a functional of which depends on v and h so delta has disappeared epsilon has disappeared and you get you have a memory of what is the thickness of the insulating layer in this function h which is over here so this reminds you that there is a A thin layer of insulator, okay. And then you take this function and then you minimize among all i mean the minimum u in each one of this functional over here satisfies the stationary heat equation minus Laplacian U equal to f with this modified Robin boundary condition where here there is this h of x. There is this h of x, which is a function on the boundary of omega. So it's a robin boundary condition, but non-constant here. Okay, so okay. And so then you, what you want to do, you ask yourself, if I fix this integral, what is the best possible age? H which maximizes the heat content. So I want to find the age which maximizes the heat content with this constraint among all age, which are just measurable. Okay? It's okay. And then, okay, there is this. Okay, there is this paper with Francesco della Pietre, Cardo Scarlet and Cristina Trombetti. And in this paper, we prove that among all H measurable with the prescribed integral and all U in H1 of omega, which are related to H, I mean, if I pick an A, H. If I pick an A H, I get a different U, of course. So then I have a couple H tilde U tilde minimizing this function, okay, where U tilde and H tilde, okay, solve this problem. Okay, so actually this means that there is a This means that there is a best way to put the insulator around your set, okay? So, and also we have a relation. I mean, we have a relation which links H tilde and U tilde, but it's kind of weird to write it down and useless. But I mean, there is a way to get H tilde from U tilde explicitly. Okay. Okay. Somehow, as you can understand, H tilde. As you can understand, H tilde has to be somehow proportional to U tilde. In the place where the temperature on the boundary is higher, then I will probably put more insulator. And when it's lower, I will put less insulator. Okay, it's clear. If I look at my building and I know that here is warmer than there, and I have to preserve the heat, I will put more insulator in the hotspot. And that's what happened. I mean, anyway. Anyway, and then there is another, maybe even more interesting result which tells you that let m be greater than zero and for simplicity f equal to one. Okay. For whatever couple UH solution to the to the problem. To the problem with such constraint, then you have that the integral of u is always less or equal than this quantity, which is a weird quantity, but this is a kind of isoperimetric inequality. And the quality indeed holds if omega is a ball and h is constant. So some other. H is constant. So somehow I have an upper bound of the it content in terms of perimeter volume alone. And then, okay, omega n, this is the measure of the ball of a unipole in Rn. And here n is the dimension. M is this constraint over here. So the equality holds when omega is. Omega is a ball, and H, I mean, and the insulator, H is constant, so the insulator thickness is constant. And that's, I think I'm time is finished or not, almost, yeah, yes. Well, it's 35 minutes usually, and now 39, so I think we can. 39. So, I think we can, yeah, so, but if you want to take one minute to conclude, there's no problem. Yeah, no, okay, no, I can, I can, I could show how to get this one, but it's okay. Maybe it takes a little, takes more than one minute. I mean, I'm just saying that this is, this inequality is in the same spirit as many inequality, many isoperimetric inequality, like I don't know, Palenti estimate, okay? Estimate, okay? So when you estimate the somehow L, if you consider minus Laplacian of U equals to F in omega, U equal to zero on the boundary of omega, and then you know that the L P norm of U is less than L P norm of V for every P. For every p greater or equal than one, and then this is in omega, and this is in omega sharp, and omega sharp is the solution, and v is the solution to this problem over here. So f sharp is the dark symmetrization of the function f, and then v is zero. This is in omega sharp, and this is on the boundary of omega sharp. So these are talented type s. And so this goes in the same spirit in the sense that I'm comparing the solution on the non-symmetric case to the symmetric case, and I'm somehow getting an upper bound for my solution. But I mean, we open sort of, I mean, very recently, we understood how to get Talenti type estimate when you deal with problems. Problems where u is non-constant on the boundary, which was for a long time believed to be almost impossible because talenti estimates are related somehow to Polyzigo inequality. And you know that when you have Polyazygo on Polyazigo, when you deal with the Polyzigo, you know that it works only in very special cases, for instance, when U is constant on the boundary, but if you have a function which is If you have a function which is non-constant on the boundary, then I mean it's false. So somehow we open a new line of researching where we were able to deduce for Roben boundary condition palenti type estimate. And this result goes in this direction. So, okay, so thank you very much. Thank you very much again. Thank you very much, Carlo, for this very interesting talk. Talk. Is there any question from the audience? Can I make some remarks on this last Talentis estimates? Okay, right. What are these Talentis estimates? When you write down the solution of the second equation, you essentially write down V as the risk potential of F. And that's what Talenti does. that's what Talenti does in essentially in essential global way because you do nothing i mean so therefore if you if you change the boundary if you change the boundary values you can still rely on up to the boundary version of uh risk potential estimates so it is uh so so the outcome is that you don't i i'm not really sure you need rearrangements to do that to do this one to to get estimates of this To get estimates of this api, I mean, it's just a translation in terms of language. You can interpret the right-hand side as a solution of that problem, but you can also interpret as the risk potential of F, whatever it is. No, no, no, I'm using RD-literal inequality. Therefore, when you want to bound U via D and so forth, what you're actually doing is you're bounding U via the risk potential of the right-hand side. So, if you want to translate. Side. So, if you want to translate this in terms of a solution to another equation, you can, but there is no additional information. And so, in this respect, you can also imagine to get boundary estimates without relying on the synthetician methods, but just getting up to the boundary with risk potential estimates, which is completely feasible in the linear case. What this might suggest is try to use risk potential and then the very specialist. What I want to say is the following. What I want to say is the following. You might like to write this inequality in terms of a rearrangement, but actually, it's an inequality involving U and the risk potential of the right-hand side, actually in terms of rearrangements. In fact, this was done also for the gradient by Andea and Vladimir Mazia, where they use. So the point is that, and at the end, the ingredients are the same because, in order to prove Talenti's estimates, what you do is Talenti's estimates, what you do is to use this Stampakia truncations and the Georgi's iteration in a continuous manner using isoperometric. But what you actually do is that you bound U via the risk potential of the right-hand side. So at this stage, you can also, in a way, forget about the right-hand side equation. So it is conceivable that you get an estimate using different boundary values if you can go up to the boundary and get some. The boundary and get some risk potential estimates. In this way, what you probably need is that the boundary has something like called Alforce regularity. You need just some measures or satisfies the Binger criterion or something like that. So it's better to realize this also in these different, more direct manners. And at the end, what you do in proving these risk potential estimates up to localization is the same more or less. Localization is the same, more or less, the same ingredients that you get in Palientis inequality. So it's just a term, a form. I mean, it's something that it has something to do with change of terminology, but what you're really doing is that you're bounding U via the risk potential of the right-hand side. In fact, when you write down explicitly the solution of the right-hand side, the Rickley problem, then you go into polar coordinates. Problem, then you go into polar coordinates, and this is explicit. But what you get is just a rearrangement of the risk potential. And that's what, for instance, what Andrea and Mazia did for the gradient, when they are able to show in an integral way that they can rearrange, they estimate the rearrangement of the gradient via the rearrangement of the essentially of the risk potential. And yeah, I think you also did something like that, right? Right, I mean, so principle approach is reasonable. The point is that they are looking for optimal constants, yeah, and so if you just want a bound, then this is probably possible. But if you're looking for optimal constant, then that's a different story because you need minimize. Somehow, this is optimal because you achieved the quality on both. But this was just to make a connection. But this was just to make a connection. Oh, no, it's just to make a connection because sometimes people use terminology using these rearrangements, but they forget that at the end, what you're really doing is to get an estimate via risk potential of the right-hand side. And then that's a clever way to do it. I mean, we are writing down because essentially what Talenti does is that is having this global Stampakia type iteration of the Georges via co area. Via coarea, and then he writes down what he gets, and then he realizes that at the right-hand side there's a rearrangement of the risk potential, and then it's a solution of something. But let's stick to also to the first equation just to get more information. Okay. In fact, the first paper in this direction, if I remember it correctly, was by Weinberger, and his approach was by representation formula by a green function. By green functions, and this is in the spirit that Rosseri was saying, but that was for a very special equation. Yeah, but in fact, Talentis technique works directly for a non-linear problem. So it's intrinsically non-linear because it's essentially this global stamp act via an integral. In fact, I mean, many of these results are measured out. They are essentially They are essentially covered by Talentis techniques because they do not realize probably they are doing the same things. So it's just a change of terminology, but this is the connection. So it's also, but can you get the optimal constant with any boundary value? No, of course no. No, no. Assume you replace this with the replace this with the no this one and this one with the same one then then we recover not all the norm LP norm but some of them and it's okay then I think that then you could also use an approach a more direct approach we also know that it is impossible to get all the norms so it's kind of very tricky tricky Very tricky, tricky. I mean, not, I mean, in the in the optimal in this one, okay. I'm this is a different problem where you have a different uh, I mean, so it's a borderline behavior. It's some some we are always looking to at the optimality, okay? So I'm always looking at something like this, okay? So L p norm of u, l p norm of v, no constant over here. So, and then and then we know that it very much depends on f and uh i mean. And I mean, in the sense that you can write explicitly some condition on F which allows you to get all norms or some of them. And so it's a more general fact that I want to point out. I mean, if you have different boundary values, then you do not have to stick necessarily to this rearrangements technique because they'll push you together. Of course, you forget, yeah. No, but of course, but it depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking at estimates, a priori estimate, okay. If you look at something which is optimal because you are looking at the best possible way to do something, then okay, you have to use, I don't know, I don't know, I mean, I know how to use rearrangement, and I don't know about other techniques in this. No, but the point I want to stress is that when you use rearrangements, Is that when you use rearrangements, you're actually using global versions of local versions? Because when you use rearrangements, then you're making some intrinsic comparisons, and then you get just in a way by chance the solution to the right-hand side problem. But what you're doing is you're getting something that is the risk potential, but in a global way. So you could also do it in a local way, and this allows you to get something more in some cases. Something more in some cases. Okay, thank you. Any other questions? So, thank you very much for these questions and comments. And thanks a lot again to Carlo for this nice talk. We will, so I will stop the recording. Oh, no.
