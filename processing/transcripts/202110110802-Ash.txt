We're delighted to have Avnarash here to tell us about the homology of arithmetic groups and Galois representations. Thank you very much for inviting me. I plan to talk about these topics in fair generality for about the first half of the lecture. And then at the end, I'll talk about some work, specific work I'm doing with Darren Dow. So there's a So there's a base field for our coefficient system. And it's quite interesting really to replace k by any ring, but then things get really hard. So we'll just keep k afield. All right, so here are the basic actors in a story. On the homology side, I'm going to work with GLN, just the usual general linear group. But you can think of this as a general reductive algebraic group if you want. A lot of what I'm Group, if you want. A lot of what I'm going to say at the beginning works for any reductive group. Then, if you take the GLNZ, you take a subgroup of finite index, we'll call that gamma, and that's an arithmetic, you can think of that as a general arithmetic group. And the important groups I'll be talking about later is gamma naught of n, defined there. It's the usual generalization of gamma naught of n from S cell 2 theory. Theory and then there will be a Nebantite character, also a generalization from the SL2 theory. Okay, on the Galois side, well, GQ is the Galois group, absolute Galois group of Q, and I'll mean by Galois representation a homomorphism like that that's continuous. And in this talk, I'm only interested in the semi-simple components of rho. There's a lot. Of rho. There's a lot of interest in the possible extensions of those things of each other, but that's way too hard for me. So we'll just do semi-simple, unramified outside a finite set of primes. And then there's this thing called oddness, which is really important. It's defined like this. If you apply rho to complex conjugation, then the eigenvalues have to have the same number of ones and minus ones to the extent. And minus ones to the extent possible. So, and although in characteristic two, all the Geller representations are odd, therefore. All right, to go back to homology now, we have to add on to the group a semi-group like that, and then we form the algebra of double cosets in the usual way. That's a Hecke algebra. Okay, this Hecke algebra contains. Okay, this Heke algebra contains some very important elements, T sub L K. Again, this is all generalizing from SL2 theory. This stuff was done by Shimura in his book in the 1970s. Okay, so now for homology, we need a group and we need a coefficient module. And it's traditional now to call the coefficient modules weights, because again, we're generalizing from the SL2. We're generalizing from the SL2 theory. So, what I'll call a weight is an irreducible module, finite-dimensional over the field, and the whole semi-group has to act on that module. And the key example of this would be the highest weight modules for GLN. So, the irreducible modules for GLN are parametrized by integers A1 up to AN. There's A1 up to AN. A1 is the biggest, and then they get smaller and smaller to AN. And then you tensor with the Neben-type character. That's what that epsilon means. And you let gamma-naught of n act on this. If K is the complex numbers or something, then it's just the regular module. But if K is a finite field, then this is a mod P module. A mod P module, and gamma naught of n will act through its reduction mod n, mod p, mod p on the f part, and then mod n on the epsilon part. And then the key fact that makes the whole theory go is that the Hecke algebra acts on the homology of gamma in one of these, with coefficients in one of these weights. All right, so now we have to connect up. We have to connect up the Galois side and the homology side, and we do it with this definition. If you have a Hecke eigen class with a bunch of eigenvalues, so we assume the Hecke algebra is a commutative, so it has simultaneous eigenclasses. Then we say that the Galois representation rho is attached to this class Z. If the characteristic polynomials The characteristic polynomials of row of Frobenius elements for almost all L are given by this polynomial on the right-hand side, which is built out of the Hecke eigenvalues and some powers of L. The thing on the right is called the Hecke polynomial. So we say that the row is attached to Z if the characteristic polynomials of the probeniuses are the same as the hecapomius. Frobeniuses are the same as the Hecke polynomials. Again, all of this comes out of the SL2 theory. So the connection goes like this. I'm assuming rho is something simple. So if rho is attached to Z, we know its characteristic polynomials on a dense set in the Galois group. And so that determines rho up to isomorphism. On the other hand, Z, there can be many different Z's. Can be many different z's that have the same rho attached, even for the same gamma naught of n. And those multiplicities are quite interesting, I think, although I have no particular use for them, but we don't know how to explain them in general. Okay, now Schultz proved this really great theorem that says... Sorry to have interrupted you. The definition above doesn't seem to depend on Into different we there's a Z there, it has these eigenvalues A L K. You see my cursor? I see the eigenvalues different. It's the eigenvalues, so you start with Z, you get a package of eigenvalues, and then that determines the concept of a temperature. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, anybody please just interrupt. Please center up meaning whenever you have a question. Okay, so Schulze proved that in, this is also true in characteristic zero, but let's concentrate on characteristic p, that basically any Hecke eigen class has a Galois representation attached. So I had conjectured that around 1990, and then Stoltzek came up with this. And then Schulze came up with this amazing proof of that. So that means that by studying a homology of gamma naught of n, we get a window into a world of a certain number of Galois representations. Furthermore, row has to be odd. The question of even rows is really interesting, but it's hard to know how to approach that using homology. And even if you know that œÅ is attached to Z, I don't think it's been proven how to find the smallest level N and sort of the smallest or which weights W the attachment occurs for. So that's an interesting area. All right, now I want to just give a survey quickly of some of the uses of Galois representation. Representations for studying homology of arithmetic groups. Of course, we should definitely mention that they're used for proving Fermat's last theorem, etc. And so that's old-fashioned now. Okay, one thing that we use it for is providing a check on our homology computation. So a lot of the research I do with my great collaborators is computing homology of different gamma-naught of Homology of different gamma-naught of n's. And then if we find a Hecke eigen class, we look and see: is there a Gaela representation that seems to be attached? We can't really prove that it's attached because we can't check, in larger computations, we can't check enough Frobeniuses. But for all the Frobeniuses we do check, the attachment relationship holds. Holes, and that gives us confidence that our homology computations are correct. Another thing that you can use the Gala representations for is naming and describing Hecke eigenclasses. So if you're talking over the telephone to someone, you say, Oh, I've got this Hecke eigenclass that has such and such a row attached, and they say, Oh, yeah, we know that one that's here, blah, blah. Also, the attachment. Also, the attachment, the specific kind of notice that the rhub can be reducible. I'm especially interested when it's reducible. And when it's reducible, we say it comes from the Borel-Slair boundary. And the shape of the Galois representation can help you figure out what part of the Borel-Slare boundary that comes from. Okay, another thing we can use, the Galois representation. The Gala representations for is to prove that certain differentials in certain spectral sequences vanish. And when I get to the other part of my talk, I'll give an example of that. Another thing that can be used, they can be used for, is if you've got a Galois representation, then you can go looking for a Z that might be attached to it. And those are conjectures that go in the opposite direction. Are conjectures that go in the opposite direction from Schultz's theorem. And I'm going to talk about those kinds of conjectures also later in this lecture. Another thing you can do is by comparing what's called the eigencurve and comparing that to deformation spaces of Galois representations, you can predict the sizes of The sizes of the torsion in the homology of gamma. That's something I can't do myself, but Venkatech or somebody like that told me that that's how they came up with their conjectures to this asymptotic growth. So that's just some applications. So, specifically in my own work, just to give you instances of these applications, in the work I'm doing with In the work I'm doing with Paul Dunovs and Mark McConnell, we're computing for congruent subgroups of SL4Z. And so, as I said, when we find Galois representations attached to Hecke-eigenclasses, we get a check on the correctness of the computations. We get insight into the Borel-Sair boundary. The homology of the Borel-Sair boundary has not been computed in general for gamma naught of n in SL4Z or any higher group. Group. And so that's an interesting thing to study. And also, we've been looking for cusp forms. And a good sign of a cusp form is if we can't find a reducible Galois representation attached to it. Okay, another example is work I've been doing with Don Yasaki, where we use certain computations for gamma, naught, of n and SL3Z. And I think he's going to talk about this in his lecture. Going to talk about this in his lecture later in the conference. So he'll explain, I suppose, how we use the Gala representations. The Galois representations helped us figure out what conjecture to make, actually, for this interesting subspace of homology classes that are constructed using the units in a real quadratic field. Okay, now I'm going to start moving towards Now, I'm going to start moving towards the other part of my talk, which is a theorem I've been working, trying to prove with Gary Dowd. And it's motivated by this conjecture that we made, which is a generalization of Serre's conjecture for SL2, for GL2. And so the conjecture is that if you have an odd Galois representation, Odd Gala representation, and it doesn't have to be irreducible, just any odd Gala representation. It should be attached to a Hecke eigenclass in the homology of some gamma naught with some weight. Now, the level n and the neighbor type epsilon and the correct weights are predicted in terms of rho. In terms of rho. Also, I'm modifying the conjecture from the way it was originally stated to allow gamma naught plus minus gamma naught and n, except the determinant can be minus one. That's just a technical point. The set of weights that we predicted in our published conjecture has been enlarged by Florian Herzig, and I don't think the Herzig, and I don't think the complete set of weights is even conjecturally known. I mean, this conjecture is not proved, so of course it's not known what the correct set of weights is. But even as a conjecture, in general, it's not known. When n is equal to 2, this is Sayer's conjecture, which is a theorem. When n is greater than 2, it looks really hard to prove. To prove. And one thing I'm interested in is the dimension, the degree I, homology, in which these Galois representations are attached. It would be interesting if that could be pinned down better. Okay, so now in the remainder of my talk, I'm going to discuss a joint work with Darren Dowd. Our ultimate goal is to prove the Goal is to prove the conjecture for reducible rho by induction. Okay, assuming that rho is the sum of odd irreducible pieces, and we'll assume the conjecture for those pieces, and then we'd like to prove the conjecture for rho. This should be doable. I mean, for irreducible rho, the conjecture, no one I think has any really good No one, I think, has any really good ideas as to how to attack the conjecture. But if you make this induction assumption, then you're sort of in the world of Eisenstein series and Borelsaire boundary and things where you're reducing to smaller cases. And this should be doable. But we have found it extremely difficult. And we're nowhere near a general. Near a general theorem like this. What Darren and I have done in the past is: well, do the case of GL3, do the case of GL4, do a general case except with very strong assumptions on rho, stuff like that. So, what we're working on now is the following. This is quite a bit better theorem, I think, than what we've done in the past. We've done in the past. We have to assume that the level, and n is the sereconductor of œÅ. We have to assume that n is square free. That's a technical thing that shouldn't be necessary, but all of our computations have been based on that assumption. I assume the characteristic of the field K is positive and sufficiently large, and I'm only going to work with two components. So I'm going to assume that rho is a sum of two. That rho is a sum of two irreducible components. Okay, here's the idea of how we're going to prove this. First, we're going to look at a parabolic subgroup of gamma, which I will define in a few minutes, and show that œÅ is attached to this homology of this parabolic subgroup. And then lift from the parabolic subgroup to all of gamma. All right, so here's some of the definitions we need. So we start with a parabolic subject of GL, and what's that? That's the stabilizer of a flag of vector spaces in Qn. So it's conjugate to something that looks like this. These are blood. Something that looks like this. These are block diagonals, where the blocks, size of the blocks correspond to the dimension of those subspaces. And then P has this decomposition into a Levy component, which is just the diagonal blocks, and the unipotent radical, which is the rest of, which is the unipotent part of P. Okay, so now if I take a congruent subgroup of SLNZ, I can intersect it. I can intersect it with this parabolic subgroup, and that's what I'm calling a parabolic subgroup of gamma. Then it has its unipotent radical, and then the L, for L, it's not a good idea to take gamma intersect L. You have to take the quotient of gamma p by gamma u. That's not necessarily isomorphic to gamma intersect L. Gamma intersect L. So we have this exact sequence by definition. And this is in general not split, which is a cause of a lot of headaches. But when you have an exact sequence like this, you can form the Linden-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. Standard spectral sequence from group theory. All my life, I was calling it the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence, but I have recently been informed. Recently, I've been informed that Linden thought of it independently at roughly the same time. So we'll call it the LHS spectral sequence. So you can see that what that's going to let me do is go from the homology of gamma L to the homology of gamma P. It's important that you can get the Hecke algebra to act on all of these objects. Algebra to act on all of these objects. And the spectral sequence is Hecke equivariant. That means all the differentials in the spectral sequence are Hecke equivariant maps. Okay, so let's see. Here's some more tools we need. We're going to need the TITS building and the Steinberg module. So I'm just reviewing quickly the TITS building. Well, if you don't know it already, then the only important thing about it is that it's a simplicial complex and the stabilizer of the simple complex on which GLNQ acts. And the stabilizer of a simplex is a parabolic subgroup. That's what's important here. Okay, and furthermore, Okay, and furthermore, this implicit complex, its reduced homology is zero, except in the top dimension. And so the homology in the top dimension is a module for GLNQ, and it's called the Steinberg module. And I believe there's going to be some interesting talks on the Steinberg module later in the conference. Okay, so here's what we do. So here's what we do. We take the Steinberg module and we form the chain complex on it over K, over our base field K. And we include the augmentation map on the right there. So we get a sequence that is almost exact sequence there, except at the top, the homology, at the top, the homology is the sequence. At the top, the homology is the Steinberg module tensored with K. All right, so look at that for a second. That's a complex of G L and Q modules. And whenever you have such a thing, you can form the homology of a group with coefficients in that complex. But first, we'll tensor the complex with our weight. Tensor the complex with our weight. And so that's flat W over a field. And so we'll get another complex. And then we take the homology of gamma with coefficients in that complex, and we get a spectral sequence. And again, it's important that the Hecke algebra acts on this spectral sequence in an equivariant way. Okay, so to describe the spectral sequence, we have to look at the stable. We have to look at the stabilizers of the cells, and the indexing is a little bit off because of the way we set it up. The zero index corresponds to the full group GLNQ. That's correspond to the augmentation at the end. And then we get this spectral sequence, which converges to the homology of gamma with coefficients in the Steinberg module tensored with W. Censored with W. And we use Shapiro's lemma to identify the E1 term of the spectral sequence. That's a pretty standard thing to do. And since gamma intersect P will be the stabilizers in gamma of the cells, their homology comes out there in the E1 term. Okay. And the leftmost column, when I is zero, Is zero there P is the honorary parabolic subgroup G L and Q. So the leftmost column is just H, is just the homology of gamma itself. And then to the right of that, we get the homology of gamma intersect T for various P's. All right. So we're going to be using this spectral sequence. And here's how, here's what we're going to do. We're starting with rho. Rho is the sum of two eerie. Rho is the sum of two irreducible Gala representations, and I want to show it's attached to a Hecke eigenclass. Now, if I can get it attached to a Hecke eigenclass for a maximal parabolic subgroup of gamma, which is shown here, Z in red, if I can find a Hecke eigenclass in the E1 page of this spectral sequence. Page of the spectral sequence, then I'm happy. So here's what happens: the D1 differential goes one step to the left. If Z survives under the, if Z maps non-zero in the D1 differential, then there's a Hecke eigenclass with rho attached in Hj of gamma W, which is what I wanted to prove. To prove if z goes to zero here on the left-hand column, then it survives to E2, then it's in the E2 page. Well, I have to make sure it's not hit from the right anywhere. And then, yeah, that's what I should have said. It survives to the Z2 page if it's also not hit from the right. And then it'll survive to the E3 page if it's not hit farther from the right. And the E4 page, it'll survive. Farther from the right in the E4 page, it'll survive to E infinity if it can't be hit from the right. All right, so that's how we use the spectral sequence. So here's our strategy. We're going to show that rho is attached to a Z where I said it should be, for a maximal parabolic subgroup. And then we show, this is a completely separate theorem. We show that if you have a Galois representation attached to a parabolic subgroup, Representation attached to a parabolic subgroup. Question: No question. If we have any Galois representation attached to a parabolic subgroup of gamma that has k blocks, then tau is the direct sum of at least k irreducible pieces. If that's true, then all of the Gao representations attach to Representations attached to all of the Hecke eigenclasses to the right of Z, all those Gauer representations are sums of three or more irreducible components. And by Schulz's theorem, we know that every Heck eigenclass on the right does have a Galois representation attached. So we use Schultz's theorem plus this theorem, and then none of those Hec eigen classes on the right can hit Rz because the Z because the rows are different. I mean, the Hecke eigenvalues are different. Okay, so the second thing shows that Z cannot be hit from the right. So if I can show star and double star, then we've proved our theorem. Okay, and the proof of double star is not too hard. We had proved that already in a previous paper. So the hard part was showing that rho was attached to Rho was attached to gamma, to a homology class in gamma p. And that's sort of an interesting problem just on its own. So how are we going to do this? So we'll start with Gala representations which are attached to Hecke eigenclasses. attached to Hecke eigen classes and I want to show that their direct sum is attached. Okay that's what I want to do and the first step is to attach sigma one plus sigma two in other words to attach rho to a Hecke eigenclass of gamma L and gamma L itself is basically G L N 1 cross G L N 2 so there's a kind of Kunneth formula except you have to check that it's Hecca You have to check that it's hecca equivariant, and so we proved this theorem that if you have a maximal parabolic subgroup of GLNQ, then it has unipotent radical U, and then its Levy component L will basically be L1 times L2. And if you have a module for each of those, then you let M be the Then you let M be the tensor product of those two modules. If you have a Hecke eigen class for each of those L i's, then you can create the tensor product eigenclass, the tensor product class in the product that'll be gamma L. And if each of the individual Fi's is attached to a Gauro representation, then the tensor product is. Representation, then the tensor product is attached to this sum of the two Gauer representations. There's a certain shift here that occurs because of sort of things in the unipotent radical that are just sort of hanging around and not doing much. So that's that first, so that theorem lets us get rho attached to a, if, you know, it's on our, using our induction assumption. You know, on our using our induction assumption, we'll have rho attached to gamma L with some coefficients m all right. But that's not what we want. I mean, what we need is to get rho attached to the coefficients of gamma L in this module. It has to be, you know, this is what appears in the E2 term of the LHS spectral system. LHS spectral sequence. So we need the coefficients to be HJ of gamma UW, which in general is not a it's not the tensor product of two modules. Somehow, though, we have to first figure out what it is as a gamma L module and then hope that that gamma L module actually equals the L-module actually equals the M that appears in our Kuna theorem, or at least A is a submodule of it, or somehow related to the M that we need. Now, this turns out to be much more difficult than you might think, or at least either that or we're not too smart, or both. But this is hard. It's not at all clear. So implicit in everything I've been. Implicit in everything I've been saying is that the modules, the homology modules, are always modules for the group, and the group acts through reduction mod P. The group needs to act through reduction mod P. That's what we call admissible. It is not at all clear that gamma L acts through its reduction mod P on the homology. On the homology of gamma u. That turned out to be a difficult issue. However, we weaken admissibility a little bit. We say that this module has a finite filtration where the quotients are each admissible. We call that F admissible. And then we can prove that in this special case where P is a maximal parabolic subgroup, then we can prove that H. subgroup, then we can prove that HJ of gamma uw is F admissible. So that's a technical thing, but it needs to be done. And for non-parabolic subgroups, I don't know how to do that. It would be really, really interesting to have a good theory for all parabolic subgroups. But a lot of what I'm going to say in the next two minutes, we can only prove for maximal parabolic subgroups. Okay, so first we have to prove that we're in the same ballpark. We're in the same ballpark that we started with. Then, what we want to do is we would like to know: as an gamma L is basically G L N 1 cross G L N 2. And so we know what its irreducible representations are in terms of highest weights. We would like to know this homology, Hj of gamma U, with coefficients in some way. Coefficients in some weight. We'd like to know what this is as a gamma L module. Now, in characteristic zero, if W is a finite dimensional representation over the complex numbers, Constant proved a theorem, that beautiful theorem, that identifies this homology of gamma U with coefficients in a finite-dimensional irreducible module, Hj. HJ, he identifies that as a representation for gamma L. That's called Constant's theorem. All right, his theorem and its proof are for characteristic zero. It is known that his theorem verbatim does not generalize to characteristic p. And in general, it's just not known. When W has very When W has very small weight, then things are known. But it would be really nice to have a mod P constant theorem. So that's a desideratum. So we need, in general, we would need both these things in order to proceed on our quest. Luckily, we're able to get the result we want in the case when J is the top dimension of for. dimension of for gamma u when j is the rank of gamma u gamma u is an abelian group so because gamma u is an abelian group and i'm only and i only need it in the top dimension i can work with my bare hands and i don't need you know fancy costum theorem or anything so we just look we just view this as the homology of a torus and we obtain this theorem This theorem. So, in the case where P is a maximal parabolic subgroup and I'm working with gamma naught, then I can identify the, I guess this should say this J here. There's a misprint. So, this J should be N1, N2. So, it's only this is only in the top dimension. Only this is only in the top dimension. I can identify this homology group as a tensor product, just what I needed: a tensor product of the L1, of an L1 irreducible module and an L2 irreducible module. Okay, so I'm in good shape there. All right, so knowing all the above, I get that. That rho, the sum of sigma one plus sigma two, is attached to a Hecke eigenclass in the E2 page of the Linden-Achildster spectral sequence. Few, okay, but now it's only in the E2 page. So I have to show that it survives to the E infinity page. To the E infinity page. And this, I've been beating my head against the wall. Well, I mean, I think we have a proof now, but we've been going crazy for like over a year trying to do this. We've come up with several false proofs, but I think we have a true one now. Okay, now this is another thing that is specially difficult in characteristic P. The Linden-Hochschutzer spectral sequence for a parabolic. Sequence for a parabolic subgroup of gamma is known to degenerate at E2 when you're working in characteristic zero. But again, these methods don't seem to work. I mean, yeah, they just don't work really in characteristic P. I do not know whether the spectral sequence. The spectral sequence does or does not degenerate at E2 in characteristic P. I really, really doubt that it degenerates, but I don't have any examples of that. However, we can use certain kinds of Hecca operators in this. Operators in this particular case where J is the top dimension of gamma, of the homology of gamma u, then I can show that if you are in E2, you will survive to E infinity. And the proof of this is inspired by one of the ways of proving the degeneration in over a complex number. Over at complex numbers. And since I have an extra minute here, I'm going to just tell you about this idea because I didn't make a slide for it. I didn't know I would talk so fast. But the point is that if you can take what we call semi-scalar matrices, those are just diagonal matrices where there's one scalar for the element. Where there's one scalar for the L1 part and a different scalar for the L2 part. And those semi-scalar matrices are in the center of gamma L. And so they act on this E2 page. They act on the E2 page, and you can try and get their eigenvalues to be different on the different parts for different I and J, you want their eigenvalues to be different. And then the spectral sequence will be equivariant. Spectral sequence will be equivariant for those. They're kind of like Hec operators, and you'd be home free. That's how that's one way to prove this degeneration in characteristic zero, because there's lots and lots of eigenvalues. Problem is in characteristic P, these eigenvalues start repeating, you know, like they're different integers, but they become the equal mod P. So we have a way around that. So we have a way around that by using the integers in. Let me get back here. We use integers, we use heck operators based on integers in algebraic extensions of Q. Okay, so I'm just going to finish by trying to state carefully the theorem that I think we can prove. And the last part that we're checking, the reason I say think is because we're checking this last bit about the degeneration. Checking this last bit about the degeneration of the Linden-Haushild spectral sequence for our classes. But assuming that's correct, then we'll be able to prove this theorem. Rho will be an odd Galois representation of a square-free Sarconductor. We take any, so this is the big deal for us: that there's no restriction on the little n in GLN. The little n in GLN. We can do this for any two irreducible representations, sigma one and sigma two. We take their direct sum. They have to individually be odd because we want the conjecture to hold for them. We take their direct sum and call that rho. And the n has to be square free. Then we prove that rho is attached. That rho is attached to a Hecke eigenclass where it's supposed to be. And we can also check then that the weight F and the Neben type are the correct ones and the level N, I should have said. Everything is correct as predicted by our conjecture. Okay, so now we would like to generalize these methods to K irreducible components where Components where k is bigger than two. And here are the problems that face us in doing that. Oops, where'd they go? Here are the problems. Okay, yes. No, they're no problems. Okay, so we can, we can, by induction, I can get rho attached to an eigenclass for gamma p for a maximal parabolic subgroup. That's great. That's great. But now I can't use that Galois argument anymore. Z now may be hit from the right in the tit spectral sequence. So we're stuck on that. An alternative approach would be to get rho attached to a parabolic subgroup of the correct type. I mean, if rho is the sum of k irreducible components, then that really should the natural place to look. The natural place to look for it would be in gamma p, where p is a parabolic subgroup with k blocks. And when you do that, then the Galois argument works great. Z cannot be hit from the right. However, now maybe I don't know how to show that K is in the kernel of the higher differentials. So the dual problem pops up. Anyway, and I just want to stress above: if there's anybody who wants a nice research project, I think a mod p constant theorem would be. A mod P constant theorem would be really interesting, and also a better understanding of the Linden-Hochschild spectral sequence for parabolic subgroups of arithmetic groups. So thank you very much to the organizers for organizing the meeting and inviting me. And thank you all for listening. I'd be happy to answer any questions. I'd be happy to answer any questions if there are any. Any personal questions? I have a question. Can you hear me at me? Yes. I'm curious about the degree sentence. That's something that's remaining to be read about. Can you talk a little bit about that? It's some degree things happening in the comment section. Some of the reason we've talked about it in the Community Publications, yeah. So that's so that's really interesting. So, first of all, um, well, it's known because of Poincar√© duality, things will tend to appear in two degrees at least. But for example, so okay, so in for in characteristic zero, you have the concept of a cusp form. Zero, you have the concept of a cusp form. And the analogous thing in characteristic P, we call quasi-cuspital. It's basically something that restricts to zero on the Borelsair boundary. We would expect that quasi-cuspital things could only exist in what's called the cuspital range, which is a small range of middle degrees where cusp forms can occur. In other words, we expect the mod P behavior to imitate. Behavior to imitate the characteristic zero behavior. That's something that might be a doable, I don't know. Anyway, that would be interesting. Any narrowing of the degree that you can prove would give you a power to prove our theorem in more cases. So, in one of the papers Darren and I did, we assumed that irreducible things could only appear Irreducible things could only appear, irreducible rows could only be attached in the cuspidal range, and that enabled us to show that certain things in the spectral sequence couldn't be hit from the right. So if you have a good, if you have better control on the degree I, then you have better chance of showing that you can't get hit from the right. Thank you. Any more in-person questions? In-person questions are there any questions from people over Zoom? Hi, so I'm wondering, so you have some weights here, but because you're considering mod P representations, there's some version of the conductor where you just take trivial weight, weight, right? But if you increase the level structure enough, is that something that you can prove? So if you, right, if you put P If you, right, if you put P into the level, then you can just consider trivial weight. So that, yeah, so there's, there's two, so on the one hand, we're really interested in the exact weight and the exact level, right? Because that's what you want when you apply Sayer's conjecture. You want to narrow down. You want to narrow down the weight and the level, and then you can check that the Z doesn't exist, and then you've proven something about the Galois representation. So that's why we're fixated on that. But we could instead say, forget the weight, you know, forget the level, just is rho attached to any Z for any weight and any level? And I haven't really thought about that too much. I assume that that would be quite a bit easier. Would be quite a bit easier. And you might even be able to use the theory of Eisenstein series, at least in a lot of cases, and then reduce mod P. You could use a characteristic zero theory and then reduce mod P. But I don't know. Does that answer your question? Yeah, but I guess so. I have in mind a different approach. One could prove this for trivial weight using with fixed level. I was just kind of wondering if that's something you thought about. Wondering if that's something you've thought about, and if that's still an interesting result. Oh, okay. No, I haven't thought about that. That would be great, though. Yeah, that would be really nice. Thank you. Do we have any more questions? Oh, I actually let me just say one more thing. Trivial weight is really good. I mean, so trivial weight is. I mean, so trivial weight is very small. And then the constant theorem is known for that. And a lot of stuff you can do with very small weight, and that would include trivial weight. So that's another hopeful sign. Yeah. Okay, thanks. Thank you, Avener, again. Thank you. Okay, so I have to stop sharing. Yes. So I guess in about 10 minutes, we'll start again with Peter.
