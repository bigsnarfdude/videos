They're both of them. Thanks for the invitation and thanks for coming. So in this in my talk I want to explain how toric geometry can give easy examples of some phenomenon like the following two theorems that I want to state. So the first result I want to mention is John work without speaker options. And we proved that if you consider the model stack, the stack of KCMI stable fun varieties of dimension 3 and volume 12, and also its course, not coarse space, good model space, they are reducible. And reducible doesn't mean just disconnected. It means that there is a point which lies at the intersection of more than one component. Actually, this point that I will construct it at the end lies at the intersection of three components which generically parameterizes smooth funnel defaults. So this is just an answer to Vanya's comment last day that actually this extracted phenomenon you can This obstructed phenomenon you can see also when you see the closure of fun. The second result I want to mention: this is somehow announced by Hamid yesterday. So, this is due to meet now the alphabetical order, Slovania Al and then And then there is an addition by Yushen and myself. So we prove that the following 422 complete intersection in P1 to the five to two. One to the five to two are capable is stable u g default reported three faults but they don't leave in P one two five so So maybe I should recall what Ramidi said yesterday. If you consider the family of Fano tree folds with the anti-canonical volume 4 and P-hide rank 1, these are quartic tree folds or double covers of the smooth quadric, but both of them are lived here. So as a complete intersection of the quartic and the quadric. And the quadric. And so it's natural to think here that all the capable stable generations live here, and the answer is no. Because we found these three toric examples, notice that, okay, so the first equation is aortic, and the other two are cortics. And so the Y's are have a weight two and the X's have weight one. And th these guys don't live here. They actually live here. They actually look here. So, okay, so you have to prove that these are capable stable. That they deform to quartic three force is quite easy because this was actually a general 4 to 2 computer section inside here is a quartic tree force, so it's obvious that the form. And and it's also easy to show that they don't leave here, because here there is only one non-gau rest time point, whereas this guy has two uh non-gau resting points. Two non-governed. Okay. And then you can improve this result by, and this is actually Hamid's talk, where you can take here a general quartic in the axis and the general quartic in the general quartic. So this was Amid's result, what Amid said yesterday. So in my talk, I want to explain how How these two behaviors can be found in diagonal. So quartic threefolds would be the first instance where you can get this type of examples? Yeah, because for cubic threefolds and fourfolds, there are examples. And in the measure to and yeah, I will say it also at the end that actually with toddy jumping methods these are the only examples somehow but that probably I mean stock can be generalized to other examples with other junk, you know. And I mean another mini, yeah. So so So so we have this example like the quintix, the quintix where you start having this non-reducible moduli and I'm wondering if you can make the quintix on I mean basically the moduli of quintic to be the moduli of some higher dimensional funnels. So so so s so some somehow my my reading is that funnels are kind of fake lower dimensional var varieties. But I it's for it. So you want to take like curves or with which dimensional quid? Surfaces. Intake surfaces. So I was just pondering this type of research. Yes, of course you can take quid. 111. And this is one of the funds we'll study. Of course, only one loop is mainly various. Last question. Definitely the property example with what property? What do you think? I mean this type of more degenerate behavior. I mean yeah, um I mean my uh my re my reading of this journal is that things go bad fairly soon. fairly swinging yeah but yeah i as you said i i don't claim that the model is um irreducible yeah yes yeah yeah are there other questions I mean I'm pretty relaxed because I stated my two results so okay so I want to give a very quick um um Introduction to Doric funeralities. So let's fix n lattice of rank n. Then the funeral in n is a polymer inside the real vector space associated with. Real vector space associated slatis such that P is full dimension, so the dimension of P is n. The origin lies in the interior of P and then every vertex of P is a primitive lattice part. So it means that it's a lattice point and between him and the object there are no other lattice points. So an example of this is this part. So here n is equal to zero two and I can see that this is the origin and then this is one zero zero one minus one minus one. And what would be your morning side? And what would be a non-example? Sorry? A non-example. A non-example is no, something like this. So this is the origin. Actually, this is I don't want to talk about toric stars, but somehow here there is stabilizers on this device. Device. And now, out of the fun polytop, you can create sigma P, which is the phase fun. Also called span, it's the same. And what is it? Well, this is the collection of cones over the faces of people. So, for instance, you take a vertex is a face, so you can create the cone over it, the vertex at the origin. Of the ritter, we got it at the origin, the same here, the same here, and also this guy here. And now I denote by xp the target associated with the span. And if you do in this case, you actually get egg. Okay, and then ah, and this is always fun. And every toric funnel arises in this way from funnel monitors. Then I consider M, which is the dual lattice. So notice that contrary to what happens, for instance, in Plette geometry, my polytopes live in the cocharten lattice. So these polytopes B are not moment polytopes. Moment also. And now I tell you what is the moment power of the anti-canonical polarization. And now you have to take the dual lattice. And then you take a duality theory between M and N. And now you can see that the following. And now you can see that the pulse of P, which is denoted in this way, P Zerk. So this is the elements in E1, such that whenever you pair against an element in P, then the dot product is at least minus 1. So this is T is a polytope in M, P polar is a polytope in M. Polytop in M. This doesn't need to be lattice. In general, it has rational vertices. And this is the moment poly of minus kx. So in this case, you get this point of view. Get this part of the so this is the origin, and this is the moment volume of O3 on T2, which is the anti-carbonical. So, in particular, the number of lattice points of the par is exactly the first antipruy genus. And the volume of this is actually the anti-canonical quality. Here it depends if you consider the normalized volume or not. I mean, if you consider the Lebesgue measure, you have to multiply by antibodies. Okay, and the last thing I want to say. That X P is capable stable if and only if the barycenter of the colour is new. So, in particular, this is the So P2 is crippled. Okay, questions about total formularities? And of course, you can also detect, okay, maybe I should say something, detect the singularities in terms of the polytope, if they are canonical terminal, if they are Gorenstein. For instance, GÃ¶ringstein is the same as requiring that this guy is lattice. So this is the PR code reflexive. And in low dimension, smooth track funnels or Gordonstein funnels are classified. But we will not use the declassification to find these examples, because these examples are non-canonical. So there is no list of fun polytopes which are not canonical. So in order to find this example, we have to do something else, and this is what I am going to explain. Okay, now I'm going to say something which sounds like a bullshit. So and I I want to mention like this kind of the holistic or philosophy. Of the heuristic or philosophy, which is usually called middle symmetry for functional arguments. So, so before you so that what you wrote a minute ago, and you quickly erase that was a theorem or the it's a yeah, it's a theorem. Do you mind? Keep let me just it's too late. I mean, it was a nice statement, but I never Yeah. This one? Yeah, yeah, here we go. I think this is proven meeting one another job. This is proven by using monetary geometry quite a lot. Could you remind us who was the pericentral? Not perfect. One and two. CHCHQ. Without the oh, without the sorry. I'm sorry. Very sorry. But I mean i if x is uh um smooth this was uh an earlier result. I mean if you assume the YTT conjecture this was earlier thing because uh the metric was uh was not correct. I think the digital species then for YTT. I knew that this was a complication, this is why I don't know species but it was simple. This is a single single, I think. Paris emperor, is that the sum of the vertices, or is it the barycenter in the sensor? Okay, I can answer this. Peak a triangulation, and then on each simplex, you take exactly the sum of the vertical. The sum of the vertices and then are you really going to hold it on your finger or is it just the bar center of the vertices? No, no, no, no, no, not the vertices. Then we know what it is. But if it is the simplex, it's the same thing. But if it is a simplex, it's the same thing. Can the toric variety be key stable? Sorry? No? Can the toric variety be k-stable? No, because it's the automatic. The torus is always there. Yeah, I knew I I wanted to avoid the ones that are all most important kind of stuffy varies one less than the image and yeah there's a comment for a picture. Yeah, of course. Okay. So now I want to say something which is not related to K instability at all, but this should be thought as a conjectural picture of what moduli of funny things are. I mean of course the the problem of defining what modulo of fun is complicated that as because they are very nasty things. Very nasty things, but I just want to give a a conjectured picture of these guys. And this is due to Tom Coates, Aless Sukorski, Sergei Galkin, Vasili Gorsk, and Altan Suk. So on one side, you can create a new colour. One side you can consider funnel and folks with general singularities. General in the sense that they cannot be improved. So if you want, this should be thought as so these are up to QG deformation. QG deformation. So if you are interested in the smooth funnels or funnels with terminal quotient singularities, these are kind of things that you consider. Or if you want, this should be thought as connect and irreducible components of modeling. Why irreducible and not connected? Sorry? Why irreducible and not connected? Because when you have two irreducible components that intersect, then the guys at the middle have synchronizes which can be improved. I mean, this is uh something that I mean, this is something that it's quite different from general type thing because more or less, also, this is what Rado explained yesterday, when you consider deformations of FAMOs, actually the problem, the non-obstructiveness comes from the deformation of the singularities, more or less. Okay, and on the other side hand, I have special Laurent polynomials in n variables. So and here there is an equivalent relation, equivalence relation which is called mutation. So this guy if you want is a irreducible components of model of pharmaceuticals and these guys are And these guys are, I mean, you have to understand what these things, but in principle, they are something that you can implement in a computer. So if you prove such if there is such a correspondence, you have a classification of irreducible components of model of funds. And how does it work? So it's a sort of annotation or what is the can I ask you to wait? Okay, sorry. Okay, sorry. So I take F and the round polynomial and now you can create the Newton polytope of this. If this F has good properties, and this is summarized by the adjective special here, this is a funopolytope. Here. This is a funnel polytope. So you can create the toric funnel variety associated with this. This is a possibly singular toric funo. And then you want to smooth this guy. So this is a partial smoothie of this. There are some problems. So the first one is that actually you have One is that actually you have to select the partial smoothing of this guy which is somehow compatible with this F. Because there are situations, and this is what I'm going to explain at the end, where you have two F's, which are not equivalent until this, but they are the same polytope. And so this means that you have the toric funnel which lies at the intersection of two reducible components. Okay. Okay. So what I'm going I would need to say is so the first one is to explain the adjective special to explain what To explain what is this equivalent explanation. And then another thing that I should motivate is why if you have two polynomials which are mutation equivalent, then they go to the same thing. So this is why this map is well defined. So my aim is to do the second and the third. I will not say I'm Second and the third. I will not say anything about the first one because I mean it's a technical definition. This is much related to mutation, and I think this is too much for the one hour. So I'm not saying anything about this. Last thing I want to say is that there are situations where you have a fun variety which doesn't admit any total degeneration. So, for instance, if you have a singular guy which the anti-canonical system is The anti-canonical system is empty. Since a toric funnel always has the toric boundary which is anti-canonical, so this means that the funnel with the empty anti-canonical system cannot have any tolerant degeneration. So here to get the subjectivity at least I need to assume that I have with admits product degeneration. Okay, now I'm open to cra to comments and remarks. Commentary? Sorry? Why is this neurosymmetry? Yeah, good question. There is also something that I didn't say at all, but somehow these F's should be thought as vibrations of, I mean, from I mean, from a tall, so from a variety of dimension n onto C, so the affine line, and then the fibers are Calabia's of dimension n minus one. And then there are some results that suggest that some Hodget theoretic period of these vibrations corresponds here on generating functions of certain genus zero grammar environments. Genus zero Grammar-Whitten invariance. So, somehow, here, if you consider these fun varieties up to in symplectic geometry and you consider Grammar-Whitten invariance, this is more or less the same as considering the complex geometry of these functions. And there there is also a derived category statement like homological neurosymmetry, but I don't want to talk about this. To talk about this. Any other question? I mean, where are the Lorentz polynomials easier than the polytopes? No, it's not easier, it's more refined, I see. Because a polytope can add different Lorentz polynomials on it. A different lunar notice on it. So that's what we're saying, so it's like the polyhop with that smoke in bed. Yeah, good. That is a perfect thought. This is a word shock. Okay, so now I want to explain what mutations are. So this I called So this I call if you want a generic integration on this chart it's not uh fine. Here right there. So so this is I think the first to consider these are formulas and To consider these are forming Zelbinski and also many, many others. So here I fix an element w in z to the n. So it's a tuple of integers. And I assume that exists on zero. And now this gives a degree on monomers. So for instance, if A is another tuple of integers, then you can create the monomial associated to this. So this is x1 to the a1, xn to the an. And now the degree with respect to w of x to the a is exactly the product between w and a. Of course, if you want to coordinate three things, you should consider a lattice and its core. Okay, and now choose a Laurent polynomial with only monomials at the easy rate. And now the mutation, maybe I should go there. I have one question actually also, which is like, is this a gross hack and kill cost damage theta function? Sort of? It's related to that butter is my state control is not theta function. My statement is not theta function business at all. But I mean, this is the fun only or sequencing or something. But I mean, you can do some theta function business also in this setting, but like for instance, does it have like positive integer coefficients? Yes. And now I want to define what a mutation, so mutation of factor H and weight W. So remember, W is a tuple of integers and they. Remember, w is a tuple of integers and h is a polynomial, Lorentz with degree zero, is the following. So it's denoted in this way: mu wh. So you take the Laurently nominal and then you go to rational functions, and this is a C algebra model. And this is a C-algebra homomorphism which maps x to the a, so it's enough to define homonomials. And this is defined in the following way. You take x to the a, but you multiply h to the power of the degree of a. So if a as If A has degree 0 with respect to W, nothing happens because I have H to be 0. So if the degree is positive, then I multiply by a positive power of H. If the degree of A is negative, then you have to divide by H. And so this is the problem, because sometimes this um doesn't create any so it's not a l a longer uh a rambling model because we have to run very much. Because we have to write the h. So, if your h is not a monomial, then this is not a Lorentz. So, this is why here I have to consider this, not the Lorentz ring. And of course, the same definition works also if here you put the rational function field. So, actually, this is the rational homorphism of the torus. And these are very well studied because if you consider the form, the volume form given by the x1 over x1 wedge dxn over xn, so this is the standard volume form on the torus. This kind of birational transformation preserves this form. So these are, if you want, volume preserving Birational transformation of the torus. And these are very well studied in this country. And these are very well studied in this context of local abial pairs or something like that. Maybe I should mention the names of some people like Blank and Galkin and Ustnich, Grosanakinaki about this. Okay, now let's make an example. So let's fix W. So let's fix W to be minus 1, 2. And now I consider H to be 1 plus X, 1 squared, X2. So notice that this has degree zero and this has degree zero as well, because I have two times minus one and one times two. So this has degree zero, so I can consider the mutation. So I can consider the mutation. And now I want to consider, for instance, consider F, which is this polynomial. And then I want to understand what is the mutation of this polynomial. The mutation of this polynomial, well, x1. So x1 has degree minus 1. So this is h minus 1x1. X1 then X2 has degree two so here I have h square X2 and here I have so there is a I think this is correct I think this is correct. Yes. Okay. And now it's quite interesting that this is a Lorentz polynomial. You don't see at the moment, because here you have divided by h, but actually this is a Lorentz polynomial. And what kind of polynomial it is? Well, it's this one. Okay. Now I want to construct the Newton polytops Construct Newton polytops of these two guys. So the Newton polytop of F, what is it? So let's assume that this is the algebra and so I have this, which is this this. This is this and this is this. So this is the previous polytop of P two. The previous polytrop of P2. And then what is the Newton polytrop? Of the mutation. Then here, this gives this point here. And now h square is you have to take the square of this. So in particular, this is the monomial one inside h squared. Inside h square, and so you need to have x2 here. This is this point. And then I have this and the double. So I have to go here and here. Is it clear to everybody? Okay. So why did I tell you all of this? And this is warranted to be still funnel of what. Sorry? Like the new polytop is. If this was fun, of course, this is fun. How did you choose H here? H has to be very special to get this paul. Yeah, properly. It has to be somehow the convex Somehow, the convex, the Newton polytope of this has to be an edge. Indeed, I mean, up to translation, the Newton polytope of this is exactly this edge. And so, what I have done is removing this edge here and then adding twice this edge here. There is also a combinatorial description of what happens on new polytops. So, you can define mutations on polytops without mentioning. On polytops without mentioning your ant polynomials. And this is exactly what I more or less suggested: that you remove things in negative heights and you add things in positive heights. But if I write this, it's going to be a mess as well if I do not see the height of this. I mean you're interpreting this as moment polytopes? Yeah. Yeah, in a dual world that would be the case, but this is taking place in the N lattice. It's the mirror of that transformation? Yeah, probably. Okay, now I should mention this attitude to Nathan. Which we are, if f and f prime are ramp denominations related by amiguation, like these two that I just said. And now you take P, the Newton polytop of the first and the Newton polytop of the second. And assume that both of them are Fano, then these two Tauric final parities are deformation parameters. So there is a flat proper family over P1 such that the fibers of zero in the first story variety and With the first time variety, and the father of a middle is the second. Okay, so who can tell? So, this is the geometric meaning of this. So, who can tell me what are these guys? So, this is P2. Yeah, this is P two. And this one for now. And this is the first Manetti surface. So the generation of P2 going this way through the space. But this process can be iterated. So you start with this polynomial, which is this one. And then now you mutate this edge, this edge, or I mean, if you mutate this edge, you go back to this one, because it's irreversible. But if you mutate this or this, then you go to the next weighted ejection. You go to the next weight-degree space, which is a further degeneration of this. And you can reiterate, iterate, iterate. And this gives basically the Markov chain of the total degeneration of B2. So let me try one more time. The mirror of the one I said. So you smooth a node on one side of the cycle and you break a component on the opposite side of the cycle. That's the deformation. Yes, I think it. Yes, I think on the dual side you can create basically an affine structure. What is the name? A fine manifold and exactly. Because on the dual side, there's okay. Basically, you have this, the dual of that polytope, and now, I don't know, something that I don't remember exactly where it is, but there is a play where. Where it is, but there is a play where here they dant it and here there's a shear transformation, and now you make it and it becomes glitter. Yeah, for the people that didn't follow this, it's not that much. And those things are what about the same poly stable or something? No, no, here I didn't mention any polystable thing at all. Just uh the generation. Just uh the generations of uh P2. Yeah, but if you have a moduli or something, th those things will represent the same point in the same point. Yeah, I mean I mean in this particular case it's true that there is There is a trivial general. So, this is a trivial in the sense that all the fibers apart from infinity are TP. But there are examples where the fibers in the middle are not even toddling. They are usually complexity one T V varieties. And they might be different from the topic guys. So the generation doesn't need to be isotrival. Make sure that they're in the same cables that are right? Kind of close or so basically the idea is that mutations give a one skeleton of an irreducible components of model So So the zero strata are the tolly guys, and these are connected by these functions. So you have the tort guy, you mutate, you go to another toric guy, and then you mutate again. And again, I mean, this maybe it can be mutated in different ways, and so you create a kind of a tree of, so it's a one skeleton in the component in the literature component. Okay, now I want to give you the ideas of the first two results that I mentioned. So the converse of this, this is also true that if two toric vinyls are information equivalent, then there is some mutation evolving. All of these are known theorems. So somehow they are just heuristics and um so the only result in this field is this, I think, which is um a sufficient criterion but definitely not uh a necessary one. What you said is not untrue. No, there is no conterexample, but there is no theorem. Okay, so now I want to mention how we found this degeneration of quartic prefaults. So the idea is that you start So the idea is that you start from the easiest torque quartic in front, which is this one. Inside this function. So this is a quartic trifold, very singular. Okay. This is a tollic because it's a binomial. And actually one can prove that this is a toric fun associated to the polytope, which is the convex cell of this. This so this should be thought as a simplex, a standard simplex dilated by four and then shifted in the way that the body center is actually the origin. And I didn't say anything about what special organ polynomial means, but you can prove or if you want. Or permit if you want. You can also invoke God and say, okay, let's take this Lorentz. But the idea is that you take this Lorentz here. So, what does it do? What is the mean of this? So, without the four, this is. So without the four, this is the Newton polytope is just the standard syntax with the vertices the origin E1, E2, and E3. So you dilate by 4 by taking, because the Newton polytope of the product is the Minkowski sum of the Newton polytops. And now you translate by minus 1, minus 1, minus 1. And then this is just a normalization thing to add the zero, the co the coefficient of the original equals zero. Coefficient of the origin equals. And this is the mirror, in the sense of like the quality of periods that I was mentioning before. This is the mirror of quartic three-folds. And so we are in the context of that correspondence that I was mentioning before. I have a Duran polynomial, and its mutation equivalence class should give one skeleton in the model of quartic tree-folds. So basically, I mutation. So basically, I mutate this polynomial. You mutate, mutate, you find mutate F and now you take the Newton quality of this mutation, so you take the torque paradise associated with this, and now you find many torque degeneration sheets of ordinary three flows. An infinite number of mutations or finite. It's very rare to find uh something which is come out seeking that will come back. There are examples, but definitely this is not one of those. How do you know how to choose the H to mutate by? Oh, there are many choices. So you're just looking randomly or yeah. So basically some people in the UK, like Tom Colts and Al Kapsczik, have implemented all of this in the computer, and so you can really explore the mutation graph. Explore the mutation graph of this, and this is what I asked the alcoholic. Please consider as many mutations as you can, and give me if you find any which are capably stable. This is how we found those three which are capably stable, because now the very center condition is very easy to check. But once you fix the F, there's only a finite number of H that will work. Ah, yes, somehow I have to come to the end of the five. But basically, you can iterate. But you can iterate, but the iterates whether you came back or not if you iterated. Yeah. Sounds like usually not. Any question about this? And it's very rare that you will get capable stable. So that's what. Yeah, yeah, but in Tauric world, the capable stability is very, very rare. So if you consider, for instance, Gordonstein Fano Tauric Gardenstein Fano fourfold. Fourfold, there are 500 million reflexive polytops in four, only around 600 have polycentric zero. So it's like a ratio around one over one. Okay, the second, now I want to give an idea of the second result, which actually was stated as first. So now I want to mention. So now I want to mention a capable stable guy which is obstructed. Okay, and the idea is the following. So you take this lattice hexagon. Now, follow my hands. You put a type 1 in a horizontal plane, z equals 1, and now you put Z equals 1. And now you put the same thing at height minus 1 on the horizontal plane, z equal minus 1, and you take the convex side of all of this, so it becomes a prism. And now we draw this prism. Let's do this. Can you see this? So this is the point 001, this is the point 00 minus 1, and then this is the other two. Okay, let's call it P, this particle. Since P is equal to minus P, because this is a Because this is symmetric under the minus the identity. Also, its polar is symmetric under minus the identity. So the body center is zero of the polar. So this means that xp is capable is stable. And now I should tell you what are the special or unpoly nominal supporting of this poly. Polynomial as a partner dispatch. I mean, as he was saying earlier, some of these special Lorentz polynomials have always integer coefficients, and they tend to have binomial coefficients on edges. So if you have an edge of length, I don't know, three, put the binomial coefficients of weight three. So for instance, here, I have an edge of length two. 2. So here I should put coefficient 1, coefficient 2, coefficient 1. The same works for every edge. And also you want coefficient 0 at the origin. So what remains is to understand what is the coefficient of this point and of this point. So let's call it the coefficient A and B. So the Laurent parameter having these coefficients is Efficients is FAB, which is so now I want to consider this hexagon. This hexagon is x plus y plus xy. In this way I get this, this and this. And now I have to take the inverse x minus 1, x minus 1, 1 minus 1, y minus 1. Now I have to I don't you have a time C on our other yeah exactly so the the Newton polytop of this would be a hexagon at height zero but I wanted the hexagon at height one zero and minus one but remember that height zero I want the two so I need to multiply this by z to z equals Z inverse okay, so in this way I I I get exactly the the boundary and then I have A Z and B Z management and actually there are four choices for A and B which are A and B can be either two or three. Two or three. Such that these polynomials become special in the sense that it is one. And the fact that there are four choices, this more or less says, I mean, morally, you have to prove it, but morally says that the deformation space of this variety has four irreducible components. Sorry, the the fact that you had to put one, two and one is also due to the special condition. But if you so if you have I don't know, three and three, okay, two and two, it's okay. But if you have two and three with the antomorphism of the polytop you get the other one. You get the other one. So, actually, up to an automorphism of the polytrop, actually, there are three choices. And this says that X lies on three irreducible components of multiple components of multiple. So, somehow, locally, the stack is given by a guy with four reducible components, the module of the action of the automorphism, and so that it has three irreducible components. So, two irreducible components are identified in the process. Okay, so this is the the just the heuristic, how you can find the abstracted guys. Of course, you have to prove it, uh this kind of results. These kinds of results. And this is instead related to a theory due to Klaus Altman, who proves that somehow gives a combina fair description of the components of an isolated toric singularity. In particular, this hexagon here, it's an interesting singularity. It's an isolated toric singularity, which is the cone of the anti-canonical cone over the pets of the surface of the B6. And this has two really useful components. And this has two irreducible components. This singularity here. The deformation space. The deformation space, yes. And so you have basically two choices upstairs, two choices downstairs. And the other singularities are non-isolated because but they are LCI, so they don't cause much problems. But of course, you have to look carefully because this doesn't have isolated singularities. What's the impact in action? Of the variety? No, no, the singularity. This could mention four, so seven. Okay, the last thing I want to say, which is I think very beautiful. And suppose that now let's concentrate on one of the hexagon. And so basically, what I have is this modampal norm. So I have this plus A, and this becomes reducible exactly when A is equal to 2 or 3. So one decomposition is this. Uh well, let let me first do the the Newton particle and then I can map in this later. This later. So, this has two Minkowski decompositions. One is this one, and one is this. Okay, here I'm quick because I should explain what is a Minkowski sum, but you should take any point in the first, and then you attach the second polytope, and then you see that by varying the touching point, basically I covered the entire headset. And the same works for this. And now if you put the ramp polynomial over these guys, which are with These guys, which are with all coefficients one, so you get this. So this is exactly this guy here, and this is this guy here. And now I don't remember if this gives A equal to Now I don't remember if this gives a equal two or three, but these are the only a equal two or three are the only cases where this polynomial becomes reducible. And the Newton polytopes of these factors are exactly those two. So this is just to match with Alcman's theory of the formations of the resin coordinates. Okay, I think I'm done. Any questions? As you already mentioned before, in closed algebra, they almost all cases extended by everything. But in this picture, there must be some sort of finitely many quick degenerations. My big question is: there are infinitely many corruption data, but we expect that there are only finitely many three digits. There are only finitely minute to generate chances. No, no, no, no, no. In general, you have the infinitely magnetic degenerate channels. Really for P2, right? Either for P2. No, no, but wait, case stable or whatever, whatever. That's my case. No, no, if you assume capable is stable, no. Fine for me. Actually, most of the time, none. And and and uh and the the cable the capo is stable should be achievable only from cable is stable, I mean the drain location. Stable, I mean, running motions. So you cannot know how, I mean, I don't know. Is the set of K-poly stable ones mutation connected? Is that the or? Yeah, I mean, I was wondering if you need to, I mean, in your algorithms, you need to allow to whatever kind of in the wild networks and then kind of stable one. I don't know the answer to this because I didn't check this. But I don't see. But uh I don't see any and in principle I think you have to go to the white on this, I would say. In dimension two the situation is much easier. It is conjectured that actually in each mutation class there is only one capableist a mandatory weakness in one city. Only one C. No, it is assuming cable is stable. Yeah, but uh not in the same No, no, but but but I was wondering so so you have this what a reservoir strata in the moduli and what what No, I completely understand your question, and I don't know anything. Actually, there is also another thing that I try to mention, that basically all this theory of deformations of funovarieties is completely insensitive to K-stability or cable instability. And so there are situations where you have a K-unstable guy, which is K-stable guy, which is you can you cannot see from moduli, which lies at the intersection of two components where there are capable stable guys. And the question is: but can you find these two components are connected or not? This is, I think, completely optional. I have a question. So, um, so suppose you have like a polytope that somehow you can mutate to a K-poly stable polytope. I mean, polystop polytope for a K-polystable funnel. For k point stable funnel. In that case, can you find a canonical sequence of mutations that takes the original point up to the point stable? I think I'm not the right person to ask. I didn't think I'll constantly try it. Somebody should close your balance into some student. I mean, it's also related to whether the mutation graph is a tree, right? Because then there's a shortest path. But is there any reason for being true or? It's not always. But sometimes it is. I tried a watch of a module already. That's what you should. No, actually, there are situations. I mean, I vaguely remember a final polygon of dimension 2, which basically you mutate, but you stay itself. I mean, it could be like a comitarial problem, but basically, what I'm asking is where there is a Is where there is a preferred mutation that improves the, for instance, the stability of the threshold. It completely makes sense your question, but I mean all the time I spoke with Al Kaschik, who is the combinatorialist that does this kind of computations, he tells me all the time that imposing the the c the very central condition uh is uh I mean, it's not very natural in in the mutation game. In the mutation game. But like in the Markov case, it is a tree and there's an improvement, which is to decrease the largest Markov number, right? So there's a sort of canonical path to the stable one. Better get out of your way.
