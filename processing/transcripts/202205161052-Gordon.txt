 And the big idea, the most general idea that I want to talk about is that we can think of collective behavior as evolving in relation to the conditions around it. So, just as we think a polar bear evolved that thick fur to deal with cold environments, so collective behavior. Cold environments, so collective behavior evolves in relation to the conditions that it has to operate within. So, I work on ants, and ants are ideal for thinking about these questions because there are more than 14,000 species of ants. They live in every conceivable habitat, so they have evolved to deal with all kinds of ecological conditions. They all live in colonies consisting of one or more reproductive females that we call queens, but all they do is lay the eggs. They don't tell anybody what to do. Lay the eggs, they don't tell anybody what to do. And the ants, all the ants you see walking around, are sterile female workers and they use local interactions. And so they provide a lot of examples of how the dynamics of behavior, how it adjusts, is operating in relation to a changing environment. Where by the dynamics of behavior, really what I mean is exactly how the interactions work to adjust behavior to changing conditions. Adjust behavior to changing conditions. So, by the dynamics of environment, that could mean a lot of things. And the ones I want to talk about now are stability, the probability of change, how frequently it changes and how frequently bad things happen. Energy flow, the relation of what the system gets for what it has to spend, and the distribution of resources. And a simple gradient is from scattered or heterogeneous to patchy. Too patchy. I don't know what happened to that slide, but by how interactions work to adjust behavior, I'm going to talk in particular about rate, how quickly interactions can adjust behavior, how the feedback is set either for the default to be to stop or the default to be to go, and the modularity of information flow. So, by the interactions in ants, Interactions in ants. Most ants can't see, and most of the interactions are olfactory. They operate by smell. So, one that we've thought about a lot is how ants use their antennae to smell the cuticular hydrocarbons. It's a waxy, greasy layer on the other ants' body that they spread on themselves and on each other by grooming. So these are not volatile, they pretty much stay put. And then the pheromones, which might And then the pheromones, which might be more familiar, always volatile. For example, a trail pheromone, where one ant puts down this very volatile chemical on the substrate and another ant, if it comes along and the pheromone hasn't evaporated yet, will smell it and is likely to follow. So, ants use networks of these interactions, these local olfactory interactions to regulate. Interactions to regulate the behavior of colonies. And early on, we realized that the interactions can be thought of as not really having any message. It's the fact of interaction that matters, and it's the rate of interaction that's crucial. And I was just talking to Corine about how this parallels the idea that the cells use the rate at which they meet self or non-self. And I think it's Self or non-self. And I think it's really interesting to think about the differences in the ways that thinking of the interaction as a message influences how we understand what's happening. So when I say that there's no message, what I mean is that we, working with Mike Green, we've done experiments where we extract the cuticular hydrocarbons off an ant's body and we put it on glass beads, and then we can introduce those beads at a certain rate. Those bees at a certain rate, and the ants will respond as if they were meeting ants of a particular odor. So, you could say that there's no message because the glass bead isn't doing anything. It's not saying anything extra. It just has a certain smell and the ants respond to the rate at which they meet that. And just now, after listening to Karine talk, I just decided to throw in this slide from an old paper in which we Paper in which we introduced live patrollers, bees with the whole all the lipids off the cuticle of patrollers, the just the hydrocarbons off the patrollers, blank controls, and the signals from another type of ant. And we found that we got a response to beads with these hydrocarbons that looked like the response to the live ants. And you could think of this, I think it would be interesting. Could think of this. I think it would be interesting to talk about how this parallels, say, cells meeting self and non-self. But so the basic idea, though, is that this is a video of ants in a lab arena, and it's connected to other arenas, and the ants are moving around. And the idea is that the ants then are using the rate at which, so if we follow an ant, each ant is using the rate at which it contacts other ants to decide what to do. And so in the aggregate, Do. And so, in the aggregate, if you trace all these paths, that's an interaction network. It's a dynamic network, it's constantly shifting, and this pattern of interactions is regulating the behavior of the colony. So if we take those interactions and we map them onto each ant, so here each dot represents an ant, and we have colored the dots by the number of interactions that an ant had. And you can see, for example, in this video. For example, in this video of one of colony two, that there was this ant that had a lot of interactions. Here, there are in colony one, there were these ants had a lot of interactions. But this work and other work since by looking at the rates of interaction by analogy to particles moving around in this model here. It turns out that it's not that these ants are special. These ants are especially gregarious ants, but that instead an ants' interaction rate just depends on where it is, not who it is. And they don't seem to change their movement very much in response to the rate of interaction. So they just end up interacting more if the local density of ants happens to be high. So I want to give you two examples from two different systems of this relationship between the dynamics of collective behavior, that is, how they use. Behavior, that is how they use interactions to regulate behavior and the dynamics of the environment, first for harvester ants in the desert and then for turtle ants in the tropical forest. So harvester ants in the desert, the desert is a pretty stable environment with respect to the resources that the ants are using, which are seeds. These are harvester ants that eat seeds and they're just scattered on the ground mostly by the wind and by flooding and they don't. And they don't change around very much. So it's a pretty stable environment with respect to the resources. What's really important for these ants in the desert is that water is limited and there are very few threats. So this is a site where I've been working for a long time near Portall, Arizona. It's actually in the very western edge of New Mexico near the state line with Arizona. So there. So, what I want to talk about is how colonies regulate their foraging effort. These ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds. This is a mound of a mature colony. There's the nest entrance. They go out on these trails, which are sometimes cleared, sometimes not. Maybe up to 20 meters, they gather seeds and they, so they're harvesting the seeds, bring them back to the nest. And so, early on, I divided all the behavior I see outside the nest into these four categories. Into these four categories. I call an ant a forager when it is out in the stream of ants or finding a seed, bringing it back. The patrollers come out early in the morning. They meet the neighbors and they set the direction of the foragers. It's their return that tells the foragers to go. The nest maintenance workers bring out the garbage and maintain the tunnels inside the nest. And the midden workers basically move the refuse around the Basically, move the refuse around the husks of the seeds that they eat, and they put in the colonies cuticular hydrocarbons so that it creates an odor gradient that guides the foragers back in. So I'm talking about only the 25% of the colony that works outside. Somewhere down there is the queen who just lays the eggs. Most of the food that a colony brings in goes to feed the brood, the larvae. There are lots of ants hanging around basically doing nothing, and that's another interesting story. And that's another interesting story. But I'm going to be talking about the foragers who go outside, get seeds, bring them, drop them in this chamber just inside the nest entrance, and then go out again. And that's just about 25% of the colony that's working outside. So again, early on, I learned how ants switch tasks by experiments in which I created a need for more ants to do a certain task, like I put out extra. Do a certain task, like I put out extra food, and the patrollers, the midden workers, the nest maintenance workers switched to forage, or I created a disturbance that recruited more patrollers who came from the nest maintenance workers. Oh, and I knew this because I had the ants marked with paint, so I knew what they had been doing before and what they switched to. But when I made a mess that the nest maintenance workers had to clean up, nobody wants to go back to do nest maintenance, so they have to get the younger ants from inside the nest up into nest maintenance. So there's this one-way flow. Nest maintenance. So there's this one-way flow into foraging, and once an ant becomes a forager, it doesn't go back. So these ants are foraging for scattered seeds. They don't use pheromone trails. There wouldn't be any point when one ant finds a seed over here. There's no point bringing all the other ants over there because it's not in a pile of seeds. There's nothing for the other ants to collect. The way that it works is that patrollers come out very early in the morning. And this is some video we made. And this is some video we made of the paths of patrollers just meandering around the nest mound and a little bit outside it. And they meet the patrollers of the neighbors. And it's their safe return that tells the foragers, okay, the wind is not blowing so hard that the patrollers can't get back. Once the patrollers come back, that's when the foragers go out. So that's what initiates foraging. But what I want to talk about is what regulates foraging while it's happening. So here are foragers leaving. So, here are foragers leaving the nest, going out a long way away to search for seeds, and coming back with seeds. And it turns out that it's the rate at which they come back, which regulates the rate at which they go out. And so, I want to talk about how we've learned about that and some of the models that we've used. So, foraging is regulated in response to two kinds of changing conditions. One is the availability of food, and the other is humidity, and those two are linked. So, first of all, you need to know that a forager loses water being out in the sun. So, when it's very, when it's been raining in the summer, as it used to do until the drought hit, I guess about 15 years ago, but it still has rained some. The air is very humid, so it doesn't cost an ant as much to be out. And there's more food because there's more rain, and so the ant. And so the annual plants flower and set seeds, so there's more seeds. But when it's very dry, not only is it more expensive in water for the ant to be outside, but there's not as much food. So basically, a colony has to spend water to get water. They get their water by metabolizing the fats in the seeds that they eat. This is a seed chamber inside a nest. There's an amphoroscale. Nest, there's an ant for scale. And so they have to spend water in searching for food to get water back. So the way that this works is that an outgoing forager doesn't leave the nest until it has enough contact with returning foragers with food. This is made with a videoscope inside the tunnel leading into the nest entrance. And the idea is that when a forager comes in like this, the ants coming out are using the rate at which they meet returning foragers to decide whether to leave. To decide whether to leave. So we know about this first of all from experiments in which, just on the scale of minutes, so this is the rate of foraging. We decrease the rate of forager return by taking away the ants and putting them in a plastic box. We always let them go later. And so here are some people collecting up the ants, the returning foragers with seeds. And we find that after a little lag, which is interesting and which we really like to understand better. Really like to understand better. When we stop decreasing the rate of a forager return, then the rate at which they go out recovers. And this decrease is larger than can be explained by the numbers of ants that are stuck in the box. So here's what the real data look like. This is foragers per 10 seconds. This was a 14-minute experiment. So this is seconds here. The red is the rate at which foragers are coming in, which declines almost to zero because we're collecting them and putting them in the box. Because we're collecting them and putting them in the box, we stop collecting them. So we let the foragers that are still out there return. And so it recovers. And then, after a lag, the rate at which the foragers go out recovers. And there's still a lot we don't understand about how the ants could possibly resolve such a stochastic process for the rate at which they're meeting returning foragers. And if you've ever watched ants at all, you know that no ant responds deterministically to Deterministically to whatever input it gets. So we have this stochastic input and stochastic output, and yet we get this very predictable response in a very short time. So the first model that we did of this, basically we just simulated the rate out as a pretty simple function of the rate at which they go in. And there's a little bit more to this equation, but. To this equation, but just want to show you that we were able to simulate pretty well. This is the real rate in. So this is decreased by a removal experiment. And the blue is the real rate out, and the green is the simulation. And so we were able to capture pretty well how the rate at which they go in determines the rate at which they go out. Now, this Now, this process is a way that the colony is collectively adjusting to food availability. That is, the rate at which they come in and they respond to interactions by deciding to go out is linked to food availability. And to understand that, you need to just think about a foraging trip of one ant. So, the ant leaves the nest, it travels along for a while, then it leaves the trail to Trail to search for seeds, and the thing is that it keeps searching until it finds food almost always. And then, as soon as it finds food, it comes back. So, its total trip time is dictated by its search time. So, this is just a simple positive feedback. There's higher foraging effort when more food is available. The more food's out there, less time they spend searching. The forages return sooner, and more foragers go out to forage. So, we then So, we then wanted to understand better how does an ant assess its interaction rate? So, how does each ant keep track of its interaction rate? And so, we think it works like this by analogy with a neuron, that each interaction stimulates some neurophysiological response which has a decay. And if enough of them accumulate, it pushes the ant over some threshold where it's likely to go out to forage. But if the last one But if the last one decayed before the next one happens, it's as though the ant forgets anything ever happened and the process starts again. So there is an obvious analogy with neurons that just as each ant is accumulating the rate at which it meets other ants to decide what to do because it has this excitable dynamics, it has this decay, so a neuron accumulates the rate at which its other neurons fire. Fire so as to decide whether to fire. And in neurons, the decay is caused by the leakage of electricity down the axon. And so it's called, for neurons, it's called leaky integration. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm kind of having trouble understanding the exact model in the sense. So I'm just So I've just let me sort of give me so if like 20 ants left at time zero, right? And you take them one hour on average, and let's say they're one hour for all of them to forage on a base of a village, they all come back in one hour and 20 months come back. If it takes them two hours, they will all come back in two hours, but again, 20 of them will come back. So I'm trying, so it looks like there's like they're really just So it looks like there's like the really the stochasticity of times is more important than the average because in steady state, how many ants got left, as many of them will come back. So the frequency of interaction is really determined about the sort of engagement. So if everyone who goes out comes back, and if there's not much variance between the time, then it looks like there's really no. like there's really no the delay shouldn't the practice things so so am i am i getting something wrong in that mental picture well they don't all they don't all leave at once and it's a poisson process um and they don't all take the same amount of time but the amount of time that they take um is a measure of uh day on days when there's more food it takes everybody More food, it takes everybody less time. Yeah, yeah. Just in this toy model that I described, without the stochasticity, delay doesn't really matter. So it's hard to see why. In the model, I described the delay doesn't matter. That's right. But I'm about to show you that the delay does matter. So if you can please ask me this question about a slide that's coming up in about three slides, maybe that I'm not sure. That I'm not sure. I want to know if that helps, okay? Sure. Okay, so here's what we did: we were able to excavate off the upper layer of the soil, and we put a piece of glass over this excavated entrance chamber where these interactions are happening. We filmed inside there. We got videos like this. So, the ants are being fed seeds. So, you see them coming in with seeds. See them coming in with seeds, and so this is the entrance chamber where the interactions happen. If there's glass over it, it's humid enough that they just keep going. And these are the tunnels to the deeper nest here, here, and here. And so what we did was to track the paths of the incoming foragers and the paths of the ants that came up from the deeper chamber and look to see how the interaction rate influences what they do. So here is Here is the results of the analysis, the image analysis of one of these videos. So, in this one, this is the entrance, here's the size of an ant. This is one tunnel, here's another tunnel. Each of these trajectories is the trajectory of an ant, and each of these dots is an antennal contact. And we have four colors here for the four kinds of ants: the ants that foragers that came in, put down their seed, had Put down their seed, had some interactions, and went out again. The ones that came up from the deeper nest had some interactions and went out, and then the two that gave up, that is the foragers that came in, put down their seed, maybe had some interactions and then went down to the nest. And the ones that came up from the deeper nest, maybe had some interactions and went down again. So then we fit, so working with Mark Goldman, who's a theoretical neuroscientist, and Jacob David. Scientist and Jacob David said, We use this excitable dynamics model of a leaky integrator. And so here is this model where the decay is in it. And so I'm interested if this answers your question. So it looks kind of like the picture I drew where each interaction stimulates a response which has a decay. And then if enough accumulate, it's likely to leave the nest to. It's likely to leave the nest to forage. We added something that neurons don't do, which is that if it doesn't get enough interactions, they return to the deep nest, or at least neurons don't do it on this time scale. So here we have the decay, the effect of the interactions. We have this noise term, which means everything we don't understand. And we were able to fit this model to the data that is, this does a good job of predicting what the ants will do. Ants will do. Is that so? This is a much more complicated model than the first one that I showed you that just sort of captures all of this stuff in some term that describes sort of how excitable the ants are or how likely they are to leave the nest. Does that help? Not quite, because my question was about the hypothesis about frequency of interaction represents. Frequency of interaction represents in foot availability. Because I could imagine a toy model in which those things are completely decoupled. Because it's one really gets you a delay, and it's only due to stochasticity or something like that. So it looks like it's not the mean, not the mean foraging time, but maybe a variance in foraging time should be affecting the. Should be affecting the input to this model per se, the interaction, the rate of interactions. Well, okay. Show you one more, okay? Let's see if that helps. So the response interactions we know doesn't just depend on food ability, but also depends on current humidity. And we know from other work that I can explain if you want, but don't want to go into information. But don't want to go into in detail that dopamine mediates how humidity influences foraging decisions. So, the part that I've been talking about so far is this part, how the ants inside the nest, which some of which are ants that just came back, are using the rate at which they meet other returning ants to decide whether to go out. But the temperature and humidity inside the nest are very constant. So, the ants inside the nest don't have any information about the conditions outside. About the conditions outside, except the ones that have been outside and know how bad it is and somehow remember by how desiccated they are or something, how bad they feel when they come in. And what we have understood now is that dopamine overrides the effects of low humidity. So, ants that get dopamine, we've been feeding ants dopamine, are more likely to go out again. So the The rate at which they go out depends not only on how many interactions they get, but also on some decisions that ants are making based on humidity, which is why this process regulates how foraging declines in the course of the day as it gets hotter outside. But colonies differ in how they do this, they differ in their decisions about whether it's worthwhile to go out. While to go out for foragers to make the decision to go out based on how dry it is, but also how quickly they're coming back with food. So, the way that the colonies differ, you know, it's a gradient, but we could sort of classify them into two types. There are some colonies that lower foraging rate on dry days and are more stable on humid days. And just as an example, here are the foraging rates of two colonies on the same day. So, here's one colony that's decided to go out and therefore. It's decided to go out and they're foraging along. Whereas this colony has reduced foraging, both the rate at which they go out and then the rate at which they come in on the same day. And so colonies show consistent differences in how much they forage when it's dry. So all colonies tend to forage a lot on a wet on a humid day, but on a dry day like this, some colonies reduce foraging. And just because we were talking about marking cells, I thought I'd show you how we mark ants. So we have this system with six colors and three body parts gives us 256 marked ants. And we just looked, compared the response of foragers within a colony to ask whether these differences among colonies and how they respond to humidity are due to differences in the Are due to differences in the distribution of foragers who are wimpy about going out? Like maybe some colonies would have had a larger proportion of foragers who decline to go out when it's dry. But instead, we found that foragers within a colony are similar in response to humidity. This is a picture that a student drew of us doing this project. So that's me in the chair calling out, you know, white, red, gold just went out, blue, yellow, yellow came in, and there's somebody entering it on a. In, and there's somebody entering it on a tablet. So the differences seem to be colony-specific, and we are now looking at the genetics to try to understand how those differences among colonies come from differences in dopamine neurophysiology. But now back to the model. So we think about here is a more complete model of this process where we that Naomi Leonard, who is an engineer. Naomi Leonard, who is an engineer at Princeton, and Renato Pagliara, who is a grad student with her. So, this is a control theory model where we think of this as an open loop. The foragers come in, the rate at which the foragers come in, and the rate at which they respond using these excitable dynamics where each interaction causes a decay, produces the rate at which the foragers go out, but then we close the loop with the foragers going out. The loop with the foragers going out, and maybe this is what you're thinking about: the variation among foragers in the time that they are out, and then they come back in. But we broke it down into two classes of foragers, the ones that go out and we're calling them here uninformed and informed, but really these are the ones that don't feel bad about how hot it is out there. And these are the ones that have been out and been exposed to dry conditions and have a different response to. And have a different response to the interactions and their own decision whether to go out again on the next trip. So I don't know if that, if adding the variation in the foraging is addressing what you're talking about, but the question is: if you take this foraging thing and make it longer on average, but maybe with the same variance or something like that, and make it if it'll. I don't make it. Will that model work? So your hypothesis of that food availability affects this model and allow this self-re-adjustment based on delay between in the second loop. So I'm not sure. Did you try that testing that with this complex model? Yes. Yes. So we find that this fits the data pretty well. Maybe we can talk more about it because I don't know exactly what kind of fit you're thinking about. I also can't see you because I don't know how to make your face come up. So anyway, I hope we can talk about this more. And okay. So just as an aside, As an aside, we can look explicitly at how natural selection is shaping this behavior. So we've done that. So remember that we have some colonies that reduce foraging when in dry conditions and others that continue foraging even when it's dry. And they're then making different trade-offs related to how much water they spend for how much food and water they get. So I've been censusing this population since grad school. Population since grad school. Been tracking these colonies. Every year we go back and find all the colonies that were there the year before and put the new ones on the map and say goodbye to the ones that have died. Early on, working, this is Stefan Kover, who's the curator of ants at the MCZ at Harvard. We dug up colonies of known age. We counted all the ants. And so we know how colony size and number of workers changes with colony age. With colony age. They're started by a founding queen and they begin to reproduce, that is, to send out reproductives to each year's mating flight when the queen is about five. And when I first started making these maps, I thought that colonies lived for 20 years, but now I know that colonies can live for 30 years or more. When the queen dies, the colony dies, but the ants live only a year. So each year, the queen is making all the ants again. Queen is making all the ants again. So, in order to ask about reproductive success, we had to figure out which of the new offspring colonies were the daughters of which mother colonies. And we did this using genetic variation. So we were able to ask how many offspring a parent colony had. And to skip over a lot of other work about that, I'll just say that there was this relationship between how a colony regulates its foraging and its Regulates its foraging and its reproductive success. And I called the paper the rewards of restraint because it's these colonies that are sacrificing food intake to save water that are having more offspring colonies. This was true really, this was published in 2013, but we did the collections in 2010. At that time, natural selection was shaping the collective regulation of foraging through this individual response to interactions so as to So, as to favor the colonies that were reducing foraging when dry. But now we're sadly, because of this continuing drought, this is rainfall over the course of the study. This is the number of colonies that were founded and died. And you can see the number of new colonies is declining. And so the number of total number of colonies is declining. And we did this first work in 2010. And we did this first work in 2010. Now we're repeating this again to ask whether colonies can afford to keep sacrificing food intake to save water, or as the food supply decreases because there's less rain and so less water to produce for plants to produce seeds, will they be able to maintain that? And that is a matter of competition between neighbors. So I just want to show you one other kind of spatial model about this. So this shows the foraging trails of So this shows the foraging trails of one colony on one day. I'm sorry this didn't come out, but this is 10 meters. So sometimes they look like trails, sometimes they look sort of like blobs. Often neighboring colonies meet and the ants of one colony will be foraging in the same area as the ants of a neighbor. And that means that whatever food one gets, the other doesn't get. And so it's not good for either one. And so we've been, we modeled this as a We modeled this as all the ants in the site as a Voronoi tessellation to try to capture the way that a colonies, that the spacing of colonies, the neighborhood of colonies sets up the competition for food. And we've looked to see how over time, competition with neighbors, as the drought has deepened, is increasing, is affecting colony survival. So looking at the maps, so the years. Maps. So the years up until about 2000 were the wettest years. People have, it's been a really interesting study using tree rings, the wettest years since the year about 1000, but the years since about 2000 have been the driest years. And the numbers of colonies have gone down. So just as an example, 1997, it was a lot more crowded than in 2019. And so we're now asking using these. Asking using these spatial models on the scale of many colonies over tens of meters, whether as food becomes more scarce, do the colonies that reduce foraging when dry, are they giving up so much area to their neighbors that they can't sustain the strategy that selection was favoring 10 or 15 years ago. So, with that, I will leave the harvester ants just Leave the harvester ants just to point out overall that they're in response to these conditions that are very stable with respect to the resources on the scale of the time scale of minutes to minutes and hours to hours on which they're adjusting foraging, where they're dealing with limited water and very few threats. They have a system that changes quite slowly. I mean, they adjust foraging very slowly. And the feedback is set so the default is to stop, that is not to go out. Default is to stop. That is not to go out to forage unless something good happens, unless enough ants are coming in with food. And the modularity is really low in the sense that information is quite centralized. That is, an ant has to go, forager has to go all the way out, get a seed, and come back before it provides any information to the system. So I want to contrast this with a very different system in the tropical forest, which is quite unstable, where things are changing all the time, where resources are quite packed. Where resources are quite patchy. Rather than scattered, these ants live in the trees and they forage for nectar on flowers that occurs in clusters. And they're a lot more threats. So this is in Jalisco in Mexico, south of Puerto Vallarta, at a wonderful research station belonging to UNAM called Chamela. And here are the ants. They're called turtle ants. They look a little like Darth Vader. They are kind of weird with these weird visors that in another species. That and another species in the genus that use to plug their nests. This is nail polish, so they don't really have purple spots. And so the tropical forest is very different from the desert. Everything is changing all the time. The vegetation is changing all the time. Activity is easy for these ants because the humidity is very high. There are a lot of threats from other species. None of these are turtle ants, but just to show you that in the tropics for ants, like many other things, For ants, like many other things, the ants are so abundant and so diverse that almost any resource one species wants, another species will be after as well. So these work not by the interactions, important interactions are not internal contact, or actually we don't know the function of their internal contacts, but we do know that they are using a different kind of chemical interaction, which is a pheromone. So the turtle ants put down a volatile pheromone as they walk. So it's different from the system you may have. Different from the system you may have that might be more familiar to you, where a scout ant goes out, it finds something, some food, and it leaves a trail on the way back. These ants, like other species, just put down pheromone everywhere they go. And so they're staying in the vegetation. And one ant, when it comes to a junction or what I'm going to be talking about as a node, and has to make a decision about where to go, it's likely to go in the direction that's most recent. In the direction that's most recently been passed by other ants who have put down pheromon. So we've been mapping, I've been mapping this in this way. So you can think of, they make this trail network. One colony has many different nests. So this one had three nests, and they have a kind of a backbone, a routing backbone as the data network people call it. The data network people call it that links the nests, and they have to keep that connected or the colony is split apart. And then they have temporary trails that go off from the backbone that go to food sources. So I've been mapping it like this, and I'll show you more where each of these is a node, a place in the vegetation where the ants had to decide which way to go. And these are edges that they didn't take. So when I say So, when I started this, I first looked at the time scale on which these networks change and are pruned and found that the trails change on the scale of days to weeks and the nests change on the scale of weeks. So, I'll show you just to illustrate that, a map in which the different days are in different colors. So, each of these is a node in the vegetation, and these are the ways they didn't take, and each day is going to be a different color. Day is going to be a different color. So we start out like this. They have junctions connecting two nests. And then each on this day, they had this whole other loop, sorry, that had these cycles in it. And then they have a temporary trail going off here. But the next day, came back and they had cut off this part and they're just using this part. But of course, the nests are connected. The third day they're doing. The third day, they're doing pretty much the same thing, but then they have this, they're using this trail to the food source. And then the next day, they had introduced this whole new branch and a new nest. And just so you don't think this was too easy, this is the place that they, the hub that they found this path to the new nest from. So this is the hub, and what happened is that they were using these. What happened is that they were using these branches and then they chose this new branch. So, to ask how this network is extended to new resources, we did these experiments. Well, we first asked, do the same ants go in the same path every day? So we painted ants with nail polish. Here we are in the forest. So here was a nest, and there was a trail going from one way. One way and another trail going another way. And we painted the ants coming off on this trail purple, and we painted the ants coming off on this trail green. And then we went back the next day and found that the purple ants tended to go here and the green ants tended to go there. But the ants can't always take the same path or they'd never find anything. So we started to ask how do they search? How do they search? And so the first thing to do was to put out a bait three junctions from the trail. So the trail was here. So this one is one. Let's see, it must have been here. One, two, three junctions from the trail. And they were all found within about three to four hours. And then to ask more about how they search on the trail, did these experiments where this was the main trail, and we put a sticker: here's one junction. Sticker, here's one junction from the trail. Here's one, two, three, four junctions from the trail. And this one is eight junctions from the trail over here. And we ask, so we're counting the ants as they go by, and then we're asking how many ants have to go by here before an ant leaves the trail and passes the sticker. And so this is the number of ants per minute on the trail and the time elapsed until they were found. And the time elapsed until they were found. And we find the number of nodes from the main trail here: one, three, and eight. That all of them had some ant pass sticker one node from the trail within an hour, but only a third of them had an ant three nodes from the trail, and only 15% of them had an ant eight nodes from the trail. And so, this exponential increase in the time it takes in the In the time it takes, in the amount of ants it takes to get an ant further away, suggests that there is just some local probability, node by node, of searching and leaving the trail. At junctions without pheromone, so if an ant leaves the trail and gets to the next junction and there's no pheromone, it usually turns back to the main trail, but not always. And then to ask how the network is repaired, because frequently there's breaks. Because frequently there's breaks. We did some further experiments. So they nest in the. Yeah. We're kind of running over time already. So just whenever you're out. Okay, I will skip to the models. We did some experiments where we ruptured the trail, but I'll just go to the models and oops, the slides didn't work. Oops, these slides didn't work. So we did these simulations where we had a model with two parameters, just the rate of pheromone decay and the probability of leaving the trail to forage and sorry, to explore. And we found that in the simulations, We found that in the simulations, the parameters, these two parameter values for pheromone decay and explorer probability, that were most successful in the simulations were the ones that we had measured in the data, which doesn't show that the answer using this, but shows that this simple algorithm is consistent with what they do. But I just want to tell you very quickly about the role of the 3D configuration of the nodes, because I think that fits with some other things people are talking about. With some other things people are talking about. So here, if the configuration of the node affects the probability that it will be reinforced. So for example, this one, if an ant travels up here and goes this way, every ant is likely to go the same way and to reinforce it. Whereas here, if an ant comes along here and it's going there, it might go over this way, it might go over that way. So nodes differ. So, nodes differ in how likely every ant is to take the same path. So, what we did was to map the vegetation that they were using and rank each node by how likely ants are to reinforce it. So, this is the most likely. This is much less likely because ants have different choices. It's like a node with multiple edges. And then we measured the vegetation that the ants. We measured the vegetation that the ants were using and the vegetation they did not use. And so we created these simulations in which we had the observed network and all the alternative network around it. And we just asked whether the paths by matching up the observed paths with the simulated paths, how likely were the simulated paths to match? simulated paths to match the observed paths and we found so this is equal and we found that although the the simulated the random paths were about the same in length the actual paths the observed paths were much more likely to use these nodes in which they would be reinforced and that they minimize the number of nodes relative to random simulated paths. So we call this paper better tired than long. So, we call this paper better tired than lost because the ants are choosing to use the paths that maintain the coherence of the trail and that minimize the number of nodes where there are opportunities for ants to get lost relative to simulated paths in the same vegetation. So, this is local regulation that keeps the network coherent. And so, I want to contrast this rapid change where the default is to go and local. Where the default is to go and local information with the slow change and the default stop, the very centralized information in the desert. So I will stop there and hope that we have a chance to continue this discussion. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Any questions from the audience or from the Zoom? running a bit behind schedule maybe we'll move the yeah maybe we'll move to the next speaker and then I think maybe we'll have a chance to interact there okay so we are going along the kingdoms of life I mean we covered bacteria here we covered now insects now we go into birth Now we go into Berskin. Pedro Lynch from Stony Group will tell us about our configuration. Awesome. Thank you so much. So I assume you guys can hear me. If not, you can look concerned, but no one looks terribly concerned. So I'll see if I can share my screen here. Uh-oh. What am I getting? All right, let's try this. Uh-oh, I'm having trouble sharing. This is worst case scenario. This is what I get for trying to update my operating system. One second. Actually, maybe I'll put my. Actually, maybe I'll put myself on mute. And if there are additional questions for Deborah, we can take those while I try and share here. I can fill in with a question. So, Deborah, I know there was this question about delays. So, if I understood correctly, you have ants that are coming back from foraging, and then they go and they put down their stuff, and then they come back and they can go out foraging again. That's correct. Again? That's correct. Does the timing for the amount of time it takes for an ant to put down its stuff match up with the delay in the... No, it's much quicker. No. They just throw down their seed and then other ants come and get it. In fact, when we made those videos, we had some video where the ant would come to the edge and just launch its seed over like a basketball. It was great. I don't think they probably do that in real life, but they just put They probably do that in real life, but they just put it down and then they're hanging around waiting to go out again. Okay, but they hang out inside the nest. Do you know? Yeah, in that chamber. Yeah. Okay. That's where they eat the other ants coming back. Okay. And does so the I suppose being inside the nest allows them to remoisturize themselves? Okay, sorry. I don't know how to say that. Yes. And I think, you know, that that may be a function of the ants that are just hanging. The ants that are just hanging around, apparently doing nothing. Yeah, so does the remote humidifiers does the remoisturization process take anything along the same lines as that delay that you see? We don't know anything about that. We do know that ants that get stuck outside will die. Okay. But we don't know how fast is the rest of the
