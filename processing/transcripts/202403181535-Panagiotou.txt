And I've been learning a lot and it's a great experience. So I will be talking about entanglement in biopolymers in general. I will discuss some tools that find applications in studying structures of filamentous materials in many contexts. So it may be systems of proteins, for example. Systems of proteins, for example, or it can be DNA, or it may be single filament structures, or it may be many chains coming together. So I have prepared a lot to talk about, so we might just leave some for the discussion later. I will focus mostly on tools that can be used to measure entanglement in those systems and in demonstrating their application to proteins and to To proteins and to systems of many chains, not networks, but many chain systems. So, a brief summary, I will be going a little bit from jumping from one to two. I will talk about a way to measure complexity of open curves in three-space. As you know, in mathematics, all here in the audience, you know, understand how we simplify biopolymers by looking at them as mathematics. Biopolymers by looking at them as mathematical curves. And I will discuss these tools, and in particular, the Jones polynomial and Vassiliev measures of those, and tools that can be used to measure an agreement of collections of open curves in three space. And if I have time, in extensions of those to periodic boundary condition systems. And I will be at, in between, I will be giving some examples of. I will be giving some examples of what they can capture in physical systems. For example, local and global topology and geometry effects, things related to protein folding and how protein mutations may be affecting 3D structure, global structure in an abstract way. And also how single chain to multi-chain affects can be thought of. Can be thought of. Okay, so you all know what a knot is here. But something I want to point out is that when we are thinking of knots, the goal is usually to classify these closed curves in three-space. And you classify them using the notion of topological equivalence. So it doesn't matter how something looks like, it matters if it is equivalent to something else. So if they're in the same To something else, so if they're in the same class, by allowing them to deform without cutting and pasting. So you capture something that these all have different hair that you see. And here we are usually looking at those as diagrams, but they representatives of a class of infinitely many different embeddings of things in three space. The situation now, the systems that I will be focusing on, but the tools I discussed. Will be focusing on, but the tools I describe are, of course, they also work for notes and links, are open herbs in free space. And these have attracted, they have been studied a lot. Usually until recently, the focus has been to try to think of them as knots in the best possible way. So for example, by using different closure methods of an open curve, one can obtain a spectrum of different knot types. Spectrum of different node types, and then one can use different projections of an open curve and use obtain a spectrum of notoid types. The focus up to that point had been from that spectrum, what is the best representative? So always the goal had been to try to map this to one of these objects here. But what I will be talking about is another approach where you are not doing any of that. You are not doing any of that, but instead, you think of this object as none of this, really. A superposition of things that you may understand from notes or notes. So, this is a combination of the ideas that we just talked about, the spectrum, and something that existed so far, the Gauss-Linken integral, which was the only tool that we had up to recently for studying open curves without enforcing any closure method or any other approach. Method or any other approximation method by one topological object. So since then we have been able to define the Jones polynomial, a second Maussilier measure, and many more because this relies on the general method that is basically the following. We have an open curving three space, and then different projections can give you some different objects called notoids, right? And then I'll Notoids, right? And then I'll talk a little bit about notoids for those that do not know about them. But then we think of the open curve of in free space as a superposition of the different notoid types it can give along with the geometric probability of them giving one of those notoid types. So then using the theory of notoids, then for every diagram we have an environment we can define, these are well studied, and so we can take the integral of And so we can take the integral over average overall projections to obtain a measure of entanglement that is only for the open curve in free space. It is not that of any notoid or any not. So more precisely, so these are notoids. These are diagrams. There is a way to interpret them as something that lives in three space via some construction, rail construction, but they don't represent any open curve, one by themselves. Open curve. One by themselves is not enough to represent any open curve in free space. However, as a theory here, you can classify them in classes. These are all in different classes based on this type of equivalence relation along with the forbidden rules. And then for an object like this, you can define a Jones polynomial, for example, in a very similar way as you did for knots. And these are the type of values you get. So you see, for this one, that looks So you see for this one that looks a lot like the trephole diagram, you get the zones of the trephoil knot. But things that are not close to any traditional knot, you can get a non-trivial polynomial for those. And now the polynomials, they can have fractional coefficients. But powers, but integer coefficients. Now what we say is for an open curve in 3-space, if this is the open curve Is the operative an instance, an embedding, a specific embedding of an open current space? Then we can take the integral over S2, average over all possible projection directions, that Jones polynomial of any particular projection. So what we end up getting is a polynomial again, but now this has real coefficients, and the coefficients are continuous functions of the curve coordinates. So if this thing closes to a knot, you will see that. You will see the polynomial changing to that of the corresponding knot. As here is an example of a calculation for something that is obviously not knotted and could not become knotted until you start breaking through and piercing through that triangle. But already this object, it has something, a polynomial, but is not equal to one, which is that of a traditional trivial straight segment of child. And you see how it changes. And you see how it changes. This is now a polynomial that evolves in time. So we give up the notion of invariance here. It is not useful, otherwise, all of these are equivalent. But we do see that at any snapshot, they do have some non-trivial complexity in a very broad sense. Of course, if we started tying something like a knot, we would see this changing to the actual polynomial. So you could get something much more complex. We will see some examples. More complex, we will see some examples maybe later. I wanted to say here that we have code that you can use to compute this for systems, the Jones polynomial, but also you can use it to compute right linking number and the periodic analogs for systems of blowing periodic boundary conditions like the crystal structures we saw earlier. And this is another example, again, using the same method. Again, using the same method, we can compute something with what is called the second Vausillium measure. For closed curves, it is a second Vausillium invariant. And this is much easier to compute than the Jones polynomial. And it can also detect nothing. It is not as good, but it may be good enough for some systems. And the good thing about it is, especially when you have to deal with a lot of data, is that instead of a polynomial, this is now a real number. This is now a real number that you can interpret a little bit more easily. And if you have something completely straight, it will be zero. If you go to something that is noted, in particular the trephel note here, it will be one. So you can see the number changing as you change the conformation. And here's an example of what this means, let's say, for proteins. These are protein structures from the protein data bank. From the protein data bank, and you see these structures have a lot of secondary structure elements. You see those helices or beta sheets and so on. And if you computed something like with a Gauss-Lincoln integral, we could compute the Rhy, for example, or the average crossing number. You could use that to compare structures. But you cannot rely on that as whether it captures the topology or something about the local geometry of the structure. Because all these hills. Structure because all these helices they are right-handed and they add a lot of positive right. And indeed, when you compute the second Basilium measure, you can see that this protein, it has really a knot, if you want to think of it that way. In any case, this protein has a global topology, of open-pair topology, that is higher than this protein. What is interesting about that? What is interesting about that too is that this protein is not exactly zero. And even though it is hard to, and I did draw this because this is how we are used to think of things, a not or a not or not, but this is not really a zero. And I will demonstrate why this is interesting. Because from the proteins that have been analyzed in the protein data bank, less than 2% I think have been found to contain NOTs, and even through alpha phones. Contain knots. And even through alpha fold, same statistics I think pretty much. But what this means is not that the rest of them, 98%, are not interesting. That still we can characterize them with V2, that they have non-zero V2. They could have zero V2 if they had a specific, but they don't. And does that matter? Well, such proteins that are two-state proteins, a set of here, example of a state of two-state proteins. Example of a state of two state proteins, that means simple proteins, that have no knots, no slip knots, really very, very simple. Their experimental folding rate, how fast they reach that native state, is shown here, orders of magnitude different. And it does correlate with this V2 parameter. So even though the V2 values may be very small, they seem to do matter in terms of protein information. In terms of protein-informed kinetic. At least, this is a first example where we have decoupled now anything related to local structure, and we are asking whether something about the global, the native state structure, something topological, let's say, about it is important. Another example of how such tools can be useful is Is that you can apply them not at an entire structure, DNA or any other biopolymer, but locally. We've heard already today in many talks how this local geometry versus global topology connection is happening. Here's an example where we apply the right to the smallest length possible in proteins, which is four residues at a time. So we have three edges. Residues at a time. So we have three edges, really, three edges, three bonds, the alpha carbon atoms only of the proteins. And we did that for a representative sample of the protein data bank of 13,000 proteins. So for each one, we scanned along the proteins. So we obtained about 1 million values of RIFE. And then we did a histogram and we looked at which values were mostly populated. We normalized our data by that. By that, and we are able to obtain a measure of, we call it topological energy, but okay, it's not physical energy, it's a measure of rarity, of a value of rice in the folded state ensemble of proteins that exist in the protein data path. And then you have some proteins that are outside the seventy-fifth percentile. And one may wonder what is the the meaning of those. What is the meaning of those? I will only say here, we can discuss more, but a hint is that when we compute it now, we can take a new protein, like the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and look at its local right values and check with what we obtained from the protein data band to see how rare or common are these local values. And this is how many of those were rare, rare local conformations. And then we asked the mutation. We asked the mutations that lead to those mutants that seem to evolve the protein. How many of those happened in rare conformations? And they seem to disproportionately happen there. What is interesting about this connection with local and global is that this protein and many viral proteins they function by doing a conformational rearrangement. So the protein starts like this. So, the protein starts like this, but then in order to proceed with the viral infection, it completely changes shape. So, it is interesting that we find those rare conformations to be associated possibly with that global conformational change. And we find such things also in other systems. Okay, a little bit of just one more mention here about an example that I won't talk about. Here, about an example that I won't talk about much, but you know that we are looking at the function at the same time, all these are happening in maybe crowded environments in cells, and all this also not only affects the function, but the material properties of a system. And in the context of polymer melts and solutions, there are viscoelastic properties studied using experiments, non-equilibrium experiments. Non-equilibrium experiments. And one of the most important quantities there is something called the entanglement length. How long a polymer has to be before you start seeing entanglement effects. And I won't go into too much detail, but say that by doing molecular dynamic simulations of linear fini polymer melts, we find that in computing the second Bausillium measure, we see an abrupt increase that happens at what experimental measurement. That happens at what experimentally is known to be the dynamic length. So, there seems to be an association with single-filament complexity and in such systems the onset of, let's say, topological knotting and entanglement visualastic effects. Okay, so back to the mathematical questions. All these results that I showed were All these results that I showed were for single filaments, right, characterizing the complexity of one chain system. But as I said, we have many chain systems. And how do we define, sorry, measures of environment for those? You know, this is almost not a question for traditional node theory, because what you have for notes usually transfers to links the same way. The Jones polynomial you can define in the same way for links. But for open pairs, But for open pairs, this is not the same. And I will go back at the lower level, let's say, the linkovids, the diagrammatic theory of notoids, which now for many components is called linkoids. It doesn't follow as easily, let's say, from notoids as it links it from notes. So we were able to define initially the Jones polynomial of open curves in three-space. Open curves in three space. The problem here, to give you an idea, you have many filaments, many strands. And now, when you do the smoothings of the crossings, now the connections may have changed, the strands. And there is an ambiguity there of how do you count your states. Without going into the details, we were able to define a Jones polynomial that did not require the use of. That did not require the use of any additional variables. That has been something that was proposed before. And of course, we can extend it to open curves in 3-space. So now you can have an open Boromian ring. And this is the open version of it. And you can change its geometry and eventually close it to become the Boromian ring itself. And you can see that in the polynomial captured. Captured. What Lou notice is that when we did that process, that formula that I didn't talk about of how we compute the Jones polynomial, it could be the same, we would have gotten the same result if we had closed the open curve diagrams, the linkoids, with using something called virtual crossings. This is a mathematical construction for those who are not in the Nothing that working in the area that actually making that connection between linkoids and virtual nodes and links allows us to use all the theory of virtual nodes that exists already to define new invariants of linkoids. And this has a lot of rich implications because now you can have an object like this. And maybe I should show in the previous picture here, we could close it strandwise. We could close it strand-wise, which makes sense maybe for physical systems. Three to four, one to two, right? And you obtain this virtual, you have to use virtual node theory to get invariance and so on. But you could have done this other closure. And if you are just mathematically studying this object, this object could be either of those. It could be a superposition of those. So we can define an entire virtual spectrum for a linkoid. Spectrum for a linkoid. And that gives us new invariants of linkoids that are even different from those of virtual links. It's a composition of those. And this means that when we do it for open curves in three-space, it is equivalent to thinking of a collection of open curves, thinking of closing them in three space with one arc that is not a real arc, not a real closure arc, but a virtual arc. Not a real closure arc, but a virtual closure arc. So, this also brings a lot of interesting mathematical questions that I'd be glad to talk more about. So, going back to the Jones polynomial of collections of open curves, that's similar simulation that contained 100 chains in a box, but I'm only doing it now for seven at a time because of computational complexity power. You can see, for example, the polynomials for seven chains at a time. For seven chains at a time, as the length of the chains increases. And of course, it is hard to tell something from looking at those, so we need some easier way to extract information from these polynomials. But at least the first thing we can see is the span of the polynomial is changing. And these have the same number of components. So this may be representative of the fact that the complexity will be changing in the system. If I have a few minutes. If I have a few minutes, I don't know, I've been talking a bit fast, trying to go into everything. Because we talked about periodic boundary conditions and periodic systems. And one way to measure entanglement in periodic systems we had proposed was using the periodic linking now. That is for systems that are composed of two generating chains, or we are looking at pairwise, there may be more. Are looking at pairwise, there may be more, but we are only looking at two at a time. So, the main idea here, without saying too much, was that you can unfold one chain and then take all the images of the other that intersect its minimal unfolding. And that gives you a measure, you add up their linking numbers of all these pairs of components here with the blue chain, and that gives you now an invariant that is symmetric. You could unfold the red chain and do the same. You could unfold the red chain and do the same in the blue, you get the same result. And that works for closed, open, or infinite chains. So, we recently tried to do something like that for the Jones polynomial. And that works, this is a cartoon, that works for three periodic boundary conditions as well. And now for the Jones polynomial, there are some subtle difficulties that don't allow things to be as clean. But you see, our goal here is. Clean, but you see, our goal here is to work with a periodic system without doing working in the identification space. Where, of course, it is difficult to work in the identification space. But also, when you have systems of open pairs, there is an ambiguity of how do you form the identification space. Now, the formation matters. How are you going to close it? So, we work in the periodic space and we are asking what is the minimal grain, let's say, of link that we can create. Of link that we can create from the system that captures as most of the complexity without repetitions. And we were able, like this, to define what is the, that for, to propose one of those, a minimal periodic link that has some nice properties, and in particular, define the periodic Jones polynomial as the Jones polynomial of that minimal link. It has the property that if you have a The property that if you have a for one chain in one periodic boundary condition, a tube-like region, and you, if you were to be taking, you have an infinite system, but suppose you just take a cutoff at a time and nth cutoff that you can keep increasing. And you take just the Jones polynomial of the nth cutoff, it turns out that Jones polynomial is related in this way to the Jones polynomial, the periodic Jones polynomial that we propose. So it is a So, it is in a sense a factor, though there is a remaining term that can be really complicated. Okay, so we used that to some textile patterns, and here you can see the Jersey and Twin. We made 3D structures for those, for which, so these are 3D polynomials. And again, the result is complicated, but still, it provides one way of characterizing. It provides one way of characterizing these structures that shows that the span of one is bigger than the span of the adjustable model of the other. So this could be applied maybe to the DNA integrity triangle or other such systems. So I will finish here, try to stay in time. Just thank my group and collaborators and you for staying here. You for staying here.
