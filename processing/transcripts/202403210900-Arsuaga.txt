                                            All right, the orientational order that is captured by the cells, correct? It's not going to be the same to have all these particles kind of pointing in the same direction, but just have them completely organize. And these liquid crystals are described by this vector M, which By this vector n, which is basically the average of orientations of these particles, that is called the director of the liquid crystal. This director happens to be local. And when you move through the domain of the liquid crystal, the direction of this director is going to change. So we are going to use a specific type of liquid crystal to model DNA, which is called the pneumatic liquid crystal. Basically, the pneumatic liquid crystals have local orientational order. Local orientational order, but not position. So all these, the center of masses of all these particles are going to be displaced with respect to each other. So you don't have position orientation. And then locally, they are going to have orientation all the order. So they'll be pointing in the same direction. That doesn't prevent you from in another region that you are studying this director looking at a different orientation. Now, how the liquid crystal is formulated is through this. That is formulated is through this, the energy is through this formula called the Ossim-Frank energy. And what it contains these terms, we don't have to worry about this last term, but we need to worry mainly about these three terms. These particular terms corresponds to this place where all these molecules would be pointing kind of like a hedgehog. We are going to not consider this case because it's not observed. In our initial model, we are not considering the choice steric. Model, we are not considered the quality staircase, which basically tells you how different layers would be organized or would rotate with respect to each other and the bending case. So in our first model, what we are going to do is just take the bending case. When we look at these images, what we see is, again, a number of order layers and these disorganized layers. So the first thing we did was to associate a penalty. To associate a penalty to this disorder phase. This basically is going to tell you: well, let's associate a penalty for the volume and the surface of this disorganized phase. And then in the outside is where we can include this liquid crystal formulation. And again, as I said in this initial model, we are not going to include the first two terms, but just focus on the bending component of the liquid crystal. So this is how. So, this is how the term would look like, but now we have to add one more term, or two more terms, that would correspond to the repulsion in between DNA fibers. And that is encoded by these two terms over here and would give us some sort of hexagonal path. Not going to get into the details, but that's kind of the idea. We did two studies, one that was competitive. One that was computational was spearheaded by our colleague Walker and Lucien State, and then by Carmen and her student Hildner, where we did mainly the analytical work. Alright, so when you look at the simulations, this is what you get out. When you minimize that energy, the minimization of that energy will give you a vector field, and the vector field you get is... Field and the vector field you get is what you observe in here. The red is going to be more organized, and the blue is going to be kind of more disorganized at the center. Now, one of the problems that we have here is that selecting or integrating this vector field to obtain a trajectory of the DNA is complicated. And I will introduce a different model later on that tries to address that problem, but that's something we. But that's something we still need to address. All right, so we go back, and now that we have a model and we can predict things, we say, well, what can we predict besides this vector field? What else can we say about these viruses? Well, we can ask two questions. One question is, well, can we predict the pressure, the atmospheric pressure of, or the cosmotic pressure of these viruses? And the answer is yes, because you can take the first The first variation of the energy that I gave you with respect to space, and that would give you just modic pressure. And we predicted values that are kind of consistent, not necessarily precise, but consistent what it's been reported in the literature. And then what we can also predict is, given the size of the capsid or the diameter of the capsid, and given the length of the genome, can I predict the size? Can I predict the size of the disorder? And the answer is here. This is what we observe experimentally from these images that other people have published. And this is what we predict. So usually it's not bad, except for T5, which is a specific type of virus that is not shown here. But it gives us kind of a ball partner. Yes, I do how the the disorder phase scales with those two inputs? We haven't done any scaling. We haven't done any scaling, but I can usually tends to have something like about half of the volume. In fact, we predict for P4, which has some radius of 22.5 nanometers, we predict about 10 nanometers is where the result of fixed. So it feels like it's scaling linearly with the scaling linearly. Linearly with the scale linearly in that case. But we haven't done like a formal scale. And for before, we would have some sort of pressure of 25 atmospheres. We cannot do that experiment yet. But we did this experiment to see if we can measure the isotropic core in the MP4. So, Tamara was the one starting this experiment where you grow the phages, you purify. The phages, you purify them, then you freeze them using this microbot, then you collect samples using the Kyrie microscope, get all these images, do image processing, and then look at the virus. So this is kind of the standard image of what you would see in one of these Cryo EM sessions. And you can look at the packing of the virus, and you start seeing. Packing of the virus, and you start seeing some patterns here, correct? In fact, something she did was to collect different types of packing. And you see some viruses have empty, viral empty, half DNA, some have low DNA packing, medium DNA packing, and full DNA packing. But you see, there is kind of the trajectories what we find. All right, and then when we combine all that information. And then, when we combine all that information together and try to produce layers, this is what we see. What we see is, remember the prediction said that the disorder phase starts about 10 nanometers, which is what this yellow line is. And that agrees, so the predictions agrees with the measurements that we observe here. And we find two layers of the end. And that's important because it kind of tells us what part is. Kind of tells us what part corresponds to the liquid crystal, what part corresponds to the disorganized part. We can look at more detail when we average some of these particles together. And what we observe is here is the capsule, here is the neck of where the what's called the connector, kind of the neck of the virus and it connects to the tail. And we observe this layer, which we think is connected. Which we think is continuous because it's the average of many viruses and should be kind of more like fibers coming out of the plane and towards you and then getting in here. And in a second layer, we clearly see these dots. So those dots correspond to DNA fibers coming up to you from the second side. And then after that, you see the disorganized phase. We see some ordering where you can see fibers. Where you can see fibers coming up to you, but then this is more circumstances. Tell me what it takes to make that picture because that's fantastic. Thank you. Tamara, how long you took it? Because you said, oh, you just do this and this and this and this, and it makes it sound like I presume that it's not. It took months, yeah, it took months. Once you have the process going, it's a matter of average and all. But then there are days that you There are days that you go, you do your sample, and of assign your biases to fit, and then you saw your sample, or anything can happen, but somewhere you have an assessment for. The actual physical job of averaging all the captions together, probably a couple hours. It's longer just to generate the data. It's probably a 24-hour collection where it's going, you know, circle by circle on the grid, collecting, you know, different micrographs, 3,000 images here. Images here. But the picture is just fantastic. All right, so let me. So, one of the key aspects here is that what I was mentioning here is that you have this layer that is kind of fibers pointing up to you, and you have a parallel layer also of fibers pointing up to you. But that shouldn't happen, correct? If you have DNA this way, If you have DNA this way, how are you going to have DNA also pointing in that direction? It doesn't make any sense. By repulsion, it should be at least to an angle. But what we see is that they tend to be parallel to each other. And in fact, what we observe when we do, let's see if I can run this simulation. Just one second. This is a simulation using molecular dynamics that Brian Cruz did. And what you're going to see is that the first layer forms nicely kind of in the way that I'm telling you, kind of spooling. And then the second layer doesn't want to be parallel to this layer. It actually is going to go into one. So you see how the first layer is forming, and then as soon as the first layer is filled, then you get A US field, then you get this kind of pointing in the kind of orthogonal direction in this particular case until everything is field. Right? So what this is telling us is that a simulation that includes basically bending and the repulsion between DNA fibers and so on and so forth is not enough to account for this part of the fibers that we look at. Now, furthermore, oops. Now, furthermore, there was this paper published in 2019 where they look at RNA viruses, double-stranded RNA viruses, and they observe again these parallel fibers. But then at the center, what's interesting too is that they observe kind of a helical organization of the genome. So somehow, when you move from the outer layers to the inner layers, The inner layers, these fibers tend to be horizontal, and then at some point it has to get out of that point, correct? Most likely because it cannot tolerate so much bending. So you can assume that you bend, you bend, you bend, and all of a sudden you cannot bend anymore and boom, you get out of the plane. And that's what we are calling the disorder phase. So our plan was: well, can we extend the previous model or develop something complementary to the model that accounts for The model that accounts for these parallel fibers together with this vertical alignment. So we extended the model that I introduced earlier, but now we added this K2 term. And to be able to obtain trajectories, what we did was to center ourselves or focus ourselves into cylindrical trajectories, as we've shown you. And again, the first term is zero, and now we are going to look at these two terms. And what we observe here that matters is the radius, and go back here, is the radius between these two coefficients. K3 is going to be the modulus for the bending, K2 is going to be the modulus for the cholesterol, meaning the angle in between two parallel fibers, correct? Do they want to be parallel to each other or do they want to be a rapper fibre? And what we observe is that the type of conformations that we observe. Of conformations that we obtain highly depend on that ratio, K3 over K2. So, for instance, if we have small K2, so K3 depending is preferred, then we see basically what we observe in the simulation. We see a layer, an outside layer, and then the second layer can just go vertical. Because there is no, you don't want to bend anymore, you just, and you don't have to pay a penalty for being parallel. A penalty for being parallel to these fibers, correct? So you just can form any angle in between two consecutive layers. So that's what we observe. However, if we increase the value of K2, what we observe is that then you have the outer layer and then the inner layer tends to, wants to form, still is paying a penalty for the bending and the K2, but it's forcing, because of the higher K2, is forcing the DNA to form this layer. And eventually, you get this other. To get this other layer when there is just no hope that you can bend it in. So, what this is telling us, we're still exploring this, but what this is telling us is that this ratio between K2 and K3 is really key to the organization of the gene. I think I can, the conclusions from this study was: well, we can have developed this liquid crystal model. And what we are trying to do with this model, this later model, where we can measure the ratio between K2K3, we are looking at the bending at around 10 nanometers, correct? That's where the DNA goes from order to disorder. So we are trying to model what happens in that transition when the DNA is bending. And those two energy. And those two energy terms happen. Right. So the last part of the talk is that electrostatic effects play a key role, and Alin showed that, and Chantal showed that, too, that how electrostatic effects really play a key role on how the DNA interacts with itself and with the protein circuit. So there is plenty of evidence that really. So, there is plenty of evidence that really soil conditions can really change whether DNA can pack or not. This is by Doug Smith at UC San Diego. And what they did is single molecule studies where they put salt and then they see how the DNA starts channeling or placing acts. There is this study by Alex Avilevich, where they look at different pressures and mechanical properties of H capsids, and also by. And also by the lab where Alex did his photograph with Bill Feldberg at UCLA, where they look at how the DNA, the distancing between DNA fibers, change within the capsule when you're exposed to different soil concentrations. Now, something that we've observed too, these are reconstructions done by Camara. This is for P four. You see here the capsid, you see kind of the neck of the DNA here. Of the DNA here, and when you color this according to the charges, what you see is that most of the interior of the capsid is red, corresponding to negative charges. So the DNA would be pushed away from the capsid. And also, there's part of the DNA that is going to go to this little neck, and you have these different charges, especially here on negative charges here on top. Charges here on top and here on the middle of the network. So electrostatics definitely are playing a part in the container that is keeping the DNA confined. And also when you, this is an experiment where we did the same as before, looking at the different layers, except that now we leave it in spermine, which is a four-volume positive ion. You leave it for You leave it for, I think it's like a week or two weeks actually in solution with spermine, and then what we put, we look at those viruses at the privilegen, and then we see how the external layer was really condensed towards the center. So this is kind of telling us that DNA, even though this is the diameter of this virus, some of the persistent length of the DNA, by adding this extra. Adding these extra positive values, you can still crunch the DNA event pattern. We need to get more data on this. This is a preliminary, but you can see this clear difference in the pattern. Alright, so we had to develop a model that would correspond to that. And Pei happened to be an expert on electrostatics, and he kind of was the The spirit person doing this. So, we are going to take the K3 term, the bending, and now we are going to look at the electrostatics, the entropic term, because you have ions floating in the environment. C naught is going to correspond to DNA, and now we're going to have a remergence potential that would tell us kind of how DNA-DNA fibers would interact when they are near. A DNA fibers could interact when they are near each other. So, a key aspect here is that when we talk about K3, K3 is going to depend on the persistent length. And when you have these ions in solution, the persistent length is going to have this expression. Now, these Ci's will correspond to the concentration of the ions. C said or Ci corresponds to the Corresponds to the variance of all those atoms. All right, so then you have that energy, and then you have to basically what you have is you have a box, you have the capsid inside, you put all the ions there. The DNA in this case is not a continuous curve, but you have an interaction that tells you all the angles in between those particles. What you need to do is compute the first variation with respect to the different Respect to the different concentrations of ions, of DNA and ions, and that would give you the chemical potential and also have the Poisson equation to let these ions diffuse. And what we obtain are pictures like this, where you have this cross-section, you have the box that we put for the environment. This will be a cross-section of the virus. Cross-section of the virus. We don't allow any DNA at the center because of the bending penalty. And we see the concentration of this particular one is for DNA. Now we have sodium is positively charged, and what you would expect is that sodium would interact with DNA, and that's exactly what we are seeing here. Collocalizes with DNA, and chloride that is. DNA and chloride that is negatively charged, it would move out of the capsule. So, we can do simulations like this. We can add different concentrations. These are for monovalent and vivalent ions. We can do more to express this. But this is kind of telling us what you would expect to see, which is kind of DNA getting outside of the center of the disorder code that I mentioned earlier and co-localizing with that positive. We can, based on this, we can estimate how the contribution from different terms would be affected by the concentration of sodium chloride. And we see how the electrostatic, the energy or the electrostatics comes down, as you have positive ions, and the Lenar Jones increases as the DNA, DNA fibers comes up. Alright, so the conclusion from this model is that we Model is that we, as far as we know, we propose this continuum model for the first continuum model for this ion DNA diffusion. One of the advantages of this model over molecular dynamics is that in principle we don't have the limitation of DNA length, and so the system can be integrated no matter the length of the genome. We can predict the distribution of DNA and ions as the system reaches equilibrium. One of the reviewers. Equilibrium. One of the reviewers asked us to talk about, to do the study as the DNA is being added, but I'm not talking about that today. We can estimate the distance between DNA strands, and that's something we need to check against other experiments. And we can estimate kind of the weight how the each energy term will change with this with this stuff. Alright, so this is the last slide. So the message, kind of take-home message. Of take-home message that hopefully I convince you that phages provide a nice system to study, to develop a theory of DNA and their confinement. Previous works by HUD and Livolin and others, what they did was to take DNA in solution and add a large concentration of salt. And they observed these toroids. And it's typical of this type of analysis. The issue there. Is the issue there is that you are limited by the salt that you are using. So here we have a protein container that is limiting or is confining the DNA. Of course you could ask, well can we do it in other organisms? And then you think, well if you take bacteria you already have a ton of other proteins that are in in the meat in the in the in the cell, correct? Because you have histone like proteins you're going to have, toposomeras you're going to have, We're going to have MACB or some smaller kind of structural proteins that might interfere with those styles. So we think that phages are just kind of states. We think that we observe that confinement and the topological complexity. In principle, this would be our rule that applies to all systems. And the cells have to evolve methods to really keep this topological complexity. We think that the DNA is in liquid crystal space. DNA is in liquid crystal state. In liquid crystal state, there have been a number of observations, and we are developing this kind of more complete theory based on experimental data. And at this level, I think, like for a long time, I was thinking, whether the bending is the key aspect of the DNA inconsignment. But I think I was wrong. I think what we are observing is that cholesterolics play a key role. Play a key role, like remember those DNA strands going next to each other. So that means that you have to pay a high penalty for just moving out of the plane. And also the electrostatic can't play a key role. As we add more ions, we can still bend and bend it in the plane. So that's all. Thank you very much. Thanks. Lots of time for questions and discussion. For questions and discussion.
