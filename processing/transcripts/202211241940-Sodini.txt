 Okay, let's begin our evening session. Our first talk in the evening is by Giacomo Sadinha from the University of Vienne. He will speak about, since he talks about features, functions in the affected software space applications to software space. Let me thank the organizer for giving me this opportunity. It's a pleasure to give this talk together. So, I'm going to present a few results developed in collaboration with Astrov Organizer and Serbia Stavare related to a criterion for the density and energy of subalgebra of Lipschitz functions in the metrics of the spaces, and an application of this criterion to a specific metric space, which is the one of probability measures with the past time distance. So I will start with the result in originatory mesospaces and then move to the result in a specific case. So the first three slides will be mostly definitions and setting, but you have to fix it. And also many of the definitions I will give, you of course already know them and have been already presented, but it's a slight difference to the normal relaxation approach related to the algebra, so I will still present them. But I apologise, because we'll be boring for the first three slides. Just be boring for the first three slides. So, okay, Xdm is a Polish metric measure space. I fix an exponent P, and I denote by Lippy Xd the space of Lipptis and bounded function on the space. So the first definition is standard, is one of the possible asymptotic Lipschitz constants, and this is simply the definition of the Break-Schiger energy. And as I was saying, I will consider a subadjurger of functions in the subset of which is a mounted function, and I will assume that it is unit. function and I will assume that it is unital in the sense that it contains the constant function equal to one and it separates one. And okay, so you can with this Holismetric measure space and the algebra you can use the definition of a relaxed gradient which is called PA relaxed gradient. So it's a classical one. But instead of taking the sequence in the whole algebra of which is the bounded function, you restrict yourself to this algebra you fix at the beginning. So you can So you obtain a definition of B1P, which is a space of functions with at least one relative gradient, and the matrix of L space is the intersection of this set with LB, of course. And okay, as in the classical theory, of course, you can find the minimal PA relaxed gradient, which is denoted like this. And with this, you can define a Tiger energy, which is also equivalent to described as the relaxation of the pre-Sigar energy, but still takes. The pre-shigged energy, but still taking approximating sequences inside the algebra. And again, of course, we have that with this norm, this is a Banach space. Of course, in general, this will not be a Hilbert space, but I will present an example which we will have in Berkeley. And from a notation point of view, of course, we can recover the normal theory, let's say, just setting the algebra A equal to d equal of X T and we drop in the notation the dependence on the algebra dp considering the Uh okay, what the the the property we want to study is the density of uh the algebra A in in energy, and this is simply the definition of density we are using. So for any function f in the having a relaxed gradient, you can find a sequence of functions in the algebra approximating it in the topology of L0, so convergence almost everywhere, and such that the asymptotic. Such that the asymptotic leaf is constant of the functions converge of the minimal relaxed gradient, the normal one itself. If this happens, you say that the algebra is density energy, and this is equivalent to say that you have an equal minimal relaxed gradient and also equality of dispenses. Okay, so now we have a notion of density, and in general it may be difficult to check that an algebra is dense. So the first result I'm presenting is a criterion which may be simpler to Which may be simpler to check, that gives you the desired density. So you fix a set Y which is dense in X and you have simply to check this property, which is equivalent to the density. So if for every Y in the set capital Y, the distance function from the point Y has at least one relaxed gradient and its minimal PA relaxed gradient is bounded above by one, then you have density. You have tested. Actually, this is equivalent, but one implication is rather simple. And I will sketch in a moment a proof of the result. Let me mention that the density may be useful in case you are considering a class of functions in your algebra that have nice properties, that high density will pass through the space, of course. So, for example, if your algebra satisfies some parallelogram identity of this form, then you have the parallelogram identity at the level of the pre-shiger. Levelogram identity at the level of the pre-Sigar energy, and by density you get it for the Tiger energy. So the Tiger energy is spaghettic, and you get that your matrix over the space is impacted. I will show you a specific application of this property proof. So concerning the proof, it is just a sketch. And one, of course, is the property. It is property also, this one. And we have just, as I was saying, one implication is rather simple. So I will just prove that one implies the density and the density. implies the density and I will use this notation. So you can without loss of general you can assume the distance is bounded above by one because if you truncate it you obtain an equivalence over space of natural changes. But it is useful because then you can express the property one in this way. So you know that you can bound from above the minimum relaxed gradient of the square distance with two times the distance itself. And of course it is enough to prove this inequality because if you have this inequality If you have this inequality, then this is already lower semi-continuous. If you relax the right-hand side and you obtain the classic Shiger energy, let's say it's larger than the one continuous with respect to the large rate. The other inequality is always true, so you get the equality. If you interrupt for this production, one truncation, you assume that M is finite? Yes, it's a finite measure. It's a finite positive measure. Okay, so the M is to. Okay, so the game is to prove this inequality using these inequalities. And the trick, let's say that the technique is to fix a Leaf system bounded function and to introduce the Off-lax regularization of the function. And the reason is that in the Optlax regularization, you have precisely the term you can estimate the minimum relaxed gradient of. So you like this expression. And as a notation, I will also use this one. So this will be. I will also use this one. So, this will play the role of a sort of derivative of the semi-group of F, and it is built in the following way. So, you fix F, a time t, and the point x, and you take all the minimizing sequences for the definition of the flux semigroup, and you take the supremum among all those sequences of the limb sup of the distance function at x computed in an element of the sequence. And I will skip some details, but what you can prove is that this function here, Is that this function here, so this sort of derivative times t to the minus one, is a PA relaxed gradient of QTF. And this is crucial because you know that this is converging to f as t goes to zero. And you know also that this is bounded uniformly. So up to a sub-sequence, you will be able to find something, and in the end, we will be able to estimate the minimal pier relaxing gradient of F with the limit of this object, which I will prove have nice properties with respect to the Lipschitz constant. Properties with respect to the Lipschitz constant of F. So now I will explain it a little bit. These inequalities and equalities were already known, so I will not enter into details here. So you start from this one and you integrate it with respect to it, to M, sorry. Then you use some Fubin here and then you pass to the limit. And okay, now as I was saying, you know that this object is uniformly bounded here, then after some sequence. Here, then up to some sequence will converge to something. This something, since QTF is converging to F, will be a T-relaxive gradient of F. So you have this inequality here provided by the Liminf and this inequality since this is larger than the minimal relaxed gradient of F. And finally, you use this inequality here to estimate this object with the Lipschitz constant, and then you have basically that the Shiger energy is larger than the PA Shear energy. And so we conclude in this way. Your match. So you conclude in this way. So I have hidden some details, but the crucial point is that you use the hot flux regularization because you can estimate the PA gradient of the distance query. Okay, now we have this abstract criterion. I will show you an example in which you can apply it to get the Bertianity of the Metric Solway space. And since my PhD, I studied mainly optimal transport. This is related to bus design spaces. So I'm sure that every business is split. Baselstein spaces. So I'm sure that everybody knows the definition of Baselstein space, but I still recall it. So we are in Rd, and this is the space of probability measures with a finite second moment. And this is simply the Basel-Stein distance. So you take mu nu in p2 over d, you take all possible couplings between mu and nu. So these are probability measures on the product space having as margin as mu and nu. You compute this function and you take the input. And it is well known that this is a complete and severable. A complete and separable distance on the space operating measure to define a second option. So, once you fix the positive and finite Borel measure on the space, you have a polished metric measure space to which you can hopefully apply the theme. Okay, but what's the most natural algebra of functions you can consider on probability measures? Well, the most simple, well, okay, apart from constants, the most simple function you can consider on probability measures is simply the map sending a measure mu to the evaluation. Sending a measure to the evaluation against some regular function. So we'll consider this algebra, which is simply made like this. So you consider phi1, phi n function in CB1, meaning that those functions are continuous bounded and with bounded derivative. You get a vector of evaluations of mu and you apply to it some regular function on Rn. This is an algebra of Yitzhak's functions on the Washington space and we simply Space and we simply denote it by sil 1. This is particularly nice as a function on the space of probability measures because they come already with some structure. So you have already some notion of derivative of gradient, let's say, not only of norm of the gradient as you have in the normal theory of matrix or space. Because given a function like this, you can compute this object, which is very simple. So it's a sort of chain rule, let's say, where the sum of the partial derivative of psi, the The partial derivative of psi, the external function computed in the evaluation, and the gradient of the function phi. And well, there are many reasons why this is a good notion of derivative. For example, with the sort of chain rule and fundamental theorem of calculus, we can say that this notion of derivative can be used to recover the oscillation of a cylindrical function along a curve. But stronger reason to say that this is a good notion of derivative is the Is a good notion of derivative, is the following equality. So if you have a cylindrical function f made by some psi and some phi, then you have, so there is no measure, this is a purely metric thing. You know that the asymptotic Lipschitz constant of the cylindrical function f at mu can be computed as this integral. And you see this integral is very nice because you just have the square norm of the gradient of the function f. And once you integrate it, so And once you integrate it, so if you integrate it, you get the Pre-Schigger energy. And the Perry Shiger energy is just a square norm. So it satisfies in some L2 space. So it satisfies the parallelogram identity. And then if you're able to prove density, you obtain that the matrix of the space on the space of probability matrix is a hidden space. And the way we proved the density, of course, was using the criterion I showed you before. So we are able to prove that the minimal two-way relaxed gradient of the distance from a fixed Gradient of the distance from a fixed probability is one level of by one. Of course, we started from this problem and then realized that it would be generalized to more general settings. Sorry, so here you fixed any finite measure M on P2. Yeah, it's for any for P21. I will give you a heuristic idea of why this is true. So, and the point is that the VASSINT. So the point is that the vast sustained distance square, which is the object, or the vast sustained distance, which is the object you want to estimate the minimum relaxed gradient, is not a cylindrical function in general. It's not bounded, for example. But what you can do is to, okay, we fix the, say, the fixed point was y before, the measure ν, and for every measure μ, we consider a a pair of optimal Kantrovich potentials. If you if you've never never seen them, they're simply Never seen them, they're simply functionalizing this equality. So you integrate the first one with respect to mu, the second one with respect to mu, and you obtain one half the vast strain distance square. And it is a classical thing in optimal transfers, for Reignet theorem, that this integral gives you the vast strain distance squared. So now it's rather easy. So you define this function u of mu, which is simply the first function, plus a constant, which is the integral of the other with respect to. Which is the integral of the other with respect to. And then you see that if you integrate it with respect to mu, then this comes out because mu is mass equal to one, and then you obtain precisely this object. This means that in a way you are expressing the vast and distance squared, okay, with one alpha in front, as the integral of some function with respect to mu. So it seems to be a cylindrical function. The point is that this function in general will not be continuous and almost differential, almost every. And almost differential almost everywhere, but will not be C1 or bounded, or its derivative will not be bounded in general. So this is not a cylindrical function. But let's pretend for a moment that this is, so that also that it is independent of mu, because this varies with respect to mu. But if you pretend for a second that this is not true, then, okay, you have your cylindrical function f. It is Lipschitz, so you can estimate the minimal Tway-relaxed gradient with its Lipschitz constant. But we saw before that we have this nice But we saw before that we have this nice equality between the Lipschitz constant and some L2 norm. And L2 norm in this case is just a derivative of the Kantravich potential. And when you integrate it, you get the Bausis strength distance one. So in the end, you have proven that the minimal Touhou-relax gradient is less than the Bausi strength distance. And then you can expect to obtain that the gradient of the distance not with the power 2 is less than 1. How much do you need? Five minutes. Five minutes. Um okay. Um then uh so it was fast, so I have some some things that uh still needs to be done or are been doing right now. So um everything I said today was was related to the Palestine 2 space on Rd with the Euclidean norm. So we were able also to extend the results to Hilbert spaces and also to manifold, but we never treated But we never treated neither the case in which you have a different exponent here and another one here. So maybe you have a Q here and a T here, so you consider the T passes time distance and the Q solar space. So it may be interesting to study if you still have the density of cylindrical function even considering an arbitrary complete and separable metric space X D. And in case instead the Bayes space is a banana space, Banach space, it would be interesting to see which properties pass from the Banach space to the metric subway space. So, for example, in case the base space B is reflexive, maybe you can get that the metric subway space is re-reflexive. And also, maybe some uniform convexity property passes from the base space to the whole space. And last but not least, and that is something I'm not really an expert in, but Something I'm not really an expert in, but this problem at the beginning was motivated by some machine learning magic because this is stuff from Mación Cournasière. He wanted to find an efficient way or an interesting way to compute the Wassenstein distance. And these results seem to provide, so you have the density of a very simple function in the matrix over space. So in particular, if you are in a compact set, you can approximate. On a compact set, you can approximate very well the vast line distance with cylindrical functions, which it tells me are simple to be computed by a computer. So it may be interesting from the data science viewpoint to be able to compute them. And okay, I have concluded with this. Thank you very much. We have got continuous questions. Can I ask, just in the last slide, so you were looking at this banner space B and reflexivity of the components, but is it also interesting if B is at a finite dimensional space? So just RNA with a different norm. Yeah, I mean perhaps not just like I don't know something. Indeed the starting point is precisely this one. So I kind of finished to do these first two things. And indeed you start from Rd with a nice norm which you can generate. With a nice norm, which you can generalize our strategy. So, this is nice means that you can apply those results of optimal transport that tells you that there is an optimal transport map and it is unique and has a nice shape. That sounds like it excludes non-strictly transportation. Precisely to be precise, you need to have that the norm function is C1 and that you have in the unit pool with respect to this norm, you have what. With respect to this norm, you have what is called inside-outside epsilon-ball. So, for every, I can draw a picture, you have the ball in this norm, and for every point, so there exists some epsilon, such that for every point on the boundary on the ball, you can have some little ball of radius epsilon inside and outside touching the market. If you have something like this, then you can apply basically everything we have done and you obtain the result. Then, by approximation, you recover the result for every Approximation and you recover the result for every normal quality. And then, if you want to extend it to Banach spaces, I use an embedding in L infinity, because you can embed the Banach space in L infinity, for even the metric space, you can embed it into L infinity, and in L infinity you have nice projections that make your space stock with a finite dimensional case that you use it. But yes, for sure, the starting point is the case in which you are in a finite dimension with an admin. Which are a finite dimension with an admitted model. Of this measure M, you had no restriction or no restriction at all. Also, making examples of measures, I know you studied them, but it's very complicated, at least to me, to imagine measures on a space. But no, there are no assumptions on the methods. Finally, positive. If you have, in principle, also kind of reverse inequality, if you study for a positive style. Quality, if you study for Wassenstein's space energy on some Wassenstein space is the underlying space, and if this is infinite, can you conclude that the underlying space is also I don't know. I don't know. It's a very good point. Maybe. Thank you. So we start in three minutes.   Do you think everyone's not? I don't know everyone. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, I don't know. If you said what you are on like the sound case. Okay, let's begin. It's a pleasure to introduce Josuki Shimizo from Kyota. He'll speak about the construction of canonical p-energy from the statistical actor. People are introducing, and I would like to thank co-organizers for inviting me and keeping this talking. So, this talk is mainly based on my PC thesis, and in this talk, I focus on Shepnski Carpet. So, Krana Shape Minsky Carpet, I designed it. And we regard this Shepnski carpet as a metal integration species, where there is a carpet, it is a compact compass. But it is a compact compact subset of R and D is a UV and measure mu is uh statistically anymore. Also failure. I do you know why it's this. Are we know what it is? Otherwise, uh so the main object is uh that is PNG and logistical space. So I can skip this discussion because there so there are several presentations in this conference. So the theory of anisometric spaces gives so these guides by using some upper gradient or another. Apparent gradient or another notions. But so, so roughly speaking, this theory of analysis spaces is to construct a counterpart of length of Pelagian. So, but unfortunately, this metallic species does not watch this series. And to see such phenomena, for example, the any one people in the sense of. In the sense of upper gradient phase in one state discount. And also, the usual notion of P modulus, so probably of curves, if we consider the P modulus of curves, then on the shaping skip of it, the curve problem is doing the X side on the right side. That's funny as the emotions zero. Also, as Also, as now Takato thinks, to this circle, the conform mobile dimension of the shape in skip puppet is not attained. So, however, in the case of P, if we consider case P is equal to, then so this corresponds to the D shape forms the variant motion on some generic just PC. Such is already done by. Such is already done by Barrel, Bars, and September 1. I mean that the two energy and one superspaces are already constructed on the shapes composite. So what I want to do is to generalize this service as general P. And as June as explained in June's talk, so we I So we I I adopt seven this essence. So let me briefly call the our main structure. Okay. So I suppose that all every everyone always sees this graph of exchange and and we consider the graph of GM G n on the shaping ski curve it. And on discrete graph graphs we can always consider some P and discrete P energies. P energy, discrete P energies. So this is in my display. What Scott and Zhou had shown is that they obtain the Z energy as some scaling unit of this discrete Z energy. But with me, but I mentioned but the we needed some scale as I can here to to get some to to get some notary values. So draft is speaking, I mean the main my main judgment is the p analysis for when t is when t is greater than the r for the edge. I suppose that I can skip the definition of r was 0 for one image. Okay. So so before I'm moving into the results To the results, so let me mention the main difficulties on this sentence. So, because we consider a sequence of graphs and our aim is to get some limit of discrete energies, so we need to prepare some uniform estimates for discrete energies. And so, here, so in particular for p capacity of capacitance here, C D M so P capacity. C DM, so choppas info DNS where people say good one thing.
