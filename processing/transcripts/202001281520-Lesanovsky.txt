He's not here. So is he actually expected to come? Does anyone know? No, he's not coming. Okay, but thanks to him. I'm here. And okay, I love it, I have to say. I mean, this place is amazing. But you will see that this talk is going to be a bit different, I think, compared to what we have witnessed so far. I mean, I almost feel like the experimentalists here, but I'm not doing experimental. Experimentalists here, but I'm not doing experiments. So it's about facilitation constraints in interacting Gridboard gases, and those constraints are not emergent, like fractons maybe, but they are just there and caused by interactions. And just one thing, maybe that I should get straight at the very beginning. I don't know whether you know me, so I thought maybe I just put the slide here. So I was for the past 10 years at the University of Nottingham. Juan is also there. He's giving the talk after me. And I moved not so long ago. And I moved not so long ago in autumn last year to the University of TÃ¼bingen that is in Germany and here it's in the south and the next biggest city is Stuttgart. Berlin is here in case you wonder. So Robin from Robin Hood who you probably know too, a very nice medieval town. Okay, so this is the outline of my talk. So I start with some fundamentals. What are Rydberg atoms? What's a Rydberg quantum simulator? We'll talk about blockade facilitation constraints that emerge very naturally in those settings. Very naturally in those settings. We'll then talk about this order and how it emerges. And in this context, I will also show you some experimental results because this is actually what motivated those works. And then let's see how far I get. I will also talk a little bit about going away from this disorder to maybe a more natural cause of randomness, which is electron-phonon coupling, and how the coherent regime actually gives rise to interesting. Nice to interesting phone address facilitation dynamics. And then I will give you a summary and possibly an outlook. Let's see how it goes. All right. So atoms and Rudberg states. So those are real things that you can prepare in the lab. So you might remember your quantum mechanics lecture, hydrogen atom, this is that. So we think of an atom that has one valence electron, it encircles the nucleus or the inner electronic core. Uh and uh these atoms have a long lifetime, which is quite surprising because the electron is typically very far away, up to the order of uh a micrometer even from this inner core. And you see also that this large displacement between charges will lead to interesting properties. So of course, I mean, as I said, I'm not an experimentalist, so for me an atom looks like that. And I think this is how we can kind of get together, right? Because I just say an atom that is Because I just say an atom that is in its ground state we can regard as a spin down state of a pseudo spin one half particle. And when an atom is in the Rydberg state, we just say it's a spin up state. So and I think like this we can connect. But this is kind of the physical basis of what I'm going to talk about here. Interesting things happen as soon as there are more than one atom. Because you can already see those are kind of charge distributions which of course interact if you bring them close. And just to write down a Hamiltonian here, there won't be too many examples. Hamiltonian here. There won't be too many equations in this talk. Just the interaction looks like that. So you have some kind of distance dependence and some parameter that parametrizes the interaction strength. And you see this is only present when both atoms at the same time are excited. So therefore, we have these projectors onto the excited states. And these projectors we also often will call just n, just a number operator, counting how many Rukberg excitations there are. Yes. So I missed why is it such long lifetimes? Because it's very hard. Because it's very hard for these atoms to get rid of angular momentum, actually. So it's also, I mean, very difficult also for the planets kind of to collapse to the sun. I think this is the fundamental reasoning, yeah. Well, okay, that's if they go directly from spin up to spin down, but there's all these intermediate states. Why don't they if you look at this electric, if you look at the transition rules, you see that actually the transition strength, and this has to do with the coupling to the electromagnetic field, which ultimately leads to this decay. Magnetic field, which ultimately leads to this decay, is actually a function of the frequency of the emitted photons. And this goes together with the matrix element, which becomes weaker and weaker and weaker, the further apart this state and this state are. And then you do look at the scaling and you find, I think, that it scales as 1 over n to the 3, I think. The matrix homogeneous two states. Yes, exactly. But it's not only the matrix. Yes, exactly. But it's not only the matrix element, it's also kind of the prefactor that comes from the microphone. But what I mean is what about the Rydberg state and the adjacent Rydberg state? There, that's not in your Hilbert space that you're. No, no, no, no, no. But this is exactly what I meant by saying the transition frequency also comes into the game, because there the transition frequency is very low, right? If you go from one Rydberg state to another, the matrix element is large, so this gives you overall a small rate if you multiply. And likewise, when you go from When you go from a high-lying Rudwerk state to a very low-lying state, the transition frequency is large, but the matrix element is smaller. And so, this, of course, doesn't explain it, but if you look at the numbers, then you see they conspire such that you actually end up with rather long lifetimes. Okay, so now if you look for another interesting bit comes about when you look at the strength of this interaction, because you find that it actually can be tremendous. So, it scales with the 11th power of what's called the principal quantum number. It's just the degree of excitation. Quantum number, it's just a degree of excitation of this Rydberg atom, and you can easily achieve regimes. You may be more familiar maybe with ultra-cold groundset atoms. You can easily achieve regimes where the interaction strength between those atoms is 10 times, sorry, not 10 times, 10 orders of magnitude stronger than what you typically would encounter between ground state atoms. And so you have tri tremendously large interaction strength so that you can actually do very nice spin physics even though the lifetime doesn't appear to be very long. Doesn't appear to be very long. Okay, kinetic constraints. So we have heard about kinetic constraints throughout. I just want to clarify what that is for my purpose, so there's nothing emergent. In the course of the talk, you will see now that I always consider situations where, let's say, one spin can change its state, and this change of the state of the spin is actually conditioned on the state of the environment, which constrains this spin-flipping dynamics. And we have seen that this can be the cause of. We have seen that this can be the cause of a reason for helicity breaking, for quantum scars, for quantum interstability, for all sorts of interesting collective phenomena. So, okay, why Rydberg atoms? So, and what can one do with them? So, of course, I mean, you are probably more familiar with the work by Lucin, but there's also this group by Antoine Rouvet near Paris and Palisot, who have actually pioneered this method of putting together ensembles. Putting together ensembles of optical traps. Now they can do it 3D. They can load each trap with one atom that you can, in a controlled way, bring from the brown state to the electronics excited state, to the root work state. And by this, you can actually dial in, in principle, arbitrarily shaped Hamiltonians that generically look like that. So you have kind of an external field acting on this pseudo-spin formed by these atoms trapped in those individual traps, and you have interactions that actually. Individual traps, and you have interactions that are typically binary. Okay, so how do constraints come about? So, this is now really how the physics kicks in here. So, and in order to see this, let's look at the simplest manifestation, which is the so-called blockade constraint. And it becomes very clear when you look at two atoms. And now you can imagine we have a scenario like that, where one atom is in the excited state, another one is in the ground state. Now, what you want to do, of course, is you want to excite this second atom. This second atom with the laser. But what you have to consider is that now the energy of the excited state of the second atom is actually shifted with respect to the bare energy because there's an interaction between those two atoms. And now, if you try to promote this atom from the ground state to the excited state, you see you can't do this because you're simply off-resonant. And this implements this blockade constraint, which you already love, and because it comes in the manifestation of the PXP model. The manifestation of the PXP model. Many of you have worked on this. And just in practice, if you now look at experiments, you find, for instance, that this blockade constraint gives rise to a situation where you can, for instance, not create Rydberg atoms at arbitrary positions, but you see that there is a certain minimal distance between these blobs, blue blobs, which are actually imaged Rydberg excitations. But more in the many-body context, you know that you can realize all sorts of phases. That you can realize all sorts of phases and phase transitions, but also you can look at interesting non-egotic behavior which comes about in the form of these quantum scars. And you have many of you have looked at this in very great detail. Can you say again why you cannot do this excitation? It's just energetically forbidden. I mean, this is what I wanted to say with this cartoon. So you shift this level up, and now you see the laser has a certain frequency, which for an atom which is just Which, for an atom which is just sitting in vacuum, essentially, with nothing else nearby, is resonant with the transition from the ground state to the excited state. But once you have this energy shift, you see the laser is basically pointing into the void. There's no state at that energy which would correspond to the frequency of a laser photon. And this is why you can't excite it. So this is very nice, and there have been done a number of very spectacular Been done a number of very spectacular experiments with this blockade constraint. So, this is not so much what I'm interested in for the purpose of this talk. I rather want to look at the situation which goes under the name fussy leaguation constraint, and there we will make the energetics work for us in a slightly different way. Can I ask again? So, there's a bunch of other states there. I mean, there's a continuum all there. So, you should. You should not a continuum, right? I mean, we are still below the ionization threshold. Okay, I'm saying nearly continuum. So they're piling up at the... Yes. So what I'm so let's say you're, I don't know, what principal quantum number you can... Oh, well, you can go up to 100, 200. Yes, so let's say you shifted the hundredth one up by this blockade. Yes. But now the 95th is now in residence. That's not going to happen. This is not going to happen. I mean, if you look at the energetics, I mean, just to give you a feel, maybe the difference between neighboring Bruitberg states can be on the order of 100 gigahertz, for instance. And typical energy shifts due to the interaction are on the order of megahertz. And the typical line width of a good laser is a kilohertz or even smaller. So there's a huge separation of scales, so that this is perfectly fine. But it's absolutely important, this question, because implicitly This question, because implicitly, this is all assumed. That here you have this huge separation of energy scales that allows you to boil down everything down to this kind of description of spin-one-half particles. Okay, so this situation we have seen, so we have one excited atom and the other one sits here in the ground state, and we now see that due to the interaction between these two Riptox states, the excited state of the second atom is shifted. Of the second atom is shifted. So before I had the blockade constraint, so it was shining in the laser at the frequency that was corresponding to the single atom resonance. But now what I can do is I can actually exploit that I know what this interaction strength is between the atoms and I can dial in a laser frequency that matches now this energy shift. And now I can promote this second atom to the excited state. But this will only work, of course, if there is an excited atom nearby, hence this facilitation. Nearby, hence this facilitation. And this has been studied in a number of works in the past 10 years. I just give you some works here. You can look at dissipative state engineering, you can use it for quantum information, you can look at quantum glasses and growth dynamics. For instance, you see that just due to this facilitation, you can, if you do this in a, if you did this in a glass, you can kind of, I mean, I shouldn't make jokes about epidemics right now, but this is what you can do kind of in this course. This is what you can do kind of in this quantum domain. But does the radio stay there very long? Does the tidy stay outside a long life? Well, it's on the order of 100 microseconds, but just to give you a feel for how long these experiments take, and I will show you some actual experimental data in a second, this time scale of the experiment is typically on the order of microseconds, one or two microseconds. So there's still a factor of maybe 50 between. So now let's get to So now let's get to the experiment. And as I said, okay, this is kind of all based on experiments that are conducted in a group by Antoine Beauvais in Palisot, near Paris. And what they can do, and this is already old, is they can arrange atoms in these traps. And just for the purpose of this talk, we look at the situation where we have a chain of atoms. The distance between those atoms is only the order of micrometers. And of course, again, we use the model that we have. The model that we have for each of these atoms a two-state description, and then just here for the sake of bookkeeping, I tell you that the nearest neighbor interaction is just V and N, and the next nearest neighbor interaction is Vn and N. So now, if you now take the Hilbert space of this problem and you can of course span it by classical basis states, and you draw each for for draw for each For each state of a three-side system, these state symbols, and order these states by the energy, you find that you would draw such a network where here the energy points into the vertical direction. So this is completely general. You see, I mean, the energy depends on the laser detuning and the interactions. And now I told you there is this facilitation constraint where I just match the interaction energy between two atoms to the laser detuning, to the frequency mismatch. Laser detuning to the frequency mismatch of the laser. And once I do this, you see that this state diagram here collapses in a way that I form now this line of resonance states. And those will be states now that span an effective smaller Hilbert space in which this constraint dynamics takes place. So this is all very simple. I mean, you see now this Hilbert space structure collapses to a linear chain, which really looks like a tight finding model. And you see now that an excitation. Then an excitation when starting here is just propagating from the left to the right by creating those pairs of excitations. And this will become important, the fact that on the way of the propagation procedure, you create these nearest neighbor excitations. So now you can, of course, it's very simple, run into some numerical code and plot the density of excitations as a function of time. And you find once the excitation starts here, time equals zero inside one, it propagates nicely to the other side, and then of course it bounces off. Other side, and then of course it bounces off and some comes back, but of course, there's some scattering and interference. So now you do the experiment and you see this. So nothing's happening. So this is which is a bit disheartening. But now we came into the game as theorists and try to understand a little bit better how this comes about. And now if you think about the actual physics of the system, you will arrive at the point where you say, okay, something is not quite right when Okay, something is not quite right when we are modeling our atoms at point-like particles. Because remember, we had this facilitation constraint, and that is what encompassed some kind of fine-tuning such that the nearest neighbor interaction was matching kind of the mismatch in the laser frequency. And this, of course, you can do when you have points that sit in space, but in an actual experiment, these atoms have temperature, and the positions of the atoms are actually uncertain. The atoms are actually uncertain, so they can fluctuate from shot to shot. This is actually not the case, or this problem does not occur when you work in this blockade regime, like for instance Lukin did when investigating this kind of scarring or the absence of ergodicity, because this blockade is not sensitive on some kind of fine-tuning of the position or the interaction strength. There, you only require that the interaction strength between two neighboring Rydberg atoms is sufficiently low. Atoms is sufficiently large, when it's much larger than the land width of the laser, then you are good. You don't care about how large it is. Here, the situation is different because you really have to compensate the interaction strength between neighboring atoms with the laser. Okay, so now you immediately see that this kind of brings this order into the game. Each of these external wave functions of our trapped atoms has a finite width, and which you can. And which you can motivate the Gaussian distribution, so this is nothing unusual. But the parameter that actually is important for our physics here is the distance between two atoms, because this is how this disorder enters in our Hamiltonian, since the interaction between two neighboring atoms is a function of their precise distance. And you see, as soon as you have disorder in the position, you have disorder in the distance. In the position, you have disorder in the distance, and this directly translates into disorder in the interactions. You can now characterize this disorder. This is not too important. I mean, this is kind of they are identically distributed, these distances, but not independent, because you have to fix the length of the chain to the number of atoms times the inter-atomic distance. But I mean, at the end of the data, it's relatively straightforward to characterize this. So now. So now the problem is in the experiment you cannot really switch this diso switch this disorder off. I told you that it is related to the fact that the atoms have a finite temperature and in principle you could argue well just lower the temperature, but they can't do this, obviously, arbitrarily well, so you are kind of stuck with what you've got, but still you want to find out whether disorders at the heart of this kind of excitation sticking to the initial side and not properly. Sticking to the initial side and not propagating through the lattice. How can you test this? And one way to test this is now not to look at a large chain, but just merely look at the smallest possible chain you can come up with, namely a chain that consists of two atoms. And for two atoms, we can write down kind of the Hilbert space configurations. You see, you have a down, down, up, up, and then up, down, and down, up. And now we just do the experiment that relates to this propagation from. Relates to this propagation of the excitation from the left to the right-hand side of our chain in two different ways. So, one way is to use this chain of states. So, from here, we are here to there. This is basically corresponding to the fact that the disorders, to the situation that the disorder is off, because disorder is only present when two atoms really interact. This is not happening here. And you can also make this excitation on the left propagate to the right by going through this state here. So it's a very simple situation. So, it's a very simple situation that you can now dial in your experiment by just tuning the laser appropriately. So, these arrows here, you see the length of those arrows correspond to the frequency of the laser, and you see the laser is now chosen such that those transitions here are resonant, but those are not. And now, once you do this, you find modulo some preparation errors that you get relatively nice oscillations between those two states with some contrast. That is With some contrast that is not zero. So now you do the experiment the other way, where you now really use this facilitation constraint via this doubly excited state. So you switch this channel off here and you go from that state where the atom excitation is to the left, via this doubly excited state, to this state where the excitation sits on the right. And of course, this is now prone to disorder, this transition, because we run through this doubly excited state where the atoms attack. And you see very nicely that you actually lose the contrast. So at least That you actually lose the contrast. So, at least in this kind of baby version of this facilitated chain, you see that this order matters. And now, of course, you can do all sorts of analysis. You can now try to understand should these, what's going on. And the obvious analogy is that of Anderson model, basically, which is a tight binding model with disorder. But here the disorder. Here, the disorder comes in a way that is not present on every side, but it's actually present only on every other side, because it really can only occur when two atoms are simultaneously excited to the root work state. So, this order is present only on every other side. You can write down the Hamiltonian of this tight binding model. You can analyze the localization length, and then you find that, in fact, all states are localized, but one, and this is just a state where you have support of your wave function. Where you have support of your wave function only on every odd side. But okay, since all but one state are localized and your initial state has overlap, which is one over L, goes as one over L. With this delocalized state, you would expect now that your initial state that is prepared such that your atom in the left of the chain is pointing up has overlapped with only localized states. With only localized states, so you would expect this excitation to be stuck. This indeed you can now simulate in the experiment, in the theory, sorry, and you find the theory with this order gives you really a nice reproduction with the experiment. So this is very nice, and for us it was kind of encouraging to see that this works. And just for you, maybe to see what the time scales really are. So we are really talking about very fast dynamics here. So this one, when you talk about ultra-goid atomic systems, that is. Atomic systems that is on the order of microseconds. So, this is all very simple. So, it's because it's single-body physics. But at least what was nice is that we, by this, could establish a connection to the experiment. In reality, it's a bit more complicated because the Hilbert space structure is actually a bit more involved in the chain. It's a two-dimensional lattice in practice for the parameters that they used in the experimental physics. That they used in the experimental physics is very similar to what I just discussed. So now, what I want to do is I want to go beyond this few excitation physics. And this is where this constraint comes in. So far, we have restricted ourselves essentially to a few excitation sector. There was a one-body dynamics going on in this one-dimensional lattice. That was modeled by a type binding model. But now what you can do is you can actually write down a many-body Hamiltonian. Write down a many-body Hamiltonian that takes care of this facilitation constraint. And this really looks like a familiar constraint in anybody Hamiltonia. If you have a spin-flip term, and you have a projector basically that tells you whether you can flip the spin or not. And of course, this projector now acts on the neighborhood of this spin you want to flip. And for this facilitation constraint, this projector looks like this. So it basically allows you to flip only Allows you to flip only if at least one of the neighbors, oh, no, if only one of the neighbors to the left and to the right of the straight atom is pointing up. And then you get some disorder potential, which is just a residual interaction between neighboring atoms, which you aren't able to cancel with a laser because there is this fluctuation in interaction strength. And now you can ask, okay, what can you do with this, right? What can you do with this, right? And then, first question is: can one bring this into a more familiar shape? And indeed, one can do this. So, one can, and we have seen this also on several occasions today, one can go into some domain world picture. And then this constraint Hamiltonian just becomes this Hopping Hamiltonian. And you can now ask what is happening to my disorder potential. This is, of course, becoming entirely ugly, right? I mean, this was a two-side density-density interaction. You now do this. You now do this non-local transformation with you. All these strings are popping up, and you get something completely horrific. And now you can ask: so, what's the effect of this disorder potential? And this is the point where, well, if you don't know what to do, you just do some numerics. And I just show you, we have undertaken all sorts of analysis here, but I want to cut the short by showing you one very simple method. One very simple measure basically that allows you to determine what the impact of this disorder, this funny-looking disorder potential, is. So, you take an initial state that is just a staggered configuration in this domain-world picture. So, you have as many particles, basically, in the system that you can have, so that you have the large that you are occupying the largest section of the Hilbert space that is available to you. That is available to you. And so, this is a many excitation state, unlike before, where we just looked at a single excitation localized to the left of the chain. And now, what you do is you quantify this loss of memory, and this is also motivated basically by experiments, of this initial state by looking at the imbalance. You basically ask how are these sub-lattices occupied as a function of time. And then you find at the beginning, this staggered state has a maximal imbalance. State has a maximal imbalance, but then if you wait for sufficiently long time, you find that it approaches a state which, depending on the disorder strength, is still this kind of staggered state. So you are localized, you get stuck. This is this situation for large disorder. Or when you lower this disorder strength, you imbalance goes to zero, and also these kind of deviations from Kind of deviations from zero, one can understand those are actually finite size effects. So we have done a lot of more analysis here, like looking at the energy level statistics, looking at the growth of the entanglement entropy, and all hints towards there being some kind of many-body localized crossover, let's say, for those system sizes that is present in the system. And of course, I mean, it would be nice if experiments would probe that. Would probe that, which is definitely within reach with this technology because these experiments that I showed you before, those were conducted in 2017 and by now everything has evolved considerably. Okay, time-wise, how are we doing? So, five minutes? Seven minutes. Perfect. So, I won't need that much, I think. So, okay, now let's stop. Let's stop and think a little bit about what we have done. We were looking at the situation so far where we had these atoms in the individual traps, in the tweezer traps. And we were dealing with a, let's say, high temperature phonon state in the sense that we could really approximate these positions here of the atoms with a classical distribution. So it's a high temperature state. Now, what if we have a low temperature state? Of course, we still have a distribution of. We still have a distribution of our atomic positions, but this is no longer a superposition of an incoherent sum, let's say, of many states, a density matrix. This is something that is very close to a pure state. And instead of this thermal broadening here that we observe in this high temperature situation, we have a broadening that is basically quantum nerves due to this quantum pressure or the zero point energy. So now, this is a completely different picture. And in fact, what you can show. Picture and in fact, what you can show, I don't want to talk about this here, just published this: you can integrate out in this domain the phonons, and you get some interesting interactions that are not binary for this situation. So how do we describe this problem? Well, we just say, okay, we have those phonons that describe the vibrational excitations within the strap. And again, I have this atom-laser interaction that I told you. I have this atom-laser interaction that I talked about before, where omega is the rubber frequency, delta is the detuning. So this has not changed with respect to the previous discussion, but what now enters the game is this phonon degree of freedom. So now we no longer kind of roll the dice in order to find out where's my atomic position, but we really take this external position of our atoms as a kind of quantized degree of freedom and look what happens there. And now just to draw. What happens there. And now, just to draw a picture, because you see already without many equations, what's going to happen. So now, look at a situation where we have an atom in the position x1 in the trap and the atom in the position x2 in the trap. So now here we have the energy, the internal energy or electronic energy, and you find now that for the situation where both atoms sit in the electronic ground state, they are happily also in the ground state of our. Happily, also in the ground state of our harmonic oscillator. Same is the case when one of the atoms is excited to the Rudbach state. But something interesting happens when both atoms are simultaneously excited to the Rydberg state, because then we really get a coupling between this electronic degrees of freedom and the phonons. And this is due to the fact that basically these atoms also experience a mechanical force and repel each other, or attract each other depending on the sign of this coupling constant. So, and now, in order to understand what's happening here, what you can do is now: well, you just expand the interaction potential, you somehow assume that this displacement that you cause is small compared to the intertrest spacing, and you end up with a Hamiltonian that looks like this. This is just the spin-spin interaction that we considered before, and this is the zeroth order. So, you have an interaction energy shift when both atoms are excited simultaneously. But then you see here in the next order, and this. And this very much reminds me of, reminded me of when you gave the talk, it reminded me very much of this. In the next order, you get a coupling between the electronic degrees of freedom and now the vibration in motion. This is now the question, what does this do for us? Because it now obviously competes also with this facilitation dynamics that is going on in our lattice. So what happens is now that Is that our tight binding chain here in Hilbert space? So, this is again this very simplified model that I talked about before, becomes dressed by the photons in a way that you see every other side here, namely the side which corresponds to a configuration where two atoms are excited, is coupling to a local phonon degree of freedom. So it looks like this. Yeah, phonon coupling here, phonon coupling here, and those are independent. Independent phonons. So, this whole tight binding model now really becomes a many-body problem, right? Because you have a degree of freedom living on this lattice coupled to a whole set of harmonic oscillators. And now you see, what one can do in order to make some progress here is one kind of has to order and bring some systematics into this game and define some kind of two-side unit cell that encompasses these two configurations with one excitation, two excitations. With one excitation, two excitations, and a harmonic oscillator. So then you can. So this is one of the few equations I'm showing you. So just that you believe that there's actually some math going on here. So you, okay, I'm done. So you can write down what the Hamiltonian is that describes this dynamics here. You can massage it in a way that actually you still get the quasi-momentum as a good quantum number at the expense of making At the expense of making this extremely ugly, you see here, this is a spin degree of freedom that just distinguishes between those two cells, sides here and the unit cell. And you have these harmonic oscillators, A, and then you have a quantum number that kind of relates to the quasi-momentum here in this letter. So you can now study what the band structure is of this problem. It's a function of this coupling constant. You find, of course, when the coupling constant is zero, you get the usual result from the tight. Result from the tight binding model. And you see here now these two bands emerge due to the fact that I have a two-side unit cell, but I have this structure also repeated here because I have also these harmonic oscillator degrees of freedom attached to the letters. So now if I turn the coupling on, my bands split, and here we have a fairly good understanding of how that happens. And what of course would be interesting now, and this is work in progress, is to really study this. Is to really study this interplay between this facilitated dynamics here, so this is the spin degree of freedom, and its coupling to the phononic excitation. So there's no interactions in this case for the spins and the phonons, but now you see, if you turn the interactions on, you dress these facilitated spins. You see also that the particle velocity or the quasi-particle velocity is changing up to a point where you really localize also this. Localize also this initial spin excitation here due to the strong coupling to the FOMOs. Again, this is work in progress. What we would like to understand, of course, ultimately is this transition from this coherent limit to the limit in which we have to or are allowed to model the whole situation by this disorder that I talked about in the first part of this presentation. All right, so my time is up. Here's a summary. This is not the only stuff we are. Summary: This is not the only stuff we are doing. So, lots of interesting things I hope that are going on. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to present the work. I'm glad that I managed to get through. So, sorry, it was a bit rushed, but I'm happy that we managed to cover everything. Thank you very much. So, you're having a coffee in what's the age of it. It wasn't the PXP model, but it was not the PXP model, no. It missed some operators in the projector. Exactly. So, I mean, you see the projector? Yes, absolutely. Yeah. So could you comment on the difference? Yeah, well, the PXP model, I mean, first of all, what you do with this constraint, you introduce also a conserved quantity here. So the number of domain volts is conserved, which is not the case in the PXP model. Case in the PXP model. And you see in the PXP, you have really, this projector is now just a product of two projectors which probe whether your left or your right side are excited. So I don't know what else to say, other than okay, it introduces a conserved quantity and allows this direct mapping on tool. Isn't this the ACLC? So this is ZXE model. Is the ACL it's a stable? It's a it's a stable the second um right the second part is a stabilizer code, ZXZ, and then you have a in a magnetic field. Yes. Okay, so this model actually has probably has edge space in my class. You say just this model here, I mean I would say I would say if I just take the second term times the sigma x, this is the CXE model and this is the AKLT payment. And does the AKLT pay up? But the AKLT, I mean, should should live, that's for spin-1 particles, right? The AKLT in the same universal. Okay. And then you have AKLTNA. But okay, what I don't understand now with this is... Okay, there's this exact mapping onto it. But I would say that your model is basically topological was that great. So you just see state, I think. Isn't this effective Hamiltonian at like a critical point? Because it has equal strength of like X field and a ZXE? That's right. So that yeah. That's what I don't know. I mean certainly the ZXE is just the same as the AKLT, you're saying that because you have the sigma X answer to critical value. Yeah, okay. Well, but that one. But then maybe there's a similar question in the elevation, if you think of the sigma. The perturbation, if you think of the symmetry of this SDT, like flipping every second spin, the perturbation probably breaks that symmetry, right? This perturbation here. Well, I would say yes, yeah, but again, I mean, we have, this is why I'm happy about your questions. I mean, we have certainly never analyzed this from this perspective, right? I mean, that would be interesting to maybe have a chat and see whether I can. Whether I can learn a thing or two from this viewpoint. I think this critical point, actually, the critical line, you could add like a marginal perturbation that will take your one-sublique, and it's like the compactified boson. So maybe being near that can help you understand something at that time. All right, yeah, that would be fantastic. Thanks. Alright, is there still a question?
