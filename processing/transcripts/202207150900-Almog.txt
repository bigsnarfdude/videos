Great work and thank you very much for organizing it and for extending to me the invitation to speak. I'm going to present joint work with John Artfeld and we discuss the stability of symmetric flow in a two-dimensional terminal or China. The most uh relevant example Probably an example that we can think about is the Poison flow. So, in many instances, I speak about Poison Flow and that's it, but everything that we do here can be generalized to any flow with certain characteristics that I'm going to discuss today. So, first, I'll start with the formulation of the formula, which obviously Problem, which obviously starts from the Navier-Stokes equation. Here we see V is the velocity, it's two-dimensional plector, P is the pressure, and B is the body force, which is directed parallel to the boundaries of the channel, if it seems so. Boundaries of the channel into things or in the longitudinal direction. The domain SF is a tunnel channel. It's infinite in the x1 direction, in both directions, the negative positive. And in the lateral direction, it's simply the inverse negative 1, 1. Epsilon to the negative 1 is... The negative one is when on the record standard, and we are applying here a no-sleep condition, meaning that we must lunge on the power. V belongs to a space of, first of all, divergence-free vector because we are discussing incompressible flows and Forms and also it is periodic. The period is given by L. And L can be very large, but it must be still be much smaller than the Reynolds number or signing to the negative number. The pressure is again periodic. Up to a point periodic, we don't prescribe periodic conditions for the pressure, but we do need it for But we do need it for its gradient. So we can add to that something linear, maybe a linear function. But that's not the point here discussing anyhow periodic boundary conditions. So after describing the spaces, let me Let me present the laminar flow. The lemoner flow is stability we are studying. So a laminar flow is a velocity field directed along the longitudinal axis and in parallel to the boundaries at negative one and one, but it depends only on the lateral coordinates. The lateral coordinates. That's the definition of laminar flow. If I take a constant pressure gradient, I call it A, then the equation that the laminar flow should satisfy is u double prime equal A plus B of X2 only. It's B of X, if you like, because everything depends on X2 only. P is also given as a Is also given as a linear function, it's a mark of interest. So we shall confine ourselves to symmetric flows. Symmetric flows mean that u is an even function of x2 of the lateral coordinate. And then it will allow us to restrict. To restrict the problem to the interval 0, 1. And then we have to prescribe the order that the first and the third, since we deal with a fourth-order operator. So we need the first and the third derivative to manage at the middle of the panel or on the symmetry axis. I'll say maybe one more value of course okay well I'll say it later on. So the most popular example of such stimulant flow will be obtained if I take a equal 1 and b equals 0 and then I get the u equal 1 minus x to square over 2. x2 square over 2, you see that u vanishes on the boundaries of the channel, and of course that it is symmetric, the flow. Now let's linearize the non-linear stocks operator near the laminar floor and present it now the Faucher derivative with respect to the V or you here. U here and here is the perturbation, and we get this, of course, non-self-adjoint operator. And if I want to write the spectral problem, then I need to add also the expression derivative with respect to p. So this is expressed in this term: the greater. In this term, the gradient of Q. And that's the spectral problem. I mean, it's halfway the spectrum problem. Today, I think last time I gave more detail about how to pond the spectral problem. Now, I'm going to rush to the technicalities, to the main issues. So, if we take if we define a string function, A string function so that u is the orthogonal gradient of the string function c, then we guarantee that the divergence of u must vanish, which is good. And moreover, if I take the curve of this equation, the last equation here in this slide, if I take the curl of both sides, I'm going to. I'm going to get something like that. Not both sides of the left hand side. I'm going to have this operating. One more thing. Since we discussed a pre-hobic solution, I can look at the Fourier coefficient. Now I write it with an alpha m. I mean you have to do all the harmonics. all the harmonics. But since alpha M is, I mean, if M is large especially, then it always by very small jumps, we will look at alpha as a continuous parameter, the Fourier parameter. So if I apply this Fourier coefficient, I apply this integral to the above To the above balance, I get the all-summer operator, which is denoted here by B, lambda, alpha, and beta. It depends on we mean parameter. And you see that it has two parts. There is this part in the parentheses, which is which is a Schrodinger, a non-central joint Schrodinger operator, which acts on not on phi, but this is just Laplace M of phi after applying to it the Fourier transform or the completing the Fourier coefficient. And there is this additional term that gives help to Help to anyone studying these problems. In the case of Coetro, Couetro is linear flow, u equals x, coet flow. This term would fall, and the analysis is significantly simpler. Here, there are no discounts, you have u double prime always on your side. And I have defined here two new parameters, beta. New parameters, beta, which is alpha times the Reynolds number. This is really what you need to be large to perform any asymptotic work. It's not enough that the Reynolds is large because the Reynolds is associated with, is multiplies a gradient in the longitudinal direction along the direction along the parallel to the boundaries of the channel and therefore we have to multiply it by alpha and this parameter should be large in order to be able to perform any asymptotic analysis. There is also this lambda I mean it's just for convenience instead of carrying this we carry something This, we carry something much stiff. So that's the orzon of the operator, and we have to define its domain. So we use the restriction, once again restriction to 0, 1, and we look at even modes. Now this is the comment that I wanted to make too early. Even modes are not the only thing you should study here. You could study also all molds. But the main challenge is the even modes that... Challenge is the even modes. I think the old modes, well, I haven't done that, but I suspect it will be much easier to obtain for it the inverse estimate for the orthogonal field operator. So my domain is function in H4 with the first and third derivative panels along the axis of symmetry. And on the boundary, both U and its derivative must vanish. This is the no sleep condition. So one U is, I'm not going to put my fire here as far as I remember is the longitudinal direction and you prime with the lateral. the lateral, the evolution vanish on the lateral component, the evolution vanish on the boundary of the child. So a quick literature summary, I mean I should have done much better than that, but even the half an hour I have, that's the best I think I can do. The Aurorazona Feldov orator naturally was first obtained. Was first obtained by Orange Zonofeld, who was British, was a British physicist, Zonofeld, German. They published it independently, I think. And the name was his name after all. There is a huge amount of studies on the also by physicists and engineers. So I'm giving here a few. Here a few references. The one I use most is by Grace. This is the second. I think the early edition, the first edition is from the 80s or something like that. There is a book by Akiva Yablo from 2012 and another by Joseph. Um all these capture pretty much uh everything I'm gonna tell you about uh I'm going to tell you about the formal analysis and the numerical results that were obtained for the stability of the Poisson flow mostly. So for Poissy flow, if I said that, it was OSDAC in 1971 that by using a spectrum method that performing the numerical computation, was able to find a stability. Find stability loss at the Reynolds number 5772. Now, one side comment I must make. In reality, the positive flow loses its stability at Reynolds numbers that are in the hundreds. But since you are not, I don't have I don't have an aspiration to describe this probably non-linear physical phenomena, but to do some spectral work on the linear operator, this is for me what counts. So that's the Reynolds number where it loses its stability. It was obtained by engineers and physicists before OSAC. They knew. They didn't get 5, 7, 7, 2, I think they got something like 5400 or some such. That was done using formal asymptotic to me. It's a mystery that they were able to obtain it even to such degree of accuracy. That is something that one has to look into in the future. The diabetes of one One result of rigorous mathematical result that was obtained by Greenier, Gouro and Louien in 2016. I shall describe it in more detail in the next transparency. So just to summarize, these are the asymptotic formula. It's for the paper by It's from the paper by Luid in 1965. What you see here is half the square they put on the vertical axis and reference to the third on the horizontal axis. And here, outside this loop, the positive flow is stable, but here inside this loop, it loses its stability. It's probability. What is mostly interesting for me is these two straight lines that you see, it's because it's on the log scale. Here I get that I get to say that this is not true, it doesn't come to zero. I mean it it it it comes to zero at infinity I think but But these two branches were obtained analytically by formal asymptotic. And this is the focus of the present work of Leon Blau Renier. I can only speculate why it's much easier. I mean, this is what I call the difficult. This is what I encounter, the difficulty I encounter. If you don't look at small alpha, but some intermediate value, then as Reynolds goes to infinity, the Poison flow will always be stable, as you can see here by just following, walking on the horizontal line. Eventually, you would reach the point where the flow is stable. This is what we get. The flow is stable. This is what we get, by the way, in our results. So I haven't asynced how they were able to obtain the using asymptotic analysis. But I know their computation, but I can't... For me, it's still a mystery. How comes that they managed to obtain this nice curve, which is very close to the Very close to the numerical computation. These, however, are asymptotic. This is an asymptotic case because both if I let alpha go to zero on both curves, then eventually the branch would go to infinity too. So you would have a region of instability. As far as you want for large animals. I mean, always, if you go beyond this curve, you will gain stability once again. But this is an asymptotic case because here you have an infinitely large domain that you could consider using asymptotic analysis. So, what is the result of Guenier-Buen? again. Suppose that I call the right half of the complex plane by C plus and then the result is that if alpha varies between some constant times beta to the negative one over six and some constant times beta to the negative one over ten, there will be There will be a positive, I mean, an eigenvalue of the positive part of, let's say, of the complex plane, meaning that the kernel would be non-triggered. That's the result. They even go as far as getting the CF and the CR that were obtained here using asymptotic formal asymptotic results. They managed. They manage. It's actually very much. Maybe I don't. It's not, it's much more complicated than the formal analysis, but it goes along the line that were approved by Tomi and the Written others. What haven't they done? They haven't shown that if you are here Here, then the flow is stable, or if you are here, then the flow is stable. This is what we are going to do, I'm going to show you today, so that we describe the mean which is. I forgot to say they also found the order of magnitude of the eigenvalue value of the win part of the eigenvalue. So let me formulate the Communicate that. If I take some positive delta and μ, which satisfy all the good things we've seen before, it must vanish on the boundary at 1 because of the no-slip boundary condition. At the axis of symmetry, the first and the third derivative should vanish in view of the restriction to 0, 1. The restriction to 0, 1. And we demand something more. We would like it to be a strictly concave function. And maybe I should have written the 0, but I will not do that with one, forgive me for the typo. But this condition is essential, but it is, once again, it is respected by the Poisson law, where the Poisson flow, where the second derivative is negative one, if I remember correctly. So this one is sufficiently broad to include the what's the influence. So in such a case, there exists three positive constants, we call them alpha mc and epsilon, and some And some better not. Better not should be sufficiently large, so we can speak about sufficiently large betas. I put some better not sufficiently large, and then everything holds when beta is beyond that. And in this case, we have two results. The first is if we look at the case when alpha is between zero and some constant alpha better than negative. L time better to the negative C. And the V lambda is less than better to the negative R times this constant. In this case, we are going to obtain an estimate on the resolve. It is founded by a model by C over beta to the half. So, certainly for this value of alpha, the flow is stable. This is is stable, these three coefficients. Please pay attention that the alpha L is not the C L. We haven't been that accurate here. We were unable to recover the precise value from the asymptotic expansion to the nose. One has to go into the regime when other values of all the data to the network will see one of the six and See all of the six and do a particular expansion there, which we haven't done yet. The second result is when alpha is greater or equal than beta to the negative one about the this is if I remember the result of René Hood and Buille found that the upper bound for alpha is some constant. For alpha is some constant, but I'm beta to the negative one over there. So, here, except that we needed this delta, delta can be arbitrarily small, but we didn't get to the negative one of the temp aspects that once again, if we consider alpha of the right value and number of fields, we will be able to cover that. So that is the result. I'll make this time. Five minutes. Okay. I'm sorry, it's 35 plus five for discussion. So if you can summarize, then please do it. You would like to close here. Okay, I was planning to show some of the methods from the push, but uh I knew it's ambitious that I did I knew it was ambitious, but I didn't know that I'm gonna stop with shorts, but that's short. Okay, so thank you for your attention. Thank you. Are there any questions, comments? But what if I don't have that condition on the second derivative that we call it? This one? Yes. If you don't have that? Yes. I can't say, I mean, this makes your life very much easier, but I do know that there are people that working on the o radio operator that have extended the radius stability parliament to To velocity field did not satisfy that. I don't know if we can stability theorem is, I mean, the stability of oil flows, some results like really for the late 19th century. But I don't know what to recover from that, but I can actually use the idea. I can actually use their ideas and or paint something similar here. I haven't looked into that before. Any fellow? Yes, please? Just a comment. I was to say that at the moment the proof is 200 pages. And so well to relax. Okay. Any questions from online participants? Participants if there are any questions from online participants I can't. There's something wrong with the sound, we know. No problem, everything fine. So, in that case, let's thank Annette again. And we wish you that this nothing, Jenny, that it that you're fine health-wise.
