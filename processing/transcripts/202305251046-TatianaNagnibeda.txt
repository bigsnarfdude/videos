But it's been very rewarding. The book was very interesting mathematically and we are so well looked after here, so it was really a pleasure. Thank you very much. The only disappointment is that I still haven't seen a bear. It's my third time I've hung. That's a disappointment. Each time I hope, and this time it doesn't work, so yes, maybe I'll have to go to the bath or just have another time. Well, anyway. Well, anyway, so I cut my introductions already a lot because we have heard already a lot about share graphs and self-similar groups and even spectra. And I go back to Saba's talk for the setup a little bit about spectrograph theory. So we will work with a graph, which in my case will be typically. Which in my case will be typically infinite, but often approximated by finite graphs. And we will be interested in the spectrum of the Markov operator. So this is just a normalized adjacency matrix, and it is closer related to the Laplacian. So the examples that are interesting for me at least, are telegraphs of it-related groups, then shire graphs with respect to some natural group actions. Group actions, like for example, the action on the levels of a rooted tree, like what we've seen here, or on the boundary of such a tree. But there are also other examples. And also, there are lattices, like, for example, I don't know, lattices, crystal lattices, or lattices coming interesting for people in statistical physics, and so on. There are also self-similar graphs that are not necessarily associated with a self-similar group. So, there are many classes. In the group. So there are many classes of examples where people are interested in the spectrum of the Markov operator or of the Laplacian on such graphs. And we will always think about our operators acting on the Hilbert space, which is L2, and all the graphs will be countable and of boundary degree. So it will be a nice space. So, in case our graph comes from a group and edges can be labeled by the generators, so there is a generating set, five-generating set, which we suppose symmetric typically, which is fixed. Then we can write our operator as an element of the group algebra, like that. And then you can consider it in different representations. So, the most difficult case, the most classical case is. The most classical case is the left regular representation. That's when the operator will act, as I said before, the L2 of the vertices of the Kelly graph or L2 of G. But also quasi-regular representations, as what Svaha also mentioned in his first lecture. So in this case, the space on which the operator will act will be L2 of the set of posets, G by H. So quasar. So, a quasi-regular representation corresponds to the choice of a subgroup. And in this case, we can think about M as acting on the Kelly graph of the group. And in this case, exactly, it will be this Markov operator or the Scheyer graph with respect to the subgroup H. Also, this maybe hasn't been pointed out, if you just have a natural action of a group on a set which is transitive, then you can just draw a graph. Then you can just draw a graph by taking the orbit, the set, as vertices and putting edges with respect to the action of generators. And this exactly will be a Shire graph with respect, sorry, the Shire graph in this sense with respect to the stabilizer of a vertex in this set. So you can think about Shire graphs as just being associated to actions, predictive actions, or orbits of an action, not necessarily think about a subgroup to start with. Submit to start with. Okay, so here I just wrote the formula for this operator, how it acts on functions. And obviously, the operator is self-adjoint, bounded. Actually, it's a stochastic matrix. So the spectrum is a compact subset of the interval minus one, one. Internal minus one, one. I would like in my talk to address two different families of questions. And the first one is the very classical in spectral theory. Can one hear the shape of the drum, as was put by Mark Katz in the 1960s? And in our case, can one hear the shape of a graph? Kelly graph, a Schreier graph. Kelly graph, a Schreier graph, or something. So actually, there was a paper published by Lang Vallette which was called Kem 1 here: the shape of a group. Now, this is not a very good formulation because there are actually non-isomorphic groups with isomorphic kilographs, so it immediately is clear that you have to be more specific. So, okay, about Kellygraph. And here the answer is no. By an example that was also given by Slava. So he Even by Slava. So he gave an exercise, I think, for PhD students to compute the spectrum of the Markov operator on Z. So I suggest to do it for Z D, for any D, and to make sure that the spectrum will always be minus 1, 1. And in fact, it is true in much wider generality for any bipartite Kelly graph of a torsion-free amineable group. And I suggest I would like to. And I suggest to uh I would like to give you a proof of that, which is different from Slava's proof without using Fourier. Um so this is the proof. It consists of three parts. One is just a remark, the other is a theorem, and the third is a conjecture, but also a theorem partly. So the remark is that the spectrum is uh the spectrum of the Mark property is symmetric if and only if the graph is bipartite. If the graph is bipartite. So all cycles are of even length. So the second is one of my favorite theorems. It is the subject of Harry Kessen's speech dissis. A criterion of amenability. It says that a group is amenable if and only if one belongs to the spectrum of the mark of rate on some or equivalent to any of the scale graphs. So the spectrum is very sensitive. Even the spectral radius, the Spectral radius, the upper bound of the spectrum, changes if you change the generating set, but it's being equal to one and being different from one is an invariant, and it is equivalent to a meanability. This is what Kessel's theorem says. And okay, so we have one and minus one by these two points. And now the third point is that the spectrum is connected. And this is the consequence of the absence of non-trivial find importance in the steel. Find importance in the stistar-reduced algebra of the group, which is in general subject of Kadison-Kaplastic conjecture for torsion-free groups. And it is true for Zd, it's not difficult, and in particular, it has been proven for aminable groups. Okay, so this is just a small you have to give a proof, right? So I give a proof. Right, so I get a proof. So now I go back to the discussion of this game here: the shape of something question. Okay, so what can we do? Of course, here we had lots of conditions, right? So we can talk about non-amenable groups, we can talk about groups that have torsion and ask the same question. So there is no result, and you can also reform. You can also reformulate the question by asking: find other examples of isospectral families of telegraphs. But there is also a second part to it. The spectrum is not the end of the story. There is also an important ingredient, which is the spectral measure. So it is basically a projection value spectral measure which lives on the spectrum of M. But typically, when you talk about graphs, you think about the Graphs: You think about the associated scalar measures, which are called often guest and spectral measures, so which are obtained from the projection-valued measure in this way. And here, delta V is just the delta function on the vertex V of the graph. So, these functions constitute the basis in L2, the vertex of the graph. And these measures have a particular interesting. Have a particular interesting geometric meaning in the sense that the nth moments are exactly the probability of return after n steps for the render walk to the vertex B if you started the walk in the vertex B. So these measures are interesting and closely related to the geometry of the graph. So there is a apparently a classical theorem that I recently Theorem that I recently learned from Pierre de la Harp is that probably known to people here, but was not known to me, is that actually the operator is determined after unitary equivalence by three ingredients, the spectrum, the spectral measure, and the multiplicity function. But from the viewpoint of this question, this is still not the full answer. Well, first of all, these things are quite, actually, all three things are quite difficult to compute in general, but also. Compute in general, but also unitary equivalence, it's not very clear what unitary equivalence of Markov operators means to the graphs. So just as an example from finite world, there are so-called strongly regular graphs which are determined by four parameters, and there are examples of Klee graphs, which are two Kayleigh graphs of final groups, which are both strongly regular with the same parameters. With the same parameters, and this means that the spectra with multiplicities are the same, but the groups are non-isomorphic, they're different fine groups. So, even this kind of satisfactory answer to the question of what determines the spectrum doesn't really tell you a full answer on the question about what it means, what different groups and graphs can have the same spectral information. Spectral information. Okay, so now maybe some answers. And for that, I introduce a class of groups, which are not really self-similar groups, but self-similar families of groups. So it is a variation of construction by Lauren Bartolni and Zoran Sunik. I think the motivation was to construct a family. Was to construct a family that generalizes rewatch groups and new groups of intermediate growth. So, in the family that I describe here, some of them are of intermediate growth, but not all. So, these are groups that act as before on the deregular infinite-rooted tree. And by continuity, we will extend the action on the boundary of the tree. And so, it's important that we consider groups. And so it's important that we consider groups with different, which act on trees of different degrees. D equal to 2 and D bigger than 2 will give us a completely different families of groups with very different behavior. So they are generated by elements of two types. So the groups are given by their generators. There is always one generator A, which just adds. Generator A, which just acts cyclically on the first level of the tree, and then there are so-called spinal generators B, and these generators act on the nearest vicinity of the rightmost infinite ray in the tree. So, this should remind you of the definition that Slava gave of his first group. So, in his case, he had three generators here: B, C, and D. And the action was switch, switch, nothing, switch, switch, nothing, or switch, nothing, switch, switch. Or switch, nothing, switch, switch, nothing, switch, or nothing, switch, switch, nothing, switch, switch. The three generators of Liborship's group. So now you can imagine that the sequence of transformations that you put on this ray would be different. You don't really have to have these periodic sequences, right? You could take some different automorphisms and still look at what group they generate. So this is exactly what the spinal group construction is based on. Is based on. So you replace the periodic sequences that Rygorshev used in his group by arbitrary sequences. And so if you want to generalize a little bit, so you take not necessarily two, but any D branches of your tree, so you promote them cyclically. This is A. And then B is Z over DZ to the power L. dz to the power m and the alphabet in which you will pick your sequence will be just all the epimorphins from b to a and so for any such infinite sequence you will get a group with also a kind of preferred generating set of spinal generators you take all a's and all b's so maybe it's a little bit technical but here are examples so for d equal to 2 so for the groups acting on the infinite binary tree Acting on the infinite binary tree, we have Ribortia groups, so the whole uncountable family constructed by Slava for D equal to 2 and M equal to 2. Now you see for every value of D and every value of M, we have an uncountable family of groups because they are parametrized by those infinite sequences in a finite alphabet. So we have G omega for every omega like that, and this is for fixed M. For D. For fixed M. For D equal to 2 and M equal to 2, we recover the family of Dubai groups constructed in Slava's original papers in the 80s. For example, for D equal to 3 and M equal to 1, so M equal to 1 is when the two groups are equal, so there is just one constant sequence. This is the only possibility. So there is just one group, and this is also a well-known cell-similar group, Fabikovsky-Gupta group. And then there's And then there are many more, obviously. So, not all of them are self-similar. Actually, for example, here there are just two self-similar ones, the two that Slava mentioned in his talk, but then all together these groups constitute what is called a self-similar family of groups. Okay, and so here is the picture of shire graphs for rewards group acting on the binary tree. I believe maybe with haven't Slava. Slava tried to draw them on the board, but this is a nice picture. So, this is for the first level of the tree, second level of the tree, and this is the picture for the infinite graphs. And also, I wanted to explain how final graphs converge to infinite graphs. So, it's like that: that if you have an infinite sequence, a binary sequence, so a point Binary sequence, so a point of the boundary. Then you look at its beginnings. And then those finer grass rooted at the Rooted at the point psi 0, ψ n will converge to the infinity graph in the local convergence where you look at balls around the root and they stabilize. So this is the convergence. So finite share graphs converge to infinite share graphs, but in sense of rooted graphs. And you can look at the actual You can look at the action on the boundary, but you can also look at a more, maybe, a more natural so-called shire dynamical system. It's when you associate to every point of the boundary the corresponding shire graph. So you get a map from the boundary of the tree to the space of rooted graphs with this local convergence. And so this map will be continuous on all regular points of the Continuous on all regular points of the boundary for the action of G. And so you look at the image of those regular points, so you can describe it as the closure of the image with isolated point removes. And this is what we call the space of Shire graphs. It is a subset of the space of rooted graphs with this local convergence. And the group will act on it nicely. It will be minimal and uniquely robotic with respect to the image of the Image of the uniform Bernoulli measure of the boundary of the tree. And so you can show that the spectrum of the graphs, when the group is amenable, so for the case that we consider this is true, that the spectrum will not depend on this point size. So you can describe the spectrum of the internet Scheyer brush, even if there are uncountably many, the spectrum will be the same. But the spectral measure. But the special measure will in general depend on the basic weight. Okay, so here is the first result answering the question about finding isospectral families. So two different families were found by Slava and Arton Rutko and by Slava, myself and Vaislava, myself, and my former student right at Paris. So I'm talking about this construction. So if you take all spinal groups for D equal to 2, then the spectrum of the Schreier graph will be the union of two intervals. And it will not depend on omega, and it will not depend on omega. So we get an. It will not depend on omega, so we get an uncountable family with the same spectrum. And a very nice addition is that in this case, the spectrum of the KD graph actually coincides with the spectrum of the Schreier graph. This is quite surprising because the Schreier graph is just a line, essentially a braided line, and the Kelly graph, it's a Kelly graph of a group of intermediate rows, so it's very complicated. But still, it turns out that in this particular case, the spectrum. The spectrum is the same, and so we get a continuum of non-isomorphic, not even quasi-isometric groups which have isospectral telegraphs. It is also interesting, yes, so the spectrum in this case is absolutely continuous to the spectral of m on this union of two intervals, and the spectral measure can be computed. And you see, it also doesn't depend on omega, but it just depends on m. So, spectral measure is also the same for. Measure is also the same for uncomfortable menia. But this is for the shared graph. So the spectral measure on the Kelly graph, this we don't know. We can carry the spectrum, but not the spectral measure from the graph to the group. So the second type of questions that I would like to discuss is about what actually the spectrum can look like. So here we saw an example where the spectrum So here we saw an example where the spectrum is a union of two intervals. And this is already not so common because mostly the examples that have been computed, the spectrum is just an interval. And there have been some techniques produced to produce gaps in the spectrum. So you can get, for example, one or two intervals with maybe some isolated points. So there are different sources of examples. Sources of examples, pre-products of final groups by Gabriela Kuhn and Sauardian Kartridge, and also lamp lighters. There is a verb by Slava and Simanek used infinitely many as points. I think it's the only such example. But so here the spectral measure consequently is absolutely continuous with spectral evap on the interval, plus there are some weights on these isolated points. And the only known examples of KD graphs with pure point spectrum With pure point spectrum are the so-called distal leader graphs, which are Kele graphs of Laplitus with respect to a specific generating set. So, this was firstly shown by Gibraltuk and Druk. And then, several new proofs of this surprising result appeared. And in particular, there is a very, very nice proof by Franz Lehner with Markos Merheiser and Walt Van Duuss using percolation on the base group of the lamp lighter. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, this is not about isospectality anymore. This is just about the type of spectrum and the type of spectral measure that one can get. So, of course, generic case, it should be something, any compact subset of minus 1, 1, and maybe singular continuous measure. That should be from, as I was explained by physicists, this would be the generic case. But when you look at particular examples, But when you look at particular examples, it's very difficult to get something like that. So typically, you get an interval with an absolutely continuous measure. And so there is a whole industry of producing exotic examples. And the more your graph is homogeneous, the more symmetries it has, the more it is difficult to produce exotic examples. So the more difficulties arise in Kelly graphs. The more difficulties arise in Kelly graphs, then there is a little bit more freedom for shared graphs. But share graphs, as Lav explains, still carry a lot of information about group and still have symmetries. So it's interesting to understand to which extent the situation becomes rigid if you go to classes of graphs with some restrictions. Yeah, so here I pointed out some examples in the case of just regular graphs without any. Case of just regular graphs without any symmetry constraints. So Eisenman Schlenker produced an example with infinitely many intervals. Then Bartolik and Rygorchuk had a spectrum which is a counter set. Then Alex Tipraev and Malazumov had examples with counterset of rebet measure zero and extra points. And there are also now quite recently new examples of graphs with spectra that carry a non-trivial Spectra that carry a non-trivial singular continuous component for the spectral measure. So I would like to show you that sharing graphs of spinal groups produce new examples of such exotic behavior. So pure point spectrum and also spectrum with non-trivial singular continuous components. And then also I wanted in the end to show you an example of an infinite family of graphs where the spectrum is just three. The spectrum is just three eigenvalues, and one of them has infinite multiplicity. So, I have never seen such examples before. I don't know if there are other examples of this type. Okay, but I will first concentrate on the first part because here we have more results. So, here we have to go to spinal groups that act on a tree of higher degree than two, so tertiary or higher. And as I said, the easiest example is this Favikovsky. The easiest example is this Tavikovsky-Gupta group. So its triangle graph for finite levels look like that. And if you take the scaling limit of this graph, then you below this construction of the limit space, you get the Julia set of this function. But if you do not do the scaling limit, but just do the limit in local convergence, as I explained before, then you get to the graphs with respect to the action of the group on the boundary of the. Of the group on the boundary of the infinite tree, and they look like that. So I didn't have enough space here, but the number of triangles that are impiled grows. So these graphs don't have linear growth as in the case of Rigotshut group or groups acting on the binary tree, but they have growth between linear and quadratic. And so here are the results that we have. It's the subject of a paper with Slava and Of a paper with Slava and Adolf Peris that is published in IMRN. So the spectra of infinite Shri graphs look like that. So they have, well, these are just two numbers, and then there is this component which is the Julia set of a very nice polynomial, which only depends on the degree of the tree on which you act. And there is also the And there is also the discrete part, countable set of points, which are pre-images of zero by this polynomial. And you still have to take a pre-image by some auxiliary function here. So in terms of Bach stroke, this is the Reinormization map for these time alliance groups. And so this works for any omega. So, for all these continuum of groups with fixed D and fixed M, we get the spectrum with this map. And actually, it only depends very slightly on M, so basically it is the same solution for all spinal groups setting on the D area tree. So, this theorem is proved by Farmer. So, this theorem is proved by fine approximation. So, we consider the shire graphs on the levels of the tree, and we do essentially what Bach was explaining, computing the joint spectrum on these graphs here, and in the end, so computing this randomization polynomial, and the end arriving at the spectrum for the infinite graphs. So, now we also were able. Now we also were able to compute the spectral measures, and this is something new with respect to previous work. So, there is another result, a similar result obtained approximately the same time by Alice Deplet and his co-authors on the Basilica group. So, they have an analogous theorem, namely that for almost all psi point in the boundary, so as I told you, the spectral measure may depend on the boundary point, so different share raspberry. The boundary point, so different sharps may have different spectral measures. So, almost surely the spectral measure will be discrete, so completely concentrated on this part of the spectrum, this part. So, the Julia set doesn't play any role in this sense. This measure is zero. And moreover, all the eigenfunctions are localized, so they have finite support. Final support. And so we can compute the empirical spectral measure. So this is not for the empirical, this is just for the real thing, the real constant spectral measure. The empirical spectral measure can actually be equippedly computed. So this is how it looks for the Fabrikovsky-Gupta example. So now I would like to tell you about another theorem that we have. Is that also associated to these groups? These groups are other graphs which are not really strong graphs for the action on the boundary, but which are what Voludia calls graphs of germs. So they correspond actually to the singular points in the boundary of the tree for the action of the group. So anyway, so they belong to this closure of the shar grass with respect to the boundary points. Points and they are really in the closure and not in the image itself. So, for these graphs here, we are able also not only to find the pure point part, but also there is a non-trivial singular continuous component in the spectrum, or the spectrum measure. So, this is quite interesting. So, if this is the standard The standard infinity share graph of the Gupta-Fabikovsky group, then these extra graphs for which the spectral measure has singular continuous components can be constructed like that. You take three copies and you put a triangle in between. So if you go to higher degree trees, then you will have a similar construction, but here you will have something more complicated, but also very symmetric like a full graph on D vertices. Graph on D vertices, basically. So you put some extra symmetries this way. So to deal with these additional graphs, actually it is interesting because we adopted a different way to compute the spectrum. So far, mainly the spectrum was computed by finite approximations. So infinite share graphs were approximated by finite shared graphs. That's what is Graphs. That's what Bach explained in his talk as well. And here we proceed to generalization, but directly on infinite graphs. So here we follow the ideas of Jean-François Appiant and apparently he was inspired by a paper by Hibushi and Shirai who worked on the spectra of line and parallel graphs. But the methods do not apply directly to artistic. Do not apply directly to our case, so we had to define our own randomization map. So, what we do, you see, our graphs are parametrized by infinite words in alphabetical D letters. So, we compare the graph which corresponds to psi, sequence psi, with the graph which corresponds to the letter ψ with which is shifted. And it turns out that one graph can be seen like an in. That one graph can be seen like an inflation of the other graph. And so there is an operator which corresponds to this procedure that I just explained, which we call capital pi. And then we are able to find a polynomial, which is again a very nice quadratic polynomial, actually just a conjugation of the map capital F from a previous theorem. And so the spectrum of the Markov operator is now expressed. The Markov operator is now expressed in this way: that it is the Julia set of this phi plus all the equip images of the point T minus 2. So this is the same spectrum as before, it explained differently because in the randomization coming from final graphs, this was the natural map that appeared. But if you work with this randomization directly on the infinite limits, then this is what comes up. Comes up. So this is actually a nicer expression for the spectrum. So maybe this is a more natural approach to computing the spectrum. And moreover, this method also works for those special graphs gamma tilde which cannot be approximated by final graphs as in the previous case. And so for them we also get the same spectrum and moreover we are able then to analyze the spectral measure and find this singular continuous Signal a continuous component. Can I ask about this spectral measure? Is it related to an invariant measure on the Julia set for this mapping? But no, because all the measures cause ah, the singular continuous component. Yes, it should be. I actually haven't thought about that. Yes, but of course it should be because the discrete part is concentrated here and now we have the single continuous component that is concentrated here. Yes, yes. Yeah, yes, yes. Yeah, I don't have an immediate answer to that. Yes? Do you expect the Rena organization to process work with this type of operator construction always? No, already, so I didn't have enough place on my slides, but I wanted to put a remark here that actually there is a drawback of this approach. It doesn't work for all spinal groups. It only works. Work for all spinal groups, it only works for spinal groups with m equal to 1. So we are able to cover Gupta-Fabrikovsky, generalize Gupta-Fabrikovsky groups, and so on. But if M is bigger than 1, so we have new those layers of uncountable families of groups, for them we were not able to apply this approach because we were not able to find this conjugation of the initial analyzation map, so there were some technical difficulties. So there were some technical difficulties. But you have the normalization map. So theorem two applies to all groups, to all final groups. So here we have this randomization map which works for all of them, but for some reason this randomization on Ethereum data were not able to make it work for all of them. Okay, so this is the end of the part The end of the first part of my answer about how the spectrum and the spectral measure can look like. And now I would like just to go to something different and go back to this example by Slava and Andrei Zhuk of Kelly graphs of lamplighters with pure point spectrum. So they are so-called distal litter graphs. Distalider graphs. Here's a nice picture which was produced by Martinez Callier. So, distaliter graphs are horocyclic products of infinite trees. So, in this example, you take two three regular trees, you root them at infinity, exactly as in Mitro's talk half an hour ago, and then you put zero somewhere and you look at four cycles of one tree going up and one tree going down. And one tree going down, and you, the vertices of your new graph are pairs of vertices such that their core cycles is like minus one here and one here. So they are on the same level. And so these are the couples of vertices in the original trees that form one vertex in the new graph. And the graphs are connected by an edge if the three images in the two trees were connected in the trees. And so this is the Kelly graph. So this is the Kellogg graph of the lamp lighter on Z with two lamps, this particular graph. And the generating set is walk switch and walk switch walk. So this is one of the standard generators considered when you study, for example, random walks on lamp lighters. So now I would like to give you a definition which I Give you a definition, which I think is very natural for many things that have been discussed in this conference. It is a way to associate a limit to a sequence of final graphs. So this was introduced by Itai Binyamini and Odev Schram. They called it distributional limit, but now usually it's called Binemini-Schram limit. So the thing is that if you have finer graphs, you could take a local limit if you had a root. Local limit if you had a root, right? Because then you look at the poles around the root and you want them to stabilize. So you have this standard local convergence. Now if you don't have a preferred root, you don't really know how to associate a limit to a sequence of final graphs. So the idea was that you can choose a root uniformly at random and look at the weak limit of the corresponding measures on the space of rooted graphs. So the limit of a sequence of So the limit of a sequence of final graphs in Benamini Sham sense is not a graph, but it's a distribution on rooted graphs, a probability measure on the space G star of rooted graphs of boundary degree. And this is a very, very nice object. It's also called sometimes a unimodular random rooted graph because actually you can show that these probability measures will be unimodular, which means actually that they are invariant under changing of the root. That they're inherent under changing of the root. And then this equivalence relation. And so, in all the examples that appeared so far, in particular, Hans asked me to say that also in his talk this morning, this is the natural context in which you should look, you should think about the limits of these sequences of finite approximations. So, this can also be thought in the following sense. This infinite random router graph is sufficient. Random rooted graph is Sophically approximated by your sequence of finite graphs, and you can talk about, for example, dependence of the infinite thing on Sophic approximations and so on. So there are many interesting aspects that come up. And so in a paper with Slava and Paula Hileman, my other former student, we have noticed that actually this lidograph associated with the lamp lighter group is the Benjamini Shram Women. Is the Mini-Stram limit of a very well-known sequence of graphs which are called the Bruin graphs. And this is also another way to prove the result about the spectral measure on the distaliter graph because the spectra of the spinal graphs can be computed. It is a classical thing. They have been computed by some people in graph theory. So this is a picture of the This is a picture of the Bruin graph on two letters and of level three. And so, in general, the Bruin graphs describe overlappings of words of length n for a language on a finite alphabet. So, more generally, you can actually define what I call Rosie graphs. You take any language and you take for the vertices of the end graph. For the vertices of the nth graph, the words of length n, and you connect two vertices by an edge if these graphs, if these words that are represented by these vertices, overlap, like that. So W is the common middle of the words A, W and W, B. And the Brewing graphs are just raw Z graphs for the full sheet. So if you take all possible words, so here you have two eight vertices because Eight vertices because you have words of length three in two letters. So there are eight possible words. But in general, you can take some other subshift and also look at residraphs. And so, okay, my time is almost over. So, but I want to say that we have studied Benjamini Schum limit of residraphs for different subshifts. So, Le Mans studied them for subshifts of finite type and showed that the Benjamini Schum limit will always be concentrated. Limit will always be concentrated on graphs which are similar to distalitor graphs. And recently, with a group of people, we have studied the limits of such res graphs also for subshifts of sub-exponential complexity. And we showed actually that there it is very much in contrast with exponential complexity because the limit, if it exists, will always be just C. So you won't get anything interesting from um graph theoretical viewpoint. Graph theoretical point. This was previously also studied by my team's students, John, for the linear complexity. But if you go back to subshifts of finite type, so languages which are just determined by a finite set of forbidden words, then there is one very well-known example, which is the Kibanachi subshift. It is the language, let's say, just on the alphabet of two letters 0 and 1, and one forbidden subword 1, 1. So you can see they're all sequences. You consider all sequences that do not contain the subgroup 1, 1. And you can consider again the sequence of final graphs, which are residrafts for the subshift, so, like the Bruin graphs for the full shift. And you can ask what is their spectrum. So, for the Bruin graphs, the spectrum could be computed because each next graph is the line graph of the previous graph, and there is a whole there is there is actually a theorem about spectra of line graphs. A theorem about spectra of line graphs. But here it's not true anymore, and one has to work a little bit to find a spectrum which is very nice and related to Fibonacci. And it's very interesting because actually the only thing that changes when you go from one graph to the next in the sequence is the multiplicity of zero. And so the Benjamini-Schram limit of this sequence of graphs is not one graph, but it is appropriate distribution on root. Appropriate distribution on rooted graphs, a unimodular random rooted graph. And consequently, the integrated density of states on this limit is actually of this type. So there are two eigenvalues of multiplicity one and one eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity. So this is very much in contrast with the examples that I've mentioned before. And yeah, I think that it is an interesting starting point for the An interesting starting point for the study of ROSI graphs of other subshifts and also of the Olympics. Thank you for your attention. What do you mean by the integrated density of states? Because actually, what the only thing Because actually, what the only thing that, well, not the only thing, but what you can compute for sure is the integral of the spectral measures on the limits with respect to the Bijemini-Sham measure. So this is what I call integrated density of states. But one can consider directly the spectrum of the derivative with respect to the limit measure. Yes, maybe. So, but can one really formulate it in terms of the Can one really formulate it in terms of uh that uh spectrum of the global operator or it's not? I don't know, I don't know. But this is this is very fresh, more or less work in progress. So as usual, a naive question. If you have the continuous singular component, is there a conjecture for what that would mean about Conjecture for what that would mean about the group? Let's touch some group theory. No, it's more that these singular continuous components only arise when you have these extra symmetries. So when you just had, oh sorry, when you just had one piece, you had pure point spectrum, and then when you introduced more or less forcibly, well, we are lucky that it is a natural graph. We are lucky that it is an actual graph, it's not a strike graph of the same group. But still, it is something extra that you do with this graph so that you get extra symmetries and then you get the singular continuous component. So, I don't think this is anything about to do with graphs. However, group theoretically, this corresponds to having a singular point for the action of the group on the boundary of the tree. For example, in basilica, there are no singular points. There are no singular points. So all points are regular when you look at the action of basilica group on the boundary of the binary tree. And so I don't know if there are naturally some graphs associated to basilica without constructing them by hand that would present the same phenomenon. Yes? This uh having uh the uh continuous connector component is the property of the group or a group in general instead? Of the group or a group in the generating setting? Aha! So, you know, I have a whole actually second part, third part, fourth part of my talk about change in the generating set. So thank you for asking. So the spectral measure, and I don't know about the spectrum, but the spectral measure may depend a lot on the generating set. So from we have a whole Have a whole group of papers with Slava and also Daniel Lens and his former student Daniel Zell. And from our results there, it follows that Rigorshup's group will have a generating set, minimal generating set with three elements, such that the Schargraph will be purely singular continuous on it. And you remember the very first theorem said that for the standard generators, the measure is absolutely continuous with respect to. The measure is absolutely continuously. So yes, there is a there is a strong dependence on lunch break and I assume at the one o'clock.
