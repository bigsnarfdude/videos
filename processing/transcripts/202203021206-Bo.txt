So uh mostly talking about systems that undergo phase separation, of which most of us have direct experience every time we want to season our salad. So here I'm just showing mix or try to mix vinegar and oil. We have these coexisting phases in which you have droplets that have a high concentration of vinegar and then this remainder part that has a higher concentration of oil. This physical phenomenon that has been studied very much in detail has received a new wave of attention because The new wave of attention because, in biology, people realized that cells use systems, physics very similar to that of phase separation to form compartments that you see here in this green fluorescent dots that basically behave very similar to the way droplets do in emulsion. So you can see them fusing, they can even wet surfaces. So there's been a whole new wave of interest in this kind of problems coming from questions that have to do with biology. Questions that have to do with biology. And there's been a growing number of compartments inside the cell that have been proposed to form by phase separation. This has the advantage that they don't need a membrane to separate from the cytoplasm, but just by having phase separation, very similar to that of oil and vinegar, you have an up concentration of certain proteins and certain nucleic acids in certain regions of space. And this can serve a large number of functions. Large number of functions. For example, since this phase separation process is sensitive to temperature, it can be a quick way of responding to changes in temperature in the environment. Or the fact that it allows to localize certain components can be useful in activating or activating certain biological processes. And also, it's been proposed to play a role in buffering the fluctuations that are present inside the cell. And today, what I'd like to discuss is what happened. I'd like to discuss what happens to single molecules that build up these condensates. And one of the reasons for doing that is that one can now experimentally access the trajectory to the motion of these single molecules in living systems across these condensates. So here I will just show you a movie. And what you see here in white is just an individual cell. And what you see here in green are condensates. And what is tagged in red here are And what is tagged in red here are single proteins. So we will follow the motion of these single proteins around, and we will see that sometimes they enter or leave these condensates. Possible to study this system experimentally and to build or get experimental statistics of the motion of these single molecules. And if I take a very, very simple picture of this whole system and I just try to look at one-dimensional systems in which I have a dense and a dilute phase. In which I have a dense and a dilute phase, I will just see traces of these single molecules that undergo this stochastic motion. And here in the following, I will denote by dark gray the dense phase, so let's say inside the condensate, and by this lighter gray, the outside. And this is sort of the phase boundary separating the two. So what I would like to discuss with you is how one can derive the equations that these single molecules should follow across phase boundaries. And this is also motivated. And this is also motivated by the fact that in the biological community there's a very heated debate about which kind of these organelles or these condensates actually form by phase separation or other mechanism. And to support or contest these claims, they're using single molecule data. And the problem is that there's not really a theory that predicts exactly how this should happen. So this is what I would like to present you in the next minutes. So before doing that, I'd just like to But before doing that, I'd just like to sort of set up the notation and remind you about some basic facts about what we know about phase separating systems. And I will start by a very simple binary mixture, which is described by this free energy, which has one part that is just a free energy density and another part that penalizes the presence of gradients that are present around the boundary. And this free energy density will depend on the volume fraction of the component. Fraction of the component, and it will have one part that is representing the entropy of mixing, so the usual log terms, and then one term that represents the fact that this molecule are interacting with each other and have an interaction parameter chi that basically can tell us how likely it is that molecule of the same kind want to stay close together. So, there's a usual competition between entropy and energetic terms. And when we vary this parameter, we can Vary this parameter, we can have a system in which the free energy density is no longer convex and we have the demixing of our system. So to minimize free energy, it's favorable to actually split the systems into two different or more different regions, one with a higher concentration and one with a lower concentration. So this is just to summarize the usual knowledge. And if we want to study dynamics. And if we want to study dynamics of this system, one typical way to go about is to take an irreversible thermodynamic approach and start by saying that, okay, we have a continuity equation, and then we have fluxes that will be driven by gradients in the chemical potential mu, of course, weighted by a certain mobility. And the chemical potential will be nothing but variations of the free energy with respect to the particle numbers. If we do this for this kind of free energy, For this kind of free energy, we get an equation in which the flux is non-linear. And this gives rise to what is usually called under Canhelian equations, which are non-linear in the volume fraction phi and also contain a higher order derivative. So they are usually quite difficult objects to deal with also from the numerical viewpoint. So now, how do we deal or how do we try to approach the problem of any? Deal or how do we try to approach the problem of having molecules that are tagged of which the motion we want to follow? So, I will do something that is sort of a trick that resembles what people do in experiments. So, in an experiment of this kind of biological systems, what you would do is to tag certain molecules and to follow their motion thanks to their fluorescence. So, basically, the volume fraction of the molecules that will form my droplet phi will be split into two parts. Will be split into two parts. One part, phi1, that is the volume fraction of the molecules that I have labeled, and another part phi2, which is the molecule of the same kind, which I have not labeled. And here I will assume that their physical properties are not changed by the labeling at all. So this modifies my free energy density because now I can differentiate between labeled and unlabeled molecules. So sort of playing with Gibbs paradox here, we'll have a different term in the entropy part. Term in the entropy part. And the energetic part instead is not changed. It just depends on the overall volume fraction phi. Now I can play the same usual game of deriving the irreversible thermodynamic approach of the system. And then I will get an equation which in terms of this phi i, which could be phi one or phi two, so the volume fraction of labeled or unlabeled molecules. Or unlabeled molecules takes a much simpler form. So basically, here I have one term. First of all, it's important to notice that this is now linear in phi i. So it's linear in the volume fraction of the labeled or unlabeled components. And it has one term, which is just a usual diffusion term. And then two advective terms, one of which is sort of forced by an external potential, the gradient of an external potential, which just depends on the overall volume fraction. Overall volume fraction phi. And then, if the system is not at equilibrium, so if there is an overall flux of the system, we also have an additional drift velocity. So basically, all the difficulty of solving the problem is contained in this J here. But once I'm given a profile phi and its flux, J, what the label and unlabel molecule do, it's nothing more than just diffusion. So what I can do then, So, what I can do then is to start thinking about labeling fewer and fewer molecules and go to the limit in which I basically just label a single molecule. And then I can start thinking about this diffusion equation in terms of a Fokker-Planck equation, and I can start analyzing the associated Langevin equation. So, this will be the Langevin equation that I have to deal with with a certain drift term V and then Gaussian white noise of a given intensity. And all that is left to do is to connect. And all that is left to do is to connect this drift and noise intensity to the parameters that are coming from the equation that I showed you earlier. So what we have is that the drift will be composed of one term that can be seen to come from the gradient of a potential weighted by the mobility, the single molecule mobility. And this potential will be nothing but minus kBT the logarithm of phi. So here, Logarithm of phi. So, here, just to give you a pictorial view of it, we have our system with a dense and dilute phase. Here, we see the volume fraction that has a high value phi minus, and then around the boundary, so there's this interface region, it sharply relaxes to this dilute value. And this basically corresponds to a potential which is trying to keep the single molecule inside the dense phase. So, trying to leave this condensate looks very much like trying to leave this stepwise. To leave this stepwise potential. Then, if the system is out of equilibrium and there is an additional flux J, we'll have this additional non-equilibrium velocity V. And then, in case the diffusion constants are different inside the dense or the dilute phase, we'll have an additional term that depends on the gradient of diffusion. And this makes sure that we can use the Ito discretization to represent this. To represent this noise product. So, just to give you an idea of how this drift looks like, I'll show you two cases. First, look at the dashed line. This is a case in which I have no external flux, so I'm an equilibrium system, and the diffusion constant is actually constant. So it's the same in a dilute and in the dense phase. Then, what I get is that away from the phase boundary, I have basically no drift. So, my particle is simply diffusing. And close to the phase boundary, Using. And close to the phase boundary, I have this dip in my drift, which is basically retaining molecules inside the dense phase. If I allow the diffusion coefficient to change in space, the drift will look more complicated, but the dynamics will basically be roughly the same. But we will see these non-monotonic changes here around the interface. Now, since Now, since we've seen that we have basically diffusion away from this from the interface region, we can think of simplifying the problem. And since solving the full Fokker-Planck equation for this kind of nonlinear potential is usually not feasible analytically, we can think about the case in which the interface gets narrower and narrower, and we basically will have diffusion in the two different phases and a coupling around the phase boundary that has to represent. Around the phase boundary, that is to represent the fact that there's a sharp change in the concentration or the potential. So we can take this sharp interface limit, I will call it here in the following, and basically this simplifies our problem to solving two diffusive equations in which I have potentially two different diffusion coefficients d plus and d minus. And the only non-trivial part of this is that I will have this I will have this condition at the interface that the probability of being right in the dense phase, so this P minus, has to be gamma times P plus, which is the probability of being right outside the interface. And this gamma is the partition factor. So it's the ratio of the volume fraction in the dense versus the dilute phase. So if I couple this two diffusion equation with this boundary condition, Condition, I can solve the problem and I can actually show you how the propagator looks like because it takes a rather simple shape that is quite informative, I think. So here I'm concentrating on a particle that started in the dense space, so inside the condensate, so x is less than zero. And here is how the propagator of, so the probability of finding the particle at position x, given that it was in x naught and a time delta t has elapsed, looks like when I'm still. Looks like when I'm still inside the condensate. So x is less than zero. So what you get here is basically a combination of two Gaussians. And the first part, sorry, the second part here is just a usual propagator of free Gaussian spreading. But we have one additional term that is weighted by this factor alpha. So when alpha is equal to one, this is the solution of diffusion in front of a reflecting wall. When alpha is equal to zero, then I just have free diffusion. Zero, then I just have free diffusion. So basically, I can think about the boundary of my condensates as basically a semi-permeable membrane that lets the fraction alpha or one minus alpha of particle through and reflects the rest. This is confirmed if we look at what happens to the probability of finding the particle outside of the condensate now. And we have this scaling factor one minus alpha in front of the Gaussian for the spreading of the. For the spreading of the propagator. Just to give some more intuitive, yeah, before that, sorry, it's important what alpha is. So, alpha is determined as a combination of the partition factor gamma and the ratio of the diffusion inside and outside the condensate. And it ranges from one, which will be the case of basically perfect reflection, to minus one, which basically means that the particles are seemingly absorbed when they come. Are seemingly absorbed when they come to the interface and they are just then transmitted to the dilute phase. So, just to give a feeling of how these propagators look like, I can think of a single molecule starting inside the condensate in this position here, and here is the phase boundary. So, if I look at the propagator for rather short times, I have just the usual diffusion spreading of the Gaussian. If I wait longer, I will start feeling. If I wait longer, I will start feeling the presence of the interface. So parts of my probability will be reflected and only a slight portion will be leaked out. And if I wait even longer, I will start getting the step-like profile, which is basically proportional to the volume fraction profile that our system started with. And if I compare this solution of the sharp interface with an actual numerical solution of the Fokker-Planck equation for the profile I showed you in the previous slides. Showed you in the previous slides, we see that there is a very strong agreement between them. And then, of course, I can also do Langevin simulations, and as they should, they agree. And nothing stops me from also looking at what happens when the particle start outside the condensate and then are dragged inside. So basically, what we have learned until here is that we can think about this single molecule motion as a diffusion inside an effective potential. Inside an effective potential that basically enforces this partially reflecting boundary condition at the phase boundary. Now, what can we do with this theory that we have developed? One of the things one may want to do is to try to measure relevant physical parameters of these condensates from single molecules. So, one of these parameters is the diffusion coefficient. And usually, one would look at mean-square displacements. In this specific case, one has to. In this specific case, one has to be slightly careful because the diffusion coefficient may change in space. So one has to be slightly careful. And the fact that there is this confinement by the condensate also has to be taken into account. So it can be less trivial than usual just to look at mean square displacement. Another quantity that one can look at is basically the length of displacement across the phase boundary. And this is actually one quantity that has been looked at in the experiment. Quantity that's been looked at in the experimental literature. So, people were actually measuring in living cells what was the typical length of displacements that crossed the phase boundary. So, here, if I'm focusing on this green trajectory, I see that in a time delta t, it moved from a position inside the dense phase to outside the dense phase. And what I can do is to measure how long this jump in this fixed time delta t was and to start building a histogram about this and get basically the statistics. About this, and get basically the statistics of what is this displacement length condition on the fact that I have actually jumped from the dense into the dilute phase. This can be computed in the sharp interface limit, and so we can draw how it looks like, and we can also get a rather compact expression for it, which has one interesting feature. So, it depends on the two-diffusion coefficients. So, in principle, looking Coefficient. So, in principle, looking at this curve allows us to extract what are these two diffusion coefficients, but it doesn't depend on the partitioning. So, it doesn't depend on how strong phase separation is in our system, which is quite interesting. And then I'll just show you how it looks like if you actually solve fully the Fokker-Planck equation. There's a slight deviation, but nothing major. And then I can also look at different displacements. Different displacements, which are not the ones that left the condensate, but are the ones that enter the condensates. So, I will focus, for example, on this purple line here that started in the dilute phase, and after time, delta T was in the dense phase, and measure how long this displacement was. And then I can basically plot this on top of each other. And what I find is that if the system is at equilibrium, these two distributions have to be exactly the same. So basically, by digital balance, the distribution of the length of the transition crossing the interface leaving the condensates and those entering must have the same distribution. And this is interesting if we think that actually leaving the condensate is very different from entering it because it entails climbing over a potential well, whereas entering the condensate just means going downhill this effective potential. Potential. But by little balance, they have to be equal. What is also interesting is what happens if I look at a system in which the diffusion constant is actually constant, so it's the same in the two phases, then my expression simplifies to this. And what I find is that it's actually the same expression that I would have if I just checked how long were the transition crossing an arbitrary line that I draw anywhere in my system. So it doesn't have to be next to the phase boundary. Next to the phase boundary, I could just draw it here in the middle of the dilute phase and check how long typically are or how long the jumps across this are. And if I plot this on top of the other, they are basically indistinguishable. So since this distribution basically only depends on diffusion coefficients, if the two diffusion coefficients are the same, it basically looks the same whether I'm looking at the actual phase boundary or at an arbitrary line that I just drew. Arbitrary line that I just drew somewhere in space. Now, if we want to measure the partition coefficient, then it's useful to look at other quantities, for example, the mean first passage times or first passage times distributions. So here I consider a system that is actually bounded and it is a size L, and my molecule is starting at position X naught, and I basically want to derive the first passage time to this position X. X. And if I compute the mean first-passage time in the sharp interface limit, I get this compact expression, which depends on the diffusion inside the condensate, outside the condensate, but also on the partition factor. So by looking at this quantity, one can estimate the partition function. And here, just to give you an idea, if I vary my arrival position, so where I want my particle to arrive, I will get plus. Particle to arrive, I will get plots of this kind, and if I vary my initial position, I will just get plots of these other kinds. So, by basically just doing simple fits of these quadratic curves, I can get all my diffusion coefficients and the partition factor. You see, there can be a slight discrepancy between the full theory, the complete theory here in the full line, and the one with the sharp interface here, but this distance is basically constant and one can. Is basically constant, and one can actually compute it. And it is related to the time that it takes to cross the finite interface, and it takes this expression here. We'll not comment too much on it now, because what I want to discuss next is what happens if we instead have condensates that are outside of equilibrium. So, here I'm thinking about a very simple system in which I'm reaching a steady state, but I have a known But I have a non-vanishing flux. So here I'm fixing the concentration or the volume fractions at the edges of my box, and I reach the steady state, which has this slope. So this system displays a constant flux towards the right. And now I can do the same as I did before and look at what would be the single molecule drift. And here, in addition to this effective potential. Addition to this effective potential and the eventual gradients, if one has a varying diffusion coefficient, we will also have the influence of this flux. And what we see here is what we get in the full line is what we would get from actually using the full profile. And here with this dotted line, it's just an approximation if we're neglecting the curvature of these curves. But what is mostly important is by just looking at it, it doesn't look very much different from what we had. It doesn't look very much different from what we had without the flux. But what is interesting is that it is actually not relaxing to zero away from the phase boundary. So it's slightly negative and even more so in the dilute phase. So this means that our single particle drift velocity is actually going towards the left. So even though we have an overall flux driven by mostly diffusion that is going towards the right, we still have that each molecule. That each molecule has a drift going against this overall drift. And basically, yeah, this is what is summarized in this equation here. There is the one that is plotted here in these dotted lines that is valid slightly away from the interface. So now, just before moving towards the conclusions, I want to comment on the fact that we saw earlier that having We saw earlier that having a system that was respecting detail balance enforced this distribution of displacement across the interface to be equal when one was leaving the condensate or when one was entering it. This no longer holds true if our system is out of equilibrium. So here I'm showing you in green the probability distribution of having a jump length and leaving the condensate. And here in this In this pink color, the reverse process, the one of entering. And we see that there is a difference. So, this is sort of a signature of the fact that the system is out of equilibrium. And the most striking difference between the two, which are still quite similar, is in their magnitude. So it's the fact that we actually, since we had a flux towards the right, we had more particles that were crossing the interface in the direction that was leaving the condensate compared to the one entering it through the interface. Entering it through the interface. And now, basically, I'm ready to conclude and to summarize what I told you. So, we can think of the motion of the single molecules in a phase-separated medium as undergoing diffusion in an effective potential, which is dictated by the volume fraction profile. We can use tracking of single molecules to obtain information about our system, both at the quantitative level, so really measuring. At the quantitative level, so really measuring the diffusion coefficients and the partition coefficient, and also into getting insights of whether the system is at equilibrium or not. And being at equilibrium, as usual, imposes strict symmetries also on the motion of single molecules. And that by looking at violation of these symmetries, we can detect and perhaps quantify non-equilibrium. So, the things that I think are very important to do next is. Important to do next is first of all experiments. So, one of my collaborators here in Dresden is now doing experiments looking at validating the theory with experimental data. Then to proceed to a more sort of quantitative understanding of these non-equilibrium effects by looking at these statistical distributions that are available in experiments, and then later on to start looking at the case in which we have molecules that undergo chemical reactions. So, we're following individual molecules. So, we're following individual molecules that can undergo chemical reactions. And I'm interested in seeing if this framework that we have developed can be applied to those cases as well. And also, what are the consequences of having particles inside condensates for search problems? So imagine you need to find a target inside a condensate. How does the properties of the condensate help you in finding your target? And with this, I thank you for your attention and I acknowledge my co-authors and collaborators. Collaborators, and I'm very happy to take questions if you have any. So uh we finish with one more session and discussion at the end. So there will be more questions on the on the talks we can discuss it at the end. The discussion is right after the session, right? Yes. Of the decision, right?
