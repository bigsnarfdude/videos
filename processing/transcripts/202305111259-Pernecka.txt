Thank you for the introduction. And of course, thank you to Vladimir and all the organizers for the invitation to this wonderful place and wonderful company. This has been probably my first participation in Purely Bana Platin's workshop. I have to completely agree with you. Workshop. I have to completely agree with Dan. I met a lot of people for the first time and it's been a great experience. So, thank you all for that. I will be talking about Lipschitz-free Banach spaces rather than Banach lattices. So, I hope you won't be too disappointed with the missing structure in the talk. But these spaces still do admit an order, and that's what I will discuss today. The results that will appear mainly in the second half of the talk will be The second half of the talk will be based on joint work with my colleagues Ramon Aviagat from Valencia and Richard Smith from Dublin. So, let me begin by introducing the Lipschitz-free Banach space. This is again a free object in the categorical sense, this time in the category of Banach spaces with bounded linear operators, where the supercategory consists of metric spaces with which it's matched. So, to be more So to be more precise, for a metric space M with some fixed point that I will call base point or origin in M, the Lipschitz-free space over M denoted by F M is the linearly isometrically unique Panach space such that the metric space M The metric space M embeds isometrically onto a linearly dense subset of this Banach space and such that any lip sheet map into a banach space That moreover preserves the origin extends to a bounded linear operator from the Lipschitz free space to x with the same Lipschitz constant. So there exists a bounded linear operator whose norm is the same as the Lipschitz constant. Is the same as the Lipschitz constant of the mapping L. And when I say extends, what I mean is that this diagram commutes. That is, that L hat composed with delta is the same as L. So these are Lipschitz-free Banach spaces. And before showing you a construction, and so proving that they actually really exist for any metric space, let me Any metric space, let me motivate their study by showing some applications. So the first application would be in... So let me make writing on the blackboard look much easier than it is to me. Okay, so the first application would be in nonlinear functional analysis for studying the metric geometry of Banach spaces. If we have two metric spaces, M and N, so M and N are metric, and if we consider them as subsets of the respective Lipschitz-free spaces, Via this isometric embedding, then any Lipschitz map from M to N that preserves the base point again extends to a bounded linear operator between the corresponding Lipschitz free spaces. So there exists albar linear that, well, extends and also preserves the Lipschitz constant, right? So there exists a linear operator between the Panach spaces that has the same norm as the Lipschitz constant of mapping L. And when I say extent, again I mean that the diagram commutes. So that means that delta M commits. delta M comp L composed with delta N is the same as delta N composed with L bar. This is immediate from the universal property. If we just, you know, if it helps us, we can just redraw the diagram into triangular shape. Then here I have a Lipschitz map. Here I have a Lipschitz map from M to a Banach space, and the L bar then can be defined as L composed with delta M hat from the universal property. And so in particular, if, for example, these metric spaces are by Lipschitz isomorphic, I mean that there exists a bijection that is Lipschitz and its inverse is also Lipschitz, then the Also, Lipschitz, then the corresponding Lipschitz free spaces are linearly isomorphic. So, this sort of linearization of Lipschitz maps transfers metric structures into linear setting. And if in particular for our metric spaces M and N we consider two banana spaces, then this suggests that the Lipschitz-free spaces could be a helpful tool for A helpful tool for studying the Lipschitz isomorphism classes of Banach spaces or for studying which linear properties of Banach spaces are determined purely by their metric. And the first examples of such applications, the first and so far the most significant and unmatched ones were provided by Gottfroma and Calton. In 2001, who showed using Lipschitz-free spaces, for example, that or who showed using Lipschitz-free spaces that, for example, if X is a separable Banach space and Y is any Banach space, Any banana space. And if X embeds into Y isometrically as a subset, not linearly, just as a subset, then it already has to embed to Y linearly, isometrically as a subspace. This compared to Masur-Rulan's theorem doesn't require surjectivity of this isometric embedding, but it also doesn't say that that embedding would be linear, it just says that there exists a linear isometric embedding. And this is not true for non-separable space X. Another application that they provided is the following. The following: If we have two connect spaces x and y that are bili-sheets isomorphic, so x is bi-wip sheets isomorphic to y. And if continuing here, if x has the bounded approximation property, approximation property, then also y has the bounded approximation property. So this is an example of a linear property that is stable under bi-litz isomorphisms. So it's actually a metric property in this sense. And one of the main One of the main open questions in this direction is to determine for which Banach spaces the Lipschitz isomorphism classes correspond to linear isomorphism classes. This is known to be true for C0, but it is not known, for example, for little L1. And a positive answer would follow if one were able to answer the following open question in Lipschitz-Free Balanced Faces and that. free banana spaces and that is whether the free space over L1 complemented whether the free space over L1 is complemented in its bifule or second fuel if you wish if this is true then the leakshit isomorphism class of A Lipschitz isomorphism class of little L1 is the same as a near isomorphism class. So, this is an example of applications in functional analysis. The other application that I would like to mention is maybe if I dare say more from real life, and that is in optimal transport. The finitely supported elements in Lipschitz-free spaces, or more generally, the differences of two probability measures. Probability measures represent so-called transportation problems. A transportation problem is when we have some mass in our metric space M, let's say located at this three point. So 1, 2, 3. And we want to transport this mass to a different location. Here, minus 2 and minus 8. And minus eight at the least possible cost, where the cost will be where the cost is proportionate to the distance that the mass has to travel. So such a problem can be represented by an element which is free space, and then the norm of this element actually corresponds to the cost of an Corresponds to the cost of an optimal solution of this problem. And optimal solutions or optimal transportation plans always exist and they can actually be recognized by the geometry of the route along which the mass travels, by the geometry in that metric space M. So that's another example of an application. And actually, this approach also gives another way of defining these spaces. And you might Spaces, and you might meet them under the name in the literature under the name Aren's IL spaces or transportation cost spaces. But I will now give you a functional analytic construction of the space. So let's now have a look that the spaces really exist. So let's fix a complete metric space M with some designated base point. The completeness assumption will not change the resulting free space, but it is convenient for proving different properties. So we will always assume that the metric space is complete. Complete. So if we have such a complete metric space, then the vector space consisting of all real-valued functions on m that are whipshit and that vanish at the base point with the norm given by the least whipshit constant, that is with the norm of such a function. Of such a function given a screen of FP minus FQ over DPQ, where these are PQ are two distinct points in my metric space. So this normed space is actually a Banach space and I will call it It the Lipschitz space. Or Lipschitz algebra, if you wish, because it also has algebraic structure, but I will not go into that. Now let delta be a mapping from the metric space M into the binary space. m into the banana space dual of the Lipschitz space that assigns to a point the evaluation functional at this point. That is the functional that for a function f returns the value of f at the given point. Then this mapping is an isometric embedding of the metric space M into the dual of the Lich space M. Which basically to see that it is an isometry to verify that it's an isometry. This is easy with the help of an extension CRM for Lipschitz maps to make change. So we get an isometric embedding of the metric space into the dual, and now we can define the Lipschitz-free space. The Lipschitz free space, the Lipschitz free space over the metric space M is defined as the closed subspace of the dual of the Lipschitz space that is generally Space that is generated by the image of M. And this with the norm inherited from the dual is a Banach space. And to see that this is the desired free object that satisfies that universal property, well first of all, clearly M is isometrically mapped onto a linearly dense subset. So we Set. So we just need to verify that extensions of Lipschitz maps exist, but there is only a unique extension, right, from M to the span of M. So we only need to check that this extension has norm equal to the Lipschitz constant of the L. And this is a direct computation, and once we have done that, we can extend it continuously to the closure. So indeed, this is Indeed, this is objects satisfying that universal property, so we see that they always exist for complete metric spaces. And if, in particular, in that universal property for the Banach space X here, we consider the real line, it follows that the Banach space dual of the Lipschitz free space is linearly isometric. Isometric to the Lipschitz space. So actually, we found in the dual of the Lipschitz space, we found a subspace that is a pre-dual. And on bounded sets in the Lipschitz space, the topology, the weak topology induced by this duality, so the weak start. Duality, so the weak start topology with respect to the free space being the pre-dual agrees with the topology of point-wise convergence of functions. So, this is the construction, and maybe let me give you some concrete examples of Lipschitz free spaces as funic spaces. Spaces. Excuse me, where in the construction do you need the completeness of the metric space? You don't need the completeness for the construction. I assume it for some later arguments, but you don't need it in the same construction. Especially it doesn't make difference because you are taking this closure here, so you result in the same space. So examples: The Lichens Free Space of Real Pine is linear. Is linearly isometric to capital L1. This can be seen through this isometry to the evaluation functional at point x. We assign the characteristic function of the interval 0x up to a sign, depending on whether x lies in the positive or the negative half of the real. Positive or the negative half of the real line. Maybe even easier way of seeing this isometry is in their duals, actually, where to a Lipschitz function we assign its derivative that exists almost every verb. And a discrete version of this says that Of this says that the free space over natural numbers with the discrete metric is linearly isometric to little L1. And similarly, to the evaluation functional at some point n, we assign the vector that has once on the first n on the first n coordinates and then. On the first n coordinates and then zeros. And in fact, free space over any subset of real line can be described through L1. The free space over M, if M is a subset of real line, is always just an L1 sum of capital and possibly capital and little L1, where the Where this part corresponds to the part of the metric space M that has positive length measure and the dimension of the L1 depends on the number of connected components in M. So if it is discrete like here, we don't have the capital L1 part. If it is a connected space, then we don't have this discrete part. This discrete part. So this is true for subsets of R, but then the situation becomes more complicated in higher dimensions. The free spaces or finite dimensional finite spaces have been identified with the quotients of L1 spaces of vector-valued functions, but it is, for example, not known. Known. So let me mention another very classical and hard question in this realm, and that is whether the free space over Rn might be isomorphic. I keep using these symbols. Maybe I should fix it somewhere. I will use this for isometry. I would use this for linear isometry. Rhythm metry. I have been, so I use this for binding sheets isomorphism and this for the linear isomorphism so that I so that I don't confuse you if I forget to mention I don't confuse you if I forget to mention this. So, it is not known whether the free space over Rn could be linearly isomorphic to the free space over Rm for distinct dimensions greater than 1. It is known that this is not true between f of r and f of r2 because f of r2 F of R2 does not isomorphically embed into capital One. This is a result due to Naur and Schechtmann that comes from an argument by originally by Kisiakov. So we see that. So we see that these two are not isomorphic, but it is not known for higher dimensions. And in general, very little is known, at least to me, about what an isomorphism between free spaces imposes on the generating metric spaces. And there are, with time, maybe let me just mention there are examples. Let me just mention there are examples of Banach spaces that are not by Lipschitz isomorphic whose free spaces are isomorphic. That is F over C0 with F over C 0 1 and if we don't insist on banner spaces just metric spaces the metric spaces don't even have to be homeomorphic for the Even have to be homeomorphic for the free spaces to be linearly isomorphic. For example, the free space over the ball of a finite-dimensional Banach space is isomorphic to the free space over the whole Banach space. So here we have a compact metric space, and here we have a whole Banach space. So they don't even have to be homeomorphic. Okay, so this was right. So this was like a brief introduction to the topic and now I would like to get to the order. Here I might be saying some trivial things, so I hope I won't offend you. So, I hope I won't offend you. I apologize for that. This is mainly for me. So, the Lipschitz space with the partial order given by pointwise comparing functions Is a vector lattice because the Lipschitz constant of the supremum of a family of Lipschitz functions or of their infinum is bounded by the supremum of the Lipschitz constant. But it is not a banath lattice. Yeah, this is easy to find two positive functions, one of which is point-wise smaller, but somewhere has a bigger slope and therefore a higher Lipschitz norm. And actually, this function then. And actually, this function that I drew here, that gives us the distance of a point from the base point, this is the greatest element of the unit ball in the Lipschitz space. And this will be important when working with positive functionals. Okay, so this is a vector lattice and a Banach space, but not a Banach lattice. And the order that the Lictit space has induces an order on its Banach space dual. So the Banach space dual with the order, well, given by the positive com consisting of the positive functionals, right? So Functional sequence. So, this is an ordered vector space. But we will show now that not every bounded linear functional is regular. See that in this, we will borrow an example due to mever that is like this. That is like this. Consider for our metric space, we will consider just the interval 0, 1, for example. And in this interval, oh, let me make it maybe bigger. It would be easier. 0, 5. And in this interval, I fix some point, q, and I take a sequence of points Bn converging to Q. To Q. And I want the convergence to be so fast that the distances of two consecutive points form a summable series. Then, if I do satisfy that, then this p I don't know minus one minus delta. Minus 1 minus delta 2n, then this would be an absolutely convergent series and so a well-defined element of the Lipschitz free space and in particular of the dual of the Lipschitz space. And now if I consider functions like this, that are my first function will My first function will be 0 up to p2 and will have value 1 at p1, so that's the first function. Then the second function will have one more peak, so I will add a peak here, repeat this one, and so on with increasing numbers. So on with increasing number of peaks as I approach the point Q, then these are clearly order, this sequence of functions forms an order bounded set because they are bounded, for example, by this Lipschitz function, which rises to one over here, and then it's just flat. But their Lipschitz norms grow. Lipschitz norms grow, and this is witnessed by the functional m. A functional m returns for function fn the number of peaks, and it counts the number of peaks. So this gives me n that means that this functional is not order bounded. So fn is Alrighty fm is already bounded but m is not bounded so m is not regular so this shows that this ordered vector space is not a lattice so it is an ordered vector space but not But not a lattice. And since the Lipschitz free space is a subspace of the dual of the Lipschitz space, it is also an ordered vector space. And the example that we constructed of a boundary functional that is not regular sits in the Lipschitz free space. So the same is true for Lipschitz free space. Yeah, that it is. Free space. That it is an ordered vector space, but not a lattice. Because you need some dadmagraphic well it not even like uh you don't have you cannot decompose any functional law into positive and negative part this functional has no positive major amount you're talking about ff right the lip c3 fm or even lip0 m star in in general okay you will see uh I constructed a very specific example that makes use of the fact that Q is a non-isolated That Q is a non-isolated point, and even that I could choose the speed of the convergence. So, sort of, that there are some requirements on that metric space, and I will address this at the very end. But in general, we can say that the dual of the Lipschitz space is not a lattice with this order. I'm sorry. So, if I understand your construction correctly, your sequence. Your construction correctly, your sequence Fn is not uniformly bounded because the slopes will increase, right? Yes, yes. The slopes increase. We had to, when we wanted to think of an example, we have to take some functions that are bounded by some other Lipschitz function, but necessarily their norms have to increase. Oh, okay. Because if they didn't, then this is a bounded linear function, also it would be bounded. It. There is maybe even we could find a little bit more illustrative example in the dual of the Lipschitz space that works with generalized derivatives, where it's kind of obvious, like we will take functions with bigger and bigger slopes, and the function of will measure the slope for every of this function, each of these functions, by assigning sort of a derivative, but that one in general is. But that one in general is just in the by due also. I wanted to cover both cases with some example. Okay. Any this doesn't exclude the case that there could be other order for which you could have yes, this this I don't know. But yeah, it only says that for this post. Only says that for peaceful variables number one is there. Well, I guess if you identify this capital one, then there is a lot there. But I think the question is: is that any possibility? No, this is really particular to this order that we are considering. Okay, on the other hand, if T is a Positive linear functional then t has to be necessarily norm bounded and its norm is given by the evaluation. The evaluation at the distance from zero function. This is because it was the greatest element of the unit ball. So all positive linear functionals are norm-bounded and we can compute their norm very easily. Okay, so let me now describe the order dual by giving some By giving some more concrete representation to the bounded positive linear functionals. So let's first see some examples. For instance, a positive linear combination of evaluation functionals is clearly a positive functional. Positive functional on the Lipschitz space. And it actually can be seen as a measure, like as given by integrating the Lipschitz function with respect to with respect to the corresponding linear combination of Dirac measures, right? Of direct measures, right? This is a trivial observation, but it gives us some first intuition. As a non-discrete example, let's consider, for example, the Lebesgue measure on interval 0, 1, right? The Lebesgue measure on interval 0, 1 and the functional that integrates. That integrates Lipschitz functions with respect to this measure. And this as well is a positive linear functional on the Lipschitz space. So maybe measures are good candidates for representing positive linear functionals on Lipschitz spaces. But what measures and on what measure space? On what measure space. So consider now m to be bounded, that is having finite diameter, and let X be some compactification of M such that every leap sheet function If Schwartz function extends continuously from M to X and let's take an arbitrary point in our compactification then The functional that is the functional that is given by integrating the continuous extension of our function with respect to the direct measure at this point is also a positive linear functional. So, if we want to accommodate for this case, we need to consider some compactification of the metric space such that all Lipschitz functions continuously extend to this compactification. On the other hand, okay, let's think of this metric space. Let M be, maybe I will use colors here. Maybe I will use colors here. Can you see the blue one? That's hard to see. Okay. Be the union of these canonical faces and It's slight modification in, let's say, C0, but it doesn't really matter. And I should also include the base point, right? And this is a complete metric space. So it looks somehow like this. I'm taking pairs of points. That get closer and closer to each other within the pair, but that don't have a limit in the metric space, so that it's a complete metric space. Then, if I consider a point X in the closure of this orange set, in, for example, star. In, for example, Stonecheck compactification of M, which is an example of a compactification where Lipschitz functions would extend continuously, and I consider another point Y in the closure of the green part, then these two are distinct points in the stone-check compactification because they can be separated by a continuous function. The orange and the green sets are closed. Sets are closed. So X is different from Y as a point, but the positive functional that they induce in the previous sense is the same on the Lipschitz functions, right? So if we want to have any hope for uniqueness in our representation, Uniqueness in our representation, then we have to also assume that our compactification is such that the Lipschitz functions separate points in the compactification. So in that sense, the Stonechief compactification is a bit too big. And this brings us to so-called uniform or semi-all compactification, which is exactly what we need. So let's move, right? It doesn't. So let's write it as a notation. By MU, I will denote the uniform compactification of the metric space M, which always exists and it can be seen as a quotient of the son. It can be seen as a quotient of the Stonchek compactification where we identify all points that cannot be separated by Lipschitz functions. And it has the property that every Lipschitz function extends continuously, possibly admitting values plus or minus infinity, and that any two disjoint closed subsets can be separated by Lipschitz functions. So an ideal setting for working with a Lipschitz maps. And further just to the notation. Further, just to the notation, for I measure mu on the uniform compactification. I will denote, as I have already been doing, mu hat the, well for now, just the formal I think that assigns to a function the integral of its extension. Its extension to the uniform compactification, I will denote it the same with respect to this measure real, if it exists. So far, no assumptions on the measure yet, it's just a matter of notation. And so now I can finally describe the positive functionals on rigid spaces. So the positive functionals on rigid spaces are Spaces are functionals that are induced by induced in this sense by positive sigma finite or L in a regular Measures on the uniform compactification of M that have the finite first moment. So that means that the integral of this function is finite. They are given by these plus Plus, possibly something concentrated at zero and or at infinity. Let me see if I have time to explain. Let me see if I have time to explain this by part here. Okay, am I mentioning? So what happens with this is that we might have some positive functionals that sit at the base point or somewhere in the compactification at points that are at distance infinity from the base point, and those cannot be given by measures. Because if they were given by a measure at the base point, that means it would have to be a multiple of the direct measure at the base point. But every Lichtschitz function is zero there. So the integration would be zero. And so if they are non-zero, this would be a contradiction. On the other hand, if they are concentrated somewhere at the infinity, then again it would have to be a measure sitting at infinity, but then this would be violated. So those that sit at zero or at infinity and are positive and are conducted and non-zero cannot be given by measures. Let me show just an example, what could it be actually? So let's have a non-isolated base point in my metric space and let's take any sequence that converges to this base point, anything. Then the sequence Then the sequence of normalized evaluation functionals. So these have norm one. So the sequence of normalized evaluation functionals, since it is sitting in this weak star compact set, would possibly after taking Would possibly, after taking a subnet, have a weak star limit point. So, if I possibly take some subnet, then this converges weak star to some other functional in here. And this functional is clearly positive as a limit of positive ones. And it's non-zero because the evaluation of the distance from the base point function is always one. So this. This one is one, so that one cannot be given by a measure. I would have to be concentrated at the base point. So that's an example. And we can do a similar example, basically exactly the same construction for infinity, but this time we will consider a sequence. Okay, I'm squeezing it in maybe badly. So, this time I would consider an unbounded sequence of points. And I would look at a limit somewhere here in the uniform compactification and take the same type of functional. So, this is about this part plus maybe something at zero or infinity. But if our functional is such that it's action on a Such that its action on a Lipschitz function depends only on the values of the Lipschitz function on annuli, then such that means that it sort of avoids zero and infinity, these pathological cases don't happen, then this one is induced by a measure. And this actually follows from the fact that if we do restrict our functional only to an annulus, then it can be, and it's a positive functional, then it can be approximated by positive. Then it can be approximated by positive linear combinations of evaluation functionals that are bounded not only in Lipschitz norm, but that are also bounded as measures in total variation. And so we can take a weak star limit in the measure space, and this would be our representing measure up to some limiting procedure. So that's where the identification comes from. And now this identification And now this identification, and moreover, it is one-to-one. So, a representing measure of this form has to be unique. This falls from the fact that actually their supports agree. So, such a representation is unique. And it is also convenient for recognizing the weak star continuous functionals. So, let me state that. So let mu be a measure like this. Let's denote these measures m sigma plus. Maybe one more comment. Why sigma finite and not rather not finite? For this we can see a very simple example. For instance, consider this element. Consider this element in the free space over 0, 1. It's well defined because this is absolutely convergent and it is given by a measure, right? It's a positive functional that is given by a measure, which is the sum of the arc measures, but that measure is not finite, it's just sigma finite. And the singularity appears around the base point, and that's actually the only point where my measure might blow up. Measure might blow up. So these measures have the property that they are finite away from the base point. So if in particular the base point in the metric space is isolated, then these are actually radon measures. So it makes it a little bit nicer. Or it's enough if just the base point is not in the support of my functional. Okay, so now for the weak star continuous ones. So let mu be a measure like this. A measure like this, then the following is equilibrium. The functional that it induces is weak star continuous if and only if the measure is concentrated or I can write it like this: is concentrated on the metric space M and this is true if And this is true if and only if, and here I'm not sure about the terminology, the functional is normal or order continuous, so let me rather write it as a property, if I have a bounded net of lichens functions that converges pointwise and monotonically, then the evaluations converge. Converge. So I don't know if this is correctly called order continuous or normal. Maybe in algebraics that in the other normal and here maybe order continuous. So the fact that a weak star continuous measure induced functional has to be induced by a measure concentrated only on the metric space. It only on the metric space follows from the good choice of compactification. This is thanks to the fact that we are working with uniform compactification, so we can separate closed subsets of the remainder of the compactification by Lipschitz functions. The fact that such a functional is a normal that follows from since my measure is Since my measure is in irregular, it is concentrated on its support. And since it sits in a metric space, this support is separable. So I can consider separable setting, but then here I can replace nets with sequences, and this just follows from the monotone convergence theorem, right, if it's induced by measure. And the fact that a normal functional is weak. Is weak star continuous? Well, the proof of this is a little bit simpler in this positive case, but actually this is true for any functional on the Lipschitz space. In the positive case, it just follows by transforming a pointwise conversion. Transforming a pointwise convergent net into a monotone pointwise convergent net, which I can do by replacing functions fi, which might, or let's say, gi that converge just pointwise and are bounded. I transform them into a monotony A monotonically convergent net by just considering the suprema of these functions for j greater than i, sort of like this. In a non-positive case, this requires a little bit more technicalities. So, this is how we recognize the positive ones and And as a final comment, let me just state for which metric spaces actually the order dual agrees with the Panach space dual. So that is, for which metric spaces, all functionals are regular. So the Banach space dual of the liquid space is of this form. If and only if the Lipschitz free space is of this form. So if and only if every weak star continuous functional is regular and not only that, but its positive and negative part belong to Lipschitz-P space again. And the metric characterization. The metric characterization of this is that the metric space is discrete with the discreteness, with the separation constant growing with the distance from the base point. So that is that there exists some alpha such that for every two distinct points in the metric space, we have that their mutual distance is greater. Their mutual distance is greater than or equal to alpha times the distance of one of them from the base point. And this is actually because such a space reduces to a very concrete manach space and that is little L1. So there exists an order preserving Linear isomorphism from the Lipschitz space, Lipschitz free space to little L1 over the index set M without the base point. And this is all I wanted to say, so thank you for your attention. Thank you very much for the interesting talk. So, any questions? Measures that concentrate at zero or at infinity, they are never going to be stack-continuous, right? They're never going to be infinite. They're never going to be interested. Yeah, they are. Exactly. So they are not measures, but these functionals, yes, that concentrate either at zero or infinity are not big star continuous because yes, but at zero, actually, these are essentially derivations at the base point. By derivation, I mean By derivation, I mean generalized derivative, and that one obviously depends on the values of the function on any neighborhood of the base point. But every function could be pointwise approximated by flattening it at this base point, and so the derivative would be zero even though its evaluation is non-zero. So, yes, they are not weak circle units. How dependent is your uh construction on your choice of base point in M? Um on okay uh so the change in general the change of the base point in M in for Lipschitz spaces or Lipschitz-free spaces means only a linear isometry. Changing the base point is a linear isometry, but you Symmetry. But yes, in these arguments, the base point matters because we saw that the measures, in the behavior of measures, is very particular around the base point. So this would change with the change of the base point. But actually there is an I didn't mention that, but I could add another characterization to this. Characterization to this, which works with measure representations that are on a different measure space and that are by principle independent of the choice of the base point. So it's just specific for this representation. But in a way, those would be positive and Positive in this sense with respect to some base point in the metric space. Not sure if I'm this is correctly. You said that if you have a bounded metric space, which is also separated from the base point, then you get you identify the positive functionals that measures. Exactly. So, but then measures they do form a lattice, right? So, does it follow that in that case order Follow that in that case, order dual is actually a button buttons, or it's the vector buttons. So, you mean with the order that we take from the measures, right? Yeah. This should. Well, in this representation, we unfortunately there is no relation between the norms of the of the element of the free space and the representing measure. Space and the representing measure. So, in sense of norms, I guess this could get ruined. The norm that comes from the measures would be more like the supreme norm. So, this is probably what I see as a hiccup, but I'm not sure. Again, I maybe would like to. Again, I maybe would like to mention the other representation. If I may, just a minute. I would write it down because this one is actually quite convenient also for such questions. I didn't want to enter there, but a functional in F M, for a functional in F M, we have that it is regular. It is regular M plus minus M minus so A This is equivalent to existence of a representing measure of this form. A measure that acts on the Lipschitz function by On the Lipschitz function by integrating its incremental quotient on m squared without the diagonal. And such a representation has the property that this measure has the same norm as the element of the free space. So maybe this is a little bit better direction for preserving. Direction for preserving this preserves the norms, so this really reflects the slopes rather than the supreme out functions. But the problem with this representation, on the other hand, is that this one is not unique, so there isn't some nice mapping from the free space to measures. They just exist, but it's not a regular mapping. There are further questions to car press three.
