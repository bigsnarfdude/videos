For inviting me to this very interesting workshop. It's always a pleasure for me to come here to Granada. So, I'm going to talk about a joint project with Juan Luis and Philomena Feyo from my institution, which has to do with the study of some anisotropic diffusion equations. And I'm going to show you different kinds of anisotropies which are collected in a Which are collected in a couple of papers that we wrote together, which had a lot of fun in writing and a lot of efforts in doing it, but actually finally we succeed. So let me just go to the plan of the talk. I'm going to give you just a brief introduction about the main model that I'm going to describe. In particular, I'm going to introduce. I'm going to introduce the specific anisotropy which we are going to deal with. Then the main question will be related to the study of some fundamental solution in terms of in the CEP sibling approach. So the main issue that we're going to study, and I'm going to show you some details, concerns the existence and uniqueness of fundamental solutions of similar form. are formed in the in the agreeing with the idea anosotropy we are going to describe we are going to display then uh yeah then i'm going to show you some of the main property also main equation and main model we are going to study existence and uniqueness of singular solution then uh just a little bit just a glimpse to the asymptotic behavior of solutions then some numerical studies and then finally This and then finally, I will spend some time in showing you some other kinds of anisotropy that we studied in this joint project. In particular, the model related to Pila Plash. So let's skip then to the main to the main model. As you see, I'm going to give you some I'm going to give you some details concerning the study of this particular anisotropic diffusion equation of the polaris medium type. You see that the anisotropy here is displayed this way. You have a different exponent with respect to any direction. And with this, the exponent mi are positive. Of course, Of course, if all these exponents are equal, you recover the classical Poros medium equation. If n is less than one, you have a fast energy equation. And you have, of course, the heat equation when the old exponents are equal to one. So we in particular, we are going to focus on the fast diffusion regime. So with all the exponents here and my as less than. Here, Mi as less than one for all i. And this is well studied in the recent paper that we wrote with Juan Luis and Philomene Affair from my institution. So, but let me be a little bit more precise about the assumption on this equation. Yeah, I mean, there are some references, but there are not so many. Actually, in the middle of this, which is strange, this model was not studied too much. This model was not studied too much in the literature. Some information can be found in this paper by Song, but actually he mainly focused on studying the existence of fundamental solutions, but not in a specific form. And this paper by Enrique Edricks, which dealt with the regularity of the solutions, which is there is still a Which is still quite big open problems. So, as I told you, I want to be a little bit more precise concerning the assumptions. So, the whole exponents here are such that this m bar, which is the average of all mi, is larger than mc, where mc is the classical critical exponent in the fast diffusion regime. Exponent in the fast diffusion regime. Mc is the exponent for which, above which you have in the classical asotropic case, you have that the variable association is integral. So you have the classical, the classical case. But here you have this assumption, which are, so you have that Mi is less than one, and the average of all the Mi's is larger than this critical spot. So let's go then to the study the kind of the self-similar variable we are going to study, which form the self-similar solutions that we are looking for. Of course, due to the anisotropy, the form of the self-similar solutions had to be anisotropic as well. So the form of the anisotropy is given. So, the form of the anisotropy is given by this in this form. See, you have this profile here, you have a different power of time with respect to any direction where these exponents Ai and alpha must be chosen properly, appropriately. Indeed, if you plug this function inside, I don't know why the pointer doesn't solve. Know why the pointer does not so well, but anyway. Then, if you change it, you make this change of variable here, then you plug inside the main equation, then you get this relation here. And if you want to eliminate the time factor, then what you see that the exponent must satisfy these relations, valid for all r. These relations, valid for all i. Okay? But then you want to preserve the mass, you want the mass conservation property, and the mass conservation property gives you also this relation here. So you have an n plus one equation. If you solve it explicitly, you have this form of the exponent alpha, which is the exponent in the time factor. Which is the exponent in the time factor in front of the profile of the C signal solution. And if you write Ai this way, with the product of alpha for this guy, C sigma i, then you have the sigma i is given by this. So it's very important that we are assuming that you see H2 is the condition for which the average. For which the average is larger than the critical exponent. This condition gives you that actually this exponent alpha is positive. And this is what actually we want because if the exponent alpha is positive, so the solution decay in time in maximum value. And this Q conditions also gives you that this exponent sigma r. That this exponent sigma i are positive, and the sigma i somehow controls the control, the expansion of the solution along any coordinate direction. See, let me see. Let me just watch solutions. You see, this is the form of the second research. So, if you choose this exponent in this form, then what you what you the education in which you The education in which you end is actually this one, and you see, this is just the anisotropic version of the stationary non-linear Fokker-Plac equation in the isotropic case for the porous medium. Okay, so the question is: how to determine F, capital F? Yeah, I mean, it's going to by the choice of this alpha, you have the mass conservation property whole. The mass conservation property holds, then what we focus in our paper is to determine the form of the profile of the stimulus solution. And in some way, Jalruis described this aspect in this very beautiful talk. And he said, also, in that case, that the profile is not explicit. Explicit. Actually, also in this case, the self-similar profile will not explicit as well. Okay, then the question: I don't know if I was too clear, but the question is, how to determine this capital F? Okay. Yeah, in the classical case of the polarized time, you have, of course, the exact form of the signal profile, but in this case, you But in this case, you cannot solve explicitly this solution because it's an inosoteric solution. You cannot use OD methods like in the classical case. Yeah, these are the form of the variable profile for the past diffusion case and for the porous medium case. And the condition that m is larger than mc guarantees that f is the profile is integrable. Finance integrable. So, as I told you, in the inosol probability case, we will not get any explicit formula for f. But this will have the existence of similar solutions, you will get some estimates of this profile in terms of a particular decay in the space parasol. So, just if you if you use Just if you if you use the change of variable that we that we saw just a question can you go back to the previous one so the only difference for any components is this sigma i right in the equation the sigma i yes yes sigma i so the question is to uh is to recover actually the some the some information concerning the existence of this similar profile. Of this similar profile, uniqueness, and some decay, some properties, a particular properties, symmetries in some form that we're going to describe in a few slides, and decays in these special variables. So, if you use the same anisotropic change of variables and separate similar variables, and you can Similar variables, and you call B this function, the function u times this time factor here, and you make this change of variables here. Then you have that new function B of course preserves the L1 norm. And this satisfies, you see, this evolution equation corresponding to the one that I showed you. This is the evolution equation for which. equation for which the equation satisfied by capital F is the stationary equation. And this is the version of the non-linear for the anisotropic version of the nonlinear Foketrack equation for our model. Yeah, I mean now I'm going to show you just the main properties but not and I'm not going to give you This, but not, and I'm not going to give you too many details concerning that. In particular, I will give you some information concerning the consensus existence of solution, uniqueness, and so on. And then in the second step, in the second step, I will go deeper to the issue concerning the existence and weakness of some similar solution. So, concerning the existence theory in the In the assumption, under the assumption that I described you before, so the old MI as less than one and the average of Mi larger than the critical exponent, what you can prove is that for any data in L1, so there is a unique function u, which is continuous in time, which values in L1, which satisfy the equation in the distributional sense. sense okay moreover it's possible to prove the l1 l infinity uh smooth in effect in this form uh so you have actually that for any for any uh positive time the the solution immediately becomes uh becomes uh becomes bounded space uh if you take if you take any positive time it's possible to see that actually the solution Possible to see that actually the solution is a weak energy solution in the sense that the gradient, so each derivative is linear 2 and the solution and the equation is fully satisfied by this solution in the form of in the weak sense applied on this particular set. And then this is And then this is a very important property, the contraction property. It's possible to see that actually this contraction estimate holds. You have in particular a comparison from this solution. So in particular, you have the mass, then the maximum property applies. And if you in particular, if you start with L1 and infinity initial datum, then actually you have the Actually, you have that the solution is a weak energy solution, so also for time, also going down to time equals zero. And it's possible to see that actually the solution is continuous, is continuous phase and time. Okay, this is just a bunch of information concerning the main properties of the main model. Okay, so So other properties of solution symmetry. You have an isotropic, an isotropic version of the Horizon Education equation. You don't expect that if you start with, for instance, with radial solutions, then the solution becomes radial. No, of course you have an isotropic diffusion equation. You actually expect that the solution is symmetric. Symmetric with respect to each variable. And actually, it's what you can prove is as a consequence of the Alexandro reflection principle, that you can prove that if you start with a symmetric function with respect to each variable xi, okay, and it was also non-increasing with respect to this, with respect to value of the absolute value. With respect to value of depth, value of xi, then this this property is preserved along the whole evolution. So if you start from initial data, which is symmetric with respect to each variable, and which is non-increasing with respect to each variable, then you have the same property is preserved for the long evolution. This can be done by using the By using the Alexandro reflection principle. Yeah, I mean, this for short, I will call this property SSNI. So separate symmetric and non-increasing. You have that if you start from a separate symmetric non-increasing initial theton, you have you have that the same properties preserved for the whole evolution of by the type of diagnosis by the solution of the of the of the Cauchy problem. of the protocol sheet problem uh so let me just describe the main uh uh the main uh the main result that we obtained in our paper we were able actually to show that for any for any positive mass there is a self-seminal fundamental solution so a fundamental solution in the self-seminal form which is a unique with mass m and we were also able to to uh to get and to capture To get and to capture some qualitative property of the profile of the solution, we were able to see that actually this solution is particularly symmetric with respect to each variable and it is non-inquising with respect to each variable. So it's an SSNI non-negative function. And this profile is always positive. You have the uniform positivity of the profile. The profile. It is in particular, it is below an explicit barrier, which for a suitable choice of the barrier function. I'm going to be a little bit more precise with this in a few slides. So let me just give you some of the main information concerning this point. You see that we started with the that we started with the stationary solution of the rescaled evolution equation from our model, our magnetic model, the stationary equation. So now the main point is to find in particular find a suitable parameter of the suitable barrier of the rescale at the rescale. about the rescaled the rescaled function the rescaled equation related to the main to the main model so we were able actually to get an explicit upper barrier so a special super solution to the stationary equation in this form you see that this this can be done in explicitly okay uh i'm going and i'm not going to give you any detail concerning this uh how indeed this can be done This is how individual this can be derived, but this is very important. This will be the special actor of our analysis. So, this function is an explicit supersolution of this. Well, of course, this is not radial, but see that this is symmetric with respect to each variable, non-increasing with respect to each variable, SSNI. And it is L1, it is integrable. Is integrable out of any ball from the origin. Actually, this ball can be replaced by a more suitable anisotropic version of the ball, so anisotropic ball. And by making a suitable truncture, by truncating suitably this upper barrier, this actually will be the barrier of our profile. What it's possible to see in the dark. It's possible to see, and that I'm going to show you in a moment. Is that the profile of the self-similar solution will have this space, this decay dictated by the barrier that I showed you in this image? Okay, now I'm going to give you a little bit some information concerning the uniqueness of this. Information concerning the uniqueness of this solution. So, what is possible to prove by using a proper suitable version of the Alexandro refers to principle is that any non-negative similar solution is SSNI, so it's separate symmetric and increasing. This is for. Increasing. This is possible by using this possible to prove it by using the Alexandro Maximum principle. But now I'm going to give you the main point concerning uniqueness. Okay, suppose that you have two similar fundamental solutions with the same mass. Okay? And profiles F1 and F2. Then we introduce this particular functional, which is given by the Functional, which is given by the integral of the positive part of the difference of the resolution, which is a Lyapunov functions in the sense that it's decreasing along time. And this Lyapunov functional because you remember that we have the contraction property. But actually, this functional can be explicited in this form because you have that U1 and Q are similar. So you compute explicitly. So, you compute explicitly this function, and what you actually get is that this function is constant long time. This is given by the integral of the difference of the signal profile. So, the question is to show that this constant C0 is equal to zero. Once you have this, you have that U1 coincides with U2 four times. So, this is the first point. So, this is the first point. The second point is to show that actually it's true. And in order to do this, you have to apply the strong maximum principle, a strong maximum principle argument. You start, you consider these two functions, you star, below, and star above, which in particular the first one starts from the First, one starts from the minimum of these two sepsimilar profiles, and the other starts with the max. And what is quite easy to show that actually U star is the minimum, and the U bar star is the, sorry, this is maximum, it's not minimum. It's a mistake here. And the second point is actually to show that by using strong Max. That by using strong Maximal principle, it is possible to show that this is only possible only if U1 coincides with U2 for all X for a small time T1. By using the strong maximal principle, it is possible to show this, that these two solutions, U one and U two, coincide for all for all for all X at a special time. At a special time t1, and by but this is possible, but this is possible only when this constant here c0 is zero, because this functional here, as I told you, is constant along the evolution. And so this gives you the fact that these two solutions coincide everywhere. So I'm not going to give you any detail concerning this, but it's a very important property which is used. Property which is used in this part is the symmetry that I told you: the symmetry of the solutions, which are separately symmetric non-increasing, which is better than each variable, and the fact that you can actually use the strong maximum principle for quasi-linear parabolic equation. So, this concerns the uniqueness part. So, for the existence, we actually have two properties that we're going to use mostly. The first property is a barrier comparison result. Actually, mainly this property says that if you have an initial datum which is Which is below a certain barrier, which is given by the truncation of the function that I showed you before, then you actually have that the solution is below this barrier for all types. Barrier comparison argument. The second important property is a quantitative positive learmite. Basically, Positive language. Basically, it says that if you start with initial detune, which is SSNI, which is below a suitable barrier, then it's possible to see that the solution V is above a small functions, a small function zeta, which is above a certain constant is ball more. So you have that this. So you have that this quantity positive lemma in particular gives you that the solution is positive for all times in a small ball. So how much time do I have? Sorry. Is it just 10 to 15 minutes? 10 to 15 minutes. Okay. Okay, 10 minutes. Okay. So the issue concerns that sort of the the issue concerning the so the the the the the proof uh which is uh which gives you actually the existence of solution is based is based on on a fixed point a shadow fixed point argument and it is uh rather involving so I'm going to give you just main steps of this okay so we define for all positive capital L and the suitable barrier capital G L this This set here, which is given by L1 and infinity non-negative densities, which are SSNI, with unit mass. Why do we choose this unit mass? I didn't say you that, but you always can reduce unit mass by proper scaling. Scaling transformation. There are scaling transformations also for this kind of anisotropy that we're going to address. That we're going to decrease at the earlier star. So you can reduce to the total unit mass. This function phi must be below this constant L and must be below the barrier capital G Al. Then for all phi in this set, we consider the solution of the scale equation starting from phi at time tau equals. phi at time tau equals to zero and uh and and we said s capital s of h of phi is uh is where so actually the capital s capital s h is the semi-group map semi-group map related corresponding to the to the to the risk equation so the main point is to to show that uh that the map SH starting from Canvas starting from L1 and L1 is satisfied as a fixed point. So the first fact is to show that you go from K and you write to K. So the first So the first property is exactly this. If you start from any H positive H, you find a corresponding positive constant H dependent on H, such that the image of K through the semi-group map is contained in the K of L. So you start from K and you arrive to K. From K and you arrive to K. And you also have this positive bounds, which is really important, telling you that actually the solution corresponding to each age is a ball to a certain fixed function depending on an age. The fact that you have this inclusion is basically due to the fact that the query comparison that I told. To the barrier comparison that I told you before. If you start from a future of organizational data which is below a certain variance, you have the same property for all types. Once you have this, it is possible to use by Reese for Fischer-Common-Gorff theorem that the image of this set is relatively compact in L1, then you can use shadow-fixed point theorem. Point theorem. Of course, this set, I didn't send you that, but this set is also closed, it's convex, so that you can use a fixed point argument, you can shout the fixed-point theorem, telling you that there exists that phi has to be non-negative. We assume all the time non-negative. Yeah, that's the case. Yes, L1 and yes, L1 positive, yes. L1 positive, yes, and on the positive corner L1, yes. So you have that actually for N for NH, for these properties that I told you, that it's possible to see that this map has a fixed point, at least a fixed point. Not saying that it's units, it's a fixed point. Then you get for any age the orbit starting from any file. From any phi of H, and you call this orbit capital B of H. Okay, and using the semi-group property, what you actually get is that distribution is periodic. Okay, you have the periodicity satisfied by the orbit starting at I equals zero from phi h. Phi h is a fixed point of the. Is a fixed point of the map, or the map of the semiconductor. And the last point is to show that actually these periodic orbits are actually stationary in time. And this can be done by using arguments that are a little bit pretty similar to the one that I showed you before by using strong maximum pre- By using strong maximum principal arguments. And so, mass difference analysis plus strong maximum principal argument gives you this important information that for any of these periodic orbits must be stationary. And actually, the frame is absolutely clear. So, we solved the issue concerning the existence and uniqueness of the simulation. Of sesiminal profile. Then, if you want to go back to the original sesiminal solution, you make this substitution here. You can pass from a unit mass to any mass by special self-similar transformation, a special transformation, mass transformation. And you have that for any mass, for any mass, you have the You have a certain profile, and the self-similar profile is given by this. So, the good question is concluded. Just a little bit more information concerning the qualitative property of the profile. We have this very important result. It is concerning the positivity. It's not revealed at all. So, is it possible to see that? So, is it possible to see that the profile is always positive? And of course, this is true in the classical isotropic case for the vast diffusion. You have the positivity, uniform positivity of the variable profile of the similar solution. It's really important to study this false aspect, and that's what we did. It's possible to show that actually the sub-seminal fundamental. Show that actually the subsequent fundamental solution is strictly positive for any x, for any time. And we were able also to give some information concerning the regularity. Regularity of the self-similar profile. Actually, the self-similar profile is infinity, positive function, and also it satisfies these lower estimates in the sharper form. So you also. So, you also have an upper estimate, but also this estimate from below, which gives you an asymptotic behavior of this solution when y goes to infinity. By using this very important property of the sepsimilar profile, it is possible to use that any solution to the Cauchy problem is positive. So we have So we have a union infinite propagation of positivity. This is quite involved proof, but actually it is based on comparing the solution with the fundamental solution that we know that the fundamental solution is always positive. And it's quite delicate the argument related to comparison principle. Related to the comparison principle in cylinders. So it's quite delicate, it's quite, I mean, it's quite technical, but I'm not going to give you any glimpse of the proof of cylinders. So we have that also, also any solution starting from any non-negative initial data is strictly positive in time, space-time. And what else? Asymptotic behavior. what else asymptotic behavior just uh just uh just the statement of the just the statement of the main result of course so of course we guess that uh that the subsequent fundamental solutions that we did that we recovered that we obtained are the uh the is actually the main and the main candidate to be the attractor of solution of the evolution uh so whatever what the actual So what what actually we're able to we were able to so to get is the asymptotic behavior. You you have that under the condition the condition that I showed before in the false diffusion case, if capital U M is the unit subsignal fundamental solution with the same mass of the initial data, then we get this asymptotic result. You get the solution converts to the self-signal one. The sets in the L1 in the L1 norm. And by an interpolation, you can also get this convergence in the grid grade with respect to any norm. And for some condition of the initial data, it's possible it's possible also to write a uniform convergence. In particular, if you start from compactly supported initial data, it's possible also to arrive to uniform convergence. So, numerical studies, just two images concerning these two plots, numerical studies, and Felix Teisso helped us with this, also with these simulations. You see that if you start, this is pretty clear. If you start from a radially decreasing initial data, then the evolution of the solution is in this form. You have this elongation. You have this elongated profile starting from time two, four, h, you see that's the profile elongated and elongated from time as time pass. This is from the radio decreasing initial data. This is from starting from a square. You see, that's the appearance, the experience of this elongated profile, kind of ellipsoid profile. We don't know actually if there are a real episode. If they're a real ellipsoid or not, but they look like. Then just a few words, not going to torture more for that. The second they said the last part concerned the difference. You saw the anosotrip is for you. So you have the, we studied the, we studied the Studied the equation which is corresponding to the anisotropic equation for the porous medium. Now I'm going to give you just a little bit more information concerning this equation here, which are the anisotropic, the anisotropic version of the evolution filablation. Let's say in this way. And for in particular, for all people. And for in particular for all where all the exponents are are equal to p, you get this uh you get this operator here, which is not the pilaplacian, but is orthotropic laplacian. It's pretty different, much more than generated in the pilaplacian. They're very different. And of course, if you if all the exponents are equal to 2, you get the classical equations. There are much literature that I'm there are many a lot of papers concerning concerning the study of this uh this equation which is uh uh which can be collected in many many papers but this list is is really far from being uh we were we were able to to to get uh information for also for this model uh and you see that here you have uh you have the the the in the in In the first model, you have the generation for u, you have the generation for the gradient of u, in particular, the singular graph. So in this case, we consider that p-bar with p-bar is larger than this exponent, which gives you characterize the existence of solution for the P-Laplacian case. And in this frame, And in this framework, is p bar is such that this I didn't tell you, but this is the inverse average must be larger than F C P C. So many things concerning the existence of self-similar solutions can also be done for this framework, in this framework, in this context. And this is resumed in also in this paper of Also, in this paper, obtain the collaboration with Luis at Ilome. Yeah, I mean, there are this just, yeah, just a glimpse. In this case, you have that in particular for the orthotropic case, you have the explicit form of the fundamental solution, the explicit form of the profile, differently from the PolarScript for the first division case. Okay, just I'm going to finish here. There are many, many open questions concerning these models. Let me just comment a few of them. We don't know anything concerning the mixed cases. They're very still open. What happens when the average of M is less than the critical exponent? Can we also accept powers? Can we also accept powers, negative powers? Existence of explicit solutions. I told you that in the Kelopi-Laplacian case, there are, but in the fast diffusion case, and so fast diffusion case, not. Problems in bounded domains, they were not studied. Yeah, I mean, this is a question, and maybe Shamu would be interested in also Nikita and Matel. Yeah, the study on anisotropic Galiatonium is enzopolis. Anisotropic Galliatonium is El Sobolev inequality connected with the flow. We don't know anything. This is for the anisotropic equation of corrosive medium type for the anisotropic P-Laplacian equations. Yeah, we still don't know how to close the case Pi less than Q because we actually were able to get the asymptotics were in the orthotropic case, where though the exponentary was. Case where all the exponents are equal to P. Uniqueness of fundamental solution. And there are some issues which are similar to the porous medium case. And also in this context, analyzing the case when E, Y, PI is larger than Q and mixed pieces. And yeah, I mean, now it's time to stop. Thank you very much for it. Thank you. So there is time just for question or quick. Then we go to lunch. You are responsible. Okay, so just a short question. Did you try to linearize the distribution of very curve around your L Continent and get some spectral information? Because you have the variance system. because you have invariants in the original equation like translation invariance in space and also translation invariance in time so that should be responsible for the lowest even if you don't know the components we didn't we didn't try anything in that direction that would be a good response but yeah it's very interesting yeah this is something that This is something that may be interesting for the people in these organizations: that in these forest region case, we didn't find any way of putting inside the vast security. But we don't know how to we it should be some sales function, right? There's no way of putting passes there into something that looks very plastic. This is very accurate. In the case of the P Laplace function case, when P is all the same, you should have R tension P, right? Yeah, yes. Yes, yes, for the case, yes. And even the energy of energy. Very quickly, what do you expect with the poor screen range? Where all these components are larger than one? That's very complicated. Yeah, I mean, it's larger than that. Well, you saw that question is related to the existence of the barriers. This is barrier. The barriers are computed on. Variants are computed only in the past diffusion regime. I mean, that would be, yeah, you have the yes, you can guess that there are appearance of something because in each direction you travel, oh yeah, this is yes. And this is what you learn when you do scaling. That's what the barrier does say. The scaling is something that is already there, waiting for scaling. So it's scaling, it goes to different speeds. If there is a solution, it has to have the scaling. The only way to avoid the scaling is not capital. Yeah, but under the point. Under the point of view of existence of fixed point argument, it's obviously I mean, once you get a barrier, then the proof works. Yeah. There are many questions. But there are many questions because this is not a type of variation with the EST of the case that has been much studied. So we took it and everybody to think what can I use your remotely within this. I think it's time to stop the question and go for light. Or then, if you don't know what you are doing. So, I just want to remind you that there's a social dinner for Wednesday at 8:30, okay? And that this program cannot cover the social activities, so it's 35 euros per person. If you want to attend, so if you can pay that tomorrow morning, there will be a new account, okay? So, she will collect the money. You can pay her the cash tomorrow morning.   I don't think it's possible to have a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
