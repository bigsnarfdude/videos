We have Mitchu Sapchuk from the University of South Florida to speak about looks of isometries and dilations. Thank you. First of all, thank you very much, the organizers, for this wonderful event. It's a big pleasure and as always, it's really nice to be here. And I just wanted to comment that I really enjoy this format. So thank you. So, thank you. So, I'm going to talk about something which is maybe a little bit not quite directly related to Spectra, but there might be some questions which at the end of the talk maybe I'll mention. But the groups that I will be talking about are related to multiple examples that people study in terms of these special questions. Okay, so let me start. I decided to kind of Compress introduction a little bit because we've been talking many thoughts about that. So, just to set up notations. So, we'll start with just regular rooted tree, which is parameterized by finite words over some finite element x. Okay, so just in a standard way, and so we consider graph automorphisms or endomorphisms in general of this tree, and of course, the group of all these automorphisms contains all these all similar groups. All these are similar groups like Rigorchia group, Basilica, and Plytor, etc. So, those groups that have been discussed many times here before. Okay, so I would like to approach this from just a little bit different perspective. Of course, you could start from defining groups acting on rooted trees, say by automata or by some other ways. Alternatively, you could put some algebraic structure either on the tree or on the boundary of the tree, and then you can consider various transformations of those algebraic structures. Various transformations of those algebraic structures and see if those transformations define some automorphisms or endomorphisms of the group. And there are multiple ways to put algebraic structure, say, on the tree or on the boundary of the tree. So you could talk about formal power series, you could talk about infinitesimal vectors over Z D, you could talk about, for example, here we're going to be talking basically about the ring of About the ring of p-adic integers or p-adic integers in more general settings. So we start with identifying the nth level of the tree, which is labeled by these finite words, with elements of z mod d to the n z, just in the canonical way. And then once you do that, of course, the boundary of this tree that consists of all the infinite paths from the root of the tree to infinity, right? So then it will be identified naturally with infinity. Will be identified naturally with infinite sums like that, which is naturally defined with the ring of de-adic integers, which we denote by Zt. So, of course, in most cases, people just consider Zp the ring of de-adic integers because the ring of the field of fractions of that ring is the field Qp. So, but in general, we don't need to restrict ourselves to prime p, but in many examples we actually will. Okay, so now this station is the following. So now the station is the following. First, each endomorphism of the tree will induce some transformation of the boundary. And some transformations of the boundary, so now boundary is viewed as the ring of the addict integers, will induce endomorphisms of the tree. So there might be some that do not induce endomorphisms, but there will be some that will induce endomorphisms. And so just what I was saying. Second. Okay. So that if we endow this boundary with algebraic structure of the C D of the addict integers, then we already get quite interesting end and automorphism of the tree itself. So let me start with this proposition by Anashin in 2012. It's quite similar proposition, but it relates Simpler proposition, but it relates what we want to piec analysis. So he proved that transformation from Zd to Zd defines endomorphism of the tree if this transformation is one ligit with respect to the de-adic norm on Zd. So, and one of the first examples, of course, you could just start with polynomials. So, polynomials with integer coefficients. And those polynomials, it's really easy to see that they It proved easy to see that they induce one loop just maps from Z D to Z D, where it could be map is just by evaluation. You have a polynomial with integer coefficients, you just plug in the addict number, evaluate this polynomial, add this the addict number, get another de-addict number, that's the addition. And so polynomials are one-lipschitz, and that's why they are defined they define endomorphisms of the three. And now the question is, how do we describe those endomorphisms? Describe those endomorphisms, say, for example, in terms of automata or in terms of cell similar action. And that was done in my work with my students in 2020. So basically, if you start with any polynomial with integer coefficients, then we completely can describe the structure corresponding endomorphism induced on the tree x star by essentially explaining what are the sections. Essentially, explaining what are the sections. So, if you have every polynomial, we'll induce this endomorphism which we denote by pi f. And then the section of pi f at point x0 is also a polynomial. The formula is also quite simple derived from Taylor expansion of the polynomial. And the polynomial will be of the same degree. So here's an example, for example, if you start with a polynomial like that, then the sections will be corresponding polynomials like this. Would be corresponding polynomials like this. And then, so once you have that, you could do some calculations. You could, for example, check one finite state, polynomial is linear. And so you also get some other approaches how to prove theorems about ergodicity of the action of polynomials on the set of p-adic integers, which were proved earlier also by Larin. We are also by Larry. And so basically, that's kind of a nice condition on the coefficients. So you start from a polynomial with integer coefficients, and that polynomial will be, so you assume that it's a permutational polynomial. So that means that on every level of the tree, it induces a permutation. Or level of the tree is identified again with Z mod D to the N, Z. So we have a permutation on Z mod D to the N, Z. Z mod d to the n C. So then this action is level transitive, if only if these conditions for the polynomial coefficients are satisfied. So that was proved using the addict analysis. So here we prove that using the techniques of group action trees. Okay, so that's right now I'm just talking about the rotid tree and the action V boundary of the rotid trees. So here's the question. So what if we want to go V Question: So, what if we want to go beyond the ring of paid integers to, say, for example, the field of p-adic integers? Can we somehow get the groups acting on, say, as isometries on QP? And how can we characterize them in terms of three atoms? Okay, so that's the picture. So, similar pictures have been studied already by many authors, and I'll mention that on the next slide. So, well, here's the idea. The idea. So here's the rooted tree. So this large red vertex is the root of the rooted tree. That's the same tree that we looked before. And the boundary of this rooted tree is just the ZPE, which is the ring of PI integers. Then you can extend this tree to this infinite tree, which goes infinite in both directions, both down and up. And out, right? It's just as a graph, it's going to be just a p plus one regular tree. And then if you fix one of the ends of this tree, then you could define the boundary of this, well, so this is a p plus one regular tree, p plus one regular tree has a natural boundary. And if you select one of the ends, maybe. Namely, this end here, right? Then you could consider a so-called punctured boundary consisting of all points of the boundary of the regular tree minus this end. So then you could identify the field of p-adic numbers with this functored boundary. So you could think of that just as a regular P plus one RA3 with one end fixed, and then the function boundary will consist of geodesics that come from this fixed end to whole. Fixed end to all other ends. So then you're going to get this field of field of paiadic numbers. And of course, there's clear identification. So the geodesics that go through the root of the rooted tree will correspond to those p-adic integers, that starts with a dot. But if you turn away from this end, which we call the spine, End, which we call this spine, to the right before you reach the rooted tree, right? You just have to start introducing digits before the dot in the p-iadic expansion of a number. All right, so here is the ring of p-adic integers, and here is the field of p-adic numbers. So the next theorem, so it's kind of faucler type, but we haven't seen that exactly. Focular type, but we haven't seen that exactly in this form, and it also has extensions. So it's basically extended observation, I would say. So the first item tells that the isomorphism, sorry, group of isometries of the ring of p-adic integers will be just isomorphic to the group of all automorphisms of the p-adic rooted tree. So this is just what we have seen over here. So, this is just what we have seen over here. So, every isometry of Zp will correspond just to automorphism of this tree. So, this isometric for the spectrometer metric. Yeah, yeah. So, just when you consider Zp as a metric space with respect to p-adic metric. And the next two items are just slightly more involved. So, first of all, we could describe in a similar way the isometries of the field of p-addic numbers of the quick field, and the dilations of the field of. And the dilations of the fibropiadic numbers. And then we relate these groups with some other groups which were studied before. Okay, so what are the isometries? The isometries will correspond to the group of all automorphisms of the P plus 1 regular tree, the one, the big tree. So I'll just refer them to the small tree, which is a rooted tree, and the big tree as the unrooted tree. Okay? So that eventually preserves the vertices of an end, right? Of an end, right? Of a fixed end omega. So, what does it mean? We just take this tree and we say that we consider all automorphisms that starting from some point will preserve the vertices along this path. So, in particular, that means that we cannot shift things vertical. So, that will be the group of isometries of QP, and we will study using the automorphisms of the graph. But the larger group is this one here. This one here. So, this is just a group of all automorphisms of TP plus one, of the regular P plus one tree, that preserve an end. So, in this group, we're allowed to shift things vertically, right? And that is the group that have been studied before. And we identified this group with the group of dilations. So, basically, what happens if you have an automorphism of this tree that preserves the levels of going to be isometry, but different Levels that's going to be isometry, but if you shift all the vertices up, for example, by one level, that means that all the distances will be multiplied by P or divided by P. Right, so this is just a group of dilations of, if you will, the idea numbers. Okay, so that's kind of the main observation, starting point. And so, a little bit of history. So, these groups were studied before, of course, as I said, just under different names. So, for example, Different names. For example, they were studied by Kartra-Kamanovich and Was under the names of affine and horocyclic groups of the rooted tree and not of unrooted tree. So they were considered, they were shown to be just the group of Busiman isometries in the paper by Bartholdi, Nunhauser, and Wasse. And so we can formulate the extension of this theorem. So Qp is just Qp is just one example of local field, of a local field. So you could just state more or less similar statement for any local field if you identified the local field with the boundary corresponding cert tree on which affine groups of this field act, then you're going to get exactly the same results. So in a sense, this QP is just one of the examples of the more general statement, but talking about local fields, of course, we'll Talking about local fields, of course, will involve much more terminology, and the result doesn't change much since we stick to Q. All right. So now the question is, so now we have this larger tree. So what interesting groups live in this larger tree? What interesting group act on this larger tree? Right, so of course you could just take the group acting on the rooted tree and then extend the tree value, but that's not the most interesting way. So we want to get some Most interesting away, so we want to get some more interest in action, like, for example, actions which are transitive on the set of curves. And so, that will be related to so-called scale groups studied by Willis. I will talk about that at the end. So, basically, I want to cook up some new examples. And we derive, we define a class of self-similar groups that are extendable, whose actions are extendable to. Whose actions are extendable to the actions on this big tree in such a way that the action will be transitive on the set of vertices. So, for that, let me just remind, so that if you have just a group acting on the rooted tree, right, so then there is, of course, if you have some group G acting on the rooted tree, then there is a map of pi pi from the stabilizer of some vertex to G. Vertex to G, where you take this element G and take the section of G at this vertex. So that will be just the projection. So the class that we define, we call it liftable groups, and because of the clear reason. So let's see, let's look at that definition for a second. So a cell similar group acting on a rooted tree TD is called liftable if there exists some vertex of the first level. Vertex of the first level, and there exists a monomorphism from G to the stabilizer of this vertex. So, this sigma over here, well, that is the right inverse of the corresponding projection map. So, if you take g, apply this sigma to get sigma of g, you get an element of the stabilizer at the first level in general. Yeah, that should be actually one. So we want to have stabilizer at the first level. Even though this definition is also correct. Such that if you apply sigma and then you apply projection back, you're going to get back to G. But that's one condition that we want. We also want extra condition that if you apply sigma and then you apply all other projections, you're going to get the identities. So that's so. So, I'm sorry, so I'm just confusing here a little bit. You don't get identities. You get identities if you start from a word which is equal to the identity over here. So, basically, that just, I gave these identities here to emphasize that this sigma of g will be endomorphism. So, in many cases, like Renurgi group, for example, or some other groups, there are substitutions that are G to sigma of G. In some cases, those substitutions are. In some cases, those substitutions are endomorphisms, in some cases, they're not endomorphisms. So, if this is endomorphism, then we can actually produce the action of H and extension of the original group on this big tree. Like we state in the next theorem. Was the math calogy there, the group of automorphisms of the large tree? Once again, please? Well, this math calogy in the previous slide with a stabilizer was this a group of automorphisms of this large tree. A group of automorphisms of this large tree. We have two different genes. Right, so yeah, this is just a typo, so that should be this geno. Oh, okay. Sorry. Yeah, so we start from a group action on the rooted tree and we construct the action on the big tree. But not of the group, but of its kitchen and extension. Okay, so the theorem is the following. So if you have a liftable group, right, that acts on rooted tree, and then sigma is the corresponding lifting. Is the corresponding lifting, this endomorphism. Then you could construct the H and extension, extending H and an extension of G, which we call G tilt. You have stable letter T, and then you just Tx by conjugation just according to this endomorphism C. So that will be extended and extension, and then this group will embed into the group of automorphisms of the big tree. And moreover, there will be transitivity automorphisms. And moreover, there will be transitivity. I'll talk about that a little bit later. So, and in particular, when you have that V is a prime number, then you have an embedded in the group of dilations of QP. So, that means that the groups of dilations of Qv sometimes are quite interesting. Okay, so that's the theorem. The question is what kind of examples we can produce. So, when do we have this sigma and so under which condition you can prove that this sigma is an endomorphism? That this sigma is an endomorphism. And that is by itself sometimes a non-trivial task to get that this sigma exists and that the sigma is endomorphism. Okay, just a couple of things about the proof of this theorem. So you want to embed the H and N extension, right? H and extension is generated by G and T, so you have to embed elements of G and you have to embed T. So elements of G are embedded in the following way. Take G and you put the action Take G, and you put the action of G on this sub-tree, in this big tree, and then you use sigma to construct the actions of this image on the sub-trees hanging down from the vertices that go up. So it will act as sigma of G here, sigma squared of G here, and so on. And then the T, the stable letter, will just act by vertical translation along this spot, along this path. That's the idea. That's the idea of the proof, right? Now, about examples. So, there are several classes of examples, and we start from the class of groups called essentially, the class of groups that act essentially freely on the boundary of the tree. Sometimes it's quite hard to prove that the group acts essentially freely, but once you have it, then you get liftable. So, what does it mean essentially free? So, if you have So, if you have an action of a group on a measure space, then this action is essentially free if the measure of a set of points in your space that have non-trivial stabilizers is equal to zero. Most of the point stabilizers are free. And of course, the group is self-replicating if these projection maps are on top. So, this is also a very wide class of self-similar groups. And so, this requires And so this requires that this is true for all V. For liftability, you don't have to have all V, it's just enough to have one V. But right, so if you have self-lift replicating group, you definitely can try to construct the solutions. Okay, so and the result here is that if you have the group G that acts on the boundary essentially freely and be self-replicated, then it's liftable. So that's one of the sources of this constraint. Sources of these constructions? With respect to which measure? Just under Bernoulli measure. Okay, so just one example, one blecher group. So these groups which act essentially, sometimes they're quite hard to construct. There is a Lumleiter group, there are on-slaxoliter groups, some virtually appealing groups, there are some virtually free groups. Virtually free groups. And the point here is that if you know that the action is essentially free, that means that if you take the identity, take any element, right, if you take any element and lift it up, then there will be only one way to push it down to the other. So that's why you essentially get this liftability quite simple. So that's a specific example. So you have Lawleture group generated by two-state automaton, and that's your sigma. And then, so this is an H and an extension of Lawiter that embeds in the group of dilations of Q2. So that's Lampleiter. The next class of examples is GGS groups. So this is the general. So this is the generalization of Ghorchuk and the Sivki groups that has been studied probably since the late 1990s. The generalization is the following. So if you have a vector from Z mod D C to D minus 1, so then you define the risk recursion as follows. A will be just the long cycle to permute the vertices of the first level according to the long cycle. And then B will be expressed as follows. And then B will be expressed as follows. You just have some powers of A according to this vector that you have chosen. And then again, B itself. So that extends, as I said, second Krigorchi group, which you defined in the original paper, Guptasiti group, Kupta-Krikowski groups. For prime D, those groups are periodic, they are regularly branched and not finally presented. And so there was quite a lot of studies of these groups quite recently. Studies of these groups quite recently by multiple people. So recently, that's Gustavo Fernandez Alcovar, Mariel Loronoce, and Alejandra Carrida. I think I added her, but probably not here. Partholdi, Pervova, Wolfkiwski, and others. So basically, most of the study right now about these groups is about Hausdorff dimension, how big are the portions by stabilizers, and about various branches properties of them. And devotes various branches properties of these groups. And so, what we prove is that, yeah, and so here, even though it's proved that they're not widely presented, for most of these groups we don't have the L presentation. So, we don't have the sigma, which is endomorphism just by default. But there's no need to have L presentation. We still can prove that those groups are elliptical, and that's what we did specifically for the case when P is prime. And this vector has the property that And this vector has the property that there exists some j such that ej is non-zero, but the symmetric entry, p minus j is when you have zero and non-zero, or non-zero and zero, then you could produce such a limit. Okay, so now for the Grigorche group itself, that was actually the original motivating example. If you take the first Grigorche group, right, with these portraits, then Lisernak in 1985 considered. Then Lisernak in 1985 constructed this famous L presentation for finite L presentation based on the substitution sigma, which is called usually Lisonic substitution. And then, of course, this sigma is the right inverse of the projection map, and it is injective entomorphism, so that's why G is liftable. So the question is: how do we describe this action on the big tree? That's also what we have computed. So that's We have computed. So that's the HNN extension of this group has been studied actually by Gruyporczyk in 1998. And so that's exactly the same HNN extension that we work with. And back in 1998, again, that was the motivating example for all of the study. So Grivorshi proved that the group is finitely presented, aminabil, aminabil group of intermediate growth. And there was a very recent result by Tatiana student, Carrintel Padar, who proved that the group Who proved that the group does not have rational cross-sections, in other words, doesn't have regular normal form. And Dima, yes. Go back to Ethereum and the cross-intermediate growth, because this group has exponential growth. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yeah, that was my mistake. So that original group has intermediate rows, but this H and extension has exponential growth still examining the process. I mistake. Okay, so now how. Okay, so now how the embedding looks like. So we just explicitly computed what is sigma of the generators, sigma squared of generators, and so on. For ABC, that's easy. Basically, for B, it's periodic down, and we just extend this periodic scale. So we have this sequence, switch, switch, non-switch, switch, switch, non-switch, but now it's just both in both directions. So that's A, B, and C. And that's B, C, and D. And the action of A is computed explicitly. So you just explicitly show that there will be also this sequence, periodic sequence of 1AA, 1AA going up. So that's a specific action of this group. And let me just finish just one or two more minutes about the scale groups. So there is a connection of these groups to scale groups which Groups, which are just closed subgroups of the group of isometries of the regular tree, that fix an end of this tree and act vertex transit. So basically, you just take this group of atomorphisms of the big tree, preserve the root, and you just consider closed subgroups in here, in that group, that are transitive. Those are called scale groups. And so that is an important subclass of total disconnected locally compact groups. So we'll discuss. Uh so Louis has some uh kind of uh idea that they are connecting self-replicating groups acting on rooted trees and elements of the connect local compact groups having positive scale. And so, what we prove is that if you start with a liftable group that acts transitive on the first level, most of groups have that property, then the Then, the correspondent H and N extension that we construct, it will act transitively on the set of vertices of this big tree, and its closure will be a scale group. So that's a new source of examples for scale groups. And for conversion groups specifically, we proved even more. We proved that if you take the conversion group, take each an extension, and then take the closure, well, this. Well, forget about this data for a moment, so just the closure of the H and extension of the Groga group. It will be a scalar group that will additionally act to transit on the punctured boundary. So that's quite a strong condition. All right, so that's probably time to stop. So thank you very much. Any questions? Any questions? What's the geometric interpretation of these two transitivity properties? That's a good question. So what do you mean by geometric interpretation? I mean, I can tell you how you get it, right? So basically, you get by analyzing the structure of the orbits of the original cryptography and then combining these orbit structures. Orbit structure with the action of the vertical shift T that you get. No, I mean generally one can consider, say, cut minus one space and then well this condition can be formulated. You fix the point with infinity and then we look at groups uh which act different each other on the uh function boundary. So uh what are these groups? I don't know. So that's a good question, yeah. I don't know. That's a good question. Yeah. So if there are some other groups, groups like that which somehow naturally act, yeah. So that's people working candidates or locally contact connected groups, like grapplers, and so they're interested in good transitivity of the action on an unrooted tree. For them it's a big point. And so we have slightly weaker transitivity, but completely different. Completely different type of sounds. Thank you. Now, the question is: can we add some extra element to this group to get complete to transitivity but still keeping this self-application properties scaling and so on? That's what Willis was interested originally about the two-transitive action of the boundary of a group that acts on the tree without fixed nerve. So, of course, our examples will not be like that, but you could. Our examples will not be like that, but the question is like what I was saying. Can we add something to get the country example for Willis? My question is about the steps. So you mentioned that SAR generalized the idea by local fields. So does it make sense to do instead of QP, like find extension of QP? You could do fine extension of QP, you could do finite closures of the closures, for example, finite extension. Of the closures, for example, finite extensions of the field of rational functions. So you can mean CP as well? CP probably that's probably that's not a good example, I think. So at least those examples that I've seen were coming either from fields of rational functions or from QP. And yeah, my last step was the Verdovich space, but it's here stopping CB. I'm gonna ask what. You need kind of non-Archimedean fields for this kind of field. So you start from non-Archimedean local fields. Yep, maybe I have to add it. So you start from non-Archimedean local fields. So then you get the proper action of affine groups on these fields on the search route. Thank you very much. I just forgot that. Discussion over the coffee pack, so we assume at 10:45. Thank you again for that. I think the breakfast was read, but we serve tweets, right? I don't know if you mentioned that. You want to go back to any kind of To go to any kind of otherwise things or whatever.
