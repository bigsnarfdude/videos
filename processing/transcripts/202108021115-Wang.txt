Thank you for the introduction and thank you for inviting me for talking in this conference. So in this talk, I'm going to talk about the geographic space and as you can see the title distribution ultron. So I will explain what that means. So this talk is based on This talk is based on an observation I had recently, and I know we are supposed to talk about other people's work, so I think it should be fine if we are just like try talk about the classical stuff and try to reinterpret. And so, in this talk, I'm mostly going to give this observation and try to reinterpret. And try to reinterpret and maybe adding to some analytical aspects of the jury option space and also ask some questions. So I hope you enjoy the talk. If you do not, please don't let me know. So let's start. So before going into the details, let me confess that I'm mostly working, I'm a very community. Working, I'm a very commutative and analytic person. So, like before, like recently, I have been mostly working on Bergman space and Hardy space, those classical analytic function spaces. So, like, I only start with seriously looking at the durable space recently. So, these are the references I have read in depth. So, if you are expert. Depth. So, if you are an expert, you know where I'm standing. If you are a beginner, so here are some very good papers that I recommend you to read. So, the first two are survey papers. So, the first is by Or Shave. He has just speaked before. So, this is a survey paper about dual action space. I think it's very well written, so it's a very good source of references. References and the second one is by Tuen Leifen and Simbo Xia. So it's also a survey paper, but it's more on the analytic aspects, like treating the dual upper space as an analytic function space and also like as piece of sogliff space. And third, of course, Alferson paper. So this is the beginning of the story. So I guess it's mostly. This is the mostly referenced paper if you are talking about the dual option space. And the third, fourth and fifth, they are mostly treating the dual action space as a piece of software space, piece of software space. It's like more only an analytic set. And I found the And I found these two papers very helpful. And this one is a very particularly hard one. So it took me several days to just understand the result of it. But it's a very good paper. So first, as like I said in the beginning, so it's based on observation. So let's start from the basic. So let's start from the basic of the basic. So what's an inner product? So inner product, when we learn about functional analysis, we define inner product as a set-script linear form. It has these properties and then you define the inner product space and then you define the norm and then you complete it. You have the Hilbert space. So it's a basic stuff. And after we learn about the Hilbert spaces, The Qilbert spaces, then I guess the first important example we get is an L2 space of a positive measure. And the inner product is just defined like integrating FG bar d mu. So it's very elementary stuff. And actually, like the property C, so X equals zero if and only if X equals zero. So this one, that's temporary, not to worry about the Let's temporarily not worry about it because we can all always mod out the kernel and get the Hilbert space. So I had this thought, I guess, about one or two months ago, and I started realizing, so measure is just a special case of a distribution. So let me first of all call what is a distribution. So that's when we learn about So that's when we learn about the fresh space, like TVS. And then you learn there's a so-called test function. And they are basically compactly supported smooth functions. And the topology is defined by a bunch of norms, just not just one norm, like partial derivative, like taking supreme on compact sets. So, and the dual space is called distribution. And the dual space is called distribution. And we also learned some examples of distribution for more, like the most classical examples, locally integrable functions, measure, and also the good thing is you can take derivative of these things, like derivative of a measure, derivative of a non-smooth function. So then comes the observation. So then comes the observation. So, like, if you look at the L2 measure space, then the inner product is defined by like integrating Fg bar, d mu. But that's the reason is we are looking at all functions, all test functions. And the only way you can define an inner product by taking like a distribution of Like a distribution applied to phi absolute value square is that you need to be a positive measure. That's the only possibility. But now we are looking at analytic function spaces. So the question comes: so if you have a distribution and you want it to apply to like phi norm squared to be positive, a non-active. Positive, non-negative, and but you like phi to be just maybe polynomials, then you get more than a positive measure. So, so what does that mean? That means, so this condition here guarantees like sesquilinear and this and this. So, let's forget about C. So, this condition guarantees all that. So, that means if you get the distribution. You get a distribution, you can define an inner product, and with that inner product, you can define like maybe a Hilbert space. So, if you look at analytic function spaces, there are like a wider category of inner product you can define this way. So, that's what I mean by L2 norm defined by a distribution or just for short distribution L2 norm. Distribution out norm. So if you get a distribution in that category, you can just define the Hilbert norm by applying that distribution to f absolute value square. Or you can just like intuitively write this way, like make it more like the classical spaces. And naturally, the inner product will be defined this way. Be defined this way, like you apply to FGR. And so, so, like, there are more things like distributions other than positive measures that give us Hilbert spaces of analytic functions. So, the next, so then I get really excited. I think I find a whole big class. I think I find a whole big class of analytic function spaces. And then I get maybe a little disappointed because I started to doubting like, are we reinventing a wheel or not? So is there anything really new or not? So these are like first, so it turns out we have already seen such kind of things. We just call it in a different way. Different way. So, for example, because of possible F norm square, F absolute value square, if F is analytic, it has the maximum property. So, if you take the like constant function and put a hole in the center, or like put some negative weight in the center, it's still still going to be. It's still going to be the Bergman norm. So that's the first hint. Like U is not a positive measure, it's a partially positive, partially negative measure. And even like, I think it's a weird thing, like if you chop up the radius r zero to one, like, and then put like positive, negative, positive, negative weights, it could make if you choose the weights. You choose the ways carefully, it should still give you some positive norms. So that's like, I think it's just weird enough to be interesting. And the second hint is the Laplacian. So if you take Laplacian plus the point mass at zero, and you can see like if you apply, so this distribution applied to f, absolute value squared just means this. Just means this, this integral. And then because f is analytic, the Laplacian of F absolute value is just the gradient, like a complex gradient, take absolute value and integral. So that's just the Dirichlet space. So Dirichlet space is, you can view it as a distribution L2, a norm space. And more generally, there's the so-called results. There's the so-called resolve sobolet spaces. I will come back to this later, but roughly they mean like you take certain derivative of the function and take the weighted L2 norm. So these are the examples. So question, are we there anything new in this observation? So I then started to look at the Turing option space. The term option space. So let me first introduce the dual option space. I believe, like, in the audience, there are a lot of experts in the dual option space, and you must know way more than me. So, if I said something stupid or like if you want to add a comment, please just unmute anytime. So, there are several ways of different. There are several ways of defining the Durial Offset space. The first is, of course, like it has an orthogonal basis. So it's a first, it's a Hilbert space of holomorphic functions. It's on the unit, open unit ball. And one easy way to define it is by its orthogonal basis. So it has an orthogonal basis consisting of monomials. Consisting of monomials. So Z2R for me, so C1, R for 1, Z2, R42, et cetera. And the norm is given by this very natural expression. And the second way of defining the George Opsen space is by reproducing kernels. So we know that if you We know that if you have a reproducing kernel, then it in some way it uniquely defines a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. So this is the reproducing kernel we give and this kernel defines the Julia option space. And the third one is the H2N is field as a symmetric Fox space. And this is exactly the field that's taken. Exactly in the field that's taken in Arsene's paper. So I didn't write anything here. So like you take an Hilbert space, usually like finite dimensional, and so it's E space, and then you direct some with E tensor E and then E tensor E tensor E. So that's the non-symmetric fork space. And then you take the symmetric part of it and it tensor. Of it, and it turns out it has a one-to-one correspondence with the Julia-Aufson space. So these are natural definitions, but they are more or less like from an operator theoretic point of view. So the only more like analytic definition of the Jewish Austin space is by defining By defining it as a so-called B-solve-softlet space. So the B-solve-soft-left space is actually a scale of different spaces. And the H2N is like up to a norm equivalence. It's belong to that square. It's like B one half something. So then, like, so you can prove that if you take a positive integer that's large enough. integer that's large enough, then the dual after norm is equivalent to this norm. So you have a bunch of derivatives at zero and then you have the derivatives norm square and then take weight and this equivalent to the dual offset space. But they are not like these two norms are not equal, they are just equivalent. So that's the So, there's a certain drawback if you do not have exactly equal. So, I want to waste the observation that you can define L2 norms using a distribution on if you restrict to analytic function spaces. So, I want to add another definition from the more like analytic function space. Anematic function space aspect to like the definition of the Jewish Opsen space. So let me start by defining the so-called radio derivative. So R is the radio derivative operator. So I know like in classical analysis, R is used to denote different things. Like it's just the first like Z1 partial Z1 C plus to Z. Plus to Zn partial Zn. That's the classical radial derivative. So here I take also the anti-holomorphic part and I take one half. So this is like exactly like taking derivative in the radial direction. So d sigma is just the normalized surface measure of the sphere. So now I think of sigma as a distribution, a measure distribution. A distribution, a measure distribution. So I can take the derivative of this sigma measure. So I define distribution, it applies to, so since the distribution is supported on the sphere, like compactly supported distribution, it applies to like any C infinity function. So for any C infinity function phi, I take the distribution to be defined this way. So I take Defined this way. So I take this composition of derivative operator. So it's r plus i, then r plus 2i all the way to r plus n minus 1i and then divided by n minus 1 factorial. So it's like the operator theoretic analog of like r plus n minus 1 choose n minus 1. So you apply So you apply this derivative to derivative of greater to phi and then take the surface measure integral. So this is a distribution and in other words it's just a bunch of radial derivatives of the surface measure. So and then you can check directly that the geometry That the Giraffe space is exactly the L2 norm defined by this distribution. And also, so like if your function is supported on, like is well defined in a neighborhood of the boundary, then of course you can just define it this way. And also, but if your function is only defined in inside, you have to take You have to take like our limit just as how you define the hardy norm. So it kind of justifies the name because, like, the Jewel-Altson space is sometimes called the Jewelry-Alsen Hardy space. So it kind of like now it kind of feels right to call it the Hardy space because it's really defined this way. Like, um, so you can, um, yeah, uh, okay, and Okay and you can prove straightforwardly that now the durial option space can be defined this way. So it's the collection of holomorphic functions such that if you like shrink it a little bit and take absolute like take the distribution out to norm and take like take R supreme on only on R's. On R, then it must be bounded. So that's the kind of new definition to the durability norm. So, and the proof is actually straightforward. If you recall what R is, so if you apply R to, let's say, F absolute value square, the partial part only apply to F, the anti-like partial part will. type like partial part will only apply to f bar and and because it's rotation invariant the monomials will always be orthogonal so so you only need to check like zr for z beta bars and if you check it gets you this equation so so like basically from this it's easy to check uh To check if you apply it to polynomials, that's exactly the joy of the norm. And then how do I prove this? You just notice that, so f is a holomorphic function. You can take the graded decomposition of it, and you can prove exactly that this is just. Uh, this is just the square norm sum, like square sum of the like uh rated decomposition norms. And from that, most of like everything follows easily. So you can prove that we check the time, okay. Um uh and uh yeah, that's what I said. Oh, sorry. So I can't see the title. So this is the first application I had. So the thought is like now you have this very function theoretic definition of Jury Offson norm, like some computational skills are able to come. Are able to come in. And then you can do some sort of integration by parts to get like the explicit equation. So if you do like I did the unequals two case, so if you do some integration by part, so basically you putting some smoothness in exchange for like the smoothness for the distribution. The smoothness for the distribution, then you get this equation. So, this is like the Jewish officer norm written in a B soft soblift scale style. So, you have this n is just the traditional radio derivatives. And you can see this is the weight that explicitly defines the during afternoon. And other dimension, you can also do the same. Dimension: You can also do the same thing. This is, I used some results that we have been we just developed recently. So probably we'll make like a release post that like in a month or two. We are working on the last bit. So like so like you can get, I'm not sure like if these equations would be of any use. Would be of any use. It's just nice to have explicit equations. So for the higher ends, you can get the equation, but the weight is not going to look very nice. So also some other, so after this, it will just me asking questions, asking some like crazy questions. Crazy questions. So now, one thing I notice is that the distribution that defines the Julia Arfson Hardy space is supported on the Saphir. So it justifies the Hardy space, the Hardy in the name. So it's like supported on the Saphir. And then I start to think because the Hardy space. Because, like, the Hardy space, there's the severe Hardy space, there's also the unit ball hardy space. And there's a correspondence of these two. If you have a unit ball hardy space, you take the so-called k-limit, you get a function like almost everywhere defined on the boundary, and that's the Saphir Hardy space. The Saphir Hardy space. If you get the Saphir Hardy space, you take either like integral with the reproducing kernel, or if you take the Poisson kernel, then you get the unit Bohardi space. So it's attempting to ask if there's a similar correspondence, if there's maybe there's a Jewish Offson, like boundary version of the Dury-Aufsen space. Of the jury officer space. So I don't know the answer. It's just attempting to ask. And I'm not sure, like comment if the audience will be interested in this kind of question. I personally find it interesting. So yeah, that will go to detail. So that formally defined this derivative operator r plus n minus one, choose n minus one. I'll choose a minus one. This is the derivative operator that I apply to the surface measure to define the new distribution. So now I know that if you are at the boundary point and if your function is holomorphic in a neighborhood, then if you look at the norm, so. So did I write it anywhere? Oh, so if the nu applied to f absolute value square, it's just the like the derivative and the f absolute value and then integral. So in a sense, it's just a bunch like expression on like partial derivative of f in at At this point. So this is the derivative operator applied to f absolute value square at theta. And you can extend it like this derivative operator applied to f times g bar and then at theta. So if you write it out in terms of partial bar for f partial g Partial beta G, it will be a bilinear form on the factor of derivatives. So you can check this bilinear form is at least a Hermitian, but I guess the problem is this Hermitian form is, I think it's not positive definite, but let's not talk about this proper. talk about this pro present so so so you so now you know that the jury after norm is just uh this like chamitian form applied to this factor of derivatives and then take integral so so it's kind of like uh l2 section uh of some trivial bundle uh on the sphere so i i sphere so i i take a like quote in ultrasion just because uh this bilinear form is not an inner product but i'm not sure maybe if we rewrite it some way then it might be just the inner product and maybe we can just identify the durials and space as like some l2 section uh space on on the boundary so i i don't know that if it's like this it will be interesting i think Be interesting, I think. So, so that's my question. I guess so. To summarize, I have the ball version of the dual reference space and for nice functions, the boundary, it defines a boundary section, and the boundary section taking some integral gives the Gives the Dura Opsen norm. So you know that the Dura-Apsen space can be viewed as a completion, at least, as some boundary section space. But can we make this correspondence explicit? So I don't know that question. And the third question I have is I have is the multiplier, the characterization of the multiplier. So recall, the multiplier is just the holomorphic function such that if you multiply it on the Duri-Aufson space, you still get in the Duri-Opsen space. But we know that the multiply algebra of the hard, the Duri-Opsen space is acting very weird. For example, it's probably Sample is probably contained in H infinity space and it doesn't contain the entire ball algebra. That's the holomorphic function that's continuous on the closed unit ball. And also there's a weird result of fun and Xia that tells us you get some functions that are not available. Are not a multiplier, but if you apply it to the normalized reproducing kernel, it's bonded. So there's all kinds of words of behavior of the multiplier. So the only successful characterization of multiplier is by Otga and this author. So the first paper, they prove that. Paper, they prove that the bounded holomorphic function is multiplied if and only if this derived measure is a causal measure for the durials and space. But then comes the question, what is the causal measure for the durial space? Then these three authors give a characterization and And so, a positive measure is a causal measure if and only if it contains it satisfies two conditions. One is called simple condition, one is called the split tree condition, but it's a very complicated condition and it's based on the construction of the so-called Bergman tree structure. So, they sign kind of kind of like chop up the unit ball into small pieces and they like make the condition like give a discrete discretized condition on on the on the measure so so it's kind of complicated but now with with the new definition like distribution definition The distribution definition is attempting to ask: can we characterize the multiplier from this point of view? Because if you so this is the factor in in the derivative factor that defines the durial norm, if you multiply g to it, if you think of it from this factor to this factor, it's just a linear transformation and the entry in the linear transformation. And the entry in the linear transformation are just a partial derivative of g. So now I know that the Duraffenson norm is integral of a Hermitian form on this. So can we, like based on this definition, can we give a characterization of the multiplier? So that's, I think that's an interesting question. Actually, yesterday I did some calculations, so you can I did some calculations so you can already give some, I guess, a sufficient condition on a multiplier based on that definition. So, but I didn't write it here. So, yeah, this is another idea. And the idea is to define the analog of toplets operator on a dura of the space. So space. So we can define, so this is the top width algebra. So we have the top width algebra on the Julia Opsen space, which is defined by just taking the C star algebra generated by the identity and MZ1 to MZN. But like if you compare it with the classical Bergman space, in the Bergman space, you have to. In the Bergman space, you have more explicitly defined operators there. You have like at least continuous symbols or like topless operator with continuous symbols. So do we have an analog of top list operators on a duri after space? So that's an interesting question. So now with the distribution definition. Distribution definition: It's natural to define a toe-litz operator this way. So, recall in the Bergman space case, how do we define the top litz operator? You take the multiplication. So, let's say G is a symbol like L infinity symbol. You take the multiplication and take the so-called Bergman projection. But the good thing is the Bergman projection is an integral of Is an integral operator. So basically, you are defining the top-lift operator as the singular integrable, singular integral operator like this. So if you look at this expression, it's just the big measure applied to the function g times f times kc bar. And then you get a natural generalization of the top. Of the top width operator, but the only restriction is that you need your symbol to have some kind of smoothness. And also, it looks look like the hard space because I know that the new distribution is supported on the sphere. So, your symbol is only need to define in a neighborhood of the sphere. So, if you have a relatively smooth. Have a relatively smooth function defined in a neighborhood of the sphere, you can just define the top width operator this way. And of course, you can check because I have the inner product given by the distribution. And you can easily check if you get something in the multiplier, and then TG is just the multiplier. If you get like Mg. Like Mg multiplier and take a G bar, then that's just the adjoint of the multiplier. And even if you take like Mg2 star, Mg1, it's going to be like G1 bar G2, like it's going to coincide the classical definition. So you get the whole big class of new defined topics of You define the top-date operators so you can ask the classical question: Are they bounded? Are they compact? Shuttle-class, positive, do maybe the commutators, certain class membership, trace spectrums. So I don't know any of that. I think these are interesting questions to look at. But I think these are hard questions, but they are interesting. Also, so this is my last question. So now I can look at the von Neumann's inequality or the Jury's inequality in a different way. So let me start. So let me just briefly recall a contraction is an operator that like its operator norm is less than equal to one. So the famous for norm as in Famous for Norman's inequality says that if you give you a polynomial applied to the contraction, then the operator norm is controlled by the infinity norm on the disk. And then we have the contraction, which is the generalization of the contraction in the model. Contraction in the multi-variable setting. So the uncontraction is a commuting tuple and it satisfies this operator inequality. And we have the uncontraction generalization of the von Neumann's inequality, which says a polynomial applied to like this tuple. The norm is controlled by the The control by the multiplier norm, but not the H infinity norm. So I know now I know more about the multiplier norm because the Jewish-Offensive space is defined by distribution. So the multiplier norm is just the like multiplying norm of like L2 analytic space defined by distribution. So you can feel it this way and it like just feels. And it like just feels just right, like it's just quite natural to get a result like that because you are taking like a tuple of commutative contractions and you want to get model space and at least model space should work well with the analytic functions. Analytic functions and now if you with the distribution definition, you know that like sort of like if the analytic function Qbert space of analytic functions is a building, the Hardy space is not the ground level. The Durio-Arsen space is the ground level. It's like the distribution with some universal property. So it just feels for me, I think it feels more. For me, I think it feels more right with this point of view. So that is natural to ask: does it hold for other domains? We know that there's no analog of Norman inequality for poly disk if you get dimension higher than three. So the question is: well, do we have an analog of Like, do we have a distribution supported maybe on the closed poly disk that defines some analytic function spaces? And then maybe the multiplier norm control serves as a model space for commuting tubes. Commuting tubes of contractions. So that's my question. And so there are other interesting questions. For example, what's the L P analog of it? If you consider like a distribution applied to F absolute value to the P's power, you want it to be positive. Be positive, I think you can still get something weird other than positive measures. So, then maybe we can study that. But that's a, I assume that's a very, very difficult question, but it's interesting to ask. Also, now we know that distribution defines L2 norms, and you know that carton measure is just an An ordering of these norms, our two norms. So it makes sense now that distribution also defines norms, it makes sense to ask what maybe you have a characterization of the carlson distribution. So I think that's also a difficult but interesting question. I think I end early. So that's my Alrighty, so that's my talk. Thank you for the attention. It's full of interesting questions. Does anybody have any questions about the talk or any comments or even better, any answers to some of the questions that he raised? I have a question. Hi, and a comment. I think it's a very lots of very I think it's a very lots of very interesting ideas and clever observations. And my question is: did you think about quotient spaces? I think that quotient space. Yeah. Yeah, I think, yeah, exactly. So I guess you are talking about like essential normality, quotient, like quotient modules, things like that. Well, before the question of essential normality, can you express the Can you express the inner product with a distribution that's supported on the sub-variety? So, I guess the first thing is that the known result tells us at least if you get a complex variety that's transversal and smooth on a boundary, then you define the weighted. Weighted norm, weighted measure on the surface on the variety, and we know that this like L2 norm would define equivalent norm on the portion space. And also, if you look at, I guess, maybe like the ideal generated, for example, Z1 and Z1. Z1 and Z1 oh sorry the ideal generated by Z1 squared so the corresponding quotient module will be decomposed in two layers and I think you can define a like so like the the norm like of the quotient space in this way like derivative In this way, like a derivative of the measure, weighted measure supported there. But I haven't checked, I think that might work. Yes. Any other questions? I'd just like to comment that the last question you asked on slide 20 is very apt because when we were. Slide 20 is very apt because when we were wondering what to do, when we, no, one slide back. Yes, one if we were only allowed 15 people, we thought that maybe the best thing to do would be to try and pick one problem and just work on that for the week. And the problem we thought of working on was what can you say about triples of contractions and how you can find some bound on it. So this actually feeds into our Our erstwhile plan. Oh, yeah. Okay. If no other questions, let's thank E again and hang around for the photo at 12.0.
