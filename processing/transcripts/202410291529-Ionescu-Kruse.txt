It's cool cruise telling us about two-dimensional water waves with arbitrary vorticity. Thank you, thank you very much. And I would like to thank the organizer for inviting me with us at this very interesting shot. And also for the first time here in Bond, I enjoy it very much. So, my talk is on non-linear two-dimensional water waves with argument vorticity. It's a joint work. It's a joint work with Roden Bano. Are we all recorded or no? Yes, we're recording. Oh, we are. Okay. I already tested one. And we propose you the description of the interaction between the motion of the free surface and the motion in the bulb of the fluid with some electron. With some evolutionary system of equations for some chosen variable on the free surface and in the bulk of the fluid. And this system will be written with the help of the Dirty Kemlayman operator and the green function of the Laplace operator in the fluid operator. Now, here are the notations. So we have two-dimensional investigating compression. have two-dimensional invisiting compressible fluid in constant gravitational field, G. X and Z are the horizontal and the vertical variables. Z equal minus H is the flat bottom. And we set the density to 1 and we have the Euler equations in the fluid domain, compressibility condition, and the boundary condition. and the boundary conditions, the dynamic boundary condition at the free surface and the kinematic boundary conditions at the wet boundary z equal minus h and on the free surface the particles are on the free surface, they are always there still there. Then we have this scarabicity in the fluid and And for irrotational closed line omita is zero, the velocity field is written with the aid of this harmonic function. Zaharov in 68 showed that in fact it's enough to know the values of this harmonic function on the free surface and the free surface at some point, at some time t, in order to recover. In order to recover the whole flow in the domain at that time t. And the equation of motions are written in this form with the add of the Dirichlem-Meymann operator, which has this form, where n is the normal of the free surface. So we have the two variables, the free surface and this. Phase and this velocity potential at the freezer phase. And they are written, these are the two equations which completely determine the flow inside the domain. Of course, here we can write this system like Hamiltonian system. There is a Hamiltonian function, and we have here this one is h over the psi, and this is minus h over the eta. For constant vorticity, For constant vorticity flows when omega is constant, Valen in 2007 provided a Hamiltonian formulation for surface waves on shared flows in constant vorticity by using a nearly Hamiltonian formulation of constant in Ivanov and Protanov from the same. From arbitrary vorticity flows, Louis Marsden, Montgomery, and Ranzi and 86. Montgomery and Ransom paid V6 have introduced a Poisson bracket and they have shown that the equation of motions of incompressible flows with a free boundary having surface tension are Hamiltonian relative to this structure. But there are some problems related with the known closure of the class of admissible functionals under the operation of taking class of brackets. So it happens that when you take, there are That when we take, there are some simple functions on which these brackets are defined, and when we take the brackets of two of these functions, it happens, it could happen that we are not in the same class, so we have problems, for example, to verify the identity. Also, I mentioned here the paper by Kotter and Boghope, which presented variational formulation for water waves in vertical fortress. Now what do we propose? So for omega difference from zero, from Euler equations we get the evolution of the vorticity in time, which is this equation. And from the incompressibility partition, we have the existence of a stream function. The velocity field is written in the L stream function in this way. Taking in Taking into account the kinematic boundary conditions, the string function satisfies this relation, so d over dx on size is minus eta t. And also this component is zero on the boundary. Uh now uh we assume that uh the fluid is at rest at plus minus infinity and according to Handholtz-Holtz decomposition the velocity uh decomposed uniquely uh in this form. So here we have this rotation on three phi and some r which which Rz and minus Rx are the components of a divergent free vector field that is tangent to the free surface S. With the add of the expression of the normal of the free surface, the fact that this is tangent to the free surface is written in this way, Rx plus Rz at x is 0. So this means that d over dx from r. Over dx from R on the free surface is zero. Because we look at the class of functions which have fast decaying, that are fast decaying at plus minus infinity, we consider at the boundaries that R is zero, so at the free boundary and at the flat path. Now we will write We will write we replace U and T with the formula for with phi and R and we write the Euler equations into this form. So here we have some gradient of some function and for the moment we have this vector here that from the vorticity equation and the incompressibility condition we can condition, we can see that this second term is in fact minus dx minus 1 from this term here. So in fact we can write this Euler equations in this form like gradient of this function which is zero and this means that at each instant of time At each instant of time, this is constant in the fluid domain. Taking into account the dynamic boundary condition, the pressure is constant at the free surface, and then we absorb into the definition of phi a suitable time-dependent term. And we get, in fact, this uh Bernoulli law for um arbitrary vo uh vorticity omega. What this is the omega. Now, how we reduce the problem in terms of these variables phi, r and eta, which we consider fast decaying functions at plus-minus infinity that have to satisfy these equations. And we rehearsed this problem. We rehearsed this problem in terms in fact of psi, which is the values of this phi on the three surface, r, eta, and omega, like some evolutionary system of equations. How we do this? So the function phi has to satisfy the following boundary value problem. So here Um yeah so here it was uh select all the phi and then these are Laplace Phi is zero in the fluid domain, phi z is zero on P and phi is psi on the free boundary. There exists a rigorous analysis, mathematical analysis Mathematical analysis study of this type of system and some condition on the regularity of phi, of O eta and of sine in order to get unique and to show the existence in the index of the solutions of this problem. But for what we have in terms, how we write this solution, we take the basis of elementary harmonic functions into these two. functions into this strip minus z then age where age is the upper part of the free surface which satisfied the first part of the condition and this is the basis of this elementary harmonic function and we consider a subclass of solution to the problem the regular in this triple which is given in this way Then we introduce the d operator, which is minus dx, the derivative with respect to x, and taking into account that for an arbitrary function f, this operator acts in this way, so Away, so where exponential alpha d has this expression. So we have to write the solution, this solution for shear, we write it in this way, where this operator, cost hyperbolic Z plus H D, has this expression. Now we return to Now we return to the condition, the second boundary condition, and so phi on S is signed. And to pay attention that in fact in this operator, the powers of the function eta plus h, eta depending on x, X are in front, so are not after this D operator. So this eta plus H is not D act not on eta plus H. And in this way, we get the solution of that boundary value problem in this form. If we focus on the other boundary value problem is La plus R is omega in the domain and R is zero on the boundaries. The solution to this problem The solution to this problem we try to find using the green function with these boundary conditions. And in order to find this solution, we use the green representation formula and we write that. We write that R is the integral of this green function omega x0 delta. How we find this green function, so it's the green function in the solution of this problem in the fluid domain. And in order to find this green function, we use the fluid. We use the fundamental green function in the whole plane. This is so this gamma 0, which satisfies this equation, Laplace gamma 0 is delta x minus x0 in R2 for any point x0 in R2. This function has this expression. And our green function in the fluid domain will be the difference between this fundamental green function and the harmonic function in the fluid domain, so that the green function satisfies this suitable boundary conditions. And the same that as for the other problem, we can write this solution for some class of solutions that are regular in this. The object the the system so uh the evolution equation for for the the freeze surface is uh the same. Uh uh Same, eta t is the Lebremann operator applied to psi. For this function r, which is from the representation formula, has this expression. If we calculate the evolution equation, we have to write Rt and this function here is the derivative, and here we have to take into account that the domain depends also here Depends also here on T and we arrive to this expression here. Here we want to get rid of time on the right hand side. And here we use the equation of the vorticity. And here when we make the derivative, we take into account that gamma depends this function depends on eta explicitly, and here we have gamma. And here we have gamma eta eta t, and here we write it like and uh how we get uh this evolution equation, uh of course we have to take into account the the baby law or some general And uh uh in fact uh we differentiate this psi with respect to t and then have this formula uh phi with respect to t on s plus uh phi with respect to z on s theta t uh and in view of the banouni relation, so uh we replace this term with uh the one from the Bernoulli relation here. Uh Here. Phi z eta t, so eta t it will be gx, g psi. We write this system. Here is the expression of the Dirichlem-Weiman operator. So this eta t is gig psi. And here is the derivative with respect to x on sine x. Psi x, and we can solve. And finally, we obtain this equation. So here we will replace with this term, and we have this is also the term which appeared also in the case rotational case. This is also, and these are the two terms now related with the omega. We also take into account the expression of phi that we have it here, this one. We write phi derivative with respect to Z on S, which has this expression, and we can also write the Richard-Reuman operator. Write the Richen-Reumann operator in terms of the free surface and of the D operator. And this sine at the bottom eta plus H D and quasi-pervoling eta plus H D minus one here is normal ordering also to remember that in fact eta plus H is in front of D, not after. Also, the other function psi, we have the green function and of the other terms. And our final expression is this one. For some arbitrary vorticity, the nonlinear governing equation for the wave-vorticity interaction can be written in terms of these variables. Terms of these variables in the following way. So here are only terms which here, so this pi here are the terms are here only the Dirichleman operator and the green function in the full domain. As example, we took the case when the vorticity comes from an Comes from a point vortex beneath the free surface. So omega is in this form. To the extent vortex is interacting with the free surface of the fluid. There are different approaches that we wrote here, event, vortice, and panish. In the general framework presented above, the problem we The problem uh we will be cover in the following way. So we write now for this form of velocity what means uh omega. And in fact, this first equation here will become the equation which describes the dynamics of the point. So, the dynamics of the point vortex. x1 is q1 dot is psi z and x equal q and q 2 dot is minus psi x in x equal q. Now these are the expression of psi and of r in this case, when the omega is coming from the Uh coming from the point vortices, point vortex. And the system of use at this system now. And also further, what we can do, we can develop in for small amplitude long waves approximation in terms of epsilon and Of epsilon and delta, the amplitude parameter and the shallowness parameter, we can expand in Taylor series the operators on the right-hand side of this equation here. And the first two equations for the dynamics of the point vortex will become these two equations. Will become these two equations. We see that the point vortex is influenced by the button and also by the free surface. Because here this is the notation for psi, psi x, this u. Also for eta of order epsilon, if we Uh if we uh develop in uh Taylor series, the expression of the Diffler-Neumann operator, we find uh these terms and we recognize here the first two terms from the Taylor series expansion of the Tirik-Lehmann operator from the papers by Craig, Soulem and Craig and Groves. Yes, and then Yes, and then this, if we ignore these terms of order epsilon squared, epsilon delta squared, and delta power 4, this is how act this g on psi. In this case of small amplitude long wavelength regime, Regime, the vortex and the vortex is not close to the free surface, the surface motion does not significantly affect the green function. And we will take for the green function, we will take this expression, which appears in the book by Menikov. And also, so of course, here this is valid where x is different. Where X is different from Q, so we assume that there is no self-interaction, and we consider this expression only when x differs from Q. And if we approximate all these these terms and in the regime delta squared is epsilon. squared is epsilon, we get this equation. So these are the dynam the how moves the point vortex and this is the free surface of surface there is completely connected. They cannot so in this expression appear the two q1 q2 and here appear u from the free surface. And also And also uh we can deduce um K d V approximation uh for for if we look at the propagation in only one direction. Here at the order of epsilon we see that the traveling wave have the speed c squared is h and And then, if we follow the routine of KDB approximation, we explicitly introduce the scaling, then we move into this frame, capital DX, capital T. We finally found this per third Kb equation. For epsilon, for omega square, for omega star is zero, it's exactly the the Kb. The Kb. So, uh conclusions: Without any restrictions on the vorticity field, the governing equations cannot be split into separate sets of equations for the free surface and the fluid model. Due to the non-constant vorticity field, there is always an interaction between the surface and the body of the fluid. are mathematically complicated. The equations can be written in a relatively compact and manageable form by the means of the Dirichler Meymann operator and the green function for the fluid domain. And we provide new explicit expressions for both objects which allow subsequent expansions for specific propagation in the system. Okay, it would be interesting to to see if there is a Hamiltonian formulation of the problem. Newtonian formulation of the problem. And we illustrate this system of evolutionary equations by this example of a point vortex. And this is further simplified for the business and the ADP regimes. And for further detailed study uh we require some numerical simulation then Some numerical simulation, then we will perform this in a follow-up. Thank you for the question.
