Thanks, Ihon's introduction. And firstly, I want to thank all the organizers for the invitation. Today, my topic is about the principle of value. This is a joint work with Dr. Shaan Liu and Professor Pierre Lo. Recent years, so we may start this kind of Start with this kind of second order pair volume operator. So, especially on its principle undervalue. So, this kind of algorithm has a lot of applications, such as about the existence or stability of solutions. But for general operator, so usually it is not. It's not easy to calculate expressive algorithm directly. Here we add three parameters here. So that is tau, d, and alpha. Tau is time frequency, and d means the diffusion rate. Alpha is just the strength of this vector field B. And we hope through the study, the The dependence of lambda on these parameters, especially like the monotosity or like the asymptotic behavior of the perceptible other value. So one tau d or alpha converges to some limit, like zero or infinity, to let us learn more about how it evolves. And usually we assume the boundary conditions, human boundary conditions, but if we replace it as other We replace it as by dual graph is not probable. And for this parabolic problem, we need it is temperate. We need the setting is temp parabolic. So first I want to show it. So I want to show our motivation, why we are interested in this kind of problem by several applications. Applications. Firstly, it is about the existence theory. This is a result by Jin Fu Shen and Yalu in 2008. They studied this competition system. Here, two species, you and we, share the same food, M. You can imagine M is food or some kind of resources. Is food or some kind of resources, then the two are trying to compete to get more food. Anyway, so for the species you, except this random work, this term means, the second term means you has some kind of ability to move towards the place where M is large. Something like U has kind of ability to find if Kind of ability to find the flu itself except this random work. Okay. One mu, the diffusion rate, yeah, is smaller than nu. And this setting and one alpha is zero. So it is well known that. So there is no coexistence, there is no positive coexistence solutions when alpha is zero. Alpha is zero. However, through the r value theory, when alpha is large enough, check and log show that they can find at least one pair of positive coexistence solutions. So alpha is like this is about the existence theory. The second is about the stability theory. So this is Two-dimensional incompressible Euler equation, but not standard type. And this one, and the last term, it is represents the Cori-Oris force, which is some kind of the rotation of the Earth. So we want to study the dynamics of a shear form for this equation. Actually, the dynamics of this problem are in two-dimensional case dynamics. In two different cases, I mean, so can be reduced into some kind of analog problem. Through our results and techniques, we can show that. So, when the degenerate event flow, shear flow is degenerate, as long as beta is zero, it is positive. In the neighborhood of the shear flow, there must exist an infinite family of traveling waves, traveling waves, which means so as long as the Which means, so as long as the correlated aureus force exists, exists. So the dynamical behavior of the degenerator shift should be very difficult. It should be very complicated. Now, so let's go back to our main target, the agri-value problem. Okay. Yeah. Today, so since the time is limited. So, since the time is limited, so we want to only focus on the inequity problem. And for this new point, match the action problem, we want to study the limit of this undue value, well, alpha corrodes to infinity. For simplicity, so in this talk, we always assume it is Newman-bounded condition. Actually, for Actually, for a general vector field of B, so it's not easy to calculate the precise value, believe it. So, for this problem, thanks to Hodge decomposition. So, for a general vector field, it can always be decomposed into two parts, the sum of two parts. So, one is potential for negative n, the other is the divergence free field. Divergence free field, we call it cattle V. Moreover, if we assume we satisfy a Newman boundary condition, then such a decomposition is unique. And NABLA M and this V are two typical vector fields. By Bespicki and his collaborators, and Chandelo, self-defined. Chandered law. Secondly, these two cases have been well studied. In 2005, Brass Diggi, Amio, and Nadio Shividi studied 1B is diagonal-free. And three years later, in 2008, Chen and Low studied the case 1B is potentially free. First, let's briefly review their results. 1B is diverse-free. Brainsticky constructed. Brassvicky constructed this kind of function function. Now, this is a very standard function. However, they need some special condition on the function space. This is just a norm, but they also need the test function from this space. Its regression should be vertical to the field, the vector field, almost everywhere. Why they need such a need such a requirement because if this application holds then you can see uh the abaction term so will vanish then you can use that only Laplacian and the C5 are left then you can use this kind of function to to calculate the limit they show that the limit sorry Sorry, they showed that the limit exists and is just the infinite of this function of f. And later by training the law, they studied the case 1b is potential for. They constructed a different type of function in this way, and with a weight here. This is just a function space, and it's just a normalization, a standard normalization. They also show. They also show the limit exists and it is the e-mimon of this functional e. Although the two limits are the effiment of the corresponding functional, but actually these two results are totally different, I have to say. So we can through one sample to learn something about chain loss results first. It might depend on. Event dimensional case, if we assume n is like this way, like this way. The limit is only dependent on the local maximum point of n. So how many maxim points, many maximum points does m have in this graph? Actually, it's five. X1, X2, and X3. And 0 and 1 boundary can bunch. Uh, boundary, uh, boundary points, but they are the biggest around their neighborhood, so they have some kind of boundary maximum point. So, we have five local maximum points, and the linear injusta, we take the value of the function c. C is uh just uh see where is c? Sorry. Uh c is here, yeah. It's just uh we only assume it is a continuous function. This continuous function. Yeah, the value of C at these five local maximum points, and we take the smallest one. That is the limit. This is the result. So as you can see, so the limit when B is a potential flow, it is only dependent on several maximum points of M. What does it mean? It means if we change the value of Cs, for example, here, in the Of Cs, for example, here in the mean point. And it doesn't matter with the limit. The limit will not change. The limit will not change. This is changeless result. However, if we go back to press status results, we can see. So since there's no weight in the function, if we change the value of C somewhere, the ethnonym of capital F and the limit. The limit will also change correspondingly, which means for dimensions of free flow, every point in the domain will make contributions to the limit. But for this case, for potential flow, only several points will make the contribution. So, one is something like global effect. This one is some kind of local effect, totally different. Effect totally different. Is there something wrong? Yeah, but the functional or depends on the result of a chain load. The definition of E depends on our thought. But yeah, it's dependent. It's dependent. Even though I mean, here, it should be an ER now. Here, it should be an e alpha, e of arva. Yeah, it is dependent. Uh, it's some kind of um, yeah, it's some kind of here, but when they make the real calculation, it can get this functional can be translated to some other forms where alpha will vanish. Okay, it doesn't matter, it's just for simplicity. Doesn't matter, it's just for simplicity. I write it here. Yeah. It also reason: since there is alpha here, the weight of maximum point is bigger than other parts, then the other function will concentrate on the maximum point. And that's the reason the meaning is only dependent on this maximum point. Some kind of explanation. Yeah. But for a general vector field, B, so. A general electric field B. So it's difficult than the two typical case cases, divergence-free and potential flow. So for several reasons. One is, so for potential flow and the divergence-free, so we can define suitable functional. But for a general vector field, so this operator may be non-self-adjoint. And usually it doesn't exist, there doesn't exist. Exist, there doesn't exist a variation structure at all. And secondly, so for potential flow, it is the domain, every point in the domain, so we have some kind of effect. But for potential flow, only several important points have effect. Once we combine them together, so we actually we do know what will happen. Know what will happen. So, if you have some intuition, we don't know. Yeah, this is the main difficulties for us at the beginning. Actually, Yuan Totony, so he considered this problem for a long time, and he also asked some clients to do the simulations, have him to do some simulations. However, the numerical results are too massive, such that he cannot get. He cannot guess what should be the answer from the numerical analysis. Okay, next, I will introduce our results. So, step by step. So, firstly, this is the beginning, our beginning point, which endows results. So, just for this operator, they need every critical point of M is non-degenerate. What does it mean? It means, anyway, here. Um, anyway, here, uh, matter is zero, then its head should not must not be zero. This is the definition of non-degeneracy. If it holds, if it held, then the for M, for a bounded domain, there exists at most a finite local maximum points. Then we denote this set as this capital M. This set as this capital M and we consider the value of this function C at these finite points and choose take out the smallest that is need. The result is just the same as the sample we showed before. It's very beautiful. But the need, M is non-degenerate. While M is degenerate, so only the mind dimensional case. So only the main dimensional case. Chain the loss to just a high dimensional case. Okay, a high dimensional case, only one dimensional case. So Ray Pong and me. So Ray Pong is my collaborator and a former PhD student of EHONG. And 10 years later, so we studied for the degenerative. Because our result is to lens, I just show the essence by a sample. Yeah, in this way. Here, I mean, here, from x2 to x3, this interval. at three this interval flat interval on which m is constant and it means every point in this in this interval so uh the gravitational m is zero which such a case can is not allowed by chain the loss is out okay um roughly speaking um this this is a local maximum point uh one is also a maximum point you can also imagine this black interval is some kind of maximum point Is some kind of maximum point. Okay, so the limit is just we take out the effect of zero, which is still zero, and the boundary point one is still one. And the reporter should know what is the effect of this flat interval x1 to x3. It's effective is just this guy. It is the principle unvalue. For this problem, For this problem, I'm valid problem. And since m gram is zero, in this interval, this one, this vacuum trend will vanish. This is the other function. The back guys are other functions. And on the boundary points x2 and x3, it is Newman boundary condition. Then for this problem, there exists a principle. That exists a principal value. That is the value. This value is just the effect of this interval. I just write it here and choose the smallest among these three guys. That is the limit. This is how, roughly speaking, this is how the interval will affect the limit. And later, okay, I think this is an idea. Later. Later, so uh for the parabolic uh problem only one dimensional case one dimensional case still so by showing you your low raymond and me so in a sequence of what we studied and uh uh thanks to this this study so you can finally solve the problem of a general vector flow b anyway so from here so we got two things uh one is We got two things. One is we find a way to establish a super and sub solution, which is very useful or effective in to treat this kind of other value problem. So why? So previous work, Christiki and Chen and Lo and Hong and Mi, so our method relies on the energy method, the function of heavy, but for this But for this time periodical operator, it doesn't look like this. So we have to find a new method. So then we find it. And more importantly, in this paper, we just realized the essence of this problem is not where it is the local maximum points is also not the infinite. The infigure of the function. The essence of this problem is just only is only. We realize it because parabolic operator has totally different behavior with elliptic operator. And it makes us to have better understanding on this problem. So I will explain why this kind of I will explain why this kind of league is important. Okay, here. What is this important? So from my understanding, you can imagine this B as some kind of wind or flow. And when alpha is very large, it means the flow or the wind is very strong, such that the wind will blow. The wind will blow the energy or the mass of other function to where, which is where is most stable in this field. Most stable. So, where is stable? It's just the stable solution of this ODE. Yeah, this is my understanding on this problem. Anyway, I don't know whether it's clear or not. Anyway, let's have you show how this ODE plays an important role. This code plays an important role in our analysis. So, for this kind of DE, in two-dimensional case, so it's solution only two kinds, fixed point and closed orbit. Since our previous experience on generate flat interval, so we also need to consider the subdomain consisting of fixed points with a positive matter, and another case subdomain consisting of a That domain consisting of uncorroless orbits also is positively married. Yeah, for fixed points. Okay, the first case is when this point is stable in this field. It will affect read and its row is just like the local maximum point in potential form. Yeah, this effect is just the value of C at this point. If it is unstable, it is no use at all. Okay, we omit the At all. Okay, we omitted it. But the second point is the most tricky part, so we leave it to the last. And when the orbit, when we consider the single closed orbit, if this orbit is stable from both sides, inner and outer side, then it will affect limit. And it's effectively just that the integral of C, the average of the integral of C on this curve. But if it is unstable from inner or outer, Unstable from inner or out or outer side, only one side is okay, and it is no use at all. And for this domain, so consisting of fixed points, it is similar to the degenerate problem we introduced before. So yeah, this effect is just that it's underwater, the principle underwent of this problem. But one addition, it may But boundary recognition, it may be new man or Deuclean or some mixed boundary cognition up to the obvious around the boundary of this red red circle. Yeah, anyway, it's only this anyway is present, in fact. And for the subdomain consisting of closed orbits, similar to RASTIP's work, so we will. So we will we can define the function in this way and choose the same function function space. And its effect is just the infinite of this function. However, so there's still some difference. Instead of work, they need this the flow here, it must be divergent. But for our results, it's not. But for our results, every stream is not necessary. As long as it is the subdomain consisting of value for objects, it's okay. And finally, the last case, the seller point. In two-dimensional case, the local structure of cell point is always this way, local structure. So two directions coming in and two directions leaving away. However, so whether it will affect the limit or not is not. Limit or not is not dependent on the local structure, some kind of a global effect. If the orbit leaves in this host, leaving this set of points from this direction and come back, and on the other side, they also leave this organ and come back. It means actually like this way. If this case, this set of points will have a wall, will leave a factor in it, and this effect is just. And its effect is just the value, the value of C at this point, C minus 4. However, if at least on one side, so it does not come back, such kind of setup point will not affect the limits. And actually, this is the most difficult case. We wasted a long time on it. And finally, so in the beginning, we don't know what is the result. And finally, so it's. And finally, so it's hired by Professor Tihan Janchu Rizal on the evaluative matter of SDE. So we can finally solve it. Okay, this is our result. So we assume, we assume, oh, in a summary, so I have a saddle. So what will affect the limits? Only five type of type, only five guys. Saddle, stable point, fixed point. point fixed point and set a point in this way and stable circle and a degenerate domain and domain consisting consisting of family of objects only this file guys will affect me we assume their total number are finite and denote the corresponding of each case as beta then we have the own effects beta from beta one Then choose the smallest. Yeah, that is the limit. This is my result. And I think the time is up. So, okay, I will finish my talk. Oh, thanks, everyone. Questions? So how are we affected by the practice later on data? vects beta one beta two yeah uh yeah for example so you know you know vector field so we assume for example here it is like three uh fixed points uh what is it it will be uh three stable this is a little anyway for example we can assume uh by calculation not by calculation so so we assume these guys are always finite Assume these guys are always finite. For example, here are three stable points. A stable fixed point we denote is effect as beta i, beta two, beta three. And the three and the two, this kind of several points would denote its effect as beta two and the beta four and beta five, but this way. How are those numbers in five? What one is beta one two beta? Yeah, the definition. But then usually you've had to function. Yeah, it's its effect is just the limit, it's just the value of C at this point. For stable fixed point, it's in fact just this one. The value of C at this point. And for a circle, yeah, they just have the average of the integral of C on this curve. Yeah, for circle many. yeah for for sub domain for this general domain just this kind of algorithm you can you can always find such kind of uh algorithmic problem and for this one it's just the ethermo of this function yeah then we take out all the values together and choose the the smallest one that is the answer so you have a slide uh about ergotic alone so you have some conjecture on So, you have some conjecture on the case where the flow is in two-dimensional case, right? So, actually, for higher-dimensional case, for example, when the dimension number is bigger than three, so there may exist a workflow, so which is much more complicated. And the obes in high-dimensional case is also much more complicated than that in two. Anyway, so our management. Anyway, so our method and our idea should still work. So even in high dimensional case, but we need more assumptions. Yeah, we should be very careful. Yeah, that's it. So maybe higher dimensions can access some standard access and magic for symmetric. Yeah, yeah, maybe about this one. I really asked some effort from Dynamical System that they didn't give me some satisfactory answer to help me to solve my problem. Anyway, do you go back to the previous slide for the potential situation? You have examples for one degree. That is in the beginning. For one dimension, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just the one. Yeah, it will work. Yeah, right. Where is it? Sorry, sorry. Just one minute. I think we have a go, I see. Yeah. It holds for higher densities. The change and loss result you can see here. So there is no restrictions on the dimensional number. It is a result of high dimensional space. Maybe we'll just go here now. Let's thank Maudin.
