Thank you, Jason. Let me start by thanking the organizers of this conference, Chris Taylor, Brian Forrest, and Folker Ronde, and for this opportunity to give this talk. I especially want to thank Volker for his patience for answering all of our questions and emails. This talk is dedicated to Tony Lau with my admiration and thanks. Admiration and thanks. My talk has two parts. In the first part, I will talk about the extension of Tanaka crime theorem for topological semi-groups, and then I will talk about one applications of that to approximation of characters and semi-groups. So here is the notation that I will use. S would be a topological semigroup. Semigroup in the sense that the semi-group operation is separately continuous. So, technically, this is a semi-topological semi-group. And then S hat would be the collection of all finite dimensional continuous irreducible unitary representations of S up to equivalence. Then T of S, which would be the trigonometric polynomials on S. Geometric polynomials on S, this is the linear span of all these coefficient functions of the representations of the semi-group of finite dimensional unity. So this T of S is a sub-algebra of C B of S. This would be all continuous bounded functions, part of this space of continuous bounded functions. Sometimes we don't need the entire trigonometric polynomial. Trigonometric polynomials. So we would work with a collection of representations, in which case the trigonometric polynomials associated with this F would be, of course, the linear span of those coefficient functions of the representations that come from the F. So I can now define what strongly almost periodic functions are for a topological. For a topological semi-group, strongly almost periodic functions, also called Mach almost periodic functions. This is just the closure of the trigonometric polynomials, closure with respect to the uniform norm. So this would be a sub-algebra of CB of S. In general, the strongly almost periodic functions would not be equal to the almost periodic functions on topological semi-groups. It would be a proper subset in general. Would be a proper subset in general. But for topological groups, the three spaces coincide, so there's no distinctions between strongly almost periodic and almost periodic for topological groups. The strongly almost periodic functions on a semi-group, this is a translation invariant, left and right, unital C star sub-algebra of C. All C star subalgebra of C B and it has a unique two-sided invariant mean, which we denote it by M. So now, what is Tanaka-Krine theorem, the classical result of Tanaka-Krine? The theorem is about topological groups. It says that if we got a topological group G, and if we have a linear functional that goes from the trigonometric. Goes from the trigonometric polynomials into the complex numbers. And if this linear functional satisfies this positivity condition here that phi of absolute value of h squared is positive for all h in tg. In that case, this linear functional is positive in this sense that phi of h would be positive for every h positive. In particular, it follows. In particular, it follows from this result that the map, like that satisfying this positivity condition here, is continuous and can be extended to the almost periodic functions on G, the closure of TG. That's for topological groups. So what makes this result not trivial, not the immediate consequence of CSR algebra theory, is that Tg is not complete. Otherwise, this result would be almost immediate. Almost immediate. So, a little history. Tanaka proved a special case of this result. For him, this was a little lemma in his paper, which he was constructing a duality theory for compact topological groups. Then later, Krein extended the theorem and proved the more general form that I just stated. And And later in the 50s, Hewitt and Zuckerman find one application of this to the study of approximation properties of characters and groups. Now, there have been a lot of developments since then, of course, on almost periodic functions on semi-groups. It has been studied extensively. Semigroup compactifications also has been studied extensively. Classifications also have been studied extensively by many people who are actually present in this conference, so I don't specifically mention names. Characters on semigroups have also been studied by many mathematicians, but this seems to be mainly concerned with extension properties of characters on semigroups. A more recent work, which was inspired by Hewitt and Zuckerman's paper, is a paper by Gro and Hare, in which they prove In which they prove the existence of characters on some compact topological groups that approximate random choices of sign. So now in this talk, I will talk about an extension of Tanaka crime theorem for linear maps, which are defined on trigonometric polynomials on semigroups, and they take their values in CSR algebra. They take their values in CSR algebras. And then in the suite of the He written documents, I also discuss one application of this Tanakat Kroin theorem for semi-groups. So here is the result I have for semigroups. So suppose we have a collection of representations for a dimensional continuous unity. Part of the dimensional continuous unity irreducible of the semi-group S. We assume that this collection of representation is large enough so that the associated trigger orbit polynomials becomes unital conjugate closed sub-algebra of TS. So of course we can take F to be the entire S half. Now we let A to be a C star algebra and we consider a map, a linear map that takes us from T sub L. map that takes us from T sub F into the C star algebra with the condition that we require phi of absolute value of H squared to be positive for all H in T sub F. This positivity here is in the C star algebra, of course. Then in that case we get this result that phi of h would be positive if H is a positive function. Again, this positive here is. Again, this positive year is for in the CS star algebra. And as in the classical result, once this is proved, then the map is continuous and can be extended to a positive linear map on the closure of these trigonometric polynomials. So, there are three features here which makes it distinct from the classical result. One, of course, is that the One, of course, is that the topological group is replaced by a topological semi-group, and the second one is that the complex number is replaced by the CSTR algebra. And the third one, not probably so important, is that the full trigonometric polynomials is replaced by this sub-algebra of them. So now, instead of giving the for the proof, I follow what has been done for the group case, but Has been done for the group case, but I just mentioned some comments about how the proof for the semi-group case compares with the proof for the group case. So that's probably more instructive than actually giving any proof. So the first comment I wish to make is the interplay between CSR algebra and the complex numbers in the context of this result. Well, we know that CSR algebras are essentially closed. Are essentially closed subalgebras of operator algebras, but the identification of CS2 algebra with the closed sub-algebra, this preserves positivity. So what does that mean is that we can replace our CS2 algebra with the sub-algebra of this operator algebra, and then the positivity of phi of h as an operator can be expressed in terms of the inner product here. This means that This means that essentially we can replace the problem of showing the positivity of map into CS2 algebra. So we can reduce it to the case of a linear functional, essentially, by this little trick here. Now, how about groups versus semi-groups? Well, in the group case, the essential difference is that we have inverses, but because here we are. Here we are dealing with unitary representations. The existence of inverse essentially translates into a representation being replaced by its adjoint. Like pi of s is replaced by its conjugate transpose, essentially. So when we go to the proof for the group case, we see wherever this inverse element is a fortunate thing that is happening. Fortunate thing that is happening, but that's actually true. That whenever this inverse occurs in the proof, it's not essential in a big way. We can actually modify those parts of the proof and essentially replace pi ijs inverse with just pi j i complex conjugate. In that way, we can essentially just avoid using groups and modify the proof so that it works for the semi-group case. Case. So this is how the group and semi-group case works. But this is not the whole thing. The actual proof of the result, I followed an old proof by Buckner for this Tanaka crime theorem. Buckner idea is that he considers two cases. The first for the function f, the idea is we want to show that phi is positive. idea is we want to show that phi is positive. So it considers two cases for phi. The first case is that the only finitely many phi of these pi i j k's, pi of j k's are non-zero. Because the domain of definition of this function is these trigonometric polynomials, which are spanned by this. So the first case would be only finitely many of these are non-zero. The second case would be that, the general case where many are non-zero. So the first case So, the first case kind of works without too much trouble. So, one can do that. The second case relies on the first case via a limiting process. One has to build a certain sequence of functions which allows us to reduce the case two to case one. And this is the technical result: this one here. The result states that there is a suitable C. States that there is a suitable sequence of functions of positive trigonometric polynomials which satisfy the properties that is needed to reduce case two to case one essentially. So let me state this result. Suppose F sub zero is a finite set of representations, any finite set, you pick one and we fix it. Then associated to this F sub zero, there exists a sequence of positive trigonometric polynomials. Polynomials which satisfy properties one, two, three. Property one says that the functions, each of these functions in the sequence is essentially a sum of traces of appropriate representations. These representations themselves come from another finite set, which we call fn. This depends on the small fn, of course. But the key is that this script fn contains scripts f sub zero. F sub zero. So these sequences are based on representation from within some finite set of representations containing the original choice of the set. Lambdas are complex numbers, and these D's are just the representation, the dimension of the representations. The second property is essentially orthogonality properties with respect to this strongly almost periodic mean. This is something that has been. This is something that has been mentioned before in this conference. This is just a reflection of orthogonality properties. But the key property would be property three, in addition to one, the third one would be the most important one, is that these complex numbers here, they approach to one as n goes to infinity for every pi which is from the original set of representation f sub zero. Now, this is the most This is the most technical part of the proof. The existence of this sequence has been proved by Bochner and von Neumann a long time ago. They worked on discrete groups. For some reason, they didn't work with topological groups. They just worked with discrete groups that there was no topology on the group. And they constructed this sequence there or something very, very similar to this one. Now, to get this sequence for the Now, to get this sequence for the semi-group, first of all, because there was no topology, there was no guarantee that this construction works for the topological case, one has to be very careful. For example, at some parts of the proof, they take the supremum of a family of functions, which if you're working with a family of continuous functions, you take supremum, they'll not be continuous anymore. So, the easiest way I could get these for semi-group is actually to work out the entire proof of the construction for something like a compact topological group and then use. Group and then use a strong almost periodic compactification to bring down this sequence from the compactification down to the semi-group. So, what we can get this sequence on a semi-group from using that technique. And once this result is in place, then transition from case two to case one of the proof will work. Okay, so this was my result on the extension of Tanaka-crime theorem for semigroups. Crime theorem for semigroups. Now, my initiation to this idea was from Hewitz and Zuckerman's paper. So, where they were studying approximation of characters. So, obviously, I wanted to see whether now I can get similar approximation result for semigroups using the Connector-Krine theorem. So, here is the topological semigroups, S as usual. We look at all characters of this topological semi-group, whether they are concerned. Semigroup, whether they are continuous or not, all of the characters. And we call it home of ST. Then we'll take a subgroup of the home of S T, which we call it H. So elements of H or characters on S. For every theta in H, we get a copy of the circle group. We multiply all these copies as theta ranges in H. Ranges in H. And we take the natural map that we got, call it psi, takes us from S into this compact group in the natural way. So S goes to essentially this family of numbers, which are theta sub S, as theta ranges on varies in H. Then we take the closure of the image of this psi map, take the image, take the closure, we call this a Bohr compactification of this semi-group. Bohr compactification of this semi-group with respect to H. So, even though we started with a semi-group, a topological semi-group, this compactification is actually a compact topological group. The caveat is that this is well-known construction, of course, but what is probably new here is that we don't insist on characters to be continuous. In fact, the interesting part would be those non-continuous characters. So, we take all of them. So we take all of them and we make this construction. So because the characters are not continuous, this psi is not continuous. So psi is neither continuous in general, nor subjective, nor injective. So this compactification is not the normal type of compactification that usually is introduced in semi-digit theory. Okay, so now we can have this result. The result that you see here is The result that you see here extends an earlier result by Hewitt and Document from groups to topological semi-groups. So it says, using the previous notation that I got, if H is any subgroup of home of ST, then home of H in all characters on H, whether continuous or not, that would be equal to the Bohr compactification of S with respect to H. Respect to H. So, in this result, the inclusion part, the inclusion of the left side into the right side, that requires the application of Toneka-crime theorem. The inclusion of the other side is a three-epsilon argument, but this inclusion is harder. Now, many of you have seen this before, all of us probably have seen this before, in the context of a billion topological groups. Topological groups. In that context, there is no need to apply Tanaka-Krine theorem because we have the Pontry-Ragin duality or the consequences of Pontry-Eigen duality. It can be used to show this for the compact obelian groups. But once you remove commutativity, then you need to rely on a different result. So from here, we immediately get this approximation property. So if you take an element in this home, any element, chi. Any element chi because that element would be element in the compactification, that means that it can be approximated pointwise by an element in S. So if you take a chi in home of h t and take a finitely many elements of h and any epsilon, then there exists an s in s such that we have this inequality. Chi of theta j minus theta j of s would be smaller than epsilon for every i from one to now this is uh Now, this was what made me interested in the whole thing this thing is that I could show that this result, which is on a semi-group level, is actually improves something that is classical and we teach to our undergraduate students, the Kronecker approximation theorem. This theorem, excuse me, this theorem has Has various forms, you can state it in various forms. This is one format of that. Suppose we got n real numbers, arbitrary is so much that as much as that these numbers one, h1 up to h n are linearly independent over q. And then we got some totally arbitrary real numbers b1 up to bn, no relation to the h's. Then for every positive integer n and for every epsilon, we can find Every epsilon, we can find some integer bigger than this capital N, which makes this inequality true for every J between from 1 to N. So essentially, we can naively, intuitively, what is happening here, we can make the HJs close to BJ's by a single integer M. But if you multiply a single integer M to every HJ, then they can become close to BJ's via this formula here. So this form of This form of the multi-dimensional chronicle theorem appears in Hardy and Reich's books in number theory. When I look at this result, I realize this M is coming from a semi-group. So if we look at the numbers that are bigger than n, n plus 1, n plus 2, etc., that's a semi-group of the additive group of the real numbers. So this is telling me that, telling us that the integer can be taken from the semigroup and applying our semi-group results for approximation. Find our semi-group results for approximation, we can actually strengthen this a little bit in this format. So the H's are as before, and the B's are as before also epsilon greater than zero. Now, if S is any semi-group in the additive group of real numbers, which contains a non-zero rational number, that's the only condition they put on the semi-group, non-zero rational number. Then we can find some element in the semi-group. We can find some element in the semigroup which makes these inequalities true for every j between one to n. So, for example, there are lots of examples of semi-groups in R. For example, you can take a prime number and look at all the multiples of the prime number. This tells us that x can be chosen to be a multiple of any given prime to make this inequality true. Here are some references. And thank you very much for your attention. Welcome from those on Zoom. I had one question. So you have like the Tanaka-Kwine theorem for compact or topological semi-groups. For you know, for compact topological semi-group, I mean, can you recover the semi-group from this category of five-dimensional representations? Like, to get that as a corollary from your work, like you mentioned that this technical result was sort of a lemma that Tanika, right, that used what building his sort of duality theory. So, do you, is there a corresponding duality theory in this context? Yes, yes, good question. There has been some work on that. Um, when I searched the literature, I saw Tatsuma. I saw Tatsuma, the Japanese mathematician, has developed a theory of duality for compact topological semi-groups, but he's not using this Tanaka-Krine theorem. He has a different, it seems to me, he has a different philosophy altogether for constructing his duality theory. And yeah, so because he was not using this result, he did not develop a version of this. Version of this. Now, having said that, so there is a duality for compact topological semi-groups, at least one there is one in place. But whether this result can be now used to develop a different one, I haven't worked on that yet. Thanks. All right, if there are no questions, let's thank many again. Thank you, guys. So we'll
