About this topic of equivariant cobordism. And I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were many computations in group homology, which is something that I also do. I also work on classifying spaces. And I also have to apologize, like many other people today, because this is not really about that. But, you know, you can see some things that are in common, like, you know, equivalent. Common, like you know, equivariant, also group homology is going to show up. So, I hope you enjoy. Hey, I have to say, this is joint work with a former PhD student, Alfred Hernandez, from the Universidad Federal de San Carlos in Brazil. And this project grew out of this thesis. Okay, so let me see how it works. Okay, so I'm gonna start easy, just giving the idea what K-theory is. What k-theory is. So, informally, you can think that topological k-theory is kind of like doing linear algebra, but in a parametrized manner. Now, what do I mean by that? The idea is you have a space that I'm going to assume for now that is compact in Hausdorff, and you're going to place a finite dimensional vector space over each point. But you're going to do it in a continuous manner. Now, what does that mean? That means that you bundle. Okay, and this kind of bundles, you call it vector bundles. Now, we know how to do linear algebra. Now, we know how to do linear algebra over one point. That's really easy. That's the linear algebra we learned in undergraduate. When you want to classify vector spaces, you know, you can classify them by dimension. So, for each dimension, you have a vector space and that unique up to isomorphism. And now you can ask the same thing about vector bundles over this kind of space. But this is more complicated. It depends a lot on the topology of X. And that's bad, but it's also a good thing because it's going to give you an. But it's also a good thing because it's going to give you an invariant of the homotopy type of x. And the short answer is that this is complicated. You want to classify them all up to isomorphism. That's hard. So K-theory does is that gives you a way to classify them up to a stabilization. Now, how do you stabilize vector band? So if you look at the set of isomorphism classes of complex vector values over this space X. Over this space x, you realize that this is not only a set, but you have an operation of sum. You can do the direct sum of vector groups, and with this operation, you have a commutative monoid. Okay, so you almost have a group, an abelian group, but you don't have inverses. So, what do we do when we have that? We do the growth and deconstruction. Yeah. So, this is the growth and deconstruction. And we call that A0 of X. So, we take formal. Formal differences of isomorphism classes of complex vector bundles of X. And everything I'm going to say today is about complex vector bundles, but you could have say many things for real vector bundles about the same thing too. And you can see here the stabilization. So we have kind of the same relation that you have when you go from the natural number to the integers, but we are stabilizing by this other vector bundle. By this other vector band that you can add. All right. So now this is an abelian group, but actually it has more structure. You also have the structure of a ring because you can also tensor vector bundles. Now, you don't know about direct sum or tensor product of vector bundles. You think you are doing the direct sum or tensor product on each fiber and then glue it adequately. And just to give you an example. And just to give you an example, and actually, a very important example in topological K-theory, what happens for the dimensional sphere? So, as a group, this is two copies of the integers. One copy is generated by the trivial one-dimensional vector bundle, and the other one is generated by the tautological complex vector bundle. And you think about it as a ring. Well, you have this question. Well, you have this question of a polynomial, and in fact, this bundle is very important because it's also called sometimes the bot bundle, and it gives you the periodicity of topological K-theory. Okay? Now, so far I talk about compact house of spaces. Now, there is another point of view, okay-theory, and you can prove that. Theory. And you can prove that this group I just defined is a bijective correspondence with a set of homotopy classes of pointed maps from X to the space of freight homophetics on an infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space. Okay? Now, the good thing about that is that this can serve now as a definition when you have a compact house space. Sorry, when you don't have a compact house of phase. So, this works now for any topological space. Okay. I mean, you can also do the same thing that we did before for non-compact spaces, but that doesn't behave as well. Okay, so this is nicer. And which sense is nicer that we are going to be able to extend this to a generalized cohomology theory. And if you only use complex vector bundles and stabilize with the protein deconstruction, you are not going to get that. Together, all right. So, both periodicity, why you're stating this is that when you do the whole loose space of this space, it's homotopy equivalent to the original space of rhetoric operators. And then you will define the negative degree k-theory groups by taking homotopy classes into the successive loop spaces of red home operators. But because you have But because you have this homotopy equivalent, you can actually extend that to positive degrees. And in the end, just to be short, what you have is just two groups, K0 and K1, because they just repeat. This is the periodicity. Okay? So probably so far, you know, many of these things are familiar to everybody. I hope so. And this is just a review. So now let's go to twisted K theory. So, if you haven't heard about twisted K-theory, you can think of cohomology with local coefficients. It's an analogy. So, what do you do for cohomology with local coefficients? Well, you know that cohomology is represented by the Eilenberg-MacLean spaces. And Eilenberg-MacLean spaces, in fact, the Eilenberg-MacLean spectrum has C2 as its group of automorphisms. So, whenever you have a map from X to the class. Have a map from X to the classifying space of C2, yeah, you can use that to twist the Eilenberg-Maglan spectrum. So you have an action of C2 on each Eilenberg-Maglan space. So now we have something similar in that if I take the projective unitary group of the Hilbert space, this has an action of the space of quantum operators by conjugation. So I can take the universal principle bundle. Universal principal bundle, EPUH to BPUH, and consider the associated bundle with fiber, the space of reference operators. So, this is this fiber bundle over here. And now, what I need in order to define twisted K-theory is to have a map from X to the classified space of PUH. And this is going to be called a twisting. And instead of having now homotopic classes of maps, Homotopy classes of maps, we are going to consider homotopy classes or lifts of this map F. So these ones that are in here. This is going to be the twisted K-theory of X twisted by F. All right, so as I said, this map is called the twisting. Sorry for the big paragraph. This map is called the twisting. But sometimes you don't see here really a map to BPUH, but instead you replace that by the principal PUH bundle, which is classified by the map F. And instead of putting the F, you put the P on the left. Now, these are not the only twistings you can have in K-theory. You can twist by other elements, but I'm going to ignore the other twistings. These are the twistings that are. Twistings. These are the twistings that are perhaps more relevant for me and for physicists, maybe. I will say a bit more about that later. Now, how many twistings do you have for each space? Well, it turns out that this space, BPUH, is homotopy equivalent to a Leilenberg-McLane space, KC3. So these homotopy classes are in one-to-one correspondence with elements of the third co-homology group. But it is important to distinguish here. Important to distinguish here between twistings and isomorphism classes of twistings. Okay? Because even though when you do the K-theory, the twisted K-theory with respect to two twistings, and they are isomorphic, the twisted K-theory are going to be isomorphic, they are not going to be isomorphic in an canonical way. It depends on the isomorphism. So that's why it's important to keep track of the projective bundle. Oh, and now that I said projective bundle. Oh, and now that I say projective bundle, I should probably warn you that just for short, sometimes I call principal POH bundle as a projective bundle. It's not the same thing, but it's okay. Any questions so far? So if F is the constant map, we get exactly what we had before. We get unto sticky. If F is homotopic to the constant map, well, of the isomorphism. Well, of the isomorphism, we get the same thing, but it may not be economic. That's right. That's right. Yeah. Okay. So now, why should we do this? Well, we have some of the same motivations that we have for doing cohomology with local coefficients. We start the first three. We want to have one carry duality, but now in K-theory, two isomorphisms. And sometimes you want to compute K-theory, but you still need to compute two. K-theory, but you still need to compute twisted K-theory as an intermediate state. So, this is the mathematical reasons to want to do this. But I guess part of the push of why people started doing twisted K-theory is because it appears in several parts of mathematical physics. So, for example, in string theory or more recently for topological insulators. I had no idea what a topological insulator is, so don't ask me, but I know that twisted K theory. But I know that twisted K theory is useful. Okay, so now you may be convinced that this is helpful. I'm going to start with something very simple, because I want to show what's the difference between computing K-theory and computing twisted K-theory. And really, this is a project about computing. This is not something very general, it's something very concrete. It's just computing. So I'm going to start with the three-dimensional sphere. And I'm going to break it. And I'm going to break it as the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere. And the intersection is the k-theory. Sorry, the intersection is the equator is S2, which I already told you where it is. So I'm going to assume that. And we're also going to assume that the K-theory is a homotopy invariant. So then doing the K-theory of a disk is the same thing as the K-theory of a point. And over a point, I told you, we already know how to do linear algebra. We have a vector bundle for each dimension. We have a vector bundle for each dimension. So we have they're in one-to-one correspondent with the natural numbers. And when we do the corotendic constructions, we get the integers. So this short exact sequence will look like this. We replace each of these by C because they are like a point. And this is C by C because of what I told you earlier. And if I want to compute these two groups, I just need to determine which map this is. Species and we can do this geometrically because these two are generated by trivial bundles, and when you take the pullback of a trivial bundle, you get a trivial bundle. So, when I do this map, I only reach the first coordinate because the second coordinate was given by this tautological bundle and the first coordinate by the trivial bundle. So it seems easy so far, right? Now, let's see what changes if I want to do twisted K-theory. To do twist decay theory. Now, if I want to do twist decay theory, I need to choose a twisting first. Now, twistings are in one isomorphism classes of twistings are in one-to-one correspondence with the third home only of S3, even though you cannot see it over there. So, I chose the element five once I chose an appropriate generator of S3. And now I can wonder: okay, what is the twisted K-theory with respect to a twist? Theory with respect to a twisting whose class corresponds to five. Okay, so what do I do to compute now? What I want to do is reduce the computation to the previous case. And how can I do that? Well, because D3 plus and D3 minus, they are contractible. Any fiber bundle over them is trivial. So in fact, this F restricted to this is trivial and this K theory. To this is trivial, and these k-theories are going to be isomorphic to the usual k-theory, but not in a canonical way. And this is important. No, because this is not in a canonical way, I have to choose an isomorphism here, and I have to choose an isomorphism here, and I also have to choose an isomorphism here. Now, here comes the important part. When I choose an isomorphism here, if I want to make things easier, I can just choose the same isomorphism that I chose for D3 plus and restrict. For D3 plus and restrict. But then, once I do that, this is not going to be the same isomorphism that I have for D minus. And that difference is going to show up in the computation. So what is the computation? The difference between these two trivializations is going to be given by the claxing function of the projective bundle that corresponds to phi. And this classing function corresponds to h to the Corresponds to h to the 5, where this h was this tautological bundle over the sphere. And now you do this computation. This is the multiplication in the k-theory, the one that was given by a tensor product, and you get that expression. Okay, so this is going to happen every time you want to compute twist decay theory by reducing to pieces that are contractible, or even to pieces where projective bundles trivialize. Bundles trivialize. So, this is the other difficulty. So, now you can imagine that you want to do a sort of computation with a spectral sequence. The spectral sequence is going to look very similar to the one that you will have for untwisted, but then the maps, the differentials are going to be different. And that's the point here. Okay. Well, I hope these samples help. Could you say what is the clutching construction? What is the patching construction? So you're using patching. Desire, class design work. So the classic contraction means that you take a trivial bundle over each of these two pieces. And then if you want to glue them, you only need a map from the intersection to the group, to the group that you are using as a principal G-band. So in this case, it will be a map from S2 to PUH. And these homotopic classes of maps from S2 to PUH are also in correspondence with H2. Are also in correspondence with H2, and in fact, the correspondence between these two is precisely the suspension isomorphism. So that's why it corresponds to H to the five. Yeah, thanks. Okay, any more questions? Okay. So now I'm going to talk about some special kind of twistings that were talked about before. Talked about before previously by Harry and Michelson. So they had this article where they were interested in the twisted K-theory of spaces of the form S1 times M. And if you compute these cohomologies using CUNET, you will realize that there is a summon that is isomorphic to this. And if you fix an orientation of the circle, that gives you a way to go from H2 of M to H3 of M. Of n to h3 of s1 times n. And Hardio and Mikerso were precisely interested in the twistings that were in the image of this map. They call them decomposable twists. I think you can see why. They are kind of decomposing in two parts. Now, this was not the main part of the paper by Hario and Mikerson. They did many other things, but they computed the twisted K-theory with respect to these twistings up to With respect to these twistings up to extension. Now, what we realize is that these twistings very easily you can realize them geometrically. Now, elements of H2 of M, you can think of them as homotopy classes of maps from M to P U H. So now I pick a representative and I want to construct a projective bundle from that. How do I do it? I can do it as a mapping torus. I take M times P UH and I glue the part of it. And I glue the part of it the zero with the part of it the one using the lambda. So I'm using, in fact, this lambda as a this map that goes from m times c to m times, sorry, m comma, lambda m times c as a clatching construction in this case. And you can and you can prove that this actually corresponds to what this map is doing. It's not too hard to do. So now we thought how about we do this more generally? Because we're already encountering a mapping torus. How about we change a product by a mapping torus? So now I take a homeomorphism of M, still considering that M is a compact house of space, and I consider the mapping torus of this homeomorphism. Now, this mapping torus is not a product anymore, but it's a fiber bundle over the circle. And in fact, any fiber bundle And in fact, any fiber bundle over the sequel is a map in torus. Now, if I use the spectral sequence, the cell spectral sequence for this fiber bundle, and I'm interested in the third cohomology group, I'm only going to have two terms in the spectral sequence, which are these two: the invariance of H3 and the co-invariance of H2. So now, So now, similarly, as Hariu and Michelson did, now we are interested in the image of this map. We want to realize this geometrically. And it's not too hard. Well, I don't want to sell low my work, but it's really not that hard, at least this part. So, what is this image? You can construct it in a similar way. You start with this lambda from n to puh, and then you can construct a projected band. And then you can construct a projective bundle again as a mapping torus. But now, in the mapping torus, you also need to glue M with F of M. You need to use both at the same time. And something that we thought was interesting, also looking from this point of view, is that the image of this map is the kernel of this map. And the kernel of this map is the same thing as the kernel of the restriction from H3 of X to H3 of N. X to H3 of n. So what we are constructing really are the projective bundles over the mapping torus which are trivial on the file. Okay? And they all have to be this way. Okay. And then just a major Vietnam sequence gives you that you want to compute the twisted K-theory with respect to this twisting. You can put it as an extension of groups that have to do now only with. Have to do now only with untwisted K-theory. Okay, so you look at the map induced by F, you look at lambda, and now lambda, even though it's a map from M to P UH, because it's also an element of H2 of M, you can also think of it as a line bundle. And you can multiply by line bundles in K figure. So this is the quotient by that, and this is the kernel of the map, one minus lambda f, but in dimension zero. Lambda f but in dimension zero. Okay, this is simple. But now I want to focus, to change the focus and see a different point of view on this mapping torus. And you can take the integers and make it act on M via the inverse of this homeomorphism that we fixed. And then when I take the Borel construction. And then, when I take the Borel construction with respect to this action, what I get is precisely x. Okay? So, this is another way of thinking of the mapping torus. It's a Borel construction. So, now we thought, okay, so how can we generalize these two Borel constructions? So, again, if I look at the cell spectral sequence for the vibration, for the vibration that the, well, actually, for the fiber bundle that determines the The Borel construction. In this case, in the spectral sequence, we're going to have in dimension three, in total dimension three, we're going to have four terms, but we will have now non-trivial differentials. Okay, in particular, we're going to have non-trivial differentials coming out of here and coming out of this guy. And we will have other differentials for this guy, but I don't care about that. You will see why. Okay, so. Okay, so because we have these terms, we have a filtration of this group that parametrizes the twistings from the Borel construction. And what we want to understand is this first term of the filtration. Okay, so what is this first term of the filtration? It's going to be determined by these two first ones. So let me tell you that in a bit more detail. So we have So we have a short exact sequence, and F1 is precisely the kernel of the map from the third cohomology group of the Borel construction to the E infinity 03 term. But because in that term, differential were only coming out of the E0323, etc. This is actually a subgroup of the fixed points, and this is actually a subgroup of the whole H3 of M and the composition is. three okay and the composition is just the restriction again so the f1 is really the projective bundles that are trivial over the file that's how you can think of the of the f1 and now we want to realize these bundles and that's not so easy anymore now you'll see why now on f1 we have From F1, we have a map to this term in the infinity page of the spectral sequence, and again, from that spot in the spectral sequence, perhaps I can go back. This is not back, this is forward, sorry. Yeah, from this part of the spectral sequence, you only have differentials coming out. So you again have that this infinity term is a subgroup of this. And this is a similar thing to what we had before. So this is what we want to realize. So one can think, okay, So, one can think, okay, perhaps you have a splitting here. Not that I know. So, we don't really have a splitting. But this is the idea. We want to start on elements in here and construct projective boundaries. Now, instead of thinking of the infinity term, which is kind of complicated because we don't know well what the differentials do, let's think of the term that you have. Think of the term that you have in the spectral sequence before you take the kernels, which is just group cohomology. And the first group cohomology can be put in terms of derivations. It's just derivations over principal derivations. And so what we thought about here is to rigidify what a derivation is. So instead of taking derivations into the homotopy classes, Into the homotopy classes, take derivations into the space of maps. Now, this is a bit awkward because this space is no longer an abelian group, okay, but it's still a group. You have multiplication given by multiplication of PUH. Now, because it's not abelian, coming out with the adequate definition of derivation, it takes a few tries, but after a few tries, this was the convenient one. So, on the product, you need to have this. So on the product, you need to have this relationship, and has to send then the trivial element to the constant map that sends all the elements of M to the trivial element of PUH. Okay, so this is probably a bit strange. Why would you do that? I thought so too. The first time I saw it. But then we realized that this was the right thing to do. Because when you have such a derivation, you can define an action on G on M times P U H in this way. And this first condition here guarantees that this is an action. Well, also in the second for the one, but the important one is the first. And now, with this, you can now do a Borel construction. Okay, but a Borel construction. Okay, but our L construction using this action for m times puh. Imagine puh is a PM. Yeah. So the formula looks awkward. It doesn't look awkward because when you act on the space of maps, you act by conjugation. So this action is actually the action that you will have when you multiply on a space of maps. That you will have when you multiply on a space on maps. The only thing that is awkward is that they are in a different way. When you think about derivations, you will think of D of G H is D of G plus G times D H. So this is like that. This is D of G times G times DH. Only the action is becoming like this because you have to act on the other side. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so it's not that strange. Okay, so now one can check that this is a principal PUH bundle over the Boreal construction and that is trivial over the five. So this is nice. It's very similar to what we did before. So in fact, we are getting an element whose isomorphism class is classified by the element by a By the LM by a class in the first filtration that I mentioned earlier. So we achieved that part. We are getting in the first filtration. Is every map rectifiable? Not that we know of, probably not. This is a problem. But of course, we don't expect every map to be rectifiable because we only expect to get maps that are in the E infinity term. And you know, they are non-trivial differentials. So not every map will be. Also, we don't know if every element of the E infinity. If every element of the infinity can be reached with this construction, so what we guarantee with this construction is that we land in this infinity term. But we don't know if every element of there can be constructed in this way. Okay, so let me give you an example. Of course, the ones that I mentioned earlier is a particular case of this, but just a different one. So I'm going to let the I'm going to let the C square act on the two-dimensional sphere by the antipodal map, you know, depending on the parity of M plus M. And if I take the classified map of the tatological complex line bundle over S2, that is the H that I mentioned earlier, I can define a derivation. And in fact, this derivation of line bundles are determined. Are determined when I shouldn't say that, but this is a derivation that comes from C. So this is, you can check that this defines actually a derivation, it's not completely trivial. And when you do the principal pH bundle that I constructed, this is a case when this is not trivial. Okay? I'm not going to tell you now why, but a reason is that when you compute the twisted K-theory with respect to this projective bundle, it's different from the untwisted K-theory. Which I think is nice because to start with, we don't know if this construction could give you a trivial boundary. So that was nice. Okay, and moreover, this construction does precisely what we want. I mean, it's compatible with what we want. I mean, we start with a derivation on line bundles. This is giving you a projective bundle, which is trivial when you restrict to the fiber. So we are landing in a. Rose three to the fiber, so we are landing in F1, and then we have a map from F1 to this infinity term, which is a subgroup of this guy. But of course, there is another way more direct to go from here to H1, which is if you have a derivation of line bundles, you can take any map and send it to this homotopy class. And that will give you a derivation now in the classical sense. So you get an element of H1, and both ways of going around. And both ways of going around the diagram give you the same. So, this is a commutative diagram, which is nice. Okay, so this means that geometrically we are achieving what the spectral sequence is telling us. Okay. Let me talk about a particular case, which perhaps can be a bit enlightening. Imagine that we have trivial actions. that we have trivial action if we have a trivial action because g is not acting on m i can take it out and in fact what i have is that this is a in a bagetic correspondence from maps from m to the space of homomorphisms from g to puh it's not hard to check um and now you can think okay what happens if i take a constant If I take a constant map on the right. So if I take a constant map, when I take the Borel construction, because the action is trivial and this H is not depending on F, because before we have a map from M to P U H, but now this doesn't depend on M. I can take it out of the Borel construction. So this projective bundle, it only depends on this part really. And this is a projective bundle over BG. So it turns out that this leaves in F3, because if you think of the F3 term, it's the one that comes from H3 of Bg coefficients in H2. Okay, and we don't have Bogomolov multiplier, but we have Schur multiplier here, close enough. If you look at the two cos cycle of this projective representation, H. H this gives you an element in the Schug multiplier. This gives you an element of the H3 of the classified space. And this is the element that classifies the bundle when I forget this part. Okay. So in fact, this bundle is trivial if and only if this co-cycle is trivial, which I think is nice and reasonable. Okay. Okay. Now, the main part of the work by Alfred in his thesis was actually to develop a spectral sequence to compute the twist decay theory with respect to these kind of bundles. And we were surprised that, you know, when we look for the twist decay theory of a fiber bundle, we have analogs of the set spectral. We have analogs of the cell spectral sequence, but they are very restricted analogues. So there is a result by May and what's the name of the guy? Sorry. Okay, so there is this book, Parametrized Homotopy Theory by May and Sigurdson, Sigurdson, where they have a version of the set spectral sequence for, in general, any twisted cohomology theory. It's done very general, but in that case, you will. In that case, you want to have a twisting that comes from the basis, and in our case, our twistings do not have to come from the basis in general. So that spectral sequence doesn't apply. But you can sort of do the same machinery. Of course, you have to go into the gaps of spectral sequences, which is always annoying. But if you do the usual filtration of the bases by the skeleton, The skeleton, yeah, you get a filtration and you get a spectral sequence for that. And the nice thing about this spectral sequence is that it's converging to twisted K-theory, but what you have on this side is untwisted. So it's group cohomology with coefficients in the untwisted K-theory of M. But the change is that the action is not just the action, the monotromy action. So you have the monotromy action, which is this one, but you also have the action given. One, but you also have the action given by multiplying by kg. And here again, I'm thinking of kg that you can think as a map of from m to puh, but you can also think of it as the line battery. So you're multiplying by that line battery. Okay. And well, I guess this is just another way of putting this, but in a way, what we are doing is having a way of computing Borel equivariant twisted k fix points. Perhaps the other way around. Twisted or el-equivariant k-fields. And I have to say that, you know, this is not what you will usually do. I mean, you usually prefer not Borel, but equivariant K-theory. But equivariant K-theory behaves well when you have a compally group, a finite group. But in our examples, our groups were not compact. Our groups were not compact, were C or C square, or they also work very well for free groups. And in those cases, when you want to do equivariant K-theory without doing Borel construction, you need to restrict yourself to proper actions. And here we don't have to restrict to proper action. The action could be whatever. And in fact, from the definition that we have of derivation of line bundles, it seems that this process is more adequate for groups without torn. Adequate for groups without torsion than groups with torsion. But this is, I mean, just because we haven't been able to find any nice, non-trivial examples for finite groups, but perhaps there are. Okay, so using this spectral sequence and going back to this example that I mentioned earlier, we computed this twisted K-theory with respect to these projective bundles, and we found that it's C-square. We found that is C squared in both dimensions, dimension zero and one. And this one, you can also do it with this spectral sequence, although in this case, it's very bad because you have very many differentials. But you can also do it with the Atijah-Hiris group spectral sequence. And that's easier to do, and you see that they are different. And this is a way of showing that PK is not trivial. And we have other examples that we have. I'm not going to show them, but just. Have, not going to show them, but just computation. You know, one reason to consider just compact houser spaces, not consider to do a more general thing, is precisely so that we can do computation, so that we have precise vector bundles that we can work with. It is the antipodal action, but depending on the parity of M Ling, yes. Yeah, so essentially the computation, the group cohomology computation reduces to a computation of cohomology over C over 2. But then you have an extension where the action is trivial, which is on the even integers. Anything in your mind? I don't know what was the previous thing. You said mentioned previously, but I think K it was previously. Oh, so the K. Oh, so the K, let me return to that. Thank you for asking. So the K was this one. So you take the derivation that is determined by putting on the generators the tautological line band. Yep. So you're proving this last sentence now. Yes, that's right. Okay, so let me go forward and not so much. Yeah, so this is precisely a proof of that, that this PK is not trivial. We have other examples where PK is not trivial, although they are, I guess, more trivial to prove. Are, I guess, more trivial to prove than this way, because they are the cases where the group gives the integers, in which case this is just the mapping torus from the beginning, or where it's a free group. And in the case of a free group, it's just a bunch of mapping tori that you glued together from the beginning. I mean, still fun, but not this is more complicated, I guess. Okay, so how long to account? Okay. Okay, so after this, we Okay, so after this, we have some questions. Even in the case of the mapping torus, it will be nice to know if this short exact sequence that we have splits or not. I mean, we think that it doesn't split, even though the examples that we did, they all do. What we're thinking about is the two cycles that determine this extension, whether this could be expressed in terms of f and the line boundary. I don't know, maybe. This question came up earlier, right? We don't know if we are hitting all the elements of E infinity one, two. Okay? But of course, I think we don't because we are considering here very rigid elements. So it would be nice to sort of make this definition of or make a less rigid definition of this derivation of line bundles. Online bundles that kind of lift the homotopy classes to something, but in such a way that you still manage to get to fall into the kernel of these differentials. I think we were lucky in a way that we landed in the kernel of the differentials using this rigidified version, but maybe there is something deeper here that we still don't understand. And of course, once you understand Once you understand the fibration, the filtration F1, of course, we would like to understand F2 as well. F3, in a way, we understand because they are just projective bundles that are pulled back from VG. But also, we have the original question, you know, whether this map from E1 to infinity to the third cohomology group. No, sorry, we have the other way around. We have the map from F1 to this term. To this term, and we don't know if that splits or not. But if f2 and f3 are zero, that splits. In fact, it will be an isomorphism, it will be isomorphic to the f quantum. So, in that case, we should be able to realize all the elements in there. Yeah, we haven't been able to see geometrically what happens in those cases. And there is a deeper question, which is now think of when you have. Which is now think of when you have both, when you have Borel equivalent K-theory and non-Borel, the usual equivariant K-theory. Of course, in that case, you want to have a finite group so that equivariant K-theory behaves well. And it turns out that twistings for the Borel construction also corresponds to equivariant twistings for M. There is a one-to-one correspondence. And in fact, the correspondence is given by Borel construction. But the problem is that we are already building. The problem is that we are already building a projective bundle over here, and this is not precisely the Borel construction of a project of an equivariant projective bundle over n. It should be isomorphic to one of them, but we haven't been able to find it. But if we have that, now we will have two different equivariant twisted case theories, the Borel one and the non-Borel one. And the non-Borel one also has a very natural spectral sequence converging. A very natural spectral sequence converging to it, which is given now in terms of twisted redon cohomology. Okay, now from what happened in the Borel case, one would expect that this should also correspond to a non-twisted pedon cohomology. I think it is, it should be non-twisted. But anyway, this is a question for. A question for later. Okay, and I guess this is all I have to say. So now, yes, thank you. Okay, technically, okay, so Perfect, okay. So, thank you very much. Thank you so much for the nice talk. Let's see. Uh, is there any zoom audience? Questions? Okay, it looks like nothing from the Zoom audience. Uh, how about questions from the room? So, two questions. One for Maria is that you said it. You said it that all differentials are put under the rock. But when you had these calculations of these K-theory groups, what happened with the differentials? I'm assuming you had them, but in these specific twistings, how the differential is, the D3? Because of the dimensions you chose. The other question is. The other question is: one could try to do these derivations in a simpler case, which is not K-theory, but vector bundles with a specific rank, U2, U3, U4, U5. Without thinking in K-theory terms, then maybe one can construct them at some low level and not stabilize the problem. Simply leave it as simple as algebraic as possible. As puelas, as algebraic as possible, or geometric spositions, perhaps that one could do something there. Okay, that could be actually useful for the case of finite groups. Exactly. Because for finite groups, you have torsion in the Fair Cohemology group. So, yeah. Yes, exactly. But for those cases, for this twisting cluster, yeah. But nothing else. Thanks for the suggestion. Other questions? Well, this is not a well, it's a particular question. A particular question. Somehow I read from Sullivan that the homology of PPU in A degree with sytatrico physics has a generator. So I don't know if there is a way to relate that with the twisting and that gives you some not trivial representation of K-theory. Okay, so you say the H3 of BPUH? The eighth homology of BPU. homology of vpu with theta three coefficients seta three coefficients yeah see uh ceta three c over three c three yeah with integral coefficients you have the then the one induced by the identity map from bpu to bpu um that is a generator of h three and then it will give you a generator of h three lower three but with three over three i i don't know i never thought about that no I don't know. I never thought about that. Well, that's a volume. Yeah. That is not representative representation. Any other questions? Okay, so let's thank Jose Maria again.
