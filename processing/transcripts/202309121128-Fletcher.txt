All right. It's a great pleasure to be here. My thanks to the organizers for arranging beautiful weather in addition to a beautiful place. So today I want to talk about polymers on surfaces. This is a little simulation of a few polymers, a big polymer and a small polymer on a surface, and some hard spheres that are constrained to be nearby but aren't able to get all the way to the surface, which is the lower portion here. And I want to relate this to a And I want to relate this to cell surfaces. Now, to take a step back, I've been interested in actin networks for a long time, one of the two primary filament networks in cells. Oh, wait, wait, there are three. They're septins. That's right. I forgot. So, what fascinated me for so many years about Actin has been its ability to dynamically assemble, respond to forces. Respond to forces, rearrange, reorganize. And its role in cells primarily is to push membranes. So polymerizing branched actin networks, the leading edge of crawling cells, helps to move them forward. But if you look about five nanometers beyond the branched, the barbed end of that filament, you're going to see the surface of the cell, the polymers that are on the surface of the cell. Cell, the polymers that are on the surface of the cell. And this has been of growing interest to me about how exactly they work, what role they're playing, and that's what I want to focus on today. So if you do a Google image search for plasma membranes, you'll come up with an image that looks like this. And it's correct in some respects. It does have a phospholipid bilayer. There are some transmembrane proteins and a glycan or two, but it misses. Or two, but it misses the mass of proteins and glycans that are on the surface and form the glycocalyx, or generally the molecular coverage of the cells. Now, these molecules can vary in height from something that is really just above the surface, a small loop perhaps, to hundreds of nanometers above the cell surface. They can have densities on. They can have densities on the scale of 20 to 30,000 molecules per square micron, and that's about 30% coverage just at the base of the protein, not counting all the fluctuations. And the genome, the human genome, has about 3,000 distinct proteins that are on the cell surface. And so cells choose from among those about what to display. So, out of curiosity to know what are the sizes. What are the sizes of these proteins in the genome? We looked at all proteins just computationally and made estimates of their sizes using homology modeling and thanks to AlphaFold. And the distribution of predicted heights looks something like this. You get quite a few proteins that have something small associated with them, and that could be just a loop extending above, or maybe this is a pore with relatively little. Pore with relatively little extracellular mass. And then you have a series of these kind of peaks, or what look like peaks, as you go to larger and larger proteins. And those somewhat correlate with domains, the number of domains in the cell surface. Now, these domains, one, two, three, four, they go on and on. There's some proteins with 20 Ig-like domains. Like domains. And it raises a lot of questions in my mind about evolution, what has driven this expansion of the number of domains, the sizes of the polymers on cell surfaces. But today I want to talk about the physical properties of those polymers. You can think about them to some extent like hair on our heads. I look around the room. There are a variety of different hairstyles. Some generated through great concern each morning. Concern each morning, like Paul's. Some really benign neglect, like mine, and some need not, like Dave, need not worry too much about Dave. And I wonder if cells have that same decision-making process. How much do they display? Which ones, what needs to be regulated? And if you take a look at macrophages, which are a cell type that we look at to Type that we look at to understand aspects of cell surface proteins. There are a variety of different sizes that are critically important to get in signaling activation in these cell types. So cells color the hair? What's that? Cells color the hair? This is artificial color. So yeah, but I wouldn't doubt it. I don't know the way of like declarations. There you go. There you go. You go. There you go. So they range anywhere from single-domain proteins like CB47, which is the marker of self, which makes sure that your immune cells don't eat your own cells, the FC receptor, which I'll come back to in a little bit, that's the thing that binds to antibodies that interact with cell surfaces. SERB alpha interacts with CB47 to turn off any immune response. Then you have ciglex, transmembrane phosphatase that's really tall. Memory phosphatase that's really tall, and this complement receptor, which is taller still. So, what is this polymer network that we have on our cell surfaces? This glycocalyx, what are its properties, and how do we think about it? Now, these are important because cells have to come together. And usually, diagrams of cell-cell interfaces look something like this, which have highlighted the key molecules that are involved in an interface. Typically, they're stretched. Typically, they're stretched to make sure that they all fit nicely within that gap so that membranes can be flat. But this misses the thousands of other proteins that are present, even in the square micron of interest at an interface. And it raises questions about how the organization of the cell surface could influence the ability to form junctions and the ability for soluble molecules like antibodies. Soluble molecules like antibodies or growth factors or other signals to get to the plasma membrane where receptors can be. So, I want to touch on three different topics quickly, all under the umbrella of understanding the properties of the cell surface. And what I hope to do is bring some of the tools from thinking about setoskeletal polymers to the cell surface, thinking about their mechanics. Surface, thinking about their mechanical properties, thinking about their collective behavior. So I'll talk first about a ways of characterizing these cell surface molecules individually, and then quantifying their collective behavior, and then an example of where this is important in an immune function. Okay, so we started out a couple years ago thinking about quantifying cell surface molecules and specifically the height. And specifically, the heights of those molecules. I showed you a computational prediction of the heights, but measuring them is actually quite challenging because electron microscopy, you may be able to freeze a particular configuration, but you don't know something about their average extension. And so the dimensions that we're interested in, from a few nanometers to hundreds of nanometers, are not always within the range that optical microscopy can work effectively. Microscopy can work effectively. So we developed an approach that basically uses super-resolution microscopy twice, once to identify where is the membrane and once to identify where is the tip of a molecule. You can either engineer a label on the tip of that molecule or you can use an antibody to tag that molecule. And then by basically throwing away XY information and just averaging Z information, you can get very precise measures of height. Measures of height. And those measures of height let us characterize specific molecules, how tall are they on average in the context of either an in vitro setting or a live cell setting. How do you know that the endpoints of the molecule don't fall back inside? So they will, for synthetic polymers, it's well known, but many of them are fall back inside. So it's a pretty uncertainty. Yeah, so what we're looking at is an average. So, what we're looking at is an average. So, we're looking at the average extension. So, they're going to be fluctuating, they're anchored to a surface. And maybe an example, I'll show you an example right here. So, these are synthetic proteins that we've engineered to have a tag at one end and to bind to a membrane. And then we just increase the number of domains in those. And those are undoubtedly fluctuating all around. And we're taking a time average of where that fluorescent signal is. Signal is. And so we know from that time average height where that is. And actually, from that, and from knowing what the fully extended height is, we can back out what the persistence length is of that polymer, if we treat it as a worm-like chain. And so that's what actually this is showing. If we assume a certain persistence length, we can match the measured height data versus the fully extended data. But this is accounting for. Extended data, but this is accounting for the fact that it is likely fluctuating and the end is touching the surface in some situations. These are low densities? So if we change the density, perfect question. So if we change the density, then we see kind of an expected increase in the height of these molecules. So the average fluorescence now increases as the density increases. And again, this is the rule. And again, this is the red curve, is a simulation of what you might expect polymers of this sort to do as you increase their density. All of these polymers are bound by the end point. They're all bound by one end. They cannot. Well, it's a good question. I don't think in the densities that we're using, we use a polyhistidine tag to linker them to a surface. And then in cell membranes, which we've also Membranes, which we've also measured, and I'll show you in just a moment, those have a transmembrane domain, which means it's unlikely for them to get ejected. We have seen ejection when we use DNA with a cholesterol. That can actually increase the density and you actually see more and more in solution. So that pressure is driving extension as well. Do you take into account other stuff that the cells might secrete, like hyaluronic acid, like in parasolium and acids? So we have it in these in vitro experiments, but I'll show you measurements on live cell membranes that will include all of those. So being able to ask how each of these components influence the height of a given molecule is something that we're actively working on now. So lateral crowding can influence the height? Oops, sorry. Yeah. Is the surface here liquid-like, and does that affect anything about the crowding physics? Great question. So, yes. Great question. So, yes, the base of the polymers can move around laterally. And that, at least in simulations, that is going to give it a different behavior than if it were anchored on the points. These are, the diffusion is going to be limited somewhat by the glass surface in these experiments. And on cell membranes, the potential for the polymer to be tethered to the cytoskeleton or otherwise restricted could influence that. But in theory, they can. Influence that, but in theory they can move around. So the lateral crowding is something that you can see as you expect the brush to extend the end of the polymers. You also see kind of a solution crowding. If you put solutes in this in vitro setting, you see actually that the average height of the polymers goes down and shrinks. So that approach lets us take a measurement on real cell surfaces. On real cell surfaces. So we can use the same approach of labeling the membrane, labeling the tip of the polymer, and then ask where things are. And so this is looking at a target cell that is a cancer cell that's expressing HER2. And so an anti-HER2 antibody would be used in a therapeutic sense to target a cell like this. What's interesting is that the antibody binding to HER2 Binding to HER2 is down below five nanometers from the membrane surface on average. And if you randomly biotinylate all surface proteins, so this is not biased to any one protein, you get an average measure of height of about 15 nanometers tall. And if you look at some glycosylation of calc acids, you will be able to see that it's even taller still. That's even taller still. And there's a difference in where the glycosylation is that you can, on average, see in measurements like this. And if you look at the macrophage, the macrophage side, the key molecule is the FC receptor there, which is going to bind to that antibody. And if we label the FC receptor basically with an antibody, we see that it is also on the scale of five nanometers from the membrane. Whereas the molecules all around it, including critically important CB45, Critically important CD45 are 15 to 20 nanometers above. So the picture I'm trying to paint is that in order for a macrophage to find this cancer cell, it has these two polymer networks on a cell surface that have to be pushed out of the way in order for the engagement of the FC receptor with the antibody. And therein lies a role for actin. Now, being able to quantify height is helpful. To quantify height is helpful and it can allow us to back out some mechanical properties. And some ongoing work in this direction of trying to characterize molecules on cell surfaces is to be able to directly determine whether flexibility has changed. And the flexibility of cell surface proteins can change either because they are crowded in these simulations, or they can be cross-linked. And so it's not necessarily looking. And so it's not necessarily local density that's preventing them in this simple way, but there can be more complex organization cross-linking like galactins will bind to the glycosylation on different proteins and anchor them together. So we'd like to be able to know whether there's flexibility, even in molecules that are constrained. And so we've been setting up a system, I'll show you very preliminary results on this, where we can try to quantify using To quantify using polarization microscopy, how much anisotropy is there in a measurement of the fluctuations of a polymer and the fluorophore at the end. So simply by imaging two polarizations, exciting the molecule in a polarized way, looking at two polarizations, we can back out and compare to simulations how the flexibility, the persistence. The persistence length divided by the length, LP over L, how that influences the expected anisotropy of the fluorescent measurement from the tip. And we've done some measurements now with just DNA, where as you increase, if you start with a fluorophore anchored to the end of a lipid, you have your anisotropy is high, meaning that. High, meaning that where the molecule started, as you image, it doesn't explore a lot of space because it's more rigidly anchored. But as you extend the number of base pairs between the lipid and the tip, now the orientation of the fluorophore, the orientation of the emission of the photons now is mixed up more, and you get less and less anisotropy. So, this is kind of a solution anisotropy measurement now done. Measurement now done on a surface. We're not trying to extend that to proteins. Always assume that you're following the sweet calendar proteins. Great question. So we can control that to some extent. Yes, yes. No, you're absolutely right. We assume repulsion in those simulations. We can add in an attraction to evaluate that. And in fact, in the negatively charged nucleic acids, and if you have a positively charged lipid, that's going to be a really significant factor. Point would be a really significant factor in that. So, adding those is something we want to do. Would it be possible to do kind of like a time-resolved version of this, especially at the dynamics of the way going in? We'd love to do that. We haven't set something up yet. So, I'd love to talk with you about that. So, right now, we're using a very simple system where we're just imaging over a relatively short exposure time on a camera with a spinning disk. But we now have a lifetime setup that we're interested in. Lifetime setup that we're interested in doing exactly this far. Okay, so characterizing individual molecules is helpful to understand more about this network and what its behaviors are. But we have an interest in understanding collective properties as well. And the collective property of most interest to me is this concept of crowding. If I have a whole bunch of molecules in one space, In one space on the surface, what does that do? But also, how can I even characterize gravel? Is it the number density? Is it the height? Is it the charge or like oscillation? It's probably all of those things together. And so how do we get a broad metric of crowding of these, this system all together? So the approach we've used is basically to explore exclusion of something that should be able to bind. That should be able to bind in this network of fluctuating polymers. And so, here's just a generic example: let's say there's an antibody targeting something on a surface, and I have my set of cell surface proteins fluctuating around. That's going to lead to some cost for this soluble molecule to be at the surface. Now, it has some affinity there, so once it binds, it'll stay, but there's a repulsion. But there's a repulsion that keeps it from wanting to be there. And we can again do simulations. This was work done by postdocs Sho Takatori and Sunmin Son. And in a bare surface, if you ask, you know, something that has an affinity to the surface, it will diffuse in and then bind. But something that has a, where there's crowding, there's repulsion. It's less likely to bind. And you can capture that. To bind. You can capture that in a modification of the dissociation constant relative to what it would be if it were bare. So we can think about just a ratio, how much has our dissociation constant increased as a result of having something on the surface. We can both simulate this. So, this is just different polymer lengths that suggest as you increase the surface density, you may expect to see increased in You would expect to see an increase in dissociation content or constant. And we can do that experimentally in a very simplified format by taking a glass bead, coating it with a lipid bilayer, and then binding to it different fluorescent molecules. So if we have crowding on the surface due to a peg with a fluorophore or different depth strands with peg on them, we can see different amounts of. See different amounts of change in the dissociation constant. And this is pretty modest because these are relatively small molecules. So if we try and increase the concentration of PEG 0.5K, so really small peg on the surface, we see relatively little change in the dissociation constant. But if we start crowding on there larger and larger molecules, we see more of an impact on the dissociation constant. Does it make sense to play with the thermodynamics? Sense to play with the thermodynamics? Like, this seems there's gated reaction theory where you know you've got actocytes which are open and close sometimes, and binding of substrates, the kinetics is varied by those rates, but it doesn't change the binding community according to that, what the basis for that is. So, I guess the binding sites are always available, but in order for this next one to be inserted, it has to do work to It has to do work to exclude the ones that are there. But then the thing about the off-rate, is the off-rate not a little lower? Because, ah, maybe there's stuff over top I want association house. The off-rate's lower. So I guess we've affecting both ways. Yeah, it would make sense that it would affect both ways. I guess what we see is the combination of the two. We see the resulting concentration on the surface as a function of. On the surface, as a function of the concentration in solution. And so I think we can see that there is a reduction in the amount that goes on as a function of how much we put in there. We can do this as well with other polymers. So I told you about these fibronectin domain repeats that we measured the heights of. If we use those as our crowding agents and ask how some other solute that can bind to the membrane, what effect does that have? What effect does that have? We see a little bit more pronounced effect on the Haden, so maybe a doubling of the Haden. And again, on-rate versus off-rate is something we should explore further. Now, in order to do this in live cells, those were just simulated systems. If we wanted to do this in live cells, we need some way of providing a binding site for something we could measure the amount of. And so the approach there is a little to get. There is a little DNA oligo with a cholesterol anchor. It's fluorescently labeled, so we know how much of the probe is present on the cell surface. And then we dump in an antibody that is also fluorescently labeled, and it binds to a little biotin that's inside that DNA oligon. So this is something that can be simply added to cells. You don't need to engineer the cells at all. You can use kind of wild-type cells or primary cells. And what you get is when you And what you get is, when you image them, is you get a certain signal of how much is present of your probe, and then what is essentially the occupancy of your antibody. And the idea is that if you have a more crowded environment, then your occupancy of the antibody is going to go down. It's going to be harder for the binding or the dissociation constant will be larger. Now, we can see that in red blood cells if we, so this is a So, this is a crowding sensor. The slope here is basically the occupancy. So, if you have high occupancy, the slope is low. And if you have low occupancy, the slope is, oh, I think I had that opposite. If you have high occupancy, the slope is high. If you have a low occupancy, the slope is low. And this is a bead like the previous experiments, the lipid-coated bead, where the sensor can bind and the antibody can easily bind. Can bind and the antibody can easily bind. And then we use a red blood cell, we see a significant reduction in how much, in proportion to the number of anchors, how much of the antibody is violent. And we can do that actually for a range of different cells. And what we find is a pretty large variation in how quote-unquote crowded is this cell surface. Now, this doesn't require the crowding to be numbered. Require the crowding to be number density or height or charge for this particular probe. We see these range in Kg. And you'll notice it's also on the scale of 10 to 15, which is quite a bit larger than any of our experiments in lab. So the crowding on a real cell surface is quite substantial. And we've been using this now to explore a few different processes that cells undergo. One area of interest has been. Ago, one area of interest has been membrane fusion for a number of years. And what we're finding is that if you track the surface density, or not surface density, I have to correct myself all the time, the surface crowding using this sensor where this is crowded, so the low ratio is crowded, and the high ratio is less crowded. As these cells, these myoblasts mature and develop, they undergo fusion. They undergo fusion right around this day 10 period. That's when you start to see multinuclein in cells. And that's also where you see a drop in the density of the cell surface or the crowding of the cell surface, at least as measured by this probe. And so we're exploring whether this process, the cell surface, is itself something that cells regulate, either developmentally or in response to fuse, because that's going to influence the ability for them to make content. To influence the ability for them to make contacts or for soluble molecules to bond. Okay, and then quickly, the last example of where sceric barriers like the presence of these polymers on surfaces can be important is in macrophage phagocytosis. So we rely on our macrophages for lots of things, pathogen clearance. Now with immunotherapies, tumor killing is important. And understanding And understanding what activates macrophages is something that we can do either with live cells, but it helps us to pick apart the details of what's important about the target or what's important about the macrophage by using some synthetic systems. So we use a bead, we coat it with a lipid bilayer, and then we can change lipids or attach proteins, and they can be proteins that the macrophages bind to, like antibodies, or they can just be what I call bystander. Just be what I call bystander proteins. Other proteins that happen to be there of different sizes but aren't essential for the process of phagocytosis. And then you can use this. If you add more antibody, you get more phagocytosis. It's well known as you have no antibody, you get more limited phagocytosis. So we can use that, and we used this a few years ago to ask the question about does the antigen that an antibody binds to, the That an antibody binds to, the molecule on the target cell surface, does it matter how tall that polymer is? And what we found by using the same synthetic system and now putting these multi-domain synthetic proteins with an antibody epitope right at the end, so the antibody binds to the tip of this protein. We keep the number density the same on the beads, but we just change the height of that protein. And what we find is that it dramatically. And what we find is that it dramatically influences the ability to phagocytose because for long polymers with the antibody at the tip, you get very little phagocytosis, but for short polymers you get very high phagocytosis. And mechanistically, it turns out this is because when, in order for the FC receptor to signal, you need a phosphatase to be displaced from nearby that receptor. And that phosphatase has a large. And that phosphatase has a large ectodomain. So, this is the CB45 that I showed you in one of the earlier diagrams. And if you have a tall antigen, you set up a large gap between the surfaces, and CD45 is allowed to be in that space. But if you have a shorter gap with a short antigen, then CB45 gets excluded, and now the FC receptor can signal down screen. So that's a role for height. So that's a role for height. What about crowding? So, this is work we've been doing more recently. So, let's take our beads that we have put an antibody on, but now let's put things around it. So, if we have bystander proteins that are not immunogenic, the macroc could care less that they are there, as we change, as we add those, we see a reduction in the amount of phagocytosis. And this seems to And this seems to scale with both the number densities, so how many we put on the cell surface, as well as the height. So if we keep the number density the same but increase the height, that also limits the ability to phagocytose. So it's this combination of number density and height is going to influence the ability for macrophage to engage with its target and therefore to phagocytose. Now, so Now, so this is just an example, a simple example of a steric barrier preventing antibodies from being bound. And you can imagine that this is the antibody is on your HER2 molecule, which is short, and your FC receptor, which is also short. And they're all surrounded by these tall proteins. But, you know, they need to engage somehow. So, how can that process be overcome? Clearly, it is because it just can clear. Because bacrophages can clear these tumor cells. So, the actincytoskeleton is going to play a role. But I think there's also some interesting possibilities with the self-surface proteins as well. So, imagine if you had a long adhesion that was longer than the bystander protein. So, you want to set up a scenario where you have your short molecule you're trying to bind. You have on both sides, you know, a medium-sized molecule. Medium-sized molecules that are blocking the ability to eat the object directly. And then you have a tall binder on top of that. So the question is, will a tall binder help? Now, at first glance, I would think that having some stable state here where these molecules are bound and that's holding the gap between those cell surfaces. Between those cell surfaces further away, that that's not going to be a very helpful thing. That's going to stop you from phagocytosis. Another possibility is that you do bind there, but that then somehow promotes the engagement of the receptor. And so we've tried this experimentally using on the MAC reach surface, they express PSGL1, which is the receptor for P-selectam. And so we can put P-selectam just on these beads. Just on these beads. So they've got an antibody, but they've also got those P-selectin. So two ways to bind to the macrophage. And when we add P-selectin, a certain amount of P-selectin, we see a recovery of the ability to phagocytose. So let me walk you through this. If we have just the antibody, we have good phagocytosis. If we have no antibody, the macrophages love to eat things, and so they will still eat some of the beads. If we have only the If we have only the PSLG, P-selectin, so P-selectin is what's on the bead, so it's the other kind of antibody, you do get phagocytosis, just not as much as if you have the antibody. If you now add these blocking proteins, which are shorter than P-selectin, they block the antibody. If you just add the blocking proteins with the Proteins with the antibody, then you suppress down to background levels of phagocytosis. And then you add P-selectin back into this. So now we've got the three molecules, antibody, blocker, P-selectin. And you start to recover up to a point. If you do too much P-selectin, then you taper off. Now, what that suggests is that somehow you're getting over this steric barrier. And so that was. And so that was the engagement. Sorry, I didn't clarify that. This was just the binding. So if we look at low temperatures, we just look at them interacting, we want to see whether the engagement is changing. So you do get some engagement. And if you look at the phagocytosis, then you see that there is a pronounced increase when you engage with the P-selectin present on the target. So somehow having a total Hardly. So somehow having a tall binder helps, even though what you need is to have this short interface to exclude CD45 and phagose codes. And so it seems to be biased in this direction. And to help us think about this, my late friend and colleague Phil Geisler developed a model to explain what's going on. And the general framework is this: you've got the macrophage when you have no long binders. You've got a macrophage. Long binders. You've got a macrophage, can interact with the antibody, but there is the presence of these crowding proteins that are not adhesive, that just are sterically blocking, that can interrupt the ability to get to this transition state and fully engage in phagocytosis. In the case of long binders, you have engagement of these tall molecules, and that tall molecule facilitates Facilitates the ability to get to this transition state and then to promote phagocytosis. And I will leave it as an exercise to the reader, and we can talk about this more during the break, that there are certain windows of lengths of the long binder and densities of the long binder where this is actually preferred. Now, you can, of course, have lengths and densities where this is much worse than this, but there are. Than this. But there is a regime where that is possible. And so it seems maybe that is one of the strategies that cells use to overcome this mass of molecules on its cell surface, is to have long binders that promote the engagement of short ones. Okay, so I will end there so we can get off to lunch. I want to thank my fantastic lab, and in particular, Sun Mun Son and Sho Takatori. And show a tutorial whose work I've highlighted here. Just very quick, so for you, power antigen that seems that phibocytosis are defined. So do you know at which stage that the phibocytosis are defined? That the phylocytosis inhibit. At the cup, always kind of what is still the view of. So the cup actually does not form. It's very early stages because the FT receptor does not signal downstream to actin to begin forming the cup. And that's because the phosphatase turns off the receptor. It needs to be phosphorylated in order to signal, and then it gets turned off into the. And we've shown that if you take a If you take that short antigen that does phagocytose well, but you make a CRISPR mutant of your CD45, you make CD45 short so that it no longer has this ectodomain to be squished out, now it blocks phagocytosis even if it's a short one. So it does seem to be the height of that other molecule that's important. I'm wondering about the length, as you sort of talked about this all in terms of length, but at the beginning. About this, all in terms of length, but at the beginning you were talking about persistence length and flexibility. Yes, right? So, you could imagine you could have a particular length of linker that is rigid versus the same average length on something that's much more flexible. Have you thought at all about how to distinguish the rollout tosses? So, we're really hoping that the combination of the flexibility measurement and the height measurement will give us a clue about whether a molecule of interest is behaving. A molecule of interest is behaving like something that's consistent with a worm-like chain with a defined persistence length, or if it has a much more interesting behavior. Because there are plenty of molecules that can interact with themselves, and those would not be expected to behave as these perfect polymers. And I think these kinds of self-interactions and the potential for binders, I think that's where the cell service becomes more of a network as opposed. Cell service becomes more of a network as opposed to just a set of discrete molecules. I think it's that network view that I'm particularly interested in. So what about the flexibility and less getting bagocytose? Ah, great question. Yes, that matters a lot. There's some very nice work from Julieterio showing that as you change the stiffness of a gel, it will, you, you, you. You modulate phagocytosis. We've actually seen that you can use giant vesicles, so floppy membranes, and if you put antibodies on those, the macrophages will actually tragocytose, which means they'll just nibble little bits off of the membrane in a membrane tension dependent manner. So if you have a high-tension giant vesicle, it will phagocytose. And if you decrease that, Those. And if you decrease that membrane tension, they'll start to pinch off little bits of the membrane. So the deformability does matter a lot. How that is detected, I don't know. You mentioned myosin, I guess, a little bit, but you didn't expand on that. I can see sort of a role for myosin with this anchoring story that if you support a piece of wood from a tree and you try to hit a nail into it, it's not going to work. But if you hold it, It's not going to work, but if you hold it with one hand and then you're trying to hit your nail, it's going to work. So, if myosin can act like a mechanical piston trying to push towards the membrane, and you hold the things together, that I could see. I think you're exactly right. I think it's that combination of adhesion, engagement, and maybe you latch yourself closer and closer. This may not be true for the protein linkers, but is there a role for this highly negatively charged okay link to the surface? Charged like okay, so the surface charges relevant here somehow? They are, so but not as much as I expected them to be. So we can take various enzymes and like de-glycosylate the cell surface and ask whether the height of protein has changed. That changes a little bit, but not a huge amount. I think it's probably going to be very specifically dependent on what process and which molecule we're looking at. So they're there. So they're there, they're glycosylated. It's probably for a reason, but I don't know if that we haven't found what that is. But you can't, for example, dry for effect was if there's divalent cations or anything like that, or polylycosine? We haven't tried changing soil conditions. Definitely increased adhesion does drive more phagocytosis. And so the potential for those to increase contact between surfaces. Increase contact between the surfaces, that probably would help.
