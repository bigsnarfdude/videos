Our last speaker is Rafael Winter from the University of Vienna, and he will talk about Velposness for the Lenard-Palesko equation with smooth interactions. Thank you. Thank you very much for the introduction, and also for all the organizers organizing this beautiful. All the organizers organizing this beautiful event here in Granada and giving me the opportunity to speak. So, today I'm going to talk about a result I obtained together with Mitia Durings from the Free University of Brussels. I'm actually also very happy that the organizers let me speak right after Megan, because a lot of the more difficult parts of difficult things to explain, she already explained very nicely before, so I can build on that. So let's start before because I Let's start because I believe that most of you will not be familiar with the Leonard Balesco equation. I'll tell you first where it comes from. So, as you maybe know, you could derive the Blasso equation that Megan was talking about before, at least formally from particle systems in a Meet the limit for the Coulomb potential that leads to the Blasso-Poisson equation. We're actually at the moment not able to do that rigorously, but in practice, for any interaction potential V, you can, the formal limit at least of The formal limit at least of this mean field n-particle system with point-wise interaction, pairwise interaction potential V, is the Blaster equation. Yeah, so I don't know if I can is it working? I was going to say, is it the right or the left one? In the center. Ah, in the center, that explains. Ah, yeah, it's very small. Okay. Okay, I'll just point with my hand or something. Shadow profits. Okay, so this is something that is a research line of its own, deriving that equation actually from particle systems. But I will consider a case where actually. But I will consider a case where actually the underlying probability distribution of my particle system is spatially homogeneous. So it's the same everywhere in space. And then that would make Megan's job a lot easier because then actually in that equation, all the terms disappear. I mean, all the spatial gradients are just zero. And then the equation is just dtf equals zero, and there's nothing to prove. However, if you rescale also time to times of order n, then you actually do see the collision between. You actually do see the collision between the particles and you obtain a collisional kinetic equation. Okay, and this collisional kinetic equation turns out to be the Bales-Colinar equation. Now you could tell me, okay, Rafael, you're crazy. You're telling me n is sort of the number of particles and you're scaling to times of order n, and n is typically, I don't know, whatever, astronomically large. But then, Megan already explained before, if you do this for the Brussels of Poisson problem, then actually your length. Some problem, then actually your length scale is the Debye length. n will correspond to the number of particles in the Debye sphere, and also your natural length scale is very short compared to the observation length. So n might be in practical application as small as 10. So it's not a completely observed limit we are taking here. And actually, some of this has been carried out rigorously. So the derivation of the kinetic equation that I have not shown you yet. And this was done by Mitya and Laura Saint-Raymond, where they showed that if you just Where they show that if you start with a particle system close to equilibrium, then you can derive some version of the Balles-Coulinar equation, although not on the time scale n, but on a slightly shorter time scale. That's also something that Mitya and I are still every now and again thinking about. And we have pushed this time scale that they had in the original paper a little bit, but we're not able yet to come to this kinetic time scale and hopefully in the future, but sort of this is not a problem. But sort of, this is not a problem that we're going to talk about right now. Okay, so let me introduce you to the equation. It's a non-linear parabolic equation, so it fits very well with the topic of this conference. And for those of you familiar with the Landau equation, it looks a lot like the Landau equation does. Just that this collision kernel B has an additional dependence on V. And this is given by, so that the main difference is. So, the main difference is this function epsilon here in the denominator, epsilon squared. And the Lambda equation that you're maybe more familiar with can actually be recovered by just removing that epsilon and setting it just to one. Okay, and this function here, this so-called dielectric function, might look very scary, but it's essentially just related to the dispersion relation of the underlying Vlassov equation. So, in particular, we will later sometimes be concerned with. Later, sometimes be concerned with that function epsilon degenerating. So, epsilon becomes zero, you see then the diffusion coefficient blows up. And that is related to these two stream instabilities that Megan was talking about before. So it would tell you that the linearized Lussov equation around the state f is unstable if we have actually a degeneracy of this dielectric function epsilon here. Okay, so there is really a Okay, so there is really a relation between the Bales-Coulana equation and the Vlasov equation, which maybe makes sense because we derived it sort of from the same limit, just on a different time scale. Keep in mind here, V is the interaction potential. And maybe also some small comment is that I wrote the equation that you get from the particle system for general interaction potentials, V, and you see that this prefactor 1 over V minus V star, the famous what they call Coulomb singularity in the Landau. Called Coulomb singularity in the Landau equation appears independent of which potential you take. So it appears also when you don't take the Coulomb potential, which is maybe a little bit of a strange nomenclature in the literature. So we will later consider relatively smooth potentials V, but we will still have the Coulomb type singularity in our diffusion coefficient. Okay, so let's just ignore that the formula is horrible and continue because quality. And continue because qualitatively, the equation has actually the same properties as the Landau equation, which I mean, it should. So it preserves mass, energy, and momentum. There is an H theorem, which essentially uses the proof is essentially the same. You just have to remember to not forget to write the epsilon. Otherwise, it's the same. It's positivity preserving, and at least also at equilibrium, the diffusion matrix has the same anisotropic structure as for the Landau equation. So there's a slightly strong. So there's a slightly stronger diffusion in the transversal to the radial direction than in the radial direction. And something that I appreciate a lot since I've recently worked on kinetic equations in biology is that you can actually use the H-theorem to find your equilibria explicitly. So you sort of get for free that the equilibria are the beasts that Juan Luis was talking about this morning. So they are the Maxwellian distributions with the given mass, momentum, and energy. With the given mass, momentum, and energy, which is preserved. So, if you know your initial datum, you know already if I converge to something, it can only be that piece. Um, and without loss of generality, I just normalized it to be my favorite one. Okay, and Michael and I were giving ourselves the task to say, okay, for the Lanau equation, there is this nice argument by Yang Guo from 2002. Can we do something similar for this equation and sort of complete the theory for the Linar-Balescu equation to the same state that we? Equation to the same state that we have for the Landau equation. Okay, let me first briefly speak about the results that are already known about the equation. So in plasma physics, you'll see it appear a lot because it has the advantage, which we will see later, that if you write down the diffusion coefficient for the physically relevant Coulomb case, you actually get a convergent expression at long distances, which you don't get for the Landau. Which you don't get for the Landau equation. So, in theoretical plasma physics, it's often the starting point. They write the Vales-Colinar equation and they start from there, taking limits or approximating here and there. But sort of for them, it's sort of the fundamental starting point in collisional plasma physics. But relatively less is known in mathematics. So I mentioned before the results of Mithier and Laure, where they derive the equation on a short time scale from particle systems in this mean field limit. From particle systems in this mean field limit. And also, in his PhD thesis, Bob Strain was actually looking at this equation and he had the same idea as us. Okay, he said, let's study first the linearized equation. If I have a nice spectral gap for the linearized equation, maybe I can solve the non-linear problem. And he found an exponential, actually, exponentially growing factor that destroyed sort of the whole argument, at least for going to the At least for going to the non-linear problem. So, in the Coulomb case, remember that's the potential V being the Coulomb potential. So, in that case, the only thing that is known is that the linearized equation is somewhat controlled. And then Mitya and I were both independently working on this. And finally, independently, people had told us that they believe the equation is even for smooth potential is ill-posed. Potential is still posed, and we met together because we were assigned to the same office in Lyon. And then we randomly discovered that we were working on the same equation, so we teamed up, and that's how this paper came to life. And in the end, in the title, I say smooth potentials, and the class of potentials that we are able to do is potentials that are isotropic, so radially symmetric, positive definite, so they need to have positive Fourier transfer. Definite, so they need to have a positive Fourier transform. They need to have two weak derivatives and need to be in L1, and we have one moment that we need. So I'm saying smooth, but they're not C infinity exactly, right? It's a lot rougher than that. Okay, let me briefly comment on why the Coulomb case is difficult. So let's again look at the diffusion coefficient of this equation. And okay, we know that in the Landau case, everything works fine. Our case, everything works fine. So, the difficulty needs to stem from this dielectric function epsilon. And it turns out that if you look at the asymptotics of this equation, it's a Hilbert transform of the gradient of f. And you can sort of get the asymptotics, at least for large v, of this dielectric function, and they look as follows. So, the real part of the function is just. The real part of the function is just 1 minus 1 over k squared v squared. And then there is an imaginary part, which is just given by the derivative or the gradient of f. And this is where the problem comes from. You see that if k tends to zero and v at the same time tends to infinity, then there are points where the real part will cancel out. The real part is zero exactly. And the only thing that prevents us from having zero in the dielectric constant is just the Dielectric constant is just the imaginary part, which is the gradient of our velocity distribution function. Which, as we also have discussed today many times, is typically a double exponential. So we will typically have a double exponential in the denominator somewhere. And this is the problem that Bob Strain was facing and why he, in the Coulomb case, could only do the linearized equation is actually given that single. Linearized equation is actually given that singularity is even surprising that that is even possible, right? On the other hand, if so, this I told you first now the bad news that there is this cancellation where you have a near degeneracy of the dielectric function. On the other hand, there's also good news. If you fix V and you let K go to infinity and you consider the Coulomb case, so the Fourier transform is one over k squared, then in principle, at first sight you have a problem integral. In principle, at first sight you have a problem integrating near k equals zero, but you see you're then faced by this function also blowing up and canceling out that singularity. And you can actually integrate the integral in k is convergent. And that's why the physicists like this equation, because this non-integrability for k small disappears for the Bales-Coulinar equation. Okay, this is the result that we were. This is the result that we got with Mitia. So, if we look at perturbations of our global equilibrium in a Sobolev space Hs with at least two derivatives, then we have a global in-time solution with controlled HS norm. If the solution furthermore has L velocity moments, we get L F order decay in time to the equilibrium. And if it has the initial data has exponential, Initial data has exponential moments, then we get stretched exponential decay to equilibrium for our solution. And there is another result. So this is close to equilibrium. You have to think f is small enough. I didn't actually put that, but it's very important information. So this only holds if f is very small. And away from equilibrium, so then we consider it sort of far away from the Maxwellian. Then if we have Then, if we have m here stands for our moment condition that we have on the initial data, we need at least three derivatives. And if we have a lower bound on the degeneracy of the dielectric function, we know that the function is somewhere in a ball bounded from below, and we have at least s plus one derivatives in this weighted sobola space. Then we have a strong solution, strong local. Strong local in-time solution for some time that depends on these constants, V, M, and S. Okay. And maybe some remarks. So the regularity, two weak derivatives could even be lowered a little bit. We believe that it's actually true if you only take three and three half derivatives. The only problem is that if you do in the energy estimates, you do some commutators, they become very ugly. You have to maybe work with Muchenhaupt weights or something like that. We didn't go through. Half weights, or something like that. We didn't go through the ordeal of doing that actually. This maybe strange-looking condition that the Fourier transform of the potential needs to be positive actually comes from the fact that otherwise the dielectric function evaluated at the Maxwellian is not bounded from below. So it's sort of natural. And maybe also some remark because I was asked a lot if we can also cover the spatially inhomogeneous case. And probably we do using Google's smart technique. Using Google's smart technique on sort of getting it more or less a posteriori. But we didn't actually look at that very much because, in the physics literature, the spatially inhomogeneous cases is almost never considered. I think it has to do with the fact that you would have to be very lucky that the spatial inhomogeneities of your system are exactly on the length scale of the mean-free path, which in typical plasmas will not happen. So maybe what you Will not happen. So, maybe what one could expect is actually that the collision operator on the observation length just then or on the length where we have spatial inhomogeneities has like an epsilon in front. Maybe that makes sense, but we didn't consider that case. Then you could ask me, okay, can you not do global solutions away from equilibrium? But I'm just going to refer to all the experts on the Landau equation, and I hope that they do first the global existence of. First, the global existence of solution for the Landau equation, and then I step in and do the lesbial in our case. Another curious property of the equation is that the existence of weaker solutions, like entropy solutions, is also open. It's not so clear even how to give a meaning to them. As I said, Coulomb potentials and maybe other power law potentials are open. And this convergence to equilibrium that I was writing there in the theorem is actually relatively easy to get once you have the global existence. We have the global existence of solution because then you're in a framework where we can use all the tech machinery that was developed for the Landau equation. Okay, now a slightly facetious slide, maybe, because I believe that the reason why people told us we believe the equation is not well posed is that they started first to look at the case away from equilibrium. Local well-posedness away from equilibrium turns out in some way to be harder than global well-posedness close to equilibrium. And the reason is that if you look at this. And the reason is that if you look at this operator, the Ballesculinard operator, and you look at the linearization of the equation, then you see there's actually no term in the linearization that corresponds to the linearization of the dielectric function in the denominator. They sort of magically cancel out. So, in order to study the properties of the linearized equation close to equilibrium, you actually don't have the problem that they're at least to the lead. At least to the leading order, there is no problem coming from the dielectric function. On the other hand, if you want to study the equation far away from equilibrium, of course, you will have a term coming from the dielectric function in the denominator. Okay, and why is that bad if we have that term? So this dielectric function is sort of given by a Hilbert transform of the gradient of f. So that is a zero-order derivative operator. Order derivative operator. So naively, you could say, okay, it's zero order, let's pretend it's the identity. So it's just the dielectric function. I replace it by my favorite zero order operator, which is just the identity, and we get one plus the head gradient f. And then the equation would look something like that. Yeah, there would be other terms, but this is sort of the leading order. And I'm not saying that that equation is per se ill-posed, but there is a problem when you. L-pause, but there is a problem when you want to do the classical energy estimates. Let's say we differentiate through the equation, that's typically how you do it, and you want to write an energy estimate for the alpha derivative of f, where alpha is very large. Then you see if all the derivatives fall on here, on the f, you multiply with the d alpha f, then you get a nice dissipative term here. On the other hand, if you differentiate through the equation and all the derivatives, Differentiate through the equation, and all the derivatives fall on this denominator here, you actually get a term that is of the same order, and it's not clear how the two compensate. So, if you do this naively in your head, you do this approximation, okay, it's a zero-order distribution, I approximate it by the identity, you might get convinced that the equation is ill-paul. On the other hand, what you can do is you let's look at the equation at the operator again. So, this epsilon. Again. So, this epsilon is a Hilbert transform, but it has this parameter k. So, the direction in which we evaluate the Hilbert transform changes and is integrated here. And this is what we use. So we have a Hilbert transform in the direction of K, and K is integrated, and that gives us additional regularity properties. So, maybe some, I don't know if that's actually one can follow that, but. One can follow that, but if we do the energy estimates and we differentiate through our Balescule and our operator, then there are terms when you have here the highest order term and here the highest order term. And it turns out that using the regularity of this Radon transform, formally you have one plus alpha derivatives of G, but you see we are able to. But you see, we are able to put them on the H2. So we can avoid having these one plus alpha derivatives on the nonlinearity there. And you see, you cannot do it by integration by parts immediately because then one derivative could fall on the H1 and that's also a highest order term. So you really have to use this regularity of the Radon transform and able to do that. And once you put yourself to that task, then it's just up to you. That task, then it's just up to finding as extracting as much as possible explicit operators from that, and then representing them as Kaldron Sigmund operators. And it's just a lot of pain, but it can be done. Okay, and I think I'm actually, I started late, but I finished on time. So let me thank for your attention. Questions? Oh, a stupid question, I think. Why is your variable K scatter V in the dielectric function? You could write it in a different form. That's sort of a convention that. Why don't we just write K? Is it a physical? Yeah, it's a notation from physics. I just wanted to use when you say that the issues relate with logistical instability, are there example explicit rules that link to that? Or is it more of a more, I guess, when you were mentioning? Yeah, so there's the similar question that you have for the Landau equation, right? So if you go to the equation, and now, okay, this is, okay, let me go to the first time it appears. You go to the equation and you say epsilon becomes zero, then in principle, you could say that's actually good, right? It's a similar thing that you have, there's more diffusion, there should be more regularity, but we're not able to actually exploit that because the same growth appears in the error terms. In the error terms. So, I mean, from that point of view, it's difficult to say that there are counterexamples, right? Because we really have to wrap our heads around what happens when this diffusion coefficient in Landau is large. And I think once we know that, then we can also give an answer to this question. I have a question regarding the initial data for the HS, H3 half. H3 half. So, why do you need initial data so regular? This is just because essentially you need the algebra property, right? I mean, if you have Hs, I mean, certain terms, F times G needs to be in the same space as F and G, and then you need some derivatives to have this algebra property. And actually, probably three halves is at least a critical exponent for dimension three for L infinity embedding. Mentioned three for L infinity embedding. So probably that's the easiest answer to. I mean, there are thousands of error terms, but I think that that's already one way to one could see that that's a good candidate for the right. And so here you have uniqueness as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, I didn't write that. Yeah, you have. Yeah, no, I did actually. You have a unique solution. And do you have uniqueness safe for non-close to equilibrium? Locally, in time. Locally in time, yes. So, on a certain time interval, you can set up an contraction. Okay. More questions? If not, then extend the message. And we described tomorrow morning at nine o'clock. And I think an applause to all the speakers of today. How about that?
