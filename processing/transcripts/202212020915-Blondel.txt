I'm Eva Rudekerna, and I will be your chairwoman for this final few presentations. I have the pleasure of presenting Corine Blondel from CNRS, and she will be talking about L packets via types and covers. Thank you. Thank you. Well, I will first thank the organizers for being here, for inviting me here, which is very nice. And I am glad to have the opportunity to talk about this work, which is a work that I really enjoyed doing with Guillen Yara and Sean Stevens. So I So I will try to explain what is in that paper here. Well, I will. The introduction will be short because the talk has been completely introduced first by Sean Stevens' class and by Guillen Yah's talk and by all the other talks this week. So no need to be very... No need to be very long on this. I just want to stress that I am always working with smooth, complex representations of reductive periodic groups over a local non-Archimedean field. We saw in Sean's talk that cuspidal and supercuspidal representations are the same in that context. So I will say cuspidal. And when I say cuspidal, I will say irreducible cuspidal. Irreducible cuspidol, in fact, so it's easier. And I will focus on the case of samplectic groups with p-od, which is the case in that paper. Even so, certainly the framework would hold in classical, other classical groups. But what is written is samplic groups. Maybe at the end, I will say a very short word about unitary groups in a joint work with JOCHI. Joint work with JOCHI Phi TAN. So, what I will be talking about is the following. We know that long-long functoriality predicts that representations of a samplectic group Sp2NF have a long-lanc parameter, which is a morphism from the Vale group times SL2F into SO2N plus 1C. And L packets are the following that representations that have the That representations that have the same long-long parameter form an L packet. So, the aim in that paper and in my talk is to describe. Sorry, there is a comment that okay, shows, but it doesn't matter. Okay, the aim is to describe the long-lance parameter of a cuspidal representation. Parameter of a cuspidal representation of sp2nf. And I will show how we describe it. We describe it at least inertially, right? So we cannot describe the full long length parameter yet. And yet is the word that always reminds me of Colin Buchnell, Kiya Verne. Fa√ßron inimitables do deris yet et complete desire. A complete day. Yet that meant I will do it. And that's women. Okay. So, what I will say here is I will explain how the work comes from putting together Mergland's work, which relates long-lance parameter to Jordan, what she calls Jordan blocks. What she calls Jordan blocks and reducibility of parabolic induction, and Busch-Del-Kutzko's approach that studies parabolic inductions through types and covers. Once you have those two things put together, you can study real parts of reducibility points of those induced representations and determine what the inertial Jordan set for these representations. Okay, so we can. Sorry. So I start with a brief outline of Megland's work. So as I said, she would show that by studying reducibility of parabolic induction, you can define and describe Jordan blocks attached to a given representation of a samplectic group. Group and those Jordan blocks completely characterize the long-daunce parameter and eventually the L packets. So this is the main paper of Colette that is used here. Okay, so what is the parabolic induction we considered? As I said, we are on a local field F with the usual notation and T odd. We start with the caspidal representation. We start with the caspidal representation pi of G naught, it is an sp2k, which is pi is the one we want to compute the long-lance parameter of. And then we look at some separate cospidal representation of some GL group. And as Colette always says, this defines n-rho. And I will explain in a moment why we will start directly with the self-dual. we will start directly with the self-dual cospidal representation because it is the case that matters to us here and we look at g0 times gl g net times gl and sub rho as the maximal levy subgroup of some g which is sorry which is a sampletic group of size 2k plus 2n rho we take a power We take a parabolic subgroup of J with Levy factor M and we look at the normalized induced parabolically induced representation. So this is the one Sean Stevens talked about, except here we take the induced representation normalize with twist by square root of the modulus character and p because this is the way of This is the way of, well, this is the easiest way here. It avoids having always normalizing factors, right? So we study this for S in C. So we twist rho by all possible unramified characters. I make a first remark here, which is important. When is such a representation, rho times determinant to the S self-dual? Well, assuming rho itself is... Assuming rho itself is self-dual, you have two values of s that gives you self-duality. It's zero and this complex number here, which I am not going to read aloud, where what is the coefficient, the E rho over n rho here is the inverse of the torsion number that Sean Stevens was talking about. That says that, so it's characterized by the so it's characterized by the representation rho. Rho is isomorphic to its twist by a non-ramified character chi if and only if chi to the torsion number is one. Okay, and this is an integer of the form n rho divided by some e rho, which we will see again later. So the first result about that goes back to silver. Goes back to Silberger. I think it's an article, a paper in Annals of Math in 1980, where he showed that such an induced representation, where here, be careful, we are looking at real parameter for a moment. So this representation is reducible with the row, as I said, self-dual, if and only if S is equal to plus or minus some S naught. or minus some s nut for a real s nut and along the years the what we know about s nuts got better so we know that if pi is generic s nut is either zero or plus or minus one half or plus or minus one and later that s zero is always a half integer and that was in a work by Meglin and Marco Tadish. McLaurin and Marco Tadish. So, starting with that, we associate to pi a reducibility set, which is red pi. It's a set of pairs made of rho, set dual cuspidal of some G L and rho. And S real, actually half integral, at least one, such that the induced representation I representation I pi row s here is reducible at s. Okay. And so the bottom fact is s bigger than one. But then simple remark, the arrow that I wrote here, 2s minus 1, is always an integer and is at least one whenever s is at least one. So At least one. So equivalent to the reducibility set is a Jordan set. Jordan set of pi is a set of pairs row A with an integer, at least one, such that there is some row with row s is in the set red pi and row minus a is an even non-negative integer. non-negative integral. So what I mean here is if you see if s is equal to one, you will have a rho equals one and in your Jordan set you will have only one pair, row one. Whereas if S is strictly bigger than one you may have more pairs row A in the Jordan set. And this is well essential. Okay. Okay, so anyway, what the relation between this Jordan set and the long-run parameter for pi is the following. The long-runs parameter for pi is the direct sum for all elements in the Jordan set of L of rho sensor STA. L of rho, so remember rho is a self-dual cuspidal of some GLN rho, so L of rho is its long run. Is its long-run parameter view as an irreducible representation of WF of degree n rho, right? And the STA here is the only, is the unique irreducible representation of SL2F of degree A. So the long-lanc parameter for pi is entirely given by, entirely determined. By entirely determined, characterized by the Jordan set, that is to say, also by the reducibility set red pi, which amounts to the same. And of course, there is this important remark that since you arrive in SO2k plus 1, you have the formulas, the term of a n rho for elements in the Jordan set is 2k plus 1. In particular, one. In particular, the number of representations, the rho, that would give you a reducibility with s at least one is, I would say, very finite, right? So the goal here is to find this finite number of self-dual hospitals giving us reducibility, real reducibility, at least one, and find the and find the corresponding S, which is important because in the Jordan of pi, you need S also. Right. And the approach would be to use types and covers. So now types and covers is the full program of studying representations, induced representations with types and covers is in the paper by Busch Del Kutzko here. Bushdel Kutzko here. Sorry. Okay. So they describe, they explain how, starting with types for the cuspidal representations pi and rho, you would build a cover. No, they don't build it. They define what would be a cover, J lambda, for the spider representation of that Levy subgroup, and they explain how to study the reducibility of the induced representation. Of the induced representation through the reducibility of induced AQ algebra modules. I will try to be quick on this because Sean Stevens has explained this, but I sort of need to plug the notation still. So we have R rho, which is induced from some extension of the type tilde lambda rho to the normalizer of tilde J rho. We have the pi. We have the pi that is induced from lambda pi. Yes. As in Guillenya's talk, we tend to put tilde in the notation when we are in GL. And we remove the tilde, for instance, when we take the intersection of something in GL with SP, right? So the definition of the cover has been given by Sean Stevens, but By Sean Stevens. But essentially, you have two steps. First step is to find an Iwahori decomposition for your type J, J lambda, which is J as an Iwahori decomposition with respect to parabolic, given parabolic of levy M. And the representation lambda is trivial on the unipotent part. Unipotent part and on the block diagonal part on the levy, it sends this diagonal block diagonal element here to lambda rho tilde of G times tensor lambda pi of z. So here, of course, in your Levy subgroup isomorphic to G L N rho times sp 2k, the part here is uniquely determined by J through the correct involvement. Was a correct involution in the situation that I didn't write. I just put a bar on it. And as Sean said, there is a strong technical condition that would ensure that J lambda is a type. And J lambda is a type would mean that reducing isotype for the initial class of the husbital rotance of pi in J if the If the isomorphism classes of irreducible representations of G containing lambda are exactly isomorphism classes of irreducible subquotients of the induced representations rho tens of pi twisted by a non-ramified character. So this is the whole inertial class here in N. Okay. Here in M. Okay, and the whole point of a cover is that if you know that J lambda is a cover, then J lambda not only is a type for this inertial class here, but you also have, sorry, I am, I anticipated on the next slide, okay, I forgot here when you have. I forgot here. When you have a type, you have an equivalence of category between the Bernstein piece here associated to the inertial class of rotens of ING and the category of right non-degenerate H of J lambda module. I wrote the right action, which is nice integral. Okay, and the whole point of types is that whole point of covers is that. whole point of covers is that when you have a cover, you have injective morphism of algebras, sending the algebra in M to the algebra in G, which gives you a sort of an inducing process on modules with a commutative diagram. So you go from a block, a Bernstein block. block a bernstein block in m from parabolic normalized parabolic induction a bernstein block in g then you go through type theory to categories of modules of other relevant algebras and what is equivalent to induction on that side is this module module equal algebra module induction right so what we will do is study the reducibility of this equal algebra module right in the theory of covers we say a little more which is uh in in in the in the paper In the paper. Here we have strong information about our types. We know that rho is induced from an extension of lambda rho. And the normalizer of J rho tilde is something like the powers of a uniformizing element of an extension E of F attached. E of f attached to the representation. No, sorry, especially no, attached to the type lambda rho tilde. So I won't be very precise about it, but each time we take an explicit type lambda tilde sub row, there are things in the type that we will choose, but there are things that are really attached to the representation. So here, E. So here E will be chosen, but on the other hand, the ramification index of E depends only on rho. So this is the E row. Remember, we had a torsion number n rho over E rho. This is the E row. All right. So anyway, the intertwining of type in M is supported on a single double class, which is Sorry, is supported on the single double classes of powers of that element P E here, block diagonal. You have the uniformizing element of E inverse and its image under the involution. All right. So this is a commutative algebra, polynomial in ZZ, Z inverse, where Z is an element which supports the double class. Support the double class of pi E. All right. Since it's a commutative algebra on the eco-algebra side, you have here a one-dimensional module when you take the lambda rho tensor lambda pi part of the representation rho determinant times p. Okay, so this module is characterized by the value of the action of z, which is sort of a character. Which is sort of a character, and the value at z will be, you will have the absolute value of determinant of y e to the s times the value for s equals zero. Okay, now what happens when you induce to the echo algebra over g? Well, it doesn't look so bad because this equal algebra h g lambda is a free module over. The free module over the algebra of M, its rank would be just the cardinality of the normalizer in G of the inertial class of row tensor pi. Okay, so it's a set of G, so here is the inertial class, such that the inertial class of conjugate by G is isomorphic to the inertial class of row tens of pi. With this framework, of course, we find back the result of Silberger, because you see that if rho times the determinant is never self-dual, actually the induced representation will always be irreducible. So, which is why we just focus here on the self-dual case. Okay, and in the self-dual case, this This Normand is exactly two, so we are inducing to get in general a two-dimensional module. And we want to know when this module is reducible, right? Something more even in Bushnell-Kutsko's paper is that if you can pick a suitable, you can pick a suitable K containing J. Table k containing j, such that the echo algebra over j is as a vector space isomorphic to the tensor product of the algebra over k, sorry, and the algebra over m through the, of course, through the morphism t. Okay, so in particular, this algebra here, h k longer, has dimension two, which we will come back to later. We will come back to later. So studying reducibility amounts to studying one-dimensional representation of Hg lambda that extend or character of H tem. Thanks a lot. Good. So now we come to we put our hands on the work to do. Okay, it turns out, and we will come back to that later also, that H of J lambda has two generators that satisfy quadratic relations. Well, of course, quadratic relation, because see, if you take an element, say T, in not well, capital T. In not well, capital T in H k lambda. This guy has dimension two. So if you compute T square, you will have a linear combination of T and one. So any element in here satisfies a quadratic relation, right? So it will turn out that H G lambda has two generators with quadratic relations. With quadratic relations. I will call them right now T0T1. And the product T0T1 will be a scalar multiple of T of Z. Remember, Z is the one in the EQ algebra of M that acts through a scalar. So our work is to find them. There are two methods. There is an exact method where you can calculate the quadratic relation. The quadratic relations, all right, and there is a nicer method where you use loose stuff and equal algebras on finite reductive groups. So I will just say a word first of horn calculations so that you get an idea of what it looks like. And I give an example in SP4. This is the paper, well, joint paper with Laurblasco. Paper with Laura Blasco in well, 20 years ago, all right. And the idea of the paper was to show in SP4 that the whole machinery of covers in Vushnel-Kutsko was able to produce all reducibilities in the case of induced representations into SP4F. The reducibilities were known by Sally and Taddish work, but the point was to show that. Was to show that through covers we were able to find this in an alternative way. Okay, so we did here the two classes of maximal parabolics in sp4. I show only one, it will be enough. So I take a GL1 times sp2 inside sp4. I take a selfie character of square one in gl1 and the And the algebra, the echo algebra in the settings that I explained before, has two generators that are supported respectively on the double cosets of those two elements. So, well, of course, the normalizer of the type, you have to switch the two pieces, the two, well, the G and G bar inverse, right? So those two elements do that. And when you take the product, you take, you get the. product you take you get the minus pi I was having before except here equals f okay so we have formally quadratic relations that looks like this with coefficient bw cw well the coefficients c are easy they are just in the indices well but the computation for bw is more involved you have to really put do the dirty job compute systems of compute systems of representative for the quotient j mod j intersected with w j w inverse or s j s inverse and this is done shown has shown as has written something like this you you you use all these intersections with the unipotent path right to simplify those questions so anyway you have to use explicit realizations for the type of pi there are gold sums involved and Goldstones involved, and I just copied one page of results so that you get the idea. So the results vary according, of course, to pi. So in the notations in the paper, chi is rho, in fact. The restriction of the type associated to rho, that is the restriction of rho to the units. Okay. So you find all kinds. You find all kinds of quadratic relations. Sometimes they may be, sometimes the coefficient B is zero, but sometimes it varies. And when you see a clear difference, when the representation pi is an exceptional cuspidal representation of SL2, you find different Quadratic relations. So, well, anyway, this is all I was going to say about it, but that was a work where we computed explicitly all the coefficients. But, well, this is a lot of work, so it's there is a need for something more conceptual, right? The theorem more conceptual is to And more conceptual is to is in the paper by Miyoshi and Stevens that says that in this situation, maximum parabolic subgroup and so on. So the Ecker algebra is indeed of a cover, that cover is indeed has two generators supported each on a single double coset. And well, this is just well, there is a normalization. Well, there is a normalization of those generators that will give you a real quadratic relation as for as here. So the eigenvalues are minus one and some integer power of Q, right? Well, a consequence of this direct consequence is that those elements are invertible. Indeed, we can Indeed, we can write their inverse with the quadratic relation. The product is a scalar multiple of z of z. If you are lucky, if it's not this one, it would be t1, t0, but right. And of course, this secure algebra has only four one-dimensional representations contained with multiplicities, of course. So you find them by computing. You find them by computing the eigenvalues of each generator, right? Well, and starting with that, and trying to work for these reducibilities, it turns out that the real parts of the reducibility points that we are looking at for those individual representations are given by Given by those expressions in R nut and R1, which means if you know this R nut, this R1, you will know the real parts of the reducibility points for the induced representations, which are exactly what we are almost exactly, what we are looking for. So you find here, as usual, the Dorschen number and you have R0 plus or minus R1. R naught plus or minus R1. Right? So with this in hand, what is the strategy to compute this reducibility set? We have those types for pi. We want to find representations with good reducibilities, real reducibilities bigger than at least one. At least one. And we certainly don't want to do the computations for any row, any type J row. So we have somehow to guess. We have to guess a reasonable set of good candidates for row. What do we expect, in fact, for rho? That wouldn't be anything. For those good candidates, we have to compute the relations and the real parts of reducibility. And the real parts of reducibility points. And if we find enough of those, we will be done because we have this relations that we have seen before. We know once we get enough so that this formula is satisfied, we are done. Right. But, okay, there is one disadvantage to this method. Method compared to the direct computation is that so remember in an inertial class we have two self-dual representations, right? And with this method, we know that one of them will have the right real part of reducibility point, but we are not sure which. Sometimes we can tell, but not always. So we cannot know if we are. we cannot know if we are interested in rho or the second one say rho prime right or so we say we have in general when we find the two non-negative real parts of reducibility points remember we had two we have choices and we don't know how to distinguish between both so Both. So somehow the wall we will find in this Jordan set will be determined up to twisting by an unramified self-dual character, which means we don't have the exact Jordan set. We will have, in fact, something that we'll call an inertial Jordan set. Okay? So the inertial Jordan set, what is it? What is it? It's a multi-set of pairs made of the inertial class of some cuspidal row of some n row and an integer a such that the pair row a belongs to Jordan of pi, right? Well, it's a multi-set in the sense that maybe row a and rho prime a with rho prime is. prime a with rho prime is this guy here would belong to i drod of pi and then you have to count them twice in that multi set okay so this is what we are going to compute here it's the inertial jordan set good Oh, sure. Yes, sorry. Row A in Jordan spy. Okay. So, well, I will now explain how we determine. Now, explain how we determine those inertial Jordan sets. Now we'll have to get into the structure of lambda sub pi. Okay. Lambda sub pi is constructed in an explicit construction of lambda sub pi. Okay, I should say just a word of the notation here. As Sean Stephens said, well, somehow a type for pi is determined up to conjugacy. Determine up to conjugacy. But once we start getting into the structure of the type, if we use a semi-simple stratum or so on, then we have things that are not entirely determined by pi. I mean they you they may change. Still, I use the notation sub pi everywhere because it makes things clearer in the talk. things clearer in the talk but some we we must keep in mind that the lambda pi j pi lambda pi is determined up to conjugacy but some of the deeper structure is not okay but you need we need it so landapi will be built with sort of simple pieces so for each simple piece we will have related objects and related cusps Related cuspidal representations of smaller samplectic groups that I call that I call simple with a double quote here because why it's it's easy to call them here simple because they come from simple objects, but they are not also simple cospitals that Guyana was talking about, even though the simple cospitals that The simple hospitals that Guenya was talking about are simple in this sense. That's not too bad, right? Okay, so we will relate somehow i jord of pi to the inertial Jordan set for pi to the ones for those simple cuspidal representations. And then we will compute the inertial Jordan sets for simple those simple cuspidal representations with lustik results. With lustik's results. And of course, we said we wanted to have a finite number of good candidates. What could be those good candidates, if not all these simple objects that we can get starting with semi-simple objects? Okay, so now we get into the few semi-simple data. For the representation pi of the sample T group, I wrote skew because, you know, on these slides you need some space and writing self-dual would have put me outside of, but I think anyway here for cuspidals they are skew, right? So that's fine. Okay, so we want a skew, semi-simple strata stratum. Okay, long. Okay, lambda, I am old-fashioned, so I am still using lambda as being a lattice sequence, but well, of course, it corresponds to a point in the building, as Sean was saying. So, with some element beta in S P Semi-simple means that the samplectic space V is an V is an orthogonal direct sum of pieces V1 to VR of dimension 2Ki. And on each Vi, you have a skew simple stratum, lambda i, beta sub i. Okay, so maybe it's on the next note. So what? And here, simple, semi-simple, simple means that f of beta r. means that f of beta i is a field, right? And in semi-simple, f of beta would be direct sum of those fields. Well, and there is more to it than, but I can't go into this. Well, once you have a semi-simple that room, skew semi-simple that room like this, you have the crucial notion of a skew semi-simple character. So to this datum, So, to this data are attached groups, open compact subgroups of the sample t groups called traditionally, this goes back to Bushnell Kutzkov's book on GLN, right? So you have H1, J1, J. On H1 leaves some simple character. Well, the wings are the same. Well, knowing that the excuse of a simple character now comes from the work of Stevens. Notion of simple character was for GLN was in the orange book. Okay, so you have on H1 a semi-simple, skew semi-simple character. You have some Isenberg construction that gives you a Heisenberg, a unique representation on this J1. This J1, this is fine. And then, so J1, H1 are propy groups. Then you have to go up to the J sub pi, which is the group on which type lives. And J sub pi is not a propag group anymore. But it turns out that this representation of J1 here does extend to J sub pi. It might extend in different ways. Usually it does, but we want an extension that would have sort of good intertwining properties. And this exists. And this is called also this goes back to the Orange book, but then for classical groups, that's a real hard piece of work that was done by. That was done by Sean 2008. Well, anyway, there are extensions to just apply that are better extensions that have good intertwining properties. Unfortunately, they are not completely unique. Well, they are not unique, should I say. There are twisted, there may be twisting characters. Well, in that. Well, in that paper, we decided that since they play such an important role, I hope I will be able to explain a little what happens, but we decided that the easiest way here was to fix them. And we have a way of fixing them that asking that the determinant would be a power of p then this beta extension become becomes. This beta extension becomes unique, and we call it a P primary beta extension. And sorry, since we have to go back and forth using transfer of beta extensions and so on, it's a good thing to have a fixed convention to have firm ground here. But there is no other reason to check the beta extension P primary. So P primary, the determinant is the power of P. Okay, and so we have semi-simple data. So what happens is that when you take the intersection with each group sp of VI, you will get groups H pi I one right. One, right? And by restriction, a skew simple character, theta pi i, right? And of course, same notation with J1, J, and so on. So this is the part of the type that comes from the very arithmetic, that has a strong arithmetic meaning. Strong arithmetic meaning that comes from the semi-simple character. And you know from Sean's talk that they are essential objects. Now, the other part of Longda Pi is a level zero part. That is, so I call E f of beta, Ei F of beta I. So E is the direct sum of the EI, right? And I call G sub E. And I call G sub EI the centralizer of beta I in SPVI, so in each simple part, G sub E the product of those. So for the simple pieces, you have it's a general fact actually. So the group J, when you go from J1 to the bigger group J, you add a part. You add a part that lives in the centralizer of beta i. So, in fact, J pi i is the product of the normalizer in the centralizer of EI of the lattice sequence lambda i. So, it's a paraic group in the Group in the group GEI, time G1. All right. And the quotient of those two is isomorphic to the quotient of this parallelic by its proper radical, which is a finite reductive group. Same thing for the semi-simple datum. So Jesse pi is just the Pi is just the product of those parauric subgroups in each simple piece times J1, and the quotient is the product of those finite reductive groups. So finally, the type, the representation lambda pi is the tensor product of this p primary beta extension kappa sub pi with tau sub pi, a cospidal representation. By a cuspidal representation of this finite reductive group, which is the tensor product of cuspidal representations on each simple on each sorry finite group G sub I. Okay, so good. Okay, now I want to. I am just wondering what was the transition here, and I don't remember. So, no transition. Equal Gevois of finite reductive books. So, I wrote before the cover J Lambda. So, this is this map, this representation lambda that sends these elements to this thing. So for zero, lambda row also in we still we are in GLN row. We'll have a simple stratum and we'll have the lambda tilde rho will be also some beta extension times some representation of level zero of a finite reductive group. And for J lambda, And for J lambda, for the cover J lambda, we actually have a related semi-simple stratum. So I have been a little sloppy here, but somehow you are summing the lattice sequences and you are taking a diagonal matrix here in the Lie algebra, gamma beta, or beta in the symplectic part, and minus gamma bar to have something in the Liege algebra. Gamma bar to have something the Lie algebra of sp and we are well I forgot to say here right I said rho should be self-dual and if we assume rho is self-dual we can choose the simple stratum itself to be self-dual so that here the minus gamma bar is actually equal to gamma that's that's a fact okay that's a fact okay and we also have lambda which is which has a form kappa tensor toe all right okay and now it's a theorem by stevens 2008 that says the following we have this summary We have this semi-simple stratum sigma alpha. If you remember, I am sort of making a digression here. If you remember in Sean Stephen's talk, he talked about the Iwahori for SL2 and how this was included in two maximal compact subgroups. If you look at that as being the stabilizer of a lattice sequence, fixator of a lattice sequence. Sequence, fixator of a lattice sequence, right? You would have a lattice sequence in SL2 that says OO, OP, PP, and so on. In this lattice sequence, you can extract two lattice sequences that would give you maximal compact subgroups. You can extract either OOPP and so on, or OPPP square, and so on. So, So, that is to say, here we are, the idea is the same. So, from this lattice sequence sigma, you can find, you can extract two lattice sequences M0, M1, that would give you maximal paraic subgroups in the group. In the group G sub E, right? And in this situation, what will happen is the following. So you remember the finite reductive group parts in your type. That was, say, a J sub rho times a J sub pi. This is the quotient of a P of sigma times P one of sigma with the sigma here. With the sigma here. And this will appear as a levy subgroup in the bigger group, the bigger reductive group, finite reductive group, that we find using the fixator of MT in the commuting group of alpha mode it's propiradical. Which means that you have now, you are in a finite reductive group with a levy subgroup, and your level zero part tilde tow sub root tensor to sub pi can be inflated to the parabolic subgroup. Then in parabolic Then in parabolically induced to the full group. And this will give you a relevant ECO algebra for our situation. So actually, you will have an injective morphism of algebras from this Echo algebra of a finite group into into algebra H of j lambda. That project supports that that means that if you have a double class in the group of the finite in of the in the finite reductive group, you will sort of make the double class bigger using j in h of j lambda. So this is queer. Okay, but what about will What about well the way I explained it, you wouldn't expect to have this character here. It looks so nice to say, well, okay, I have the equal algebra. Well, not exactly, because okay, this is a simple way of explaining things, but behind the theorem of Stevens. Of Stevens. There is a whole machinery of transferring beta extensions. Okay, so Jean-Steven spoke about the transfer of simple characters and semi-simple characters. So you get, when you have a semi-simple character on some H1, if you change the lattice sequence or even sometimes a group, you have a good number. Sometimes a group, you have a good notion of transferring that character. You have this notion of endoclass. So you can sort of move your simple or semi-simple characters around and for instance, your semi-simple character theta here will be transferred to the groups over M sub T easily. I mean, easily. Well, it's the theorem, but it's well done. Done. You want to do the same with the beta extensions, but the beta extensions are not uniquely determined by this semi-simple character. There may be a twist. So what is uniquely determined and defined in that paper of Sean is you can uniquely transfer beta extension relative. For a beta extension relatively to some lattice sequence, so it gets complicated. And the whole point here is that when you try to obtain this isomorphism, behind this, there is a machinery of transferring beta extensions. And when you transfer them from sigma to mt, there is a twisting. There is a twisting character, sort of quadratic or trivial that appears, and we can't help it. It is built into the situation. And well, I would say it even shows how subtle the beta extensions are, because you have to get this character. Well, I called it sort of sloppy, a signature character here, just to point out several facts that it's quadratic or trivial. It's quadratic or trivial, and it's obtained as a signature of some permutation on data that do not depend on toe, they only depend on the shape of our groups. So this character only depends on m sub t relative to sigma and so on, but not on the representations, which is not so bad. Okay. Okay, so this is the basic tool that we have now. So remember, we want to we have candidates to find the Jordan set. The candidates come from the simple data of our semi-simple stratum. And we want to show that if we take some row that has good that That is very similar to a simple piece, we will get something. So, anyway, well, if I assume first that the okay instead of sorry, instead of working with a simple piece indexed by I, I indexed it by one so we don't bother, but you will agree it doesn't matter. So, here assume. So here, assume, I take the case of one, assume the stratum in GL and the stratum in SPV1 add into a simple stratum. And then you look at finite reductive groups. Well, in the levy, we will see we have this zero times g1, and in the bigger group, we'll actually. Bigger group, we'll actually have some G sub m T1 times the other pieces. So when we want to compute the Eco algebra that I had on the slide before, it's actually isomorphic to a Equal algebra over the smaller group GMT1 of almost the same representation, except we will only have the first piece TO1. Okay. Okay. So in this algebra, we have, sorry, in those two algebras, remember we have t equals zero and t equals one, we will have generators satisfying quadratic relations. So we find some R naught here and R1. And of course, I have to write their dependency on the character and the representations. And we'll find real And we'll find real parts of reducibility points that would be obtained through R0 and R1. So what we want to do is compare with what happens if we would take only the pi 1 part. If we take only the pi 1 part, we'll have integers are not, but same representation. Same representations here, but we'll have characters epsilon n01 because now it's a problem of beta extension in this simple piece and R1 of epsilon M11. The problem is if we had same character here and here and here and here, this would be sort of And here, and here. This would be sort of easy to say when I have a good candidate here, I can twist it and go there. But here it's more complicated. Still, now we'll make stronger assumptions. We'll see, we will assume that. Sorry, that's not that. We will assume that. We will assume that f of beta one and f of gamma, so remember gamma is a part in rho, are isomorphic and through beta one goes to gamma. And by doing that, we will assume that the self-door, okay, that the character, the simple character theta pi one transfers to that's here transfers to a simple character in the j l part so as usual when you have a self-dual simple character in a samplectic group it is the restriction of a unique self-dual simple character of the group h1 tilde so that's what we are doing here we have this Are doing here. We have this theta pi1 simple character on spv1. It has a unique cell extension to h tilde one by one. And this simple parameter can be transferred to h rho one tilde. Okay, so this would be our candidate, except that in fact our candidate to be the factor or candidate to be the underlying simple character for row is the square of this. And well, I just wrote matrices to show you why we get a square here is if you have a levy here with two copy of GLN, two copies of GLN, if you send xy to theta one of x theta one of y, well, this is nice, but if you restrict it to It to the intersection with sp2n, what you will get is theta one of x square. So this is where the square appears here. So our good candidate for rho would be a representation with underlying simple character theta, well, theta pi one square. And in this situation, And in this situation, actually, we will have a unique. So remember, we had to compare the values of R naught and R1 for the big, in the big situation. Okay. So sorry, obviously, I made a copy-paste, but I forgot to. I wrote twice the same. Two, I wrote twice the same thing. We had to compare the real path of reducibility points in the situation, the semi-simple situation and simple situation. So anyway, here there should not be ones up there. So actually in this situation, there is a unique character of the residual field of E1, quadratic or trivial, such that in fact, But in fact, the characters here and there, the epsilon characters, differ by one and the same character. So this allows us to twist, in a single twist, to go from an element of the initial Jordan set for the simple pi to the inertial Jordan set for pi. So I can now state the The theorem that comes from this. Okay, so the statement says the following, and the statement uses a notation that I haven't defined before. So the inactual Jordan set is made of pairs row A. Rho is a cuspidal representation of some GLN. This cuspidal representation. This cuspidal representation defines a unique endoclass of simple characters, right? So, this unique endoclass of simple character, so I wrote before for pi i of pi one, I wrote the simple character small theta pi one. So here the capital theta pi one is the only. Pi one is the endoclass of this small theta pi one and I take the square, it's another underclass, this is fine and the inertial Jordan set of phi with this underclass is a set of rho A such that rho defines the same endoclass. So this is fine. And the theorem is The theorem is the electron Jordan set of pi attached to this underplus is the one for pi one twisted by the character of square one that we had before. So we have a just a simple simple twist by a quadratic or trivial character that That takes us from the inertial Jordan set for pi one to the one for pi. All right, well, which is fine, and we will not be surprised to have in this story of long-run parameters, having to twist by quadratic characters every so often is not something very surprising. So, anyway. What also holds is the following. If you take, so now in this statement, I am just looking at one simple part, pi one, with a simple character theta pi one. Now, if I compute the sum on the inertial Jordan set for pi one attach to the To the endoclass of theta pi one square, right? If I sum the m degree of rho, I do find 2k plus 1, 2k1 or 2k1 plus 1. 2k1 plus 1 if beta 1 is 0, 2k1 otherwise, which means if I look at the inertial Jordan set with endoclotta. With endoclass theta pi one square, I find the whole inertial Jordan set. Almost. There is, I must say a word on the case, beta one equals zero. Beta one equals zero amounts to saying that pi one is of dead zero. This case has been done in the work by J. Mey Lustenson Stevens. Okay. And actually. Actually, so they they show identities like that in the dead zero case that are used later on. And another thing, I have now to make a convention and didn't want to talk about before, which is that I would assume that one of the beta i is zero because you know at the end I need a 2k plus one. So anyway, this one here. Anyway, this one here, I have to get it at the end. If none of the beta one, none of the beta i's is zero, I have somehow to simulate and add some zero parts. So here I am just assuming that one of the beta i's is zero, and possibly with the corresponding vi is a zero vector space. And then the statement can be The statement can be done with in a homogeneous way, right? So, now the corollary of those two theorems is that the inertial Jordan set of pi is the union of the inertial Jordan set associated to each simple piece and each square of underclass for the simple piece. Of under class for the simple piece, right? With for each piece, this twist by a quadratic of trivial character. So this gives you a sort of a full description of the inertial Jordan set, knowing that in the work of Lust and Stevens that I was talking about. Stevens that I was talking about, there is also an algorithm that explains how one could find the good finite reductive group representations to get the good convidence. Anyway, and the last theorem is a theorem about endoparameters. About endo parameters. So, Sean Stephen explained to us what was the endo parameter. Well, anyway here, what we call the self-dual endo parameter of theta is the sum of so the theta pi i, they are the endoclasses of the simple parts, right? And you and you have a coefficient that it's the dimension of the space Vi over the dimension of the extension F of beta I over F. So this is uniquely defined by pi. Actually, you don't need theta to get it. I mean, the result is uniquely defined by pi. And the diagram here that takes you from cuspidal representation of sp 2k to irreducible representation of GL2K plus 1 by transfer. I want to state the theorem. I have no time to really explain this. So first pedal representation of sp2k, we know that we will get in this manner an under the... In this manner, an endoparameter of size 2k, we go here to endoparameters of size, oh sorry, it's a 2k plus 1, of course, right? This map sends, this map sends an endo parameter sum of a i theta sub j to sum of a sub j theta sub j square. theta sub z square and you add theta zero which is the trivial endoclass and here you take an irreducible representation of G Ln to the endo parameter attached to its cospidal support. And this is a commutative geogram. So it is a ramification So it is a ramification theorem in the sense that it describes exact it describes the here the transfer but in terms of the endo parameters on each side so it's fully determined well i guess somehow i have been speaking before of the case when you can make hound computations and this is a case i have And this is a case I have been working on with very special situations in unitary groups, but I think this is enough and I will just start you. Do we have any questions for our speaker? Could you go back to your slide on the reduction steps? Reducibility points. Sorry, the examples a few slides ago. Hello. So when you were talking about the heck algebra for the levy m sub t and the embedding of that into the all right. I was trying to understand the logic of something. You had this embedding. Yeah, at the bottom. And And as far as I understand from the logic, you're trying to understand this whole business is trying to calculate R0 and R1. So, I mean, you have, you want to compute R0 and R1, but each HEC algebra has something, right? So, in other words, are they the same? In other words, it's sufficient to, they're not the same. No, no. Okay. Okay, good. So, another question is at the very Another question is: At the very beginning, when you're using Mogland's theory of the Jordan blocks, her results, if I remember, were before those of Arthur. So what was she using? How was she characterizing her packets? What was her definition of the packet when she was actually proving that at the beginning? I absolutely don't remember. I really don't remember. I really don't remember. I mean, I looked at that, but at least 10 years ago, so I kept that. This is clear, but I don't remember. Any other questions? Any questions on Zoom? All right, let's thank our speaker once again. I'll go for the picture to make
