The first week are controversial by Atan Bhutan from EC and how about the invitation. Now I'm going to speak. Get the organizations for this event. So this work is joined with Dr. Kajino at Kyoto University. I'll first explain what I've been doing. Explain what I mean by Dr. Drawing a little picture. So we have some domain U and we have a reflected Dronian motion that stays within the domain. Once it hits the boundary, it's pushed back. And we do something like this. And we are going to forget what the Brownian motion does inside. So we are going to erase all this path. So what we will see is that. So, what we will see is that it jumps from one molecule point to another molecule point. So, starting with the diffusion on a domain, we obtain a jump process on the boundary. And this jump process is called the boundary trace process. And one way to understand Markov process 2 is through its heat kernel. And so, we'll try to see what kind of heat kernel estimates this jump cross on the boundary satisfies. So, I'll start with a very classical example. So, we have a Brownian motion on Rn and alpha is some number between 0 and 2. And S t is the symmetric alpha stable process. So, it's one way to say it is through its characteristic function. Another way to say is that it's generated by the fractional Laplacian, Laplacian to the power alpha over 2 to the proper size. The proper size. And yt is the general, is the 2 minus alpha dimensional Bessel process. So remember, n-dimensional Bessel process is the radial part of the n-dimensional Brownian motion. But this n doesn't have to be an integer. It makes sense to define these Bessel processes even when we don't have an integer, like in this case. And one can write down the generator. So we look at this path xt, yt as a diffuse. Xt, Yt has a diffusion on the upper half space. Xt lives in Rn, Yt lives in the positive real line. So we have some diffusion on the upper half space. So it's kind of similar to the picture that I drew before. So we have this diffusion. Once it hits the boundary, it gets pushed back. And we want to understand what the boundary process is in RNS. It turns out that, okay, so in order to define this boundary process. To define this boundary process, one needs to parametrize the time properly for the boundary process. And this comes from looking at the local time at 0 for the y-axis process. So that's the Bessel process. So when y is 0, this process is on the boundary. So the local time at 0 for this y-axis process can be viewed as the amount of time this diffusion spends on the boundary. And we look at the right continuous inverse of the local time, cloudy. So this is very simple. So, this is very similar to what Peter Frisk was talking about yesterday. So, this is some positive continuous ID function. We are looking at the right continuous inverse, and this defines a Markov process. So, what Moltzong and Ostrowski showed in the late 60s, which was rediscovered independently by Cafferly and Sylvester, is that this pad XTYT, this boundary entrace process after this time change. So, we are just keeping track of that, this process on the boundary. This process on the boundary, this behaves like an alpha-stable process. So the alpha equal to one case is special because it's just the usual deflected body motion on the upper half space, which was shown earlier by Spitzer. Okay, so this formulation is actually due to Mozart and Oscar scale. Kaffir and Silverster rediscovered this manipulant formulation, which I'll explain now. Maybe the reason why analysts like Kaffir and Silverster care about this. Like Catherine and Sylvester, care about this is that if you look at this process slightly on the upper half space, it comes with this generator. So it's two independent processes on the x and y direction. On the x direction, it's the pronunci motion, and on the y direction, it's the 2 minus alpha dimensional Bessel process. So this is a nice local operator, and properties of this local operator were used to understand the properties of this non-local flat. The properties of this non-local fractional Laplace operator. For example, in their paper, they showed that Hernac inequalities and boundary Hernac inequalities for the fractional Laplacian follow from the analogous properties for the local operator, which is somehow more classical. And there are more techniques to deal with local operators than non-local operators. Okay, so let me recall what Caffrey and Ansilist did. Their description is in a more Description is in a more analytic framework. So, this diffusion on the upper half space comes with its Dirichlet form, which looks like the usual Dirichlet energy, except that there's a weight y raised to the power 1 minus alpha on this weighted cross L Do space. So, it's a nice symmetric diffusion process. And we can look at the Dirichlet form for the boundary process. The general theory of Dirichlet forms tells us that. Dirty forms tell us that the reflection, the Diracle form for the boundary process is given by the following formula. It's just the same Dirichlet energy, except that we want to find the energy of the function that lives on the boundary. So, in order to find the energy of this function on the boundary, we have to solve the Dirichlet problem for the corresponding generator. So, we want to find the harmonic function for this energy. So, which we saw is this operator L alpha with the boundary condition given by L. With the boundary condition given by f. So we start with the frisky boundary condition, solve the Diracle problem, compute the energy inside. That's the Diracle form for the boundary process. And what Caffrey and Silverster show is that this energy after solving the Diracle problem is exactly the same as the energy that corresponds to the Diracle form for the stable process for the fractional Laplace operator. Any questions so far? So, this is kind of the motivation for our work. So, when Nauteka and I started this work, we are wondering to what extent does this phenomena occur for other domains or for other diffusions? So, does the boundary stress process behave like a symmetric stable process for other domains or other diffusions? For example, what happens? Diffusions. For example, what happens if we replace the Brownian motion with, instead of a Laplace operator, we replace it with a uniform elliptic operator in divergence form, like we saw in Peter Fritz's talk yesterday. Or what happens if we consider reflected domain motion on non-smooth domains, like the snowflake domain, or even ellipses domain, like the first orthant, which is like the higher dimensional version of the first quadrant. Or what happens if we look at the Brownian motion. What happens if we look at the Brownian motion and dissipancy parameter and look at what it does on the outer split boundary? So you get a jump cross on this blue-shadered boundary. Does it look like a stable process? So the answer to all these questions is going to be yes. So in all these cases, it behaves like a stable process in a quantity fashion, which is what I will try to explain. Before going there, I thought to Going there, I hope to explain some of the relevant history behind this problem. So, this problem of computing the Dirichlet energy for the function, for the solution of the Dirichlet problem given the prescribed boundary condition, goes back to Douglas for the unit disk case and more generally for smooth domains. In Rn, if Gu is the Green's function and if U is harmonic with some precipitate boundary condition F. With some twisted boundary condition f, then we can express the energy of the harmonic function inside the domain in terms of its boundary values by this double integral. So this is some kind of jump-type delivery form that comes from a local operator and this sigma is the surface measure, and this is the second normal derivative of the Green's function. And the proof is not too difficult, it just comes from the observation. Too difficult, it just comes from the observation that the Poisson kernel is given by the normal derivative of the Green's function. And once you express new in terms of boundary condition, using the Poisson kernel, it just comes from an integration by parts eigen. But it's clear that if you want to look at this kind of domains, for example, a snowflake domain, it's not clear how to make sense of the normal derivative even at a single point on the boundary. But it turns out that. But it turns out that there is still a nice formula for the Diracle energy in that kind of non-smooth situation. Again, it's due to an old result due to Doom in the 60s. So I want to explain this formula. We call it the Doom-Nyme formula. So in order to explain this formula, I have to introduce an object called as the NIME kernel. It was introduced by Linda Nym in her PhD thesis in the 50s. So I'm going to So, I'm going to look at some domain for Brownian motion Rn, which is transient, in the sense that the Brownian motion exits this domain almost surely. And we choose some base point x0 in the domain. The nine kernel with the base point x0 between two points, x and y, is simply the Green's function between these two points divided by the product of the Green's functions from this base point x0. So, this is this makes sense. Sense. But what Naim showed in her work is that this function can be extended continuously to the Martin boundary with respect to some complicated topology that I don't want to get into. But these limits can be extended all the way to the Martin boundary. We wouldn't need this topology for studying the main results, so I'm not going to define them. But in any case, But in any case, these limits exist. So we can think of this nine kernel evaluated even at two different boundary points. So now we are ready to state the result of Duke. So Dube showed that, okay, so there is one more piece of notation, which is the notation for the harmonic measure from the Brownian motion on the Martin boundary starting, the Brownian motion is started at X naught at X naught. Starting start at x0, it exits the boundary, it exits the domain u through some point on the Martin boundary, and this defines some probability measure on the Martin boundary. So, this measure is called the harmonic measure. So, the derivative energy for a harmonic function on the domain with prescribed boundary values on the Martin boundary is given by a formula that's very similar to the formula that we saw before, except that there is no second normal derivatives to take with respect to inward-pointing normal vectors. Here, we just look at the 9. Here, we just look at the nine kernel, and instead of the surface measure, we have the harmonic measure. So, in other words, the jump kernel of the boundary trace of reflected Rome motion with respect to the harmonic measure is the nine kernel. One way to remember this research. And Doof's proof also is a version of integration by Ponards. It it uses of s it uses some version of normal derivatives or defined normal derivatives introduced by Niem in her thesis. By Nine in her thesis. So we are not going to aim for such general domains. We are going to restrict ourselves to domains that satisfy some nice geometric hypothesis. And I am going to explain that in the next slide. So our setting is the setting of uniform domains satisfying what's called as the capacity density condition. So this capacity density condition. So, this capacity density condition is given by the following estimate. So, we have a domain U. So, we have some domain U. We look at some boundary point and we look at two volts of radius R and two R. So, the kept radius of the radius So, the capacity between this shaded region and the complement of this larger wall is comparable to the capacity between the smaller wall and the complement of the larger ball. So, this is a way of ensuring that every point on the boundary is in the support of the harmonic measure. Kind of condition ensures that. And this is a very general condition, for example, it is satisfied by all Lipschitz domains. Satisfied by all Lipschitz domains. So it's not too restrictive. And uniform domains, okay, so I have to explain what this uniform domain means. So first of all, we have a domain which is a connected, non-empty proper open subset. If there exists some constant such that for any pair of points x and y, there is some curve that joins them and the diameter of this curve is up to a constant. Up to a constant, same as the distance between these two points. And if you take any point on this curve, the distance to the complement is comparable to the minimum of the distance between these two end points. So there are lots of curves that try to avoid the boundary between any two points. And x is face is what? So you is kind of amo this thing? What I mean is that you Is that your set u is a subset of x? U is a subset of x, so these are all metric spaces. So, this is a notion that makes sense on any metric space. What about paths? So, paths can be defined as the continuous image of a unit interval where one endpoint is mapped to x, another endpoint is mapped to y. So, this is So, for example, all the domains that I had a few slides ago, you know, these are all uniform domains. Even uniform domains can be quite have fractal-like boundaries. Okay, so maybe if you haven't seen this definition before, it's good to motivate this definition. I mean, there are a couple of reasons for uh why uniform events are important. Why uniform domains are important? First of all, there is a one-to-one correspondence between this family of uniform domains and Dromo-hyperbolic spaces that were shown by Bong, Hero, and Postland. Another reason is that there are lots of uniform domains. Every boundary domain can be approximated by uniform domain in the following sense. So, given a complete doubling metric space, okay, so the doubling metric space is related to the doubling measure that we saw in this morning's talk. The metric space is doubling if there is a Space is doubling if there is a non-zero measure that's doubling on that space. But there is a more metric definition that I don't want to get into, it's just quicker to define it this way. So if you have a complete W metric space, that's violations equivalent to a length space. The length space is something where, given any pair of points, the infimum of the length of curves is the same as the distance between those two points. And if you have a bounded domain, on such domain on such a complete doubling metric space that's bio-shit sequential length space and for any epsilon greater than 0 there are two domains omega o and omega i o stands for outside i stands for inside omega o is approximating omega from outside omega i is approximating omega from inside such that omega o is within epsilon neighborhood of the home domain that we started with and the same is true for the class limits for the inside domain. For the inside domains. So you can approximate any domain from both inside and outside to arbitrary position using uniform domains. So there is no shortage of uniform domains. For example, for specific geometries like the Heisenberg group with the parameter correct geometry, we know that balls are uniform, for instance, or half space are uniform. But this general result tells us that there is a lot more uniform dominance than. lot more uniform domains than those so okay I already mentioned this uniform domains can have fractal boundaries as we saw with the snowflake example that's also uniform domain in fact every quasi disk is a uniform domain and snowflake domain is an example of a quasi disk or quasi conform okay so this is our version of the group line formula The Group 9 formula. So we have some metric space entrip with the Dirichlet form such that there is a nice diffusion process that comes with a sub-Causion weakness in it, which is true in all those examples that we saw before. So Brownian motion or a diffusion generated by uniformly elliptic operator in Rn, they always satisfy such estimates. And Q is some uniform domain that satisfies the capacity density condition, and X0 is some base point. Some base point. Then the nine kernel has a continuous extension to the topological boundary. So here we are just using the metric topology, not the fine topology that I did not define. So this is the usual topology, all the way to the boundary. And then we can express the derivative energy of a harmonic function with respect to this energy on a uniform domain u with respect boundary. Form domain U with respect boundary condition as exactly given by the Group 9 formula. So there are two differences from the previous version of Group 9 formula. So in Group's version, the boundary was the Martin boundary. Here we are working with the usual topological boundary. As a result, the harmonic measure is now lives on the usual boundary, not the Martin boundary. So this is the statement. The statement. Just want to comment on a few aspects of our proof of this. So, our proof relies on what's called as the boundary hamlet principle, which was not available to do but at time. And the version of boundary hammock principle we use is a recent work of my student, Abo Chen. But the main ideas are already in the work of Ikava in the EPN setting. So, Chen generalized the work from So generalize the work from nucleon set into this more general metric context. And the degenerate diffusion of Molschnim and Osterosky that we saw in the very first slide satisfies the condition of theorem. So this diffusion process on the upper half space satisfies Lausch and heat conforms due to a couple of results. One due to shapes, scanning, and certain theory, where they show 0.20 polygon doubling property for the 0.20 polygon doubling property for this case, and then 0.1 doubling implies Gaussian pickled loads as I explained by the link this morning. So that's your Liborian Show loss. So therefore we can think of the result of Caferlian Sylvester or also of Molten and Oscarski as a special case of this Dube9 formula. So Dube's approach So, Doop's approach is only available for Brownian motion because it relies on the work of 9, which is only available for the Brownian motion. So, as far as we know, there is no research generalizing this work on fine normal derivatives with respect to the fine topology for general diffusions. For example, the version of group line formula is new even for elliptic operators, even for the upper half space. This is uniform electric operators and divergence form that was explained to us by Peter Fritz studying. In fact, even though this formula looks very similar, I want to point out that for uniform electric operators in divergence form, the harmonic measure can be quite singular with respect to the surface measure. So, for the usual Brownian motion on the upper half space, the harmonic measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the surface measure. Respect the surface measure. But for uniform elliptic operators, there is an example due to CAFERAL EFAX and KENIC, which is essentially due to Alfors and Berling. You know, they looked at some quasi-controlled mapping that was defined by Alforce and Berling, and they looked at the image of the dominant motion of the quasi-controlled mapping. This turns out to be a diffusion generated by a uniformly elliptic operator. And the harmonic measure is singular with respect to the surface measure. Respect to the surface measure. So, even though this formula looks like it should come from integration by parts, you know, this phenomenon of singularity tells us that somehow the harmonic measure is the right measure to do integration by parts. Okay, so we want to understand this trace process. So, this Doom Line formula tells us what the direct waveform of a trace process should be in order to further understand. Process should be. In order to further understand the trace process, we need to understand more about the components in this formula, namely the nine kernel and the harmonic measure. So let's first understand the harmonic measure. What can we say about the harmonic measure in this setting? So we are able to obtain estimates on the harmonic measure that are sharp oxygen constants. So we are under the same settings of the previous theorem. So you have a diffusion that satisfies subquotient equipment. Diffusion that satisfies subconscious and heat calpounds, and that's a uniform domain that satisfies the capacity density condition. And so, in this case, the harmonic measure of a ball centered at any boundary point, so C is some part on the boundary of radius r, where r has to be small enough compared to the distance from the base point. So, we are looking at the harmonic measure with base point x naught. So, the diffusion starts at x naught, and we want to estimate the probability that the diffusion exits. That the diffusion exits through a small ball of radius R centered at this ball report. And this probability is estimated from above and below by the ratio of Green's function. In the numerator, we have the starting point X0 and a point CR. Cr is a point that's roughly distance r away from the boundary from C and it's also roughly a distance r away from this point C. And such points exist due to the geometry of uniform domains. Due to the geometry of uniform domains, this is a well-known fact that there are points such that the distance between CR and C is comparable to the distance between C R and boundary. Because in uniform domains, you cannot have things like cusps. For example, if you have a cusp, this kind of points cannot exist near the cusp. But the geometry of the uniform domain guarantees that even though the boundary can be a fractal line, it's still quite nice. The boundary can be fractal line, it's still quite nicely behaved in this sense. And on the denominator, we have we pick two such points which are almost roughly distance r away from the boundary, point C and also distance r away from the boundary and also distance roughly r away from each other. So these are all up to constants. It turns out that the exact choice of C R and C R prime does not matter too much because of the usual Hernack inequality. The Greens function at nearby points are going to be comparable by Hernack's. ones are going to be comparable by Hermann's inequality. Okay, so this result for the Brownian motion is actually not due to us, it's due to Ikawa and Hirata. So I thought I mentioned Ikawa's work here, but in any case, this result for drawing motion is shown by Aikawa and Hirata 2007. They use an argument due to Bass and Birdseye for proving boundary Hernac principle. But somehow we avoided that. It's an iteration argument, but our argument is somehow more simple and probabilistic. So even though the result was not, our proof is still new. At least, even for the Brownian motion, our proof is new. But this result is new in this general context of diffusions or fractals. On fractals or diffusions on matrix spaces. Okay. So now we have a good understanding of the harmonic measure. We have a good understanding of what the Diracle form for the boundary of trace process should look like. And now we want to understand further properties of a trace process like the heat kernel. So I want to mention some very basic factors. A very basic fact in the theory of Dirichlet forms that was already mentioned in Peter Fritz's talk yesterday is that the Dirichlet form itself only defines the process up to a time parameterization. In order to choose the time parameterization, we have to choose a measure. And so in Peter's talk, the measure was the Louvre measure. But in our talk, our measure has to be suffered on the boundary because we want to look at some local time on the boundary. So, what's a natural measure on the boundary for some diffusion process? It has to be the harmonic measure because, in general, you might not have a notion of arc length or area or something like that for fractal domains or fractal boundaries. So, we look at the harmonic measure. Okay, so in the first example of Molstein and Ostrovsky, the local time. The local time for the y direction at zero serves as the boundary local time. So it has this following property. So the reason why we call it the boundary local time is because if we start the diffusion, the Molsonov ostroski diffusion at some point on the closed upper half space, then the local time immediately becomes positive with probability 1 if and only if you are on the boundary. You are on the boundary. So I mean, there are other measures that could satisfy this property. So there is still some choice. You have to still choose a good measure on the boundary. And the general theory is that, okay, so the boundary local time is what's an example of a positive bonus additive functional or PCIF, again from yesterday's talk of Peter Fris. So we want So, we want this local time that's associated with the boundary process to satisfy this property. So, local time should immediately become positive if and only if you are on the boundary. And from the correspondence between positive continuous radiative functions and measures, it amounts to choosing some measure on the boundary. So, I'm going to skip this because we saw the exact same definition yesterday. Saw the exact same definition yesterday of the positive continuous RT functional. So it's just an adaptive process that's non-decreasing and has this additive property. So the local time at time t plus s can be decomposed to the local time at time t plus local time at time s for the shifted path. And again, this was mentioned by Peter Fris yesterday. So there is a one-to-one correspondence between Between positive and necessarily functions for symmetric Markov process and measures that do not charge any sets of positive capacity. So, this is called the Revolutz correspondence. It comes from PhD thesis of Revoose. So, these two examples are also mentioned by Peter. You know, this is completely independent of Peter's slide. I somehow had the same examples because it's the most basic ones that explain. Once that explains the situation. So the local time at a point for the one-dimensional Browning motion corresponds to the Dirac mass. So that's an example. Another example is F times the reference measure corresponds to this local positive continuity function that's given by the integral of F over this path. So these are the two basic examples to keep in mind. But in our case, we want But in our case, we want something, some measure that supports on the boundary. So we want to choose a measure on the boundary, and I already mentioned that the harmonic measure is the natural choice because that's the only measure that's on the boundary that comes naturally from the diffusion process. And there is still a choice for how to choose the harmonic measure because we still need to fix a base point, and one way to fix. And one way to fix a base point is to choose some point that's somehow far away from the boundary. So, for boundary domains, we choose a base point such that the distance between this base point and the complement is almost as big as the diameter. And such base points exist, again, due to the property that it's a uniform domain. And this choice defines the measure, but only up to a bounded perturbation. If you have two such base points, then the rare negative derivatives can be uniformly bounded away from. Be uniformly bounded away from zero and infrared again because of elliptic and lack inequality. So, in some sense, it's not so satisfactory in the bounded case. We have some measure that's uniquely that's well defined only up to some small bounded perturbation. But in the unbounded case, we can do better. So, for unbounded domains, there's a canonical variant of the harmonic measure that's due to Kennedy and Toro for what's called non-tangentially accessible domains in RN. Domains in Rn. So this comes from looking at the harmonic measure with a base point and letting the base point go to infinity. And if we simply do that without any rescaling, the harmonic measure will typically go to zero. So we need to rescale it so that we get some non-zero limit. And one way to rescale it is to look at the Reeds function from the starting point Y for the harmonic measure. Y for the harmonic measure to some fixed reference point X0. And such limits are unique up to a constant multiple. So even if you choose X0 differently, the two limits will agree up to a constant multiplicative factor, which is much better than the bounded case. So for unbounded domains, we have a very canonical choice of a harmonic type measure. They call it the elliptic measure at infinity in the paper of Kenneth and Toro. That comes from looking at the harmonic measure, maybe starting at infinity and also rescale appropriately. So these are non-tangentially accessible domains? So non-tangentially accessible domains are also called as one-sided uniform domains because that's a special case of informed domains. So in some sense, their result doesn't quite apply to other settings. Their result doesn't quite apply to our setting, but their proof does. The proof relies on boundary HAMAC principle, which is still available. So the theorem 2, which is estimates on the harmonic measure, implies that this measure mu that we obtain in the bounded case and also in the unbounded case is a doubling measure. And this is very important for obtaining good heat curl bounds as we saw in this morning's talk. So we have a doubling measure. So, we have a doubling measure and it comes from looking at either the harmonic measure or rescaled limits of harmonic measures. So, for example, if you do this for the Marshino-Oskroski diffusion or the Kafer-Liesen-Wester example, we get the Lebesgue measure on the boundary as rescale limits of harmonic functions, which is a natural choice you would expect for the fractional across operating. So, this is our main result on the heat current estimate for the boundary trace process. So, we looked at, so we have fixed a boundary measure both in the bounded case and in unbounded case that comes from harmonic measure. So, this defines a positive continuous additive functional due to Rebouse correspondence. So, this can be thought of as the boundary local time in the sense that the positive continuous additive functional corresponding to this measure. functional corresponding to this measure is going to immediately be positive if and only if the starting point is only bounded. So that justifies the terminology bounded local time and also we can look at the right continuous inverse of this RT function AT and look at this time change process. So this is going to be a Markov process that lives on the boundary. It's a jump process and this jump process is going to be a new symmetric Markov process on the boundary. The post-degree form is given by the group 9 formula that we saw before. And okay, so the jump process satisfies stable like heat peel bounds. This is what I will try to explain in the next few slides. What do I mean by stable like heat panel bonds? So, in order to explain what stable like heat pelt bounds means, it's first helpful to look at what kind of heat panel estimate. Look at what kind of heat panel estimates the stable process satisfy on Rn. So, we can express the properties of alpha stable process on Rn in terms of the Lebesgue measure M and the Euclidean distance D and there's a space-time scaling function that's associated with the fractional Laplace operator, which is R alpha. So, the jump kernel is the object that's in the jump density in the Diracle form. Jump density in the Diracle form is given by, in fact, this is an exact equality up to a constant in the Euclidean case, but I just write this a comparison. The volume of a ball of radius dxy centered at x, that's the junk density between x and y. And phi of dxy comes from this space-time scaling function, R power alpha. So, you know, R power alpha is also natural for a stable process because that's the expected amount of. Because that's the expected amount of time an alpha-stable process spends in a ball of radius r when it started at the center. And the heat well estimates satisfy the following two-sided bound. So it's the on-diagonal part, which is 1 over the Lebesgue measure of a ball of radius v inverse of V. So in Rn, it's roughly like k to the power n over alpha. That's the on-diagonal estimate, and that's an off-diagonal estimate. It has this dk polynomial type dk as. DK, polynomial type dk as e go to infinity, that's given by t times whatever the jump density is. So that's the property of stable process and the heat current estimates for stable process. So you want to somehow abstract this into what's called as a stable-like heat current estimates. And this terminology. And this terminology is not due to us, but it has been studied for a long time, you know, since the early 2000s by people like Chen, Kumagai, Bass, Levin, and so on. So I'll show some relevant results soon. So you want to express the space-time scaling function for the boundary trace process that we have just constructed. So, in the bounded case, okay, so the one difference from the alpha stable case is that the space-time scaling function not only depends on the radius, but it also depends on where the jump process might start on the boundary. So, this space-time scaling function is comparable in the bounded domain case, the Reed's function between the base. The reads function between the base point x0 and a point CR, which is chosen exactly as before. So it's a point that's roughly distance r away from the boundary, but also distance r away from this point C. And in the unbounded case, there is a unique positive harmonic function that can be normalized, let's say, to be one at this point x0, such that it. This point x0 such that it has zero boundary condition and this function is called as the sometimes called as the harmonic profile or the Martin boundary point at infinity. So we choose this point and this function, this function, this harmonic function defined determines the space-time scaling function in the unbounded domain case. So in both cases, roughly the speed at which the Green's function decays as you approach the boundary determines Across the boundary determines the space-time scaling function for the boundary trace process. So, this is true both in the bounded case and the unbounded case. You know, let's look at some examples. So, for the marginal escrowski diffusion, this positive harmonic function that's unique to up to a multi-meting part is simply y less to the over alpha. So, this explains why we get an alpha-stable process, or at least the space-time scaling for the alpha-stable process that we see. That we see. And for the reflected drawing motion on the first order, we can again compute the harmonic function quite explicitly. It's just the product of the coordinates. This is the unique harmonic function of the positive altercative path stat that has zero boundary condition on the boundary of the object. And in that case, the space-time scaling function is given by this formula. I just look at some point that's distance r away in this 111. 111 direction. So we can write down explicitly in some specific examples, but in general, for example, in the separate speed target, this result is still true, but we do not know how to estimate this very well, except that saying that this grows like a polynomial from both above and below. So it would be interesting to look at specific domains and specific geometries. For example, you can look at Example, you can look at a ball in the Carmel-Carthoriometric for the Heisenberg group and ask yourself: okay, so you have this jump cross on the boundary of this ball, what's the space-time scaling function for this jump process look like? And it involves estimating this Green's function, which I don't know how to do for specific examples. But this theorem applies in all those situations as well. Okay, so this is what. So, this is what we mean by stable like thick nerve bounds. So, it satisfies the exact same bounds that we saw for R in Rn, except that we replaced the space-time scaling function with this new space-time scaling function that depends both on the starting point and on the distance. So, the junk kernel is given by 1 over the symmetric measure of a ball of radius, which is the distance between these two points, and the space-time scaling function evaluated here. And similarly, the expected exit time for the jump process. Exit time for the jump process starting at this boundary point C for a ball of radius R centered at this boundary point is again given by this function. That really comes from looking at the Greens function or the harmonic profile and the same is true for the heat nerve modes. So it's the exact same kind of estimates that was true in Rn, now it's true for domains with fractal boundaries or domains on fractals and so on. Fractals and so on. So I want to briefly mention some ingredients in the proof of theorem 3. Okay, so in fact, the first estimate, the junk kernel bond, is not too difficult because we know the exact formula for the junk kernel that comes from the group 9 formula. That along with estimates on the harmonic measure tells us, gives us this junk kernel. It gives us this jump pile estimate. The exit time bounds are a little bit harder. That actually relies on knowing something about the reflected diffusion process itself. So, in my earlier work, we showed that the reflector diffusion on a uniform domain inherits the same kind of subcotient Heatland estimate as in the ambient space. So, the space-time scaling for the diffusion process, the reflector diffusion. Process, the reflector diffusion is the same as the diffusion on the whole space. So, this heat kernel was crucial in proving this exit time bounds because one can show that the Green's function for the boundary trace process behaves exactly equal to the Green's functions for the reflected diffusion on a suitably chosen domain. And since Keeknel estimates have to integrate with respect to time, use Greens. With respect to time, use Green's function bonds. This was useful. And why is Green's function important? Because if we integrate the Greens function, we get the exit time, expected exit time. So that's roughly how the proof goes. And once we have these two estimates, the third estimate somehow comes for free using the general theory. And in this case, the general theory are researched due to Cheng, Kumaga, and Wang, and also due to Grigori and Hu and Hu, which allows us to Which allows us to obtain the signal estimates from the jump kernel estimates and exit tapox. So in a sense, the philosophy is similar to Cafrell and Sylvester. So Cafel and Sylvester wanted to understand non-local operators on the boundary of space using local operators inside the domain. So here we are somehow studying the boundary trace process using this reflected diffusion. Process using this reflector diffusion or like field diffusion inside the domain. Thank you very much for your attention. Questions? Yeah. So this is all like motivated by the fractional Cost-In, right? So have you ever thought about these problems from the point of view of the generalized Long-Rabbon equation, which is also supposed to have, it's also like kind of. It's also like kind of a model. It's supposed to do the same thing as fractional Brownian motion, but with memory. So it's the same model for these, like, you know, diffusion and mucus or plasma of the scholastic fluids. So your thought about how this would work if you looked at that equation? Not not really. I I mean even the cash flow is sorry, even the casual silver can be viewed as some version of Large One Dynamics, as a weighted uh version of Stellar Plus operator. Version of the Laplace operator. But for our results to apply, we need to know that this diffusion process satisfies this subcaution heat curl modes, which could be a strong condition. I think some of our results should be true much more generally. For example, the 29 formula I believe should be true with very little assumptions. But some of the more quantitative parts of our results, I don't think, can be obtained in. Can be obtained in too much generality without putting some quantity bounds under diffusion. That's my feeling. I suppose you start from the data of the boundary process and you don't have any geometric information about that it is a boundary. Could you tell when it was a boundary process and if it and if And if it qualifies as being a boundary process, could you reconstruct the process inside the boundary? Because it's often very useful to be able to realise a jump process as being a time change, a continuous process. And I was thinking maybe this would work in two dimensions, using you might be able to go and infer what the domain was if you. If you answer today, I answer by looking at some characteristics of the bal the boundary process. But I think it's a really good question because lots of people have thought about this. In fact, the same question that you asked goes by the name of Talduron problem. So, this is this somehow comes in this area of what's called as electrical infinite tomography. So, the idea is that you do some boundary measurements. So, the idea is that you do some boundary measurements and try to deduce properties of the medium inside. And so, there are some posture results. So, given a process on the boundary, so you have some jump process on the boundary, does it immediately determine the process inside, the diffusion process inside? So, this is okay. So, this problem is stated in an analytic way in Carl Jr. product, but in essence, it's the same as this probability state description. Description. So there are some positive results for elliptic operators if the coefficient is smooth. So these results, some of them goes back to the 80s. So that's a very nice survey by Uhlman. The title of the survey is something like Trail Ground Problem and Electrical Limpic and Chromography. But I do not follow all those results myself very much, so I'm not sure exactly what the state of the art. So, I'm not sure exactly what the state of the art is, but you can have a look at this. Yeah, I probably had a question whether you could take a local directory form in the corresponding process and use automation to get some information instead of looking at the kernel and that's right. Yeah, because then maybe, especially for fractals, if you use a coordinator that is kind of Coordinator that is kind of the same scale of your fractal, maybe you get even better estimates. That's right. So, in subordination, okay, so there are two ways to construct jump process from diffusions. One of them is to look at these kind of trace processes. The other one is looking at subordination, as you suggested. In subordination, the state space of the process does not change. They are still on the same space. The problem is somehow simpler because it's enough to understand the heat kernel from the subordinate. The heat kernel for the subordinator separately, and the heat kernel for the diffusion separately, and you can put them together using a simple formula that connects the subordinate process. So, that problem is in many ways simpler, and there are more resources for helping my cook.
