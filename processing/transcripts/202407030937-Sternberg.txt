So I want to talk about a couple of collaborations I've been involved with, both with Dimitri Golavati and Matien Sandier, and one problem also involving Alberta Montero, and another one involving a former student of ours, Christian Kofoy. So these are, as the title suggests, these are two problems that come out of Ginsburg-Landau theory, kind of Landau theory, kind of, I would say, both of them, I think of as modest steps of involving generalizing Ginford-Landau theory and some settings relevant to the liquid crystal model and to the setting of surfaces. And I'll try to, they seem like two different problems as I'll introduce them to you, but at the end of the talk, I'll make a few comments about kind of the general direction that we have in mind. Direction that we have in mind that in some sense involves both these problems. So the first one is just, I guess I think of it as maybe filling a gap in the literature, although maybe those in the audience may tell me this gap is already filled, which is to kind of extend Ginsburg-Landau theory from the setting of tangent vector fields on a surface. Tangent vector fields on a surface, which has been done, and I'll describe the previous work by other folks in a moment, to the study of, say, Q tenses on a surface. And that is, once we started looking into it, we realized that without much, any more sweat, really, we could talk in general about mappings involving just complex line bundles. By the way, By the way, I'll say a little bit about what that term means. But if the people in the audience who are not familiar with it, I wasn't either when I began this project. So I'll give you a little bit of background there. Okay, and then the other problem is we were interested in thinking about what happens when your surface has a singularity. And so I'm going to talk a little bit in the second half about. The second half about infrared-Landau theory posed for tangent vector fields, but on a surface that has a singularity, and our very modest step is to think of maybe the simplest setting that is just a cone with just a point singularity. Okay, so starting point is one that's come up a bunch of times in this. Up a bunch of times in this meeting already. Starting point is to just think about Ginsburg-Landel on a planar domain. So a lot of people have worked on this, including a lot of folks in this room. But certainly maybe the most influential work was that of BBH, Resis Petuel Le Lan, where they considered a complex value order parameter. Order parameter on a planar domain omega. And so we have an energy, it's just the great Dirichlet energy, and then this Ginfer-Glandau penalty. By the way, you know, you might think of this, I mean, this is usually called Ginfre-Glandau or simplified Ginfer-Glandau. If you included a magnetic field, you'd think of it as a model of superconductivity, though we have no magnetic field here. But I will say, you know, for this meeting, that you might think of this as. You might think of this as, if you like, a relaxation of one constant OCE frame. So this Kingsbury-Lando pen will be relaxing the S1 condition on the order. Okay. Anyway, so this has come up numerous times, but let me, just to make sure everybody's on board here, just remind you what the story there. You considered a Diracite condition that's asked one value, it's a G. Say G. Take it to have degree so that you force the solution to have zeros. That carries some winding number. These are the vortices. If I denote by u epsilon a minimizer, then really the main game was to figure out, okay, asymptotically where these vortices locate. Okay. And the punchline, basically, that there's a Basically, there's a convergence to a so-called canonical harmonic map away from D points, D being the degree or absolute value of D of D is negative. And so you get something that's S1 value away from these points, singular at these points, but carrying the degree around each of these points, so degree one or degree minus one, depending on the sign of the data. Okay, and the location. And the location is characterized by not the leading order term in the energy, but the order, which is logarithmic, but the next order term, which is order one and involves interaction of vortices. And so this next order term, this so-called renormalized energy, is a function of the vortex locations. And you minimize that, and you get a description of the asymptotic location of the vortex. Entire location of vortices. So that's BBH. Hardware. So, what about generalization to surfaces? A lot of people have done this. Probably I'm going to piss off somebody in the room here, maybe a lot of people, by not mentioning your names. Apologies. But here, I think the earliest stuff I'm aware of on generalization was a paper by Baraket for looking at BBH on a Riemannian surface. Surface with a complex order parameter. And then there's work in the setting of abelian Higgs, where you have the curvature form also, kind of a different flavor, but it's very much related work by Becquel and Rivier, Berlandi, Sing. It's all this work in the 90s. And I just mentioned one kind of cool, there's a relatively new paper by Conavari and Sagati. It's not exactly this. They can see. They consider one constant ocean-frank, but posed on a surface. So it's a related work, but much more recent than these other ones. Okay. But the work that's most relevant for what we're up to is this work of Bignat and Gerard. So I want to spend a lot of time. So, I want to spend a lot of time at the beginning here describing their result. So, what do they do? They want to consider a bunch of problems, but the one that's relevant here is the intrinsic gradient, or the intrinsic Dirichlet energy, I should say, on a surface, a closed, compact surface, no boundary. So, the objects they're looking at are tangent vectors on that surface. On that surface. And they basically want to, I can make it into a verb, BBH, this thing. They want to figure out the vortex locations, the renormalized energy, et cetera. And so that's what they do. So let me describe a little bit. So again, we take some compact, smooth surface embedded in R3, or consider more general objects, but let's just Consider more general objects, but let's just go with that. And so the energy, again, is defined over mappings into the tangent bundle here, into the tangent space. U maps your manifold into Tm. That's my notation for, I guess, standard for the tangent space. So this is an intrinsic problem. You're looking at the covariant derivative squared, A being is your convection there. And then, again, There, and then a Ginsberg-Landau handle. I get their paper, they look at some other problems as well. They look at extrinsic gradients, they look at a problem like this that's relevant to micromagnetics, but here I'm just focusing on this particular one. Okay, so I guess a key comment in comparing this to BBH is: why vortices? They have no boundary. So, in BBH, vortices are driven by the. Driven by the degree of the boundary data. Here, the presence of vortices are going to be driven by the topology. You've got a closed surface, you've got tangent vectors. So again, for example, think about a topological sphere. You can't have a smooth tangent unit vector field. So you're going to have to have some horizons. Okay. So, yeah, just a comment here, of course. The one case where you don't. One case where you're not going to expect to see vortices in a minimizing configuration would be a, say, a one-hole torus. Then you can have a smooth G-shaped. Go back one slide. When you write U. Yeah. So U is a complex scalar. My two. No, U is a vector. It's a vector that lives in the surface, or it's just a vector? At each point on the manifold, U. On the manifold, U is an element of the tangent plane. Sorry, yeah, I should have emphasized that. Okay. Right. So except for the case of the one-hole torus, the topology is going to, you expect it to generate some singularities. So what do they do? They get an expansion for the energy by identifying kind of the analog of the canonical harmonic matter. Of a canonical harmonic map of BBH, they're talking about a canonical harmonic vector field, I'll call U star. So roughly, you know, given some vortex, given some points on your manifold, and in general, you don't have to have degree one, a collection of degrees. There's a constraint that they have to add up to the Euler characteristic, but okay. You have a map that's singular at those points, but otherwise smooth. Smooth, not, and I didn't write it out. Oh, here I did. It has to be unit length, having the appropriate degree. So roughly, that's their analog of a canonical harmonic map. Okay, so they kind of build this thing, but there's kind of, I mean, some of it is quite similar to BDH, but there are definitely some major complications. But there are definitely some major complications. One of them, which isn't going to play a big role in what I have to say today, but I certainly should mention it, is that they have to deal with the presence of what are called harmonic one forms. So given the genus, there are two G harmonic one forms. These are, think of this as objects that are the differential of harmonic functions that exist on your... That exist on your, or as long as the genus is non-zero, that exist on your surface, and you can kind of add them to the phase of that canonical harmonic map or any linear combination of them. And they can, in general, lower the energy, you know, if you take the appropriate linear combination. And so, but there's a cost associated with them, basically integrating along along. Integrating along closed curves with these harmonic one-forms, you get what Girard and Ignat call flux integrals, denoted by phi here. And so it's an added complication that the phase, the construction, let's say, of that canonical harmonic map involves this kind of extra degrees of freedom. I guess the way I think of it is: the simplest example I think of is: take a circular torus. So let's call this angle, it goes this way, theta. This angle that goes this way theta, and the angle that goes this way, say phi. So those are two harmonic functions, multivalued harmonic functions, and you could kind of basically add combinations of those guys to the phase and possibly lower your energy by taking appropriate linear combinations. So that's kind of what's going on here in this more general setting. Okay. So continuing with what they did. Continuing with what they did. They take balls, okay, geodesic balls, about points on your surface. And as with BBH, the cost of a vortex is logarithmic. It's in general proportional to the square of the degree. But then they go further and get the next term in the expansion beyond the log. That's your renormalized energy. So that's this. This W here, so it's going to, if you're given a collection of points, you're given a collection of degrees, again, they have to add up to the right number, turn to the Eul characteristic, and these flex integrals, and you get, this you can take as a definition of the renormalized energy. You just take the Dirichlet energy of this canonical harmonic map, subtract off the logarithmic part. What's left over is order one, and then we've got a formula for it. Then we get a formula for it. Fairly explicit formula. Explicit in terms of the Green's function, the Laplacian on that surface. So is that explicit? In general, you don't have an explicit formula for that, but you can say at least locally it looks like a log, you know, in a little patch. Okay. All right. So last slide about Igna Girard. So they get an energy expression. So they get an energy expansion. The number of vortices then corresponds to the Euler characteristic. I'll use this letter E in this talk for that. The Euler characteristic associated with that tangent bundle is just 2 minus 2 times the genus. And you get the limit of harmonic map, degree 1 vortices, and their locations given by their normalized energy. So they have indeed dbhed. DDH the problem for tangent vector fields on the surface. Really nice piece of work. Okay. So again, these two problems, let me kind of restate them. So the first one I'm going to be talking about is: what if instead of tangent vector fields, we had one? Well, we wanted to just kind of pin down the story when you have two tenses rather than. Rather than with applications to liquid crystals in mind. And again, without any really much more sweat, you could think about complex hermission line bundles as well, rather than just changing vectors. So, you know, these words don't mean anything to you. I'll have a few slides talking about that. And then the second problem involving singularities would be: you know, what if, go back to the case of the tangent bundle, what if the surfaces Surface is not smooth. And again, our baby step, if you will, was just to think of: okay, what about a cone, a circular comb with one singular point? And I'll talk a little bit at the end about some of our motivation, but it may feel like just mathematicians saying, oh, let's make things a little bit more complicated and put a singularity in there. But I will say that the idea of looking at The idea of looking at textures on cones. We're certainly not the first ones to do this. In particular, there are people in this room who did a lot of work on looking at, say, symectic structures on cones, like this work of Mosna, Beller, Kamyon, and further papers by these folks and Zhang and Nelson. So there have been works on liquid crystals on a conical substrate in the past. So, but okay. In the past. So, but okay, we're going to take we have kind of a different direction in mind in terms of things where you land out leaving. Okay. All right, but back to the first question. Okay. So this is, again, work with Dimitri Golovatti and Etienne Sanguer and Alberto Montero. So we take, again, we're looking at this intrinsic This intrinsic Dirichlet energy and then a Ginsburg-Landelf penalty, but now U is just a section of a complex Hermitian line bundle, L. Meaning what? So think of it as just some object that sits over M and associated with it, you have a kind of a complex structure, a complex vector space of dimension one over each point on the manifold. So again, Um so again, what we're thinking of is say a Q tensus or a two by two symmetric trace-free matrix, if you will. So which we can associate with R2 or with C. So that one example is again with the idea that you could think of this as kind of a penalization, if you will. This is kind of a penalization, if you will, of an Osine-Frank type energy, if you want to think in terms of liquid crystals, where you have tangential anchor on the surface. Okay. So what is this? So I want to basically argue that essentially the technology developed by Ignut and Girard, which was based on the technology developed by lots of folks, but in particular BBH, is Particular BDH, it's pretty much unchanged there. Because, I mean, how do you, what is this U? The way you work with one of these emission line bundles is just to work with so-called trivialization. So you cover your surface with a bunch of patches, say u alpha, that are going to be overlapping. And within any one patch, you describe it as this tribulation is just a complex valued function. Is just a complex-valued function. And then these on the different patches, these different tributizations have to talk to each other. So that's done through some transition functions, phi alpha, beta on the intersection of two patches through this. So u alpha is e to the i, phi alpha, beta, u beta. So you have a way of moving along from one patch to another, and then you need to talk about covariant differentiation. Then you need to talk about covariant differentiation. So there's also a connection, which is just these are one forms defined on each of the patches. And again, as a tangent plane, you have to kind of describe how one tangent plane talks to another one, so to speak. And so you have this relationship that the connection on an intersection of two patches say A alpha is related to A beta by D of this transition function. Okay, so this is called the connection. So, this is called the connection. And if you notice, if you take, it's locally defined, but if you take d of this expression, then you get d squared over here. So, you do have a globally defined d alpha. That's the curvature form. Okay. And then you can define your covariate differentiation with respect to some vector field through a formula like this. So yeah, so basically there's not much work to be done. I mean, so this first problem I'm telling you about these first results are really just kind of grabbing stuff that this person did and grabbing stuff that that person did and putting them together here. So because things are, the trivializations are complex value, basically the technology that was already developed. That was already developed, for the most part, carries over. I mean, there's some issues with identifying the appropriate connections, et cetera. So the work of Bigner and Girard carries over fairly easily. So just main point here is that instead of a canonical harmonic vector field, you have a canonical. Harmonic vector field, you have a canonical harmonic section. Same story. It's going to be modulus one in terms of these tributarizations defined off of a finite set of points. But the key thing here is, and this is where the topology comes in, is that, okay, you're not going to have one of these smooth sections of modulus one with degree one about a set of points unless the number of points is equal to the Euler cadence. All right. All right. So, what about the case? What we really had in mind is what about the case of these cube tenses? So, that's kind of our main example of our line bundles here. So, suppose you have a Q tensor. So, these are Q tensors. So these are Q tensors, they're trace feed, they're symmetric. Rank two tensors defined on the tangent space. Here, let me just use this notation, T2 sim for symmetric. So that's our line bundle. And so what is there to say? Well, so one issue is, well, how many singularities should there be? Now, you know, within the literature, I think it was kind of, depending on where you're coming from, this was certainly a well-known. Coming from, this was certainly a well-known thing that if you had cube tensors, you expect, let's say, if you're on a topological sphere, you should have, say, four singularities. But we wanted to kind of pin this down in a rigorous way, starting from the limit of Ginsburg-Landau. And so the issue was then to carefully identify the Euler characteristic of the line bundle corresponding to these two tensors. Because once you have that, you integrate GA and you get just by Gauss-Bonet, you're going to have a characterization of how many singularities you've got there. So really the issue becomes, okay, how does the Euler number differ from that of the tangent bundle? And that really corresponds to figuring out how the connection form differs. Because once you have that, Right, because once you have that, you take DA, you integrate, you're done. So, just in one slide here, this is just kind of a trivial thing that if you have the tangent bundle, so let me say locally describe E1 alpha, E2 alpha, some local frame. Then, you know, then you have these formulas that relate the covariate derivatives, so the covariate derivative, the derivative. So, the covariant derivative, the derivative of E1 is AE2, and the derivative of E2 is minus AE1. That's kind of a standard thing. And then, so when we're talking about these Q tensors, all we need to do is find a good basis, an orthonormal frame, for these Q tensors. I'll call it QO and QE. This one stands for odd and even. But you just form these guys. E1 tensor E1 minus E2 tensor E2. That's one of these trace-free symmetric. That's one of these trace-free symmetric eyes, and E1, E2 plus E2, E1. So if you were in the plane, all I'm talking about is 1, 0, 0, minus 1, and 0, 1, 1, 0. The guys with ones on the off-diagonals, or 1 and minus 1 on the diagonals. So that's your basis. And then just using the product rule, you just compute these derivatives using these formulas for how the derivatives are. How the derivatives of the tangent vectors vary. And in one line, you find there's a factor of two. So the connection form has a two in it. And so then, again, just by Gauss-Bonnet, you find the Euler characteristic associated with that line bundle is twice what it was for the tangent bundle. And by the way, we also worked it out for if you have a case. A K-tensor that's symmetric, trace 3. You can make an appropriate definition of that. The plane, if you like, R2 tensor, R2, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And then take the symmetric guys that have trace zero. I'm told by my collaborators that that has relevance in meshing because work by Dimitri with with Dan Spyrne and Alberto Montero. I refer you to Dr. Golovaki if you want to know about what this has to do with mesh and Know what this has to do with mesh, but okay, so what are the conclusions here? So, oh yeah, that's right. I just wanted to finish up this part of the talk by saying, what if you have a topological sphere? So, if you have a topological sphere, then zero, so you get four singular. Again, this is depending on the context. This is depending on the context. This was well known, but okay, here we're kind of writing it down in this context of Q tensors and limits of Ginsburg-Landau. And then you can describe the location as a minimum of the renormalized energy, which if you have some, again, it's explicit in the sense that it's determined, it's given as a formula in terms of the Green's function. Formula in terms of the Green's function. But one thing that's kind of nice is: what if you take a round sphere? Then the Green's function is literally just the log, right? It's just the log of the chordal distance between the two points. So then you look at, oh, and another thing is if you take a sphere, I should have mentioned that. Remember those harmonic one forms? There are none. The dimension of the space of harmonic one forms is twice the genus. One form is twice the genus. So if you're on a sphere, there aren't those. So you don't have to worry about those horrible flux integrals. Okay, maybe they're not horrible, but you don't have to worry about it. So the renormalized energy is just a sum of logs. And so then we have on this reference, I don't know if there's something earlier, but there's this work of Cohn and Kumar, who consider what are called completely monotone potentials and And they study where the minimum occurs in terms of a given number of points on the sphere. Completely monotone, by the way, if you're not familiar with that phrase, just means you've got a potential where, you know, the derivative is positive, second derivative negative, third derivative positive, fourth derivative negative. So alternating signs. But in particular, in this setting, they have a proof that the minimum configuration may be not shocking. Configuration, maybe not shockingly, occurs at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron. I mean, in general, you expect with renormalized energy, these vortices don't like each other, so they want to get as far away from each other as possible. Okay, so that's first problem. Okay. So, generalization to now we want to go back to Now we want to go back to tangent vector fields, still the intrinsic Dirichlet energy. So, slight change in notation. So, this is again your covariant derivative here, but this is your intrinsic gradient. But now, I want to consider a situation where you do have boundary, but I want to take an actual circular cone. So, actually, for further reference, I'm going to draw it up here. The reference, I'm going to draw it up here. There's my cone. I'll call this C alpha. Who is alpha? Well, if you take a slice and unwrap this thing, then this is alpha. And I'll call, I think I may use this notation a little bit later on, I'll call a C alpha hat down in the plane. cos C alpha hat down in the plane. So if you unwrap the cone, you know we get a sector like this of angle alpha. That's the alpha. Okay. So we wanted to see what's the issue here. Well is this is there kind of a pinning phenomenon for example are the vortices drawn to the to the to the tip of the cone which I think I'm going to refer to as I call this here. How are the vortices distributed? But how does the energy change, the asymptotics of the energy, et cetera? Okay. And oh, I should have said this. So this is work again with Dimitri and Chin Sonye and Christian Caudefoyd. Okay. So, but now again, we don't have a closed surface, so we're going to drive. We don't have a closed surface, so we're going to drive the or force the presence of singularities through a Dirichlet condition, just as in ZDH. Okay, so we take a vector field G, so it's going to be tangent to the cone. It's defined on the boundary, that upper boundary of the cone, and it's going to be of modulus one. And degree, say d-bar. Degree, one has to be careful with here. I have another slide in a minute talking. I have another slide in a minute talking about what I mean by degree on this surface, but yes. I just want to talk about who I know they are. Who they are. Yes. Brezis, Betuel, and Elan. Okay. So, yeah, so we're interested in the position of the vortices, but also, because we have some maybe uglier problems in mind for the future, which I'll Uglier problems in mind for the future, which I'll mention briefly at the end. We kind of wanted to test the water with the tools that BBH developed, that Ignat and Girard developed, et cetera, to see how much they're going to change, how easy it's going to be to move into a situation of a singular surface. Okay. So, right. So, degree. So if you have, let's start with a smooth surface first of all. If you've got a smooth surface and you have a map from that surface into its tangent space, suppose you take some open set on the surface and have some boundary. And suppose u is nice and non-vanishing on that boundary. Then you can talk about degree in the following way. You can introduce, I'll call J of U. Introduce I'll call J of U, which is the inner product of IU and the gradient. So you get, it's like a one form. But anyway, if you were down in the plane, and if u is just say, say, e to the i phi, something, say, S1 value, then this is nothing more than the differential of the phase. So if you're down in the plane, the degree, forget about this first term. The degree, forget about this first term here, the degree would just be j of u over the modulus squared if u isn't, that's one value. But anyway, you're just basically integrating the change in phase, you get 2 pi times some integer. There's the degree if you're down in the point. But if you're on a surface, this won't be an integer. This is related to the change in phase, but the fact that you have curvature, the tangent planes are changing, tells you you have to. You have to adjust for it to get yourself an integer. You have to integrate the Gauss curvature over that open set whose boundary is the curve boundary open. So once you do that, that gives you degree on a surface. That's a definition of it. Okay. Now, we're on a cone. Gauss curvature is zero everywhere, but there's a singular point, right? Singular point. So the deal is basically that you should think of the Gauss curvature as a delta function. It's concentrated at that tip. So here's the story. So if you have some curve on that cone and you want to compute its degree, sorry, the degree of some map U along that cone. U along that curve. So it depends on whether this set O goes around the tip or not. If it doesn't, you've got Gauss curvature zero, you got a smooth surface, everybody's happy. You just integrate J. If it's modulus one, J over U squared in modulus. If it's modulus one, you just integrate this J, and you get degree. On the other hand, if you're On the other hand, if your curve encircles the tip, then there's this kind of, again, you can think of it as a delta function of Gauss curvature, but you have to subtract off something in order to get an integer. And so maybe it's a good time to introduce, use this later anyway. So you can think of an orthonormal frame here if I call this vector t in general pointing along a generator. And when you go along a circle here, you can think of that as an orthonormal frame for your cone. And then you need to subtract off the J corresponding to T. Basically, there's a rotation of the coordinate system itself, or of the frame. Or of the frame itself needs to be taken into account in order to get yourself an image. Now, this one here, I have to tell you, personal comment, this one has caused me more grief than any one in any paper I've ever written. But anyway, that's really just a matter of convention whether you're going to put this one in here. But if you put this one in here, one thing that one reason for defining One reason for defining degree in that way is the following. It's an easy computation to compute J of this T, or for that matter, you could work with the N just as well. But it turns out to be alpha. It basically is measuring the change in either T or N as it traverses the cone or if you look at the unfolding as it moves through that sector. So if you go back to this guy, If you go back to this guy, you're seeing that the degree is 1 over 2 pi integral of plus, oh, this is in the case of the boundary condition, for example. You get 1 over 2 pi j of the boundary condition plus that 1. And then this, as I said, this comes out to be alpha over 2 pi. So you can see that if you opened up the cone all the way, if alpha were 2 pi, and you're really just down in the plane again, then you'd like to get your usual definition of degree. You'd like to get your usual definition of degree, and so you'll get this integral of plus one minus one. You get the kind of the right definition of degree. Okay. I will say, though, and this will come up a little later, that if you were to describe a u, a tangent vector here, in terms of say some u1, in fact, I'm going to call it u1 hat of some, u1 hat, say t plus u. T plus U2 hat N, describing any tangent vector field on here, then another object you could think about is the degree of this guy, which you could think of as a complex value or R2 value vector defined on the sector here. And then there's just the usual degree of that guy. That guy's going to be one less than this definition of degree I gave here. Because there's also the one from the wrapping. There's also the one from the rapid coordinate system. Okay. So, what do we show? So, here's the story. I just want to tell you about, I'm not going to get into renormalized energy, but just tell you about the leading order behavior. So you take a sequence of minimizers for this problem. You take a boundary condition that has degree d bar. Then the leading order energy. The leading order energy is logarithmic. So you're going to have some vortices. And so we're going to, if this were down in the plane, if this were BBH, you'd just say pi times d bar log epsilon. But here, this M, it turns out that the leading order asymptotics, in some cases, depend on the opening angle. So if the degree of that boundary can The degree of that boundary condition is positive, which, yeah, if the degree is positive, or if this is less than or equal to zero and the opening is not, in some sense, too big, then you get that the coefficient is this absolute value of d bar minus one plus alpha over two. So again, thinking in terms of this vector field here, in terms of In terms of this vector field here, in terms of vortices, you know, take for example if d-bar were five, you're going to get four vortices. And what we find is they're not located at the tip. And then there's the actual winding that's just inevitable. There's a cost, if you like it, there's a fractional vortex, I guess that's a better way to put it, at the tip. And this is how much it costs you energetically times a log. But there's this dichotomy because we found that if d bar is less than or equal to zero, and again, going back to that one that I told you torments me, if you look at this vector field here, that would correspond to this vector field having degree negative. If that is negative, then it turns out it's energetically advantageous when the cone has a pretty big opening to put some of the vortices of degree minus one away from the tip. One away from the tip, and one of them at degree minus one at the tip. So it depends on the open. So that's, you know, in terms of the statement of the result, that's the effect of this singularity. It can kind of attract a vortex or not, depending on the opening, particularly when the degree is negative. Okay. What's that? Just a few minutes. Just a few minutes. Okay, so let me just. So so that's how the answer changes. What about the approach? So just say a few words about that and finish. So one thing is that to be tangent, if you're going to be a unit vector, say, all the way down to the tip, you're going to create a singularity. And that's going to cost an infinite amount of energy. Going to cost an infinite amount of energy. So, you're going to have to have U going to zero towards the tip. So, that's just one remark here. The rest of this slide I've already said. So, you know, Coptice variations, what do you do? You get upper bounds, you get lower bounds, you go home. So, for lower bounds, just a comment about how some of the technology that was developed from DBH and by Bob Girard and Kim. By Bob Girard and Kien Sanghier, how does it change? Well, so Sanghier and Girard independently have this method of what's called ball growth. So Dan was mentioning in his talk yesterday about getting the energy in an annulus about a vortex, and so Gerard and Sanjay said, well, you cover the vortex sets, basically, they cover the set where the order parameters are small with balls, then you grow them. Then you grow them in order to get kind of and merge them in order to get kind of a good, a good bad ball, a ball that covers the vortex. And there's this growth procedure, very elegant approach for then computing lower bounds. And that's where things got messy for us. If you start covering the bad set, the set where the order parameters are small, and maybe you start growing your. Order parameters small, and then you start growing your expanding this ball, think of it in a cone, it can self-intersect. Now you don't have a ball any longer. Or you could have a ball that contains a tip and another ball that doesn't, and they bump into each other as you grow. And so there are all sorts of technical issues. In the interest of time, I'll just say that in the end, we resolve this by realizing we should always, in this process, maintain one ball centered at the tip. Maintain one ball centered at the tip. And when it bumps into anybody else, it swallows it. So you always have a ball centered at the tip. I'll leave it at that. And then for upper bounds, let me just draw one picture and I'll hand you what that is, which is so you could conformally map your sector into a disk and And so, in a disk, we know what to do in terms of EVH. So, you can kind of do that kind of construction in a disk where the technology is well understood, and then go to a sector. There's a bit of a complication in the sense that if you kind of slice your cone and open it up, and you have some vector field on the cone, it is. I don't know if that's a good thing for it. But anyway, there it is. But anyway, there is when you unwrap, there's a jump in the tangent vector, so you have to modify that to handle that jump. So it's not quite as straightforward as it sounds, but anyway, you can do an upper bound calculation using the conformality. The Dirichlet integral doesn't change from here to here. You're just unwrapping, and here it's a conformal map, so the Dirichlet doesn't change. Okay, and so let me, I'll skip. And so let me, I'll skip all that. My terrible picture here. In fact, so we've looked at these two problems, one with line bundles, where we, the main issue is that we established that the limit of minimizers has singularities at twice the number of singularities you have for the tangent bundle. And then, this, what we just talked about for a cone. And so. And so, what about future directions? Well, finish with this. So, certainly, we would like to think about more severe singularities, in particular, what if it's not a circular cone? What if it's not a cone at all? What if there's a cusp singularity? And actually, for directions we have in mind, what if there's a fold singularity? What if it's not just a point? And I guess one of the areas we really have in mind is to think. To think down the line about pneumatic textures on deformable membranes. You know, in a situation of, say, a vesicle where you've got something like an Ocean-Frank energy, okay, but you also have, well, depending on what community you come from, a health-rich energy or a Wilmore energy, an energy involving the mean curvature squared. So then you have this interaction of that kind of a term with the deformation due to the Deformation due to the director of the liquid crystal. So, those are the kind of directions we had in mind when we started on this. This is easy to just two little steps. And I'll finish with that. Any questions? I'm a curiosity about your growing border. Your growing ball construction, I mean you said there is that issue of a ball that can wrap around, but I don't see how having a ball at the tip, as you said, deals with that issue. Right. So if the ball wraps around, what we do, it sounds kind of violent, we add it to the guy at the tip. Sounds like a terrible thing to do. But it turns out we can control the growth. So that's our answer to any trouble. Any trouble. If a ball away from the tip hits the ball at the tip, throw it into the ball at the tip. If a ball self-intercepts, throw it into the ball at the tip. And it turned out that we could, again, we could control the rate at which these balls grow and make that whole story work. Thank you very much for your very, very nice talk. So I was just wondering: so, do you think, actually, you said you have a renormalized. But you said you have a renormalized energy as well, right? Yeah, well, I would say we're, okay, if I'm being honest, we have not totally finished the proof of what it's going to work. But that was that, yeah. And so, I mean, even leaving aside the renormalized energy, but just the zeroth thing, do you think you would be able to do something on polyhedra as well, for instance? Oh, yeah. I think, yeah. All singularity, I think. Maybe we have no. Maybe absolutely what we have in mind sometimes. So we have a one-time ten-forward sense of that.
