Process that occurs within a single cell. Plasmid segregation and plasmid replication. So, as plasmids can be carried in multiple copies per cell, if they are randomly distributed in the cell, then the moment the cell divides, it produces two daughter cells and plasmids are distributed randomly between them. Of course, there are some plasmids that have some active partition mechanisms ensuring that equal number of plasmids are on equal. Number of plasmids are on each button cell, but that's not a general case. Once a new cell is born, then it continues growing and plasmids replicate until they reach a certain number of plasmids and then they stop replicating. And this process is repeated periodically. Of course, there is a probability larger than zero than a plasmid will be lost. A plasmid will be lost. Well, one of the daughter cells does not inherit a plasmid, and therefore, this plasmid is, well, this cell doesn't contain any plasmids, and therefore the offspring also doesn't contain any plasmids. And that's what we call certificational instability. Another interesting feature of plasmids, and we've discussed it for the past few days here, is the possibility that they impose a fitness cost, a fitness cost. A fitness cost to the host. For instance, expressed in a longer or faster duplication rate for plasmid-free cells with respect to plasmid varying cells. We will return to that point later on. Another interesting feature that we have studied in the past is the fact that if a mutation appears in a gene that is encoding in a plastic, then because it's It's a multicopy plasmid, then there is a period of time where the ancestral and the mutant alleles coexist within a single cell, increasing genetic intracellular genetic diversity, and producing a really complex dynamics of kind of like two-coupled systems of a plastic within a cell and that cell within a population. And of course, those mutations can be also lost through what's called segregation of treatment. What's called segregational drift. And also, plasmids are very important drivers of active evolution because they can also be transferred horizontally and even between hosts of different species. Okay, so this is of course just a cartoon of all the different features that have plasmids and how the plasmid dynamics. And how the plasmid dynamics that occurs with even single cells. But many studies, and Sebastian was mentioning a few the other day, that have focused on studying the interaction between all these processes, how these processes interact between them and produce stable plasmids within the population. In particular, it has been shown using mathematical models that thus In the absence of selection for the beneficial genes, then the horizontal transmission has to be larger than the fitness cost in order to be able to maintain the population. What's called the laying criteria for existence. And what we have been focusing in the past few years in my lab is to try to study how does heterogeneity or variability in some of these traits impact plasmid dynamics. And I'm going to be talking briefly about And I'm going to be talking briefly about two examples here. One of them, the first one, is with respect to plasmid copy number heterogeneity. So, in general, if one poses a differential equation model, we can assume that every cell in the population contains the same number of plasmids. But of course, that doesn't occur in reality because I was explaining in this cartoon. I mean, cells are randomly segregated. Cells are randomly segregating and replicating plasmids, and copy number controls are not, I mean, the mechanism of copy number control is not perfect, and cells are not, well, they are not synchronized. And therefore, we produce, as the population grows, a population will be composed of cells with a varying number of plasmids. So, what we wanted to know is, well, what are the consequences of this? And our hypothesis is that if you have a wide distribution of plasmid copy numbers, then Of plasmid copy numbers, then you have at any moment in time coexistence between the susceptible cells, so plasmid-free cells, or low-copy plasmid cells, and cells with high-copy numbers. To test it experimentally, we used a multi-copy plasmid and E. coli that plasmid is carried about 20 copies per cell with our beta-lactam resistance gene and a fluorescent marker. Marker. And the first thing we wanted to see is if we introduce, I mean, we increase the concentration of antibiotic, if we see that this distribution of plasmid cutting numbers, or in this case, fluorescent, as a proxy of plasmid cutting numbers, if as we increase the concentration of antibiotic, if that distribution shifts towards the right. And indeed it does, suggesting that maybe selection is acting upon a subpopulation of cells that is highly resistant. is highly resistant. Indeed, when we, a consequence of this is that we compared it with a control that had the same gene but card in the chromosome and what we observed is that if you impose the population to intermittent periods of selection, then those cells that were carrying the gene, the beta-lactam gene in the plasmid were producing more The plasmid were producing more variability, and therefore, the probability of survival was higher compared to the chromosomal strain. So, we were very happy. But of course, there are multiple explanations to this behavior. One of these, and that's something we were discussing also on Monday here, the difference between noise and plasticity. Because another possibility would be that as you increase the concentration of antibiotic, then plasmid copy number is, I mean, replication of plasmid is enhanced, or transcription or something. Is enhanced or transcription or something else. So, to test that this was not the case, but we did this to use a micro-fleeting device similar to, well, not as fancy as the one Rock was using the other day, but still, we were able to observe in a single focal plane a population of cells under the microscope and then slowly or gradually increase the concentration of antibiotic and see what happens to the cells. We put a fluorescent stain with the antibiotics, so the moment the cells die, they turn purple for traumatic effect. No, also because we want to see when were they killed. And you can see kind of here, the ones that survived at the end were the ones that were originally highly fluorescent at the beginning. And the other thing that's to notice is that throughout this whole process, fluorescent remains. This whole process, fluorescent remains constant until the cell dies. So it doesn't seem to be like there's an over-expression or over-replication of plasmids, but more like antibiotics are selecting on highly resistant subpopulations within this population. Interestingly, this GFP or this plasmid copy number amplification that occurs in the presence of antibiotic. In the presence of antibiotic, it is very fluid in that way, but very flexible. Because if we remove the antibiotic, then it very rapidly returns to the original distribution, which is something we would expect also if low copy number cells are present and then you remove the antibiotic, then those are not paying a cost and therefore they start replicating and rapidly replacing those highly resistant cells that grow very slowly. If the gene is carried in the chromosome, we don't observe that overexpression, and we also, of course, we don't see anything a change in the distribution of copy numbers in the population when we remove the antibiotic. Furthermore, this effect depends on the concentration of antibiotic. So the higher the concentration of drug that we use, the further the shift it is towards the right. The shift it is towards the right, and if we remove that periodic, they also return to the same place. So it seems to be not only this scalable identification is very flexible, but it's also very dynamic in terms of the population that it produces. And we most are multi-scale models of plastic dynamics, and it occurs basically the same. Okay, but what I really wanted to talk to you about today is a Talk to you about today is about heterogeneity in a different aspect, and it's with respect to fitness cost. And this follows very nicely from Alicia's talk on Monday, but she was discussing some data that Alvaro had obtained in the hospital he was working on with this very nasty plasmid, Peoxa48, that is a very clinically relevant plasmid and that they observe very frequently in their hospital. So, what Adoro did was, and his group did, was to take 50 samples from patients, remove the plasmid that were containing the plasmid, remove the plasmid, and then compared what was the relative fitness of plasmid bearing strains with respect to plasmid-free strains in order to compute the fitness cost. And they were all kind of ecologically compatible strains because the plasmid was found in Found in those hosts. And for our surprise, we obtain a very wide distribution. The mean of that distribution is below one, and that's what we would expect. That implies there is a cost associated in general, in the meaning average. But yet, if you look at the distribution, it's like a very wide distribution of fitness effects with a very large tail in the right, but crosses one, which means that there are some holes for which this very Are some hosts for which this very horrible plasmid actually confers a benefit in the absence of antibiotics? So we were asking, I mean, we wanted to use mathematical modeling to ask, kind of, to address the following questions. I mean, what's the effect of this wide DFE distribution? Distribution of fitness effects on plasmid travel. Also, how variable is this interaction between hosts, plasmids, and the environment? And what is the effect of such a plasmid in a polymic? A plasmid in a polymicrobial community, and how does that drive structure? Can I ask a question here? So, how much of that might also be experimental error? Sure, sure, sure. Yeah, is that? I mean, we're not testing it in a gut, no? So it is in a. But even just if you measure fitness multiple times, how accurate is the fitness measurement in the so how much of this breadth of distribution might be experimental error and how much is real? Like the experimental error and how much is real of this? Maybe if we grow, I mean, it is in one specific environment and grow in isolation, so surely it's not the same as in the host. But we did it in multiple environments, and maybe not a single, I mean it's not the same clone that always has a higher benefit, but what's definitely true is that you have a very wide distribution, and there are some values that are on the right-hand side. You have a copy number of the last unit? Copy number of the plasmid? Oh, this is a low copy number plasmid in this specific case, yeah. And it has post-aggregational killing mechanisms and it's kind of like a large plasmid. Fitness is competition between... Yes, it's a competition between plasmid-free and plasmid varying in equal proportions. And then we put them on the we roll them together, and then using a flow cytometer, we can count how many cells. Lois cytometer, we can count how many cells there are in each subpopulation, and therefore we can estimate the proportion of one with respect to the other one and therefore estimate this relative fitness. Sorry, I'm kind of made all this. They don't lose the plasma, like there's no opportunity for them to lose the plasmid during the scale of the experiment? Usually it doesn't. I mean we did observe some cases where the plasma was cleared, but in general it's not. It's also very, this is a congenitive plasma, I forgot to mention it, so even if they I forgot to mention it. So, even if they are lost through segregation, it's probably very rapidly recovered. Sorry, if it's an educative plasma, is it not possible? Sorry? Is it not possible that it infects the other strain? So, how do you then discount competition? Well, in this case, we only have two populations, that plasmid brain and a plasma-free strain. So, there is, of course, the possibility that they will transmit the plasmid to the area. Oh, the way we did it here was using one of the strains was fluorescent, so we were able to distinguish if it was not. Yeah, that's something we could verify by assuming seeing the clones and then checking if they were fluorescent and then checking that they were not carrying not plasmid. So the goal of my talk today is to use a mathematical model to see the consequence of such a wide distribution of fitness effects. So very quickly I will describe the simple mathematical model we're going to be using. So it's a bacterial growth model that's based on a mono term that describes the uptake of a limiting resource in the environment and therefore a growth rate of the environment. And therefore, a growth rate of this population is described by this sub-degree that depends on the max, which is the maximum growth rate, a half-saturation constant, and also a parameter expressing the cell's affinity for the resource. So, we can describe basically growth of any population based on these three parameters. So, if we set up our initial conditions, we can use numerical methods. We can use numerical methods to solve computationally and describe the growth kinetics of these strains. But what we want to do is to introduce another sub-population that is carrying a plasmid. So now we have two sub-populations, a plasmid-free cells and plasmid-bearing cells. And we have plasmids can be lost through segregation at a certain rate, determined by the plasmid copy number. Determined by the plasmid copy number. And also, plasmids can be transferred horizontally, assuming a mass action term and a rate of transmission that's given by constrained by the permissiveness of the receiving cell. You can write down a system of ordinary differential equations, and the difference in fitness here is expressed in terms of this growth rate. So, if we assume there is a cost associated with plasmic bearing, then growth of the plasma bearing subpopulation would be low. Of the plasma variance of population would be lower in under, which, of course, is not necessarily the case, but that's how we meant we could include fitness differences. Because we had the copy number as a variable or it's either constant, yeah. So we're going to consider copy number constant. And yeah, that's something we could also measure experimentally and test if there was some amplification of copy numbers there. There was some amplification of copy numbers there, but it doesn't appear to be the case. So then our model has basically these four parameters: identifiable, structurally identifiable parameters. And because we were basing this theoretical study on samples that were already in the fridge, so then we said let's make an effort to parametrize this model. The conjugation asset, in order to determine the conjugation. Asset in order to determine the conjugation permissiveness was done using pairwise conjugation assets with a dollar cell and CU measuring how many of the receiving cells were receiving the plasmid and estimating this rate of conjugation. And as you can see, well, some of them were below detectable levels, but still there's a huge variability in conjugation rates. Also, there's a side of the line. Sorry, sorry. And we can also measure the MIC, I mean the resistance levels of each one of those isolates with and without the plasmid. And interesting here is that this is Klepsiella and this is E. coli, and the same plasmid with different hosts produces a way different effect in both species. This is log scale. In both species. This is log scale, so this is actually almost 10 times more resistant. I mean, Klexiella is 10 times more resistant when it's carrying the plasmid than E. coli carrying the same plasmid. And the other parameters that we still haven't calibrated are the growth kinetic parameters. And to estimate those, what we did was to grow each both the plasmid-free and the plasmid variance populations. Populations in isolation and measuring the optical density as a function of time. Similarly, we can use our model and also simulate that experiment and produce theoretical growth curves. And once we have a simulator at data, it kind of like makes sense to use an NCMC algorithm. NCMC algorithm with a metropolis case still sampler in order to obtain maximum likelihood estimates for each one of those growth kinetic parameters. And then we have a collection of strains that we can use in our numerical experiments. And just to test how good, I mean, how good is this model to predict the ecological dynamics based on Ecological dynamics based on parameter estimation on single cells going in isolation. What we did was an experiment where we were computing as the previous one with relative fitness or measuring the cost. What we did was to put 50-50% in a population of plasmid-free and plasmid-pairing cells. And one of them was fluorescent and the other one wasn't. And then, after 24 hours, we can use a fluorescent to count how many cells are in each one of those populations. One of those populations, and therefore we can estimate the relative fitness associated with a car and the plasmid. We repeated the same experiment, but now with a model, where we put them now in competition and obtain a growth dynamic curve. And at the end, we can estimate what's the fraction of plasmid variant with respect to plasmid-free, both in the data and with respect and in the model. And there's quite a good agreement. So, at least in principle. So, at least in principle, this model that is calibrated to strains in isolation seems to be able to capture very well now competing sub-populations. So, okay, so we kept on that. So, now we have 50 strains, 25 E.L.S., 25 clips, and we have them both in vitro, in the fridge, and we can use it for genotyping or phenotyping. But we also have 50 strains in our collection that are In our collection, that are in silly constraints that we want to use also to perform numerical experiments. In particular, what we can do is to, I don't know, the first thing is to compare pairwise competition between different strains. So we simulate two plasmid-free and plasmid-free strains from different types, and we can observe a very wide range of possible dynamics. Range of possible dynamics. I mean, in some cases, if you compete this Klepsiana against this E. coli, the plasmid is lost. In other cases, the same Klepsina but competing with a different E. coli, then we see the E. coli is stable. While in this case, the same Klepsiana competing with a different E. coli, now Klepsiela is stable. So you can have all sorts of different dynamics between the strains. But this is a theoretical model, so now it's actually fairly easy to extend. Fairly easy to extend this model and say, well, we want to compete like large bacterial communities of multi-strain communities. And in this case, we have six different strains with and without plasmid, and we can put them all together and see how does the dynamic expand through time. The benefit of this is that now we can make an if we assume that every cell in the If we assume that every cell in the population has the same fitness and is paying a fitness cost, which would be kind of like the neutral or standard canonical model, then what we observe is that as you start increasing the number of strains in the community, it doesn't really make a difference. And the platinum is only stable at very high conjugated rates, which would be consistent with previous results. On the other hand, if we use a distribution of fitness effects that comes from the data, from the calibrated data, then From the calibrated data, then when we compare or when we simulate a range of conjugation rates and a range of strains in the community, we see that the plasmid is very stable. Which kind of makes sense because the plasmid can move around and as you start increasing the number of strains in the community, the probability of finding a host that has a positive growth rate, well, that's kind of that result. Well, that's kind of the result of hitchhiking lineages of higher fitness. And as you start increasing the strengths in the community, then it's more easy to find those strengths, and then stability is less, depends less on conjugation. Can I ask a nano question? What is the benefit of comparing them pairwise rather than just to a common strength or a lab strength? Do you get more Get more separation of fitness effects that are helpful for the model? Yeah, so with respect to strains that have been grown in the lab, we do tend to see a larger fitness cost, which probably suggests that the plasmid is kind of like new to the host and then there are lots of genetic conflicts or different mechanisms. So, our first conclusion is that how Conclusion is that having a wide distribution of fitness effects promotes plasmatic stability in the absence of selection. But what we wanted to see is what happens when you introduce antibiotics. So now we extend the model to introduce a bacteriocidal antibiotic in such a way that of course cells without the plasmid are killed very readily, while cells with the plasmid have a lower killing rate. And therefore, if you change the environment, you're changing the fit. Change the environment, you're changing the fitness landscape, and now you're favoring one or the other. So, what we wanted to see is what happens when you have stochastic environments. We also tried with COPS antiperiodic, etc., but now I'm going to show you the data for stochastic. And what we did was to transfer each day, kind of in a Linsky experiment, diluting the experiment, and the previous day, and each day we replenish the media, but we define a different concentration of antibiotic. And the concentration of antibiotic is determined by... And the concentration of antibiotic is determined by a stochastic process. In particular, here we're using Gaussian noise, so we're changing every day the antibiotic concentration. And we can also multiply this time series of antibiotic in the environment. We can multiply it by a parameter that tells us how the amplitude of those variations, and therefore we have a parameter associated with the selective pressure. Now, another Now, I'm going to go for first pairwise and then what happens in the community, but if we compete them pairwise, each one of the strengths in our community, light colours means there's no plasmid, dark colors means there is the plasmid. Again, green is concealed, red is E. coli. And you can see which one wins, basically. And we can see which one has the highest population frequency at the end of a 24-hour experiment, or at the end of an experiment. And in some cases, well, I don't know, it's hard to see anything besides that it's. To see anything besides that it's kind of reddish in a way. But as we start increasing the concentration of antibiotic, then something bizarre happens and it starts becoming more and more green as time goes, well, as the concentration increases, until we get to a concentration of antibiotic where none of the e-colonies is able to grow and therefore all the cells that survive are FCLS. So we thought this was interesting. Yeah, it will be as strike of selection increases, the frequency of the Increases, the frequency of the E. coli carrying the plasmid reduces in time, well, with respect to those, and selection for tercellas carrying plasmid increases. Now, we wanted to see if this could also happen in not using pairwise competition, but also having larger communities with more individuals. So, this is an example with a community composed of six strains. And as we start increasing the concentration of antibiotic, you can Concentration of antibiotic, you can see how the dynamics changes. And then more and more LFCLs are able to survive, and the E. colas are usually killed. And it's even more dramatic as you start increasing the enterotic concentration, which is kind of expected. Now, if we look at the strain level and see which one of those strains, I mean, we repeat this experiment a thousand times with different communities and different environments, and then at the end, we only count how many experiments. We only count how many experiments have that, or I mean, have this strain, and how many of those experiments were still present at the end of the experiment. And therefore, we can see which ones are the fitter strains in the specific environment. And without antibiotic, we see that most of the strains that were most frequently found in experiments are those ones, are E. coli strains. And as we start increasing the antibiotic concentration, we start seeing how they start to be replaced. I mean, they're ordered here from a higher. Replace, I mean, they're ordered here from a higher frequency to lower frequency, so they start ordering, and at the end, we end up with basically just glacial strands. But I mean, it's hard to tell if actually it makes any sense in terms of each one of those strains, but we still thought we could get some information out of the ones that win. So, these are the four parameters in our model that are calibrated. So, this is each point here corresponds to one of those. Point here corresponds to one of those trains, and the radius of this circle corresponds to how many times it was found at the end of the experiment. So this is without antibiotic, and what we observe is that most of the strains that survive, the big circles, are those ones that have high specific affinity cell cell efficiency, which means they have a higher growth rate. And they also have a very low resistance level, but that doesn't matter because this is a drop-free environment. This is a drop-free environment. But as we start increasing antibiotic, as we start increasing antibiotic, then strains that were not as good or they have very higher resistance levels, but they have lower growth rates, they start to replace those ones that were previously overrepresented. And as we start increasing the concentration of antibiotics, more and more we select for higher resistant ones. ones. So that kind of makes sense because then what we're selecting for is for fitness. Either fitness in higher growth rate if there's a lower drug, I mean if the drug is not too high, or for fitness in terms of resistance if the drug concentration is high enough. And surprisingly, it doesn't really matter what the rate of conjugation is. This, I mean, whilst there is conjugation, then it doesn't really matter. I mean, it's not like we were expecting to see maybe that highly conjugative strains because there's a lot of variability there. So finally, I was telling you that at a strain is probably not really interesting, but if you look at the species level, then you start looking at certain patterns that emerge. And again, the E. coli tend to be cleared of the population. Tend to be cleared of the population when you increase the selection, not so much that leftas are actually quite stable. So, at low anthropology concentrations, the community is mostly composed of E. coli, and at large populations, it is largely composed of clercellas. And as we start increasing the size of the community, this effect is actually even further pronounced. So, this is something we're very happy about because that's what. happy because that's what that's what uh going back with uh with our clinician collaborators that's what they observed in the hospital so they so uh they gathered a very large meta-analysis of all the strains where p oxa48 was found in the hospital in many years and a few years and what uh what's a common trend is that the plasmid is usually observed in plebsiella strings. Strains, which kind of makes sense and is consistent with theoretical results because hospitals, of course, are environments with lots of antibiotics and high selection. So, in summary, multi-copy plasmids can produce variability in plasmid copy normal, and that produces heterosexent populations. And it can provide a multi-copy plasmids provide a mechanism for transient animal. For transient and elastic resistance. Also, that plasmids can produce a heterogeneous distribution of fitness effects and that can have a consequence in the patterns of plasmid persistence in multi-strained communities. And finally, mathematical and experimental modeling can be both used together in order to characterize hospital-wide patterns of resistance. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So I think we'll have we'll get Kildego to start setting up and we can have maybe one
