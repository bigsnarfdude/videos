Oh, Shunga, are you ready? Okay, I'm ready. Okay, the third talk is Professor Shunga from Tongzi University. The title of his talk is a unified treatment for LPC Brominkovsky type inequality. Please, Shunga. Okay. Okay. I think Professor Shen introduced, introduced. First, I will thank organizers for inviting me to give a talk on this online workshop. Also, I'm very happy to meet so many colleagues from China and abroad. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. My talk title is Unified Treatment for LP Blooming Cross Types Inequalities. This talk is based on a joint work with Zodu. This paper has been published in CAG in 2018. The outline of this talk is the following. Is the following first? I will introduce the classical Brown cost inequality. Then, I will introduce the LP Brown because mean causing type inequalities. Then, I will introduce our worker, the LP transference principle. After introducing the principle, I will give some examples to use this principle. principle now we tend to we go into the first uh part the classical brown mikos mikowski inequality this is in the brown mikowski theorem suppose q l are convex bodies are convex bodies convex bodies in our n is a compact compact and convex sets with non-empty interiors interiors and for f is the great For f is greater than zero and less than one, then it has the following inequality. This inequality is sharp with the equality and only if P and L are homosexual or homosexual. This theorem was discovered in 1883 for N is less than 3 by Hen Brown. Hen Brown is a German mathematician. Brown Link is a famous. uh brown link is named after uh professor brown because he gave an analytical proof for the n-dimensional case and characterized the equality condition in 1896 now we uh look look into this uh inequality in this inequality two ingredients are involved first first uh the minkosi compilation The mean causing combination is beta k plus m L is equal to this set, equal to this set. From the definition, we can see that it for any X in K and Y in L, the set is consists of beta. The set is consists of beta L plus gamma y, gamma y. Then the Brown because theory says that this functional, this functional, the one over the power, the volume, volume functional, one power n, one over n is key, it can be. We see that k and l are homothetical. If l equals to lambda k j plus x plus f x. X plus X. Now we give an intuitive explanation. For example, if we give a, if C is an square centered under the origin with length, with length, with an assignment L and B is an is a disk, is a disk. Disk is a disk centered at an origin with the radius R. Then the area, then the area of the Minkowski series, because addition of the square and the disk is from the formula geometry, we can see that the area is equal to three times the area of the times the area of the square plus four times L R. L is the length of the square and R is the radius of the disk plus the area of the disk. Then it greater than four times LR is greater than two times square times square root high LR then this written is equal to this this equal to this so we get so we get the inequality since since uh the square and the disk is not homosexual. Disk is not homosexual. So the inequality is strict. It's strict. The equivalent, the Brownikovsky inequality has six equivalent forms. The six equivalent forms, the proof is the essential essential reason is because the the volume function has has homogeneous n degree homogeneity homogeneity the volume function is n degree homogeneity the proof is easy and in in practice or if we want to if we want to prove and wrong because types inequality we open use Types inequality, we often use the sixth, the sixth form. That is, we normalize the volume of K and L equal to one, and then we tend to turn into approving this inequality. The volume is greater, is greater than one. We introduced the significance of the problem in. Introduce the significance of Leblawmikov theory. To get a full impression of the impact of LeBlanc in quality in geometry and analysis, please read a civic article by Richard Gardner. I just see Miss Medical Science that this same article has cited 358 times. So it is a it is. So, it is a very influential same article in convex geometry. The Bronze Mean Causing quality is a perfect tool for conquering problems involving magical quantities such as volume, surface area, and mean width. So, it quickly implies from the Blooming Caucus theory, we can get the classical as a parametrical inequality. This is an aspirational Inequality. This is an experimental inequality. Suppose K is a convex body in Rn and B is a unified ball, is a unit of ball, then the following inequality holds with equality if and only if K is a ball, B is a ball. Here, S K is the surface area of K. The surface area of K can be derived from the Derived from the variation of the volume function function. Now, the parametrical inequality for complex domain with C1 boundaries is equivalent to the superlef inequality. This, it quickly implies the brown concave concavity theorem. This is an abrupt concave theorem. It says that. It says that n minus one dimensional intersection intersection is concrete on its support and support. The Brown Mikaus theory is equivalent to the Mikhail-Fester inequality. This is the Mikausifester inequality. L V1PL is the first mixed volume. It is obtained by computing the variation of volume functional volume functional. This is the Mikausi-fest mixed volume of K and L. Without that, the problem because inequality. That the block becomes inequality is equivalent to the Minkowski facility theory. If we set L L is the ball, is the ball, then we get a parametrical inequality. Seventh, an extension of the Brownian cost theory. In fact, the Brown inequality is also hold for the bigger measurable. The bigger measurable sets, measurable sets. Suppose EF are the biggest measurable sets in our N and their sum is also measurable than the equality of equality codes. This equality has no equality conditions. This equality was first proved in 1920. Equality was first proved in 1935 by Lutz Nick. Harvey and Ormond found a simple and beautiful proof in 1956, now called Harleweger Oman cut. The proof of the general belonging cut theory can be found in the textbook of radio analysis, also by Alice Den. Final extensions. Further extensions of the belonging cost theory, we can refer the following articles. For example, Borre established the Browning Coast theory in Gaussian space, Gaussian space medicine, establishing the Brown Mikhail type in quantity for final money food. And so many. We can refer. We can refer these articles. Kosantia Salali established the Brown because inequality for P capacity. The case of equality was proved by Kavaraj and Jerry and Lee in 1996. Now, I introduce briefly the proof of the Brown-Mikaus theory. There are many methods to prove Brown-Mikaus theory. Now, I give the proof due to letter and shoes and shoes faster, faster. Faster, faster. Faster, we express the volume of key as an integral. The integral is an intersection function. It's an intersection function. For converts for the P and L, the inclusion relation, the inclusion relation. The inclusion relation both. Step three: according to the monotonicity of volume and the induction hypothesis, the inequality can be derived. We can refer the book also by Raf Schneider can consult this proof. Now we go into the second part. Second part, the LP Brown Minkowski type inequalities. In 1962, Farrell introduced the LP combinations of convex bodies and established the LP block because of inequality in this article, 1962. In 1962, OP is greater than one. Now, LP combination, the LP combination is a IOP compilation is like this, like this. This is a P multiplication and this is the P addition. Especially if P is equal to 1, this is going to the classical in COSI computation. Note that very defined IOP computation Combilation they need the convex body key and L contain the origin in their interior. K and L should contain the origin in their interior. Now the L P combination of P and L is also a convex body with origin. It's also a convex body with origin in C terio. Further development developments of LP Brom Gauss theory were greatly impaired by Evanu Twak in 1990s. The following two articles has very big influential in convex geometry. The problem because value theory one and the second and second. And second, I think has top citations in convex geometry. Now, this is an LP-Blocking Class theorem. Suppose that K and L are convex bodies containing the origin in their interior, and the P is greater than 1. Inequality holds. With equality, and only if P And only if P and L are kinetic. Recall that for classical, for classical Browning theorem, the equality holds, the equality holds, if and only if K and IO are homosexetical, but I fail, but I fail. The equality, the equality holds, if and only if K and IO are balanced, we not difference, we notice the difference. Next inequality, next in quality. This inequality states that the function with n power p of n is concave. The inquiry has the equivalent form, has an equivalent form. Now, we give two examples of the LP block Minkowski type inequalities. For a convex voltage, it's a messentee. Is gamma integral, is gamma integral. W0, wy, w n minus y are defined by this integral, this integral. Notice that w0 is precisely the volume of k and wn is the volume of b where g and j is endowed with a normalized harm measure u j. Harmony view J and the K projection here K it it erodes the Osgana projection of K onto the subspace case. If K has a C2 boundary, W i K are an integral of elementary symmetrical functions of the principal curvatures over the boundary of K. This is a classical games integration. Now, for this quantity, for this quantity, it also holds the wrong Minkowski inquiry. This is classical. This is classical. This is in quality. There is that the functional W msj one over J is J1 over J is concrete on the sets of convex bodies. We can refer the book by Rofschley to seek the proof of this inequality. Now, the LP belonging costs in quality for gamma-centegra is like this, like this. Also, the equality holds. The equality holds if and only if k and l are than this. This inequality states that the functional W n minus j the power p over j is complete on a convex bodies on a set of convex bodies containing the origin in the interiors. This inequality was proved by It was proved by Evan Lutoi in this paper. Our LP transparency principle. Now we recall that the functional, the functional, this is our motivation of the functional, we know volume functional, the power m minus one over n and then the Over n and the mass integral function of the power 1 over j are conc are concrete on a set of convex bodies with respect to Minkowski combinations. Then, then the functional, the volume functional, the power p over n and then the the mass integral functional p the power p over j I can create. The power P over J are concrete on the set of convex bodies containing the origin in materials with respect to the LP commercially. These are known facts. I just mentioned these inequalities in the second part. These are known facts. Now, our motivation is: suppose a function of f is computed on P on k with respect to mean causing combinations. For example, f is equal to this volume function and the mass integral. And all the conditions f power p is concrete on the set of convex bodies with an origin in a carrier with respect to the L P. With respect to the LP compilations, if answered, a unified treatment is obtained. This is our motivation. That is to see, we load this functional has brown Mikausi type theory inequalities. Then we can establish the L P, the L P B wrong Miko theory. So we want to use the language of analysis to state for a function of f, if f is concave with respect to Mika's combinations, we want to give a unified treatment on all the conditions f the function f is compute on this set. This is our what. That this is our motivation. Okay, to answer this question, we pose several conditions on the function f. Suppose the function f from the set of convex bodies to positive numbers. We see that f is positive homogeneous provided positive homogeneous provided for any. Homogeneous provided for any alpha greater than zero. This quantity holds. We see f is increasing, provided, increasing in the sense of the inclusion of sets, provided if k is included in L, F is less than F L. Moreover, F is strictly increasing, provided K included in K are not equal to At load equal to L, then FK is strictly less than F L. This is the three conditions: positive homogeneous increasing increasing. Then we see F is P con Q, P con Q. This is a condition peak and K provided less inequality. This quality is less inequality holds. A Julia one can keep is caught in the. one concave is called is called concavity is called concavity we see f the function f is a translation invariant invariant provided for there exists a point x fp plus x equal to fp okay we pose four we pose four conditions positive homogeneous increasing Homogeneous increasing peak and key and translation invariant under these conditions we prove in this article we prove the LP transparency principle. Suppose that F is positive homogeneous, increasing and concrete. Three conditions, positive, homogeneous, increasing, and concrete. If K and L are convex bodies containing the origin in A materials, then the equality holds the equality hold. We also discuss the equality condition. Furthermore, if F is strictly increasing, it's strictly increasing, then the equality holds if and only if K and L are dynamic. As I just mentioned, that FIRE introduced the LP combination for convex bodies containing the origin in AO materials through our transparency principle. We know that the LP Brown because theory holds. In some sense, because F is strictly increasing, it's strictly increasing. I just recall the Brown Counter theory, Brown Council theory for volume for Gamers and T correct. The equality holds if and only if K and L are homosexual, but for L P Brown means. But for LP Brown Minkowski theory, the equality holds if and only if P and L are in this. This is the difference. Through our LP transference principle, we see the difference and we discovered that this equality conditions is different in some sense because F is strictly increasing. If F is If f is strictly equation, then it couldn't hold if only P and L are kinetics. Since F is positive homogeneous, this equality has an equivalent form, also has an equivalent form. To prove this theorem, we should prove several lemons. Suppose K and L are convex bodies containing the origin in a terrible and p is greater than one. Then f is p concrete if and only if f p k l is concrete. We define the function f p k l like this. The equivalent, this number is equivalent, it is sufficiently. Equivalent is sufficient and condition is sufficient and necessary is unnecessary. Now, the normal, the second normal, the inclusion, the inclusion relation is needed for P is strictly one. This inclusion is this inclusion hold. Hold that as you can see the P is bigger than Y then the set is big the set is big with equality if and only if K equal to L Now for many LP Brown Minkowski type C inequalities equality only occurs when the convex bodies are dynamic not from vexed bodies are analysts, not homosexual. This phenomena can be completely characterized. We give two equivalent additions. Suppose F is positive homogeneous, increased and conc. That's three conditions. Positive homogeneous, increased, and concrete. P is greater than one. Then the following additions are equivalent. For convex bodies containing the origin in your interior, the function fpkl is alpha if and only if k and l are dynamics. This assertion is equivalent to the following. When restricted to the sets of convex bodies containing origin in a material, the function f is strictly increasing. strictly increasing so i just say the equality conditions is different in some sense in some sense in some sense because the function f is strictly increasing next theorem suppose f is translation invariant is translation invariant Translation invariant positive homogeneous increase in concave compared to the previous theorem. We add a condition, translation invariant. Then, the following assertion one implies assertion two. For convex bodies, the function of F1PL is affi if and only if K and L are homothetical. So this case. This this case this case the classical Browning Causal inequality is among this case if and only if K and L are homosexual. The addition one implies the next implies the addition two for convex bodies containing the origin in a interior the function of f p k i l is alpha if and only if k and i are that is if p and i that is so we explain we explain the we further we further explain the reason why the classical one means causing inequalities the equality holds if not only if p and l are homosexual however the lp belong in causing mean causal equalities holds the equality the equality holds if not only if p and l are finite If P and L are panicked, the addition one implies the addition two. This is our LP transparency principle. Transparency principle. Now, we give several examples of our L teachers very specific. of our ao p transference prison the first one is harmonical harmonical compassion tigress how do we how do we 1957 introduced the harmonical conversion tigress like this like this this is harmonical compression conversion tigress uh in his paper he proved Favor, they prove the problem in Caucasian type inequality for harmonical dimension tigers W theta J one over n minus j This function is concave with equality if and only if k and L are homosetical. Now, we using our principle if we let F If we let fk, fk is equal to w j one over n minus j this functional. If we let fk equal to this functional, then we can check, we can check, we can verify that f is positive homogeneous, strictly increasing, strictly increasing, and concrete on the same. And compute on the set of convex bodies. So, by our principle, we immediately obtain the LPRA mean causing theory for harmonic emission teachers. Since the function of f is strictly increasing, so the equality holds if not only if p and l are kinetics. Dynamics. This is the first exam. Second, an application to A5 Games integral. These quantities are called R5 Games Integral introduced by Lutwack. n by 0 k is equal to the volume of k and for j equal to y 2 and n minus 1 by m minus j k is equal to this integral not just this is the integral the power of is minus n minus n not just all the quantities are The quantities are alpha invariant for special linear transformation. In 1984, Erin Lutmark established the Brown Minkowski type of inequality for alpha mass dimension. At least, this is the wrong Minkowski type. Long mean quality type inequality for a phi games integral. Now, we use our principle. If we let fk, fk equal to this functional functional, the phi, the j order, a phi integral, the power is one over m minus j. We set f is this functional. Then we can. then we can verify that the function f is positive homogeneous strictly increasing and concave so by using our principle we can establish the lp around mikaus type inequalities since this function is strictly increasing so so the equality holds if and only if p and l are dynamics This is the second application. Now, the third, the third application, we discuss the moment of inertial. From classical mechanics, we know that for each convex body k is a moment of inertial. I k is defined as an integral. The second moment is. The second moment is the election. CK denotes the centroid of P. However, in 1956, established the Brown Minkowski type theorem inequality for moments of election, like this. Very, very simple, very simple inequality. Now, we use our, we let the function f equal to i t the power is one over m plus two one over n plus two then we can prove f is positive, homogeneous, and concrete. If K is origin symmetrical, is origin symmetrical, then the centroid of P is at the origin. If we restrict the domain of F to the class of origin symmetric convex bodies, then F is strictly increasing. If we restrict the domain of F to the class of origin-symmetric convex bodies, Origin symmetric convex bodies, then F is strictly increasing. Now, using our LP transference principle, we can establish an LP belonging Gauss type theory with equality if and only if P and L are attained. Finally, we give an example of capacity, on capacity. The Q capacity of convex body. The Q capacity of convex body, the quantity is defined as an infimum of this integral. The integral is over Rn over Rn. The problem in curve type in quality for capacity is like this, like this. Borrell, we just mean the Borrell established in quantity in 1983 and coverage. 83 and Cavarati Jerry Niebuh proven a case of equality. Inequality, one can refer in the book by Evans and Garrick, Measure Theory and the Five Properties of Functions to CINAHL information on capacity. Now, we let the function f equal to this, equal to this, then f is a positive point. Then F is a positive homogeneous increasing concrete and the translation invariant. By our principle, by our principle, we can establish an LP blank Mika type theory, like this, with equality if and only if K and L are dynamics. So we give four examples to use our principle to establish LP belonging cos type C inequalities. Seal inequalities. Okay, I think I should stop here. Thank you. Okay, thank you, Shanga. Is there any question or comments? So, Professor Shung, is your method also? I mean, the F still works for the all these Mikovsky problems? Minkowski problems you mean that f if f divide f to all minkots yeah after this work we don't have a very consider the use of our price maybe maybe maybe we can very consider this case okay okay thank you Any more questions or comments? Hello. I have a question. So, nice to meet you. Very nice talk. It was very interesting. Do you think you can apply the principle to the eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator, of course, the Laplace operator? Because I know that I know that the eigenvalues of a domain satisfy Pronominkowski inequality. Right? You mean I think the Minkowski functional? No, the first eigenvalue, the first eigenvalue of the P labels. I think it works. I think this is. I think this is a very good program. I think it works because it satisfies all the conditions. It should be working. But the thing is that it's a family of... So you consider all of the first eigenvalues of the P Laplace operator, and you have a family of functionals, but they all satisfy the Brun-Minkowski for the usual Minkowski sum. Yes, yes, it's a very good question. Yes, yes, it's a very good question. So, I don't know if maybe you would have two indexes like in Africa. Yes, yes, thank you. Yes. And the other question I have is: I noticed you didn't mention, or maybe I missed it, the dual Minkowski sum, the dual Minkowski theory. Do you have a principle, transfer principle for, I don't know, going to the classical theory, to the dual Rominkowski or... Here to the dual Rominkowski, or something like this.
