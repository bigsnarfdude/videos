So we have these beautiful results from planar graphs. We know they are four colorable, we know that for the triangles they become three colorable. We know something about what happens if we have a look at graphs on surfaces. So kind of a natural question is can you take these statements and somehow generalize them to Generalize them to graphs drawn on surfaces and well, we will go into bread. I mean, this has been kind of a topic that I was thinking about for a long time. So, I don't know, like 15 years ago, I remember that I gave a talk along similar lines in Oberwolfa, and the talk was interesting in that everything that I said in it was either trivial. That I said in it was either trivial or wrong. So I'm setting myself very low bar for this talk as well. Well, okay, so I mean, can you say something like whatever, every graph drawn on the Taurus is for colour rebel? Well, you know that the answer is no, and it's actually no for most of these questions. On any other surface than the sphere, there is a conterexial. Here, there is a conterexample to the straightforward generalization of these claims. I mean, if I are infinitely many contra examples. So, for instance, if you take a projective plane and quadrangulate it such that the quadriangulation is not pi-mart type, it will always have chromatic number four and uh it's not three color level, so that uh gives you constructions of infinitely many. Uh Infinitely many non-sequelable triangle-free graphs for all non-orientable surfaces and for orientable surfaces, you can let's say use Wichelski's graphs or other constructions. And for the four-color CRM, there are also like similar constructions. If you take this quadrangulation of the projective plane and put a vertex of degree 4 inside each face, you get a You get a non-four colorable graph if you take a triangulation of an orientable surface which contains exactly two vertices of odd degree, and these two vertices are adjacent, and the resulting graph is not for colorable by an old result of FESC. And yeah, so there are. So there are counterexamples, there are conterexamples which look like they probably are not unique, like I mean, this seems like some kind of random things. So I mean, what is kind of the best thing that we could could hope for is well, I mean, there um if if the if the graph is not uh not uh not for colorable Not four-colorable, then it contains some minimal subgraph which is not four-colorable, some five-critical uh five-critical graph. And maybe we can at least say something interesting about these uh five, let's say, five-critical graphs that can be drawn on surfaces. And ideally, if we managed to get some kind of nice structural description for them, we might be able. For that, we might be able to use it to obtain an algorithm, to let's say obtain an algorithm to four-color a graph drawn on the toes, which is currently an open question. And of course, we can try to play with things a bit more. So, I don't know, we can try three coloring or whatever, five colouring. Or whatever, five-coloring the graphs on surfaces, or three-coloring graphs of girls, at least five on surfaces. And it turns out that all of these are completely resolved. We know that the problems for each of these combinations of number of colors and girls is either NP complete or it is characterized by just finitely many of these minimal obstructions. Mineral abstractions. So basically, kind of the generalization of four calculus and Gachi Curium are the only cases where something non-trivial happens. And a couple of years ago, well, 15 years ago, we solved this for the generalization of the Gretchy theorem. So for this first question of For this first question of the structural characterization, we have shown that the minimal obstructions are in sense close to being quadrangulations. So the thing that happened in the projective plane is not a coincidence, it's just a special case of this general phenomenon. And based on this, well then we found some algorithm. Then we found some algorithm which, given a graph drawn on the surface, either decides it does not contain any such near quadrangulation as a subgraph, and therefore the red is so therefore the graph is three-colorable, or we can find one which is three-colorable if and only the whole graph is. So that reduces the problem indeed just to the near quadrangulations. And then finally, we were able to find an algorithm based on some kind of topological abstraction to decide whether this near quadrangulation of a surface is recolorable or not. And so now if you combine all of these together, this gives you an algorithm to decide C-colorability of triangle free graphs on any fixed surface. And so we could perhaps hope that we can do. Perhaps hope that we can do something similar for the four colour CRM as well. So maybe we can somehow characterize these minimal obstructions, so kind of by analogy what plays the role of like the role of these near quadrangulations here could be played by something which is fairly close to Eulerian triangulations of. To ordinary triangulations of surfaces. As we have seen, those kind of appear in the known examples of multiple colour graphs. And well, then maybe we can somehow go through the rest of this program and what it says. This has a number of issues. I mean, one issue is that at the moment, we don't really have tools. Moment, we don't really have tools to obtain a general result that would speak for every surface. And basically, the result is that the proof of the four-color theorem, or basically the only way how we know how to prove the four-color theorem, is based on Kemper chains. And so, whether the fact that the configuration is reducible in the plane does not imply. Plane does not imply that it is reducible on the torus because on the torus that we have like more ways how to route the Kenpa chains, disjoint Kenpa-chains than we have in the plane. So basically for every surface in principle we would need a different set of reducible configurations and I mean there are possibly some ways how to go around that but it's Around that, but they seem like infeasibly complicated. So, unless someone comes up with a new proof of the four-color theorem, I don't think we are going to ever be able to prove any kind of general result that would hold for coloring on every surface. But also, if you just have a look, let's say, kind of the simplest surfaces, like of the simplest surfaces like the projective plane or or the or the torus, the situation there at least to me seems like hopelessly complicated given in terms of the structure of the of the these five let's say five critical graphs that can be drawn there and so and so on. So what is like the first like the simplest non-trivial thing that we could consider like at least kind of like kind of toy example Kind of like toy example that would at least maybe give us some guidance or hope for the surface. And that's these are graphs of crossing number one, the graphs that you can draw in the plane just with a single crossing. So these obviously you can also draw on the torus and in the projective plane without any crossing. So there are some special cases that we are considering. Yeah, considering, but this case still seems to be somewhat non-trivial. I mean, we still have like constructions of infinite families of five critical graphs of cross-sink number one, which seem interesting, but on the other hand, it does not seem as hopeless as, let's say, we have had a look at the torus. And for this phase where we will need to modify the proof of the four-colour theorem, that at least seems reasonably feasible. There are results of similar complexity, generalizations of the four-colours theorem of similar complexity that have been proved. There is this proof that Q is the same. cubic graphs without Peterson minor are 3H colour level which in particular CRM because the dual form of the four colors theorem is that the planar cubic graph, virtual cubic graph is re-explorable and they need to need they need to need to lose the the the reduction uh uh kind of the special cases that they need to prove this for for instance they need to prove this for apex cubic graphs graphs that you can draw in the plane up to one apex vertex and in that case they kind of run up run into a dissimilar problem of paper cheats not necessarily Temperate shapes, not necessarily being planar. Another result is similar, in my opinion, probably even higher complexity, is recently Inovearabashi, Miyashta, Bohemohar, and Sonovat proved that the Peterson graph is the only A cyclically 4-H connected cubic graph in the projected plane, which is not CH polarable. And that again runs into similar issues. And they obviously have to do a modification of the proof of the four-colour CRM. And from what Juan told me, they need like 5,000 reducible configurations compared to, let's say, 5,000. Compared to, let's say, 500 or something like that, which happens in the four-color CRM. But it kind of shows that this part is on the level of complexity that we can currently manage. So this just to me feels like a feasible project. So there is kind of an obvious equivalent formulation that enables us to just work with planar graphs. Just work with planar graphs. So, okay, so let's say DFA this five-critical graph, let's say, non-four colorable graph drawn in the plane with just one crossing, with these edges V1 up to V3 crossing and V2, V4 crossing. So, what can we say? Well, for example, we know that V1 and V2 must be adjacent because. And V2 must be adjacent because if they were not adjacent, we could identify them. This gets rid of the crossing, so by the four colors here, and the graph would be four colorable, and then we decontract them and get the four coloring of the original graph. So, actually, around this, this the this crossing must be uh induce k4 and so uh it so this this this uh this This staple forces these vertices to receive different colours. And then we are just want to extend this recoloring of these vertices by different colors to the rest of the planar part of the graph. So this shows that this problem of this side. Deciding whether a planar graph with one crossing is for tolerable or not is equivalent to the problem where you get a planar graph with the outer face bounded by a cycle of value 4 and you are given its pre-colouring by colours 1, 2, 3, 4 and you want to decide whether this pre-colouring extends to the four colouring of the whole graph or not. And I mean And I mean, you can easily check that there are like similar reductions that show that this pre-colouring is not special in anything, anyway, that it's actually equivalent to getting such algorithms for the other possible patterns of the pre-curring on the autoface. So basically, you want to just be able to solve this pre-curring extension problem generically. And if you play with the Kempe chains, you will realize that if you take such a planar gra with the outer face bounded by a four cycle, there will always be at most one of the possible four colorings of the outer face that does not extend, with the single exception being being uh uh being uh being of course this graph which which forbids all the colourings which uh which uh which give uh here the same color part so kind of now our our goal let me introduce some terminology i will use say the graph is a four canvas if it is a plain graph with the outer face bounded by an index Bounded by an induced force cycle, and the graph does not contain separating triangles because we can easily eliminate separating triangles from anything interesting. We will say that the four cannabis is restrictive if there is this existence unique forecoloring of this outer cycle, it does not extend. And we will eventually have to speak about the ones where all other facts these have lines fault, or I will call those ten. When it's four, it's four codes triangle. And so, what I consider to be a realistic goal is to get this algorithmic question. If you give me a four canvas with pre-colored outer face, can you decide whether the pre-coloring extends or not? And the way to do it was that you would like to describe these minimal or critical restrictive. Critical restrictive for Canvas Es. And it seems that maybe a good way to go is to maybe restorate ourselves, to triangulate it case first, because it makes well ma makes makes it like more more direct more directly possible to use the tools developed for the for the for the CRM and uh It seems to simplify some things. So, what's our current plan? So, our main problem now is that we don't actually know what we want to prove. So, the first step is to decide what we want to prove. And the way we want to do it, so we would like to use computer-assisted enumeration to list all these minimal restrictive forecasts. Restrictive for conversies with some bounded number of vertices, up to 30 seems reasonable. Then, I mean, stare at them until we understand why they are restrictive, why there is this people and there does not extend. And based on that, we would like to conjecture a characterization. My guess is that the characterization will look somewhat like this, where we just need the label. This where we just need to fill in what these recursive constructions and topological things are. And then we would like to modify the proof of the forecolor to prove this conjecture, which will be challenged, but hopefully it will. And so, okay, so how do we actually get this computerized part? So, if you wanted to list all If you wanted to list all, let's say, all plane graphs with most 30 vertices that runs into a problem that there are like a lot of them. So you might ideally, on the other hand, you might want to list only the restrictive ones where you actually have some precarity of the outer phase that does not extend. Interface that does not extend, but that runs kind of in a problem. That, if you think about it, it basically means that you would have to come up with some reducible configurations for already for the so we would already have to, from the beginning, to fight with this generalization of the four colour CRM, which I don't want to do at the moment. So, we do something in the middle, so you can easily. So, you can easily realize that, notice that there is an easy reducible configuration for vertices of degree 4. You can just identify two of the adjacent vertices, and that turns a non-four colorable graph into a smaller non-four colorable graph. So, basically, we first need to the the kind of the the We would just basically, as the first step, need to generate such restricted four canvases, where all the internal vertices have a degree at least five, and then on them do these decontractions of vertices of degree or degree four. And it seems actually feasible that if you restrict yourself to That if you restrict yourself to these graphs, planar graphs with internal vertices of degree at least five, there are manageably many of them. So you enumerate those with up to this bound of roughly 30 vertices. From them, you filter out those that are interesting, that actually have one, this one for the mupecolar ring, and on them you do this for vertex decontractions to get all. To get all restrictive triangulated four canvases with up to 30 vertices, and then you just take their subgraphs to get the minimal arts, and we get to the face of staring at them. And so, how do you actually generate these four candidates, these graphs with all internal vertices already filed? Well, here's a theorem. A theorem for that, that they have can generate them by some replacements, like one of the replacements is you can take this configuration and replace it by this larger configuration, and so on. And so, based on these reducible configurations, so you can kind of use some apply some standard methods to get a nice algorithm. get a nice algorithm which actually can be parallelized or distributed very efficiently. And so what we currently did with this implemented this part on my computer in like a couple of hours it generates these graphs up to 25 vertices, there turn out to be like 50 million of them and And so now if I can get it run on some cluster or whatever, then it will probably scale up to these 30 vertices, I promise. And out of these millions of graphs, some 10,000, less than 10,000 are restrictive, and it turns out that all It turns out that all of them can be explained by kind of two-ish constructions. One construction is described here. You can take this such a restrictive triangular liquid four canvas where we have vertex of degree four on the outer face, and you can replace. And you can replace it by two vertices of degree four placed uh placed like this. And this preserves the fact that the coloring recurring one two one two does not extend to this graph. So because you can easily check that. And another construction is that you take such a restricted forecanvas and surrounded by this. And surrounded by this ring of vertices of degree five, which is a little bit harder to argue, that it actually again reserves this, that it based on some healthy argument, you can do it in half a page, or you can just spend some pages at least discussing all the cases. And so, my claim is that using these two operations, you can start with With this graph and generate all restrictive triangulated fork and VSCs with up to 25 RTCs. And yeah. So actually if you if you don't go from these from these four candidates, if you relax this condition of Condition of that all the internal vertices have degree at least five and equal to vertices. All of them, there turn out to be more things that you need. So there is something based on this thing being an Eulerian triangulation. Perhaps there are some other ways how to combine the Combine now two smaller canvases into a larger one and possibly some others. Things start to be somewhat more complicated if you have vertices of degree four, which I find kind of funny because vertices of degree four are those for which we have this essentially trivial reducible configuration, but if we have Simple configuration, but if we represent somehow exploiting components, yeah. So here are some kind of like interesting restrictive for currents actually. I find this one interesting and this one interesting and the rest are interesting for some technical reasons that I won't uh won't explain. So these uh these are all all minimal or critical. Or minimal or critical. And so this one shows that actually these critical graphs don't have to be triangulations. This one shows that it can have like two faces of length four, and in fact, it I hope that it's the right part maybe. Yeah, I think so. And actually, actually, kind of based on the construction that got us this, you can get. As this, you can get actually this critical graph, the arbitrarily manifold facing. You can actually have also a five-phase, but we are not able to get any rate more than one five-phase. You can have five phase and arbitrary red uh phases of length four. We don't know how to get anyone which would have six phase or over. Face or over, which is kind of both good and bad. Like if you have a look at the proofs that we have for this generalization of the Gretchy theorem, they kind of very heavily use the fact that the critical graphs do not have own phases. There are some technical reasons for that, but that somehow arise when you call. Somehow arise when you consider what happens if you unreduce a reusable configuration, and then you kind of well, I probably doesn't. Yeah, so the fact that actually we have here this face which has length longer than four breaks. I'm a bit confused about these. So the shaded area, that's just a region? That's just a fact. The region? That's just a face. In previous pictures, you had a shaded region which meant you had some. Here it's any subgraph. Here it's just... I don't know. Sorry for confusing ploy. Okay. So, okay, based on the very limited amount of data that we have correl that we have collected so far, here are kind of like kind of like conjectures that I am not completely afraid to state, but they could be very well wrong. So one is what I have discussed just now. So maybe these minimal extractive default candidacies do not have any phase of lines at least six and have at most one five phase. Maybe it is true that all that if the internal vertices have degree at least five, then you can all Then you can always get them using this. I should probably explain why I tried that, not too, but to play plus epsilon. The reason here is that here this direction of the actually does not, well, one of the direction of the reductions does not preserve the fact that the internal vertex is a degree at least five, but if vertices are. But if if vertices of degree four arise in this way, you could uh you could m uh get somewhat modified version of this uh of this construction. So that's what this epsilon means here. So one thing that might be true is that all these four candidates can be obtained using these constructions. And if this is what's a four candidate A fortune vascular, all internal vertices have degree at least five. And if this is true, this for example implies that the only forbidden pre-colouring can be 1, 2, 1, 2, because that's what just comes up in these constructions. So it would be true that if you have a planar graph with planar graph with well with planar four canvas with all in all internal vertices of degree at least five and take a pre-coloring of the fourth fourth cycle where two opposite vertices have different colors then this pre-coloring always is talented I have kind of no idea why it would have to be true other than it just comes up from this and also critical right I have no triangles that's included in the triangles yeah and and also that And also that they, if they are triangulated, the outer face cannot contain exactly one vertex of degree 4 for some reason. I don't know why that should be true, but that again comes up from the construction. So basically now my plan is to just continue the way what I promised. Hopefully I will get somewhere. Uh any quick questions? Shouldn't things be a lot easier if you just say that you don't have any separating four cycles? It seems like the ways of building that you showed. Um forbidding separating force cycles uh is uh I mean that that uh I can I can kind of do it but uh but uh can but uh can you c I mean you run into into pro you cannot do it if you want to keep keep uh keep the the other thing triangulations because you can uh you probably we have we have this we have these uh these these examples of critical things which actually have four faces and so if if we triangulate that we need to fill in the four faces with something and then we will have separ uh you'll have separate thing correct thing. Also, the a problem is I mean all already in this in this generation of the four candidates avoiding the creation of separating four cycles is separating triangles is a bit of a pain and avoiding separating four cycles would be very difficult. So I thought about it but it seems to there seem to be like There there seem to be like technical technical or technical complications with it. Technical predictions. Why would we want to test up to shift? I mean uh I mean I I would try to be proving a statement that that is true. So how many minimal clouds what is it installer? I mean that it seems the it seems like that that the number of things increases by like a factor of five for each for each vertex. So currently we are at ten thousand, so um my guess about uh about the current all the order of the elements, but Out of these, most of them will be generated by these constructions. So as the first step, I will filter out those that are already explained by the constructions that we know. Hopefully, nothing will be left, and if anything will be left, then I don't stare. There is a chance for an ICU, and There is a chance for a nice theorem after filtering this. All right, so thank you again. Oh, the next speaker is James David.
