For the introduction, and thanks to the organizers for inviting me and putting together this very nice workshop in this very scene location. Okay, so I will talk about a global application result for doubly periodic water waves for water waves with vorticity specifically with metronomy flows. And so I should mention this is joint work with Zhang To. Jang To and Eric Marin. And so we started this project when I was a postdoc of Eric in Lunta. Okay, and so technically this is still work in progress, but we have, let's say, enough confidence in the results that I present this to you. Okay, so let's start with some motivational pictures. And clearly, David and I were visiting the same Wikipedia pages. So on the left-hand side, So, on the left-hand side, you have here this kind of classical picture of these two-dimensional periodic water waves. And then on the right-hand side, this is basically the situation that I will talk about. You will find 3D sort of doubly periodic waves. So, basically, these are waves which are periodic in two different directions. Since we have still left Monday, you're probably not sick of slides like this yet. So, let me just briefly introduce the setting that we are in. So, we're considering 3D steady water waves, which means we have an inviscid, incompressible fluid with constant density, and we're in the case of finite depth. We assume that the free boundary is given. We assume that the free boundary is given by the graph of some function, eta. So in particular, we cannot model overhanging water waves with this setting. So in the bulk of the fluid, of course, the velocity field is given by the water equations, and you have the incompressibility condition. And you have the incompressibility condition. And you have the incompressibility condition. We have both gravity as well as surface tension. So, in particular, you have on the top surface, you have the kinematic boundary condition, and we have the dynamic or stress balance boundary condition. And on the bottom boundary, we just have that the velocity field is tangential. Okay. Okay, so let me recall some previous results on W periodic water waves. So this is a picture of a kind of very simple W periodic water wave wave in 3D. And so there are obviously some results on irrotational flows, that means the vorticity vanishes with surface tension. And so basically, these results. And so basically, these results split into two categories. The first one is on symmetric waves, and then the second one is asymmetric waves. And I should maybe draw a small picture to explain what these mean. So basically, you have your xy plane, and then you fix direction to enforce the periodicity. So basically, you fix two vectors. Two vectors, lambda one and lambda two, and you're looking for solutions which are periodic with respect to these directions. And if I drew this roughly correctly, if these vectors have the same length, and The same length, and this angle and this angle is the same, then you can draw the fundamental domain of periodicity, which looks like this. And so this looks like, or this is basically a symmetric domain and kind of looks like a symmetric diamond shape. So if you enforce this, then you call this a symmetric double karyodic model rate or a symmetric double keriotic rate. Company for your trade. And if you don't enforce this, for example, if say lambda 2 here, and now you try to draw the fundamental domain period of cycle like this, you see that this is not symmetric with respect to the x-axis anymore, and so we call this asymmetric waves. And this has, from a mathematical point of view, quite severe consequences in that. Severe consequences in that the symmetric, or at least from the bifurcation theory perspective, that symmetric water waves can be handled with kind of classical bifurcation results, whereas asymmetric waves cannot. And so, yeah, the first existence proof in the symmetric case comes down to a paper by Reed and Jimbroad in 1981 and Sun in 1993. And the existence of asymmetric. And the existence of asymmetric waves was then proven by Greg and Nichols in 2000. And these two papers use, as far as I know, quite different techniques. And so since I did my PhD in Stuttgart, I'm kind of obliged to talk about an alternative method of studying these doubly periodic waves using spatial dynamics, which was pioneered by Groves in the UK in 2001 and then. And then used further by Ross and Heragos and Nietzsche. Okay. So this is with surface tension. If you study without surface tension, it gets quite a bit more complicated because you run into small divisor problems. But also this was, and also in this case, the existence was established by Josen Propnikov in 2009 for a symmetric case and 2011 for the asymmetric case. And 2011 for the asymmetrics. And so, for the topic of this talk, I will focus on waves with vorticity, specifically peltravi flows, where the vorticity field is collinear to the velocity field. And so, in this setting, Yevgini Locaru, Dolgar Sled, and Eric Walin have established the existence of small amplitude. The existence of small amplitude doubly periodic water waves which bifurcate from a laminar flow. So I will explain what this laminar flow is in a few slides. And they use multi-parameter bivocation theory to establish these results. And so basically the objective of our project was, okay, can we extend these solutions found here? The solutions found here to large amplitude solutions. Okay. So let me so okay. So I outlined a few slides ago the like standard equations for the water wave problem. If you're adding vorticity, you can go to a kind of different formulation. I will not explain to you how to get to this. Instead, I'm hoping. Instead, I'm hoping that Eric in his talk tomorrow on his overview talk on waterways with vorticity will talk a bit about that. Okay, so basically you again have bulk equations. You basically, the first one is basically says your beltrami flow. The second one is still the incompressibility. Then you have boundary conditions again, okay, so you still have a kinematic boundary condition. Have a kinematic boundary condition that the velocity field is tangential. And then you can reformulate the dynamic boundary condition in this way. So you again have here the mean curvature. So you're again in the situation with surface tension and your gravity. And so basically we will consider solutions of this. Okay. And so of course. Okay. And so, of course, you can, if you set alpha equal to zero, you can recover the case of the irrotational model once again. So I mentioned like two slides ago that the result or the local bifurcation results was used laminar flows as a starting point. So I should mention what these exactly are. So basically, you can find You can find a set of explicit solutions to the water wave equation with the tracking flow. So basically, you set the surface to zero, so you're studying water wave problem with a flat surface, and then you can find two explicit solutions. One looks like this, and the other looks like this, and then you can. Then you can construct a solution to the full problem by superposing these with constants C1 and C2. And these constants C1 and C2 will play the role as the bifurcation parameters in our setting. And so this is a plot which I stole from the local bifurcation picture how these solution actually looks like. Solution actually looks like. So basically, what you can see, like if you layer the, or if you cut through the, if you make a horizontal cut through the fluid, then you can see the velocity field just moves in one direction. And if you increase the height, so if you go near the, or if you change the height, then the direction of the velocity field changes. So if you increase the height, Change. So if you increase the height, it kind of rotates. So again, the goal is to construct large amplitude doubly periodic solutions of the Tromi flows. So I decided to once again put the full formulation on this slide. So again, you have the Bach equations, you have the kinematic boundary condition, you have the dynamic boundary condition, and then to Boundary condition, and then to get uniqueness to this problem, we also have to enforce an integral condition. And then finally, we also have to enforce the W periodicity. So you fix generators lambda1 and lambda2, which should be linear independent. These span like a periodic lattice, and you assume that both your surface profile as well as your velocity field. As well as your velocity field, are periodic with respect to these periodic letters. Okay. So once again, the starting point is the analytic local bifurcation result by LSW. And they found, to be a bit more specific, they found fairly general assumptions that you can find. That you can find a critical C. So again, C was the parameter in the laminar flow. And they found that at this critical C, you have a bifurcation of a doubly periodic wave. So in particular, they can show that for these bifurcating solutions, the surface profile can be written to leading orders. So here there's like So, here there's like higher order terms missing. But basically, to leading order, the surface profile looks like a super two cosine waves, which are superimposed. So, the goal is to extend this to or this set globally. And the challenge is that the kernel That the kernel at the linearization about the laminar flow at this critical bifurcation parameter has a two-dimensional kernel. So basically, standard bifurcation theory doesn't apply anymore. And so this is also the main difference to the case of symmetric Wetiodic waves because in the symmetric case, you can impose a Case, you can impose additional or you can use the additional symmetry that you have to make this kernel one-dimensional. So the general strategy is to first write the bifurcation problem in the form identity plus compact. And then, and I think this is probably the main trick, we take this S, so the S is the kind of parameterization. Kind of parameterization of the local bifurcation curve. And so, okay, so because you have a two-dimensional bifurcation or two-dimensional kernel and a two-dimensional parameter set here, this S is actually two-dimensional. So you have an S1 and an S2. And so what we do, we fix the direction and just scale this direction. And so for technical reasons, basically, we have to. So, for technical reasons, basically, we have to assume that the product of the direction is non-zero. So, we cannot choose one of the trivial directions. And so then the idea is to treat this R as the new bifurcation parameter instead of C. And then it turns out that we can use a slight variation of the analytic lobe bifurcation result by Foni and Toland to extend the model. To extend the one-dimensional curve to your global curve. Okay. So, first, let's start by reformulating the problem or rewriting the problem in the form identity plus compact. And for that, we kind of treat the problem in, or we split the problem into two parts. So, the first part is we study the diffcal problem for the velocity field, and then we Field, and then we study the dynamic boundary condition for the surface profile. Okay, so we start by kind of fixing or assuming that we have an eta which is in the space B k plus 2 alpha, which is basically like Hurlder continuous functions which with differentiability k plus 2 which are Which are so where the surface profile doesn't intersect with the bottom. Okay, then again, you have the kind of diff curve problem now without the dynamic boundary condition, and you consider this basically in the full problem. You have here the alpha u, and so here you try to solve this problem with the w p. And so, in the end, you will rewrite this, or you will write then the full problem as a fixed point problem. And okay, so the first intermediate result is, okay, you can actually solve this, so there's a unique solution. And if you start with a W, which is CK alpha, then you get a solution which is in CK plus 1 alpha. k plus 1 alpha. So you basically get obtain one derivative more by solving this problem, which is already a good sign because then the idea would be okay you trade this one additional derivative to go back to CK alpha to get compactness. Okay so unfortunately this is just this existence is not enough. You also need basically a shadow type estimate and the reason why this is like a And the reason why this is like a really next step is because you have kind of some degeneracy if the surface profile vanishes or if the surface hits the bottom at some point. So for this, we kind of need to make the influence of the surface profile explicit. And for that, we use this kind of naive flattening transform, which although it's often called a naive flattening transform. It's often called a naive flattening transform. It's surprisingly powerful. So basically, you make the kind of straightforward coordinate transformation, which maps kind of the fluid domain with a free boundary to a fixed domain with a fixed upper surface. Then you can introduce a flattened velocity field. There are some degrees of freedom in how to do this, but the way, if you do it like this, If you do it like this, then it kind of preserves the divergence freedness and that the velocity field is conjunction. And the only thing that really changes is the curl equation. So you basically get an additional matrix A here, which is given by this. Okay. And then you can show, so it takes a bit to prove this, but you can prove that, okay, if you But you can prove that, okay, if you can prescribe a flattened W, which is in CK alpha, and you assume that your eta is in CK plus 2 alpha, and you assume that your surface profile is sort of bounded away from the bottom and also bounded, then the flattened problem has a unique solution, which depends on W and eta, and it satisfies this Schauder estimate. This Schauder estimate. So again, you gain one derivative, but now you have kind of this explicit constant, it's not explicit, but you have this constant which depends on this r. So basically, if this r goes to infinity, then this constant will just blow up. Okay. So one brief remark is that in like the classical In the classical Chauda estimate, you would also have a U-bar. So, this is the solution of the flattened problem. So, you would have this U-bar in the K-alpha norm on the right-hand side, but you can remove this using the fact that the problem has a unique solution. So, let's, as a next step, look at the dynamic boundary conditions. Next step, look at the dynamic boundary condition, and again, we want to obtain solutions and regularity of these solutions. Okay, so you apply again Flattening transform, which only changes this first term. So now this, instead of just a norm of or absolute value of u, this is now this v of u bar and again the idea is: okay, you have this. But again, the idea is: okay, you have this kind of second-order operator here, so you should somehow morally gain two walls of the vertical text. Okay, so to see that, you define this operator L of H applied to eta. You define it like this. So, why do you define it like this? Because basically, you can rewrite the dynamic boundary condition in this form. Four. And so the idea would be, or the theorem you can establish, is that this general problem, so L of H applied to eta is equal to F, has a unique solution which we call this kind of calligraphic couple. And if you start with H and F in Ck plus one, your solution is in Ck plus three. And okay, so you can not only obtain the unique solution, you also obtain this kind of quantity or quantitative estimate of the CK plus 3 alpha naught. Okay, and so why do we start here from, or why do we write this in this way that we start from CK plus 1 and we go to CK plus 3? So basically, So basically, on the slides before, I always assumed that the surface profile is in CK plus 2. So you want to end up in CK plus 3 because then you can trade again one derivative to get back to CK plus 2 and get compactness. And for that, because you only have a second order operator, you can only gain two derivatives, and you actually gain two derivatives here. But for that, so in order to But for that, but so in order to end up in Ck plus three alpha, you have to start in Ck plus one alpha. And so if you compare this equation and this equation, you can see that what we want to insert is H is Navla of Eta. So eta is, so we start with Eta in Ck plus 2. So Navla Eta is in Ck plus 1, so that's fine. But on the right-hand side, we have Right-hand side, we have again the eta. That's fine because in this B, there's only, so basically there's only one derivative which falls on the eta, so that's fine. But you have this u. And so a priori, you start with the u in ck, so that would not be enough. But if you insert, if you use that u bar, it's kind of the solution. The U-bar is kind of the solution to the diff crawl problem where you already gained one solution. You can use that to show or to basically, so you use that you can start with also the U in CK plus 1 minus 1. That was a lot of different regularities. But let's summarize this. Okay, so you can write now the full The full water wave problem as a fixed point problem. So the first line is basically saying, okay, you obtain this U-bar, so the flat velocity field, as a solution of the diff curve problem, where you replace this W by an alpha U, and that should be alpha ER. Okay, and then the second one is that you obtain the eta. That you obtain the eta, so the surface profile, as a solution of this elliptic equation from the dynamic boundary condition. And again, you replace the H by the Nabla eta. And the right-hand side F is now this object. And again, the important thing is that here you don't have just Here, you don't have just a velocity field, but you have this L bar. So, basically, you gain already one derivative field. So, this whole object you call K bar. And so, now the bifurcation problem looks like this. So, you have your F, which is defined as phi. Phi is the vector which contains u and eta. And you want that phi. And you want that phi minus this operator C is zero. And after all we have done before, you can show that if you fix yourself to a ball or to a domain where the surface profile is bounded away, strictly bounded away from the bottom, then C is in fact a vomit component. And we've got to take a And that's taken way more time than I planned for this. Okay, yeah, so I shouldn't skip about the bottom line that f is now of the form an entity plus component. So basically we are in the, we have done the first step. Now the, okay, so basically we can recover the local bifurcation result from LSW in this setting. And I will just not re-talk about this. So you basically Talk about this. So, you basically can choose like suitable parameters, and this suitable, I don't really explain this, but it's relatively generic. And there exists such a critical C, and so that basically you have a bifurcation of a family of doubly periodic solutions, which you can write like this. So, you start, you have the laminar flow, then you have The laminar flow, then you have the two eigenfunctions. You have two eigenfunctions because you have a two-dimensional kernel. Then you have some higher order terms. So again, you have a bifurcation from a 2D kernel, so standard analytical bifurcation theory doesn't really work directly. The workaround is again we fix the direction for this S and just scale into this direction. Scale into this direction. So we introduce a slightly different bifurcation function, which is this g, which now depends on the phi tilde. So phi tilde was the higher follow terms, effectively, on this C and on this R. And R is effectively the scaling variable, which is now the new bifurcation parameter. And so on. Okay, so this looks. So this looks a lot more related to the standard global bifurcation theory, because now we only have one-dimensional bifurcation point by top. And the key observation is that if you take the, or if you linearize this G about points on the local bifurcation curve, then you can show that this linearization Show that this linearization is an isomorphism for each small r. And it turns out this is all you need to kind of extend the global bifurcation result. So basically, if you actually look into the proof, for example in Buffonia and Toland, then you can see that they used the fact that the kernel is one-dimensional. The fact that the kernel is one-dimensional, basically, and only in the first two lines of the proof, where they actually deduce: okay, we have a one-dimensional kernel, so we have this isomorphism. Or we have this property that this thing is an isomorphism. So, since we can show this directly, we can extend the load bifurcation theory without relying on the fact that we have a 1D kernel. Kernel. Okay. Let me just state the final result. So basically, you fix the direction in which you want to continue. Then you have this, then there exists a continuous global bifurcation curve, so this fractional R, which contains solutions of this reformulated bifurcation problem that extends the local bifurcation curve, or the local bifurcation curve, part of the local bifurcation. The part of the local bifurcation curve, which you have selected by choosing this direction. And as usual for global bifurcation, now we have to also test it that the bell works. Yeah. Yeah, this problem is a good sign. Anyway, so we have this that R has a local analytic reparation, and one of the two following alternatives occurs. So either R is a closed loop. Either are as a closed loop, or basically you eventually leave certain neighborhoods, which effectively means, which is related to the two other alternatives, that either your solution blows up or you go to the boundary of the phase space. And this is now my main slide. So, again, the main result is we managed to obtain a Obtain large amplitude doubly periodic waves for invertrami flows using global bifurcation theory. So the starting point is this local bifurcation result from laminar flows. The challenge is that we have a two-dimensional kernel at the bifurcation point. And yeah, so this is the strategy that we follow. And of course, there are a few open A few like open problems or open questions. So, the first thing that, so we are, this is the part which is actually like work in progress. So, basically, you have these alternatives. Can you say anything more about the global affocation curve then? Okay, yeah, either this happens or this happens. So, this is the first one, and the second one is: okay, can you maybe find some formulation which also would allow for Formulation which also would allow for overhanging wings. And yes, so this is the point where I stop, and thank you for your attention.
