You're unmuted now. Okay, oh, I think I'm not starting for another five, but oh, just as I'll guide you off. No, it's want to make sure my writing is legible. Natural most installed. Oh, yeah, I'm just getting the title. An audience here. The next speaker will be right-handed board, and that's the most welcomed way of doing mathematics. Can everybody see and hear online? Okay. Well, let's start the next talk. The speaker is Professor Graham. His talk is on geometric economy of vegetable steady states. Here you go. Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, near and far. Near and afar. So, a quick word at the beginning: everything I have to share today is joint work with Henri Veristicki and Jun Cheng Wei. And broadly speaking, the question I'm interested in is how the geometric structure of a domain influences the structure of steady states or reaction diffusion equations in that domain. And that's a big question. And that's a big question with lots of answers and lots of sub-problems in it. So, today I'll actually be focused on domains that are epigraphs, so things that lie above the graph of some function. And I'll likewise focus on bistable reactions. There's again a whole world of questions for other classes of animations and reactions, but we have to be a little focused in 25 minutes. In 25 minutes. So, broadly speaking, I want to consider the following equation. So it's a semi-linear elliptic equation posed in some domain omega. I'll think of omega as being a nice open subset of Euclidean space. Space. And for simplicity, I'll consider Dirichlet boundary conditions. Now, one can study many other boundary conditions. We saw Neumann a moment ago. Robin conditions are also interesting, but again, to keep things focused, let's look at the Dirichlet problem. So this represents the steady-state solution of. Steady-state solution of some reaction diffusion equations, and I'll consider two classes of reactions today. So the first is a familiar bistable reaction. So an archetypal example would look somewhere. Archetypal example would look something like this. Our reaction is going to start from zero at zero. It'll initially be negative, and then it has an intermediate zero at some location theta. It goes up and then bends back to zero at the carrying capacity one. And I'll always work under the assumption that we have a positive integral from zero to one. And this ensures in the And this ensures in the dynamic problem, for example, that you can have invasion if you start from sufficiently large initial conditions. And a somewhat similar type of nonlinearity, I'll also kind of be tangentially interested in, is an algebraically special nonlinearity. given by minus u plus some larger power of u, u to the p. So this kind of nonlinearity arises often in physics. And then the equation might represent a soliton solution to a nonlinear Schrodinger equation, for example, or a nonlinear Klein-Litton equation. So kind of in its early stages, But kind of in its early stages, it looks like a bi-stable reaction. It's just different in that it doesn't bend back down to zero. It continues off to infinity here. And I'll need to make the assumption that p needs to be strictly larger than one. And for kind of sob-level and embedding reason, it needs to be bounded from above by n plus two over n minus two, where here n is the ambient dimension. n is the ambient dimension. And to distinguish these two cases, I'll refer to this as the high stable problem, B, and this I'll call the nonlinear field equation. I'll denote that by an F. And for the most of the talk, I just want you to think that we're in the bistable setting, but many of the results I have to share will have some counterpart for the nonlinear field equation, and it crops up in a couple of places. So, the kind of motivating observation that I want to develop on is if I think about my semilinear equation in the whole space, like even let's think about it on the real line. So, I can go looking for solutions of just an ODE in this case, and on the line. And on the line, there are lots of solutions. So the most familiar solution would just be the stable solution, which would be the constant one. And this is what you would see in the long time limit of some dynamic problem, again, if you start from sufficiently large data. But as we know well, there are other We know well there are other solutions. So, for example, there's a kind of soliton-like solution. Looks like a bump. It's in L2. It decays exponentially away from some central body of mass. And there are also oscillating solutions that wiggle around the unstable intermediate zero theta. So, there are solutions of this type. And to me, a somewhat surprising fact, although one that's very easy to verify, again, through ODE calculations, is that if you impose a boundary condition, so we start thinking in terms of a Dirichlet domain, let's say we impose a boundary condition at the origin for simplicity, and we study the equation on the half-line, then the Then the imposition of a boundary condition essentially suppresses all these other funny solutions, and you're left with a unique positive bounded solution that's stable and it again corresponds to the long time limit of an invading dynamical problem. So, maybe an important comment I should make that today when I use Today, when I use the word solution, I'll always implicitly mean something that is positive and bounded. In particular, zero is always a solution to my equation, and I kind of don't want to keep mentioning it. So, whenever I say solution, again, I mean something that's positive and bounded. So, on the half line, you can verify that there's only one. Line, you can verify that there's only one solution satisfying this criterion. And actually, the same kind of phenomenon holds in higher dimensions. So if I look in Rn, there's lots and lots of solutions. And if I look in the higher dimensional half space, one can show there's only one. That's actually a new result. It will follow from some analysis that I'll present here. So I want to So, I want to think about this kind of dichotomy a little more generally. So, in some situations, we get a huge plethora of solutions, and in others, we add a suitable boundary condition, we end up with a unique solution. And to kind of narrow the scope of the question, I'll focus on epigraph that I mentioned. So, I want to think about a more general version of the half-space where I allow the boundary to move up and down a little bit. To move up and down a little bit. So, for the rest of the talk, let me assume that my domain omega up here can be written as the set where the vertical coordinate y is greater than some function of the first n minus one coordinates called x prime, so that it's the set that lies. So, that it's the set that lies over the graph of the function phi. And I'll always assume that phi is uniformly Lipschitz. Kind of a technical condition that ends up being important in some of the arguments. So it's a Lipschitz function from n minus one variables to the reals. I've drawn one kind of arbitrary example, but a useful kind of motivating example. Kind of motivating example would be a cone or even an absolute value kind of function in two dimensions, let's say, of varying opening angles. And it turns out that when we're working in this class of epigraphs, you can actually observe both of these different kinds of phenomena. So the main results that I'll work towards. Says that which kind of scenario you're in, in terms of the classification of your steady-state solutions, depends on the large-scale structure of your epigraph. So on the one hand, if this function phi is bounded from below, which in particular means that your domain is contained in a half space, so if the infimum. So if the infimum of phi is finite, then this bistable problem, our semi-linear elliptic equation with a bistable reaction, has exactly one solution. And in contrast, if your domain contains a non-convex cone, so it kind of bends downwards. Of bends downwards, bounded from above beneath some kind of tent profile. So, if instead phi of x prime is bounded from above by some negative constant alpha times, say, the absolute value of the first coordinate, then there exist infinitely many solutions. And so, in the kind of motivating example of a cone, let's just say in two dimensions, we could look at phi given by beta times the absolute value of x or some real parameter beta and the kind of relevant picture. And the kind of relevant picture is that when your domain looks like this, it's a convex cone. So beta is greater than or equal to zero. And in this case, we have a unique solution. And in contrast, when you're working in a non-convex cone, beta is negative. And we have a ton of solutions. So, I want to share a little bit some motivation for why there would be such a difference between these two scenarios and what kind of methods would lead to that kind of result. That's not just due to the rotation, but to the rotation. You have a non-symmetric solution. Yeah. No, it's not. No, it's not. Well, in the higher temperatures, I don't think it's due to that. But yeah, it's a good question. They'll have a pretty different structure to the different classes of solutions. So let me start in the first scenario in the theorem. So I'll think of my domain as being kind of semi-bounded, so it's bounded from below. So it's bounded from below. And for this case, we end up turning to the method of moving planes in order to establish the uniqueness of the solution. And so this idea goes back to Alexandro Opserin, has been used by many others many times. Has been used by many others many times. So let's assume that we have this lower bound. And just for simplicity, it doesn't matter a great deal. Let's shift so that the infimum of phi is actually equal to zero. And to kind of And to kind of illustrate the technical question here, let me consider a different kind of example domain. So let me consider a boundary that is bounded. It's a bounded function of x prime, but it's periodic or something. So we're looking at the domain above some regularly wiggling curve like this. Working up here. And in the method of moving planes, the idea. And in the method of moving planes, the idea is to first show that any solution in this domain is increasing as a function of the vertical coordinate, increasing in y. And to do that, I want to consider some vertical level, lambda. So I consider this line y equals lambda. And I want to compare the value of u below the line. Of u below the line with the corresponding value of u above the line. So I'll perform a reflection. And so I'll be interested in the difference v. Let's say I'm in two dimensions just for simplicity of notation. The development doesn't depend on the dimension. So I'm looking at the difference v between my solution u and its reflected value. Value where I reflect about this line that involves replacing y by 2 lambda minus y here. And I'm considering v in the kind of intermediate region, call it sigma lambda, which is just the intersection of our domain with the sub-level set corresponding to lambda. And I anticipate. And I anticipate that v should be negative always because u should increase in the vertical coordinate. So if I compare u with a reflected point above, the difference should be negative. And so one can check that v is going to satisfy an elliptic equation of this form where it's a linear equation. Where it's a linear equation, q is given by some difference quotient, I won't write it out, and v is going to be less than or equal to zero on the boundary. And actually, we know that it's not identically zero on the boundary due to the strong maximum principle down here, u vanishes, but its reflected copy will not vanish. So, the difference will be strictly positive on the lower boundary here. And so, the idea is to gradually move lambda. The idea is to gradually move lambda up from zero and hope that you can always show that v remains negative. And the way you do you go about this is you kind of imagine for contradiction that you get stuck somewhere and that there's some maximal value of lambda above which you can't go while preserving this sign. And then you argue by contradiction that in fact, by proving a suitable maximum principle, you can push beyond that level and still maintain the sign. Maintain the side. And so, for the sake of time, I won't write out kind of all the ideas that go into the moving plane method here. One kind of technical innovation that I want to highlight is when you're carrying out this argument, you're gradually increasing lambda and you're studying the behavior of v. Studying the behavior of V, one challenge is that it's a little bit delicate to deal with the sign of V when you're close to the boundary of your domain. For example, V vanishes on the boundary. That's a possible place where positive values could start to sneak into your difference. And so it becomes important to kind of isolate the behavior close to the boundary from the behavior in the interior. And you also need to be worried about locations where you. Also, you need to be worried about locations where u ends up being very close to zero. Then it's likewise a bit difficult to show that you can't start to develop some positive values coming out of places where u is approaching zero. And so we end up proving some new maximum principles when you're outside a domain of this kind of purple structure. So we look outside in a We look outside in a region where a combination of things is true, where the distance to the boundary is very small. So maybe up here, the distance to the boundary of our cutoff domain is very small. And we also work in a region where u is much less than one. So maybe hypothetically, our solution u could be approaching zero at lateral infinity. That's a possibility. And we end up. And we end up needing to prove a maximum principle here. And this doesn't fit cleanly into anything that we could find established in the literature. It's similar to a maximum principle in a narrow domain, where you have a domain that's bounded between two hyperplanes, but it's a little funny because you also allow your narrow domain to be wiggling all over the place. So we need to develop a couple of So, we need to develop a couple of new tools in order to produce some maximum principle of this type. But again, for the sake of time, I'll kind of pass by that and just leave you with the main ideas leading to uniqueness here. So let's assume that after establishing some maximum principle of this type, you're able to carry out this method of moving planes. And so let's suppose that you're able to conclude then that. You are able to conclude then that any arbitrary solution in this domain is increasing as a function of y. So this means that as you send y to infinity, you need to converge to some profile that satisfies our equation in the free space of one lower dimension. So this implies that there's a limit. It's a function of x prime alone. it's a function of x prime alone and this is in fact a stable or marginally stable solution of our semi-linear problem in one fewer dimension. It's stable due to the sign on this derivative here. And here we're able to draw on a wonderful To draw on a wonderful recent result, this is of Jung Yu, Kole Wong, my collaborator Jun Chang Wei, and Ko Wu. So, this group have shown that under this hypothesis, that you have a stable solution of this bistable equation in the free space. Equation in the free space, they show that this solution is constant. This is a paper from last year. It's like 10 pages long. It's fantastic. Once you know it's a constant, in this particular case, you must be converging to a stable root of our reaction. The only stable root that's positive is one. So then you know that your solution tends to one at infinity. So, in this direction, any old solution is arbitrarily close to one. And this allows us to then employ a sliding argument instead. So, if we want to compare two hypothetical different solutions to our equation, Different solutions to our equation, we can put one of them way up into a region where the other is very close to one. And there you have a certain degree of linear stability coming from the properties of your reaction that allows you to get a maximum principle. And then you can gradually bring that slid solution back down to its original position. And you can again use a strong maximum principle argument to conclude that you have an. Arguments to conclude that you have an order between the two solutions. So a sliding argument implies that if you give me any two solutions, U1 and U2, then U1 would lie beneath U2. And by symmetry, you then have U1 equal to U2. So this is a combination of different ideas coming from. Combination of different ideas coming from this method of moving planes and a sliding argument, and it kind of hinges on this recent nice result of Yu, Wang, Wei, and Wu, who have classified the stable solutions in the free space. So that takes care of one part of the theorem. Sorry, in the second case, there will be no solution. That's right, yes. So in this field equation, you have no solutions in semi-bounded epigraphs. Bounded evergreens. So, in the other case, we draw on some ideas originating in geometry to construct a large family of solutions that live in an epigraph with a different large-scale structure. Large-scale structure. So, in geometry, I see there's a couple of questions in chat. Could someone, there seem to be something going on in chat. Let's see. Could someone check? Okay, no, it's been, looks like it's been resolved. Okay, so in geometry, there's long There's long been interest in things called constant mean curvature surfaces. And in the 19th century, French mathematician Delaunay constructed periodic examples of constant mean curvature surfaces that are kind of like a cylinder, but they oscillate. Their radius is oscillating. And in the 80s, Kapuleus showed how to glue different solutions of this type. Glue different solutions of this type together to construct lots of constant mean curvature surfaces. So they look something like this. This is a cutaway of a higher dimensional surface, but at infinity in different directions, you have these kind of periodic oscillating cylinders, and then they meet in some sort of juncture that has to be. In some sort of juncture that has to be arranged carefully. And in order to have such a solution, one can argue that the different cylinders exert a kind of force on one another. So they're kind of pulling at each other through this junction. Say F1, F2, F3. And in order to support such a solution, you need to arrange things so that the sum of To arrange things so that the sum of forces is zero, so you have an equilibrium situation here. And in the early 2000s, Malt Theodi observed that one can use this or adapt this construction to semilinear equations. So, this is working for the nonlinear field equation. He constructed solutions u that Constructed solutions U that look like a sum of solitons. So say capital U here represents a bump solution, radially symmetric bump solution in free space. And it's a sum of solitons that are centered around fairly well-separated points that, likewise, in different directions at infinity tend. In different directions at infinity, tend off to periodic trains of bumps. And one can again argue that these bumps exert a kind of force on one another that must be balanced in order for these solutions to exist. And so what we use here in the case of an epigraph is an observation that when you add a boundary condition, that acts like a repulsive force. So it pushes bumps. So it pushes bumps away from the boundary. And that means that we can kind of replace this upper train of bumps by the force coming from boundary condition. So if we're working above some kind of conical surface like this, we can construct a train of bumps that have two asymptotic directions. With their own forces. And then, as I say, the boundary condition is repelling and acts like an opposing force that allows you to balance out this distribution and obtain a solution. This is all kind of at a heuristic level, but it demonstrates why you need a kind of non-convex cone to work with, because if the boundary is pushing you up, you need to be able to place these rays of solutions. Place these rays of solutions at an angle down in order to counteract that repulsion from the boundary. And so, if you're working in a convex cone, there's no way to arrange some sequence of bumps that acts in the same fashion. So, I'm out of time and I'll stop there. Thanks, everyone. Any questions? Yes, you uh several results. When alpha the integral of alpha is minus infinity. Okay, so your explanation was very clear if it is a cooked cone. Suppose that it is not like a cone, but it has some weird which has infinite depth. So it's totally different. So it's not an epigraph then, it's something else. It's not epigraph. Is that right? Ah, okay, okay, because it has discontinuity. Okay, because it has discontinuity. Yes. But suppose that it has a world which becomes deeper and deeper, but it's flat, but there are even sequences well, which becomes deeper and deeper. So the argument also applies to this case. It should really, because it satisfies your assumption. It satisfies, well, it wouldn't satisfy this kind of condition that it lies between. Of condition that it lies beneath a tent, right? Oh, it has to be beneath a tent. Yes, it has to be underneath. It has to be roughly like a concave cone. Yeah, it's like it can be compared to a concave cone. Yeah. It could be that there are other ways of arranging these kinds of spike trains to construct solutions in other domains, but we're not entirely sure. For your first result, you did. You didn't mention case F. So your argument is only for case B. So that result is true also for case F. Yes, so I think we don't use anything essential about B. I think most of the argument works for F. It's just that at the end, there is no positive stable root of your reaction. So you can conclude that there's actually no solutions at all. No solutions at all in those domains. Yeah, no positive boundary solutions. Okay. Maybe another question? So the unique seems to be important that the solution is strictly positive. Yes. So it's well possible that there might be non-negative solutions with some non-trivial normal set. I don't think this could happen. I think the strong maximum principle would rule that out. I'm not sure. So the limit of the modic hyperplane can give you some solution which is symmetric around the hyperplane, but the boundary reflects. So she would be zero, the reflected boundary, but it would need to be then negative above that nodal, that node, right? Nodal, that node, right? In order to balance out. So, I guess, or another way to say it is that if your solution is non-negative and non-trivial in the epigraph, then it can't vanish in the interior of the epigraph. The normal derivative will be zero as well. The normal derivative along the boundary. Let's talk. Hmm, let's talk afterwards. Yeah, it looks like there might be one question from Francois. I don't know if we want to. I could take it offline if we wanted to. Okay, maybe Francois, just go ahead. Thank you. So good morning, everyone. So I would like to ask you a question. So as far as I understood, the Lipschitz continuity of the graph plays a role in order to initiate the sliding method. So out of curiosity, So, out of curiosity, what would happen if the graph were the function, let's say, phi of x prime, which is the norm of x prime square? Yeah. I also expect uniqueness there. So, Henri and I have tackled similar questions for monostable reactions in that kind of domain. And I suspect that the ideas we work with would be able to work for that particular domain. Work for that particular domain. I think our ideas would basically need your domain to kind of become flat for the curvature boundary to tend to zero at infinity. So I'm pretty confident that for that class, you would have uniqueness. More generally, it's a bit tricky. I'm not sure. Yeah, thank you. Okay. Thank you. Well, let's thank co-Grahan again for that.
