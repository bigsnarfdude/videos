So, it's time for us to begin the talk. So, our first speaker is Professor Wang Fang from Shanghai Jiotung University. The title of his talk is in your low boundaries for the relative volume inequality for CCE. Wang Fang, please. Okay. Thank Professor Li for introducing me. I thank Professor Lee for introducing me and I also want to thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity to speak here. So today I will talk about lower boundary for the relative volume inequality for the conformally compact Einstein. This is a quite recent work I joined with my student Hui Wangzhou. My talk was divided into three parts. Divided into three parts. So, I will first introduce some geometric background. For example, what is conformally compact Einstein and also what kind of volume relativity inequality I want to study. And the second part, I want to introduce the fractional GGMS operators because I need to using this kind of operator to construct the lower bound. I will give you the main. I will give you the main theory. And in the third part, I will state my result and give a sketch of the proof. So let's start with the conformal compact Einstein thing. So here I will talk about a metric in the interior of a compact manifold with boundary. Here I want the manifolds to be smooth and To be smooth. And so the boundary will have a smooth defined function. When I say a smooth boundary defined function, I require it to be a smooth function and the zero level set is just the boundary and it does not degenerate on the boundary. And the metric, the Einstein metric, I was denoted by T plus, I required to be a complete Riemannian. To be a complete Riemannian metric and which has negative rich curvature, negative constant rich curvature. And well, the last requirement is that I want it to be conformally compact. That means by multiplying rho square, the metric will be extended to the boundary. And if the if it can If it can be extended in the CK-alpha class, then we just call it CK-alpha conformally compact. So, here we notice that the boundary defined function actually not unique. If you have one, you can construct many others. So, the extension is also not unique. So, when we look at the metric on the boundary, we can only determine our conformal class, not the metric itself. Not the metric itself. So here we call the conformal class on the boundary to be the conform infinity of this einstein metric. Okay, so for the regularity issue, so we will require that the CCE manifold has regularity at least C3 alpha. The alpha could be zero here. This is because This is because that here we consider the dimension to be m plus one greater than or equal to three. So crucial delay, Lee and Spinner has a boundary regularity theorem that says if initially you have a C2 regularity, then you can choose some other coordinates such that the metric will have The metric will have very good expansion near the boundary. I give the extension here. It just like the in the interior is no problem because we know for Einstein metric, if we choose harmonic coordinates, then we the metric will have very good regularity in the harmonic coordinates. And for the boundary regularity here, I mean, we can see things is a little different. Is a little different. If the boundary dimension is odd, then the expansion can be up to actually up to infinity order. So you can choose a coordinate such that the metric is smooth to the boundary. But if the boundary dimension is even, you can see some log term appear in the expansion. So the log term may stop the regularity. So we also call this H. So we also call this h and the coefficient of the log term to be the obstruction term. But whatever, here we consider the boundary dimension greater or equal to three. So we at least has C3 alpha regularity. We can assume C3 alpha regularity here. That is some reasonable one. I want to point out that here for this expansion, it actually means It actually means every time you fix a boundary representative, then you can choose the very good normal coordinates. Then in this special normal coordinates, you can have this good expansion. And these normal coordinates can be is called the geodesic normal coordinates corresponding to this boundary representative. And in this expansion, G2. expansion G2 onto Gm minus one or Gm minus two or H things. This lower order dimension, sorry, lower order coefficients are all locally determined by the G0, I mean the boundary metric. But if we go to the order n, we can see the coefficients cannot be locally determined. That is a global one. Only when we completely solving the We completely solving the Einstein equation, we can see this. So sometimes we also call this G0 to be the direction data, this GN to be the Neumann data, just in general sense. Okay, there are also some other important geometrical properties for CCE. For example, it is asymptotic hybrid. Here, after requiring required After requiring require that the regularity is at least the C3 alpha, we can see the sectional curvature can be written as negative one plus some small error. This error term can decay at least the rho square. And another important property is that after g sorry. After give the compact location, the compactified metric has unveiled a boundary. This is just because in the very good expansion, it is even to a certain order. So you can choose, actually you can choose some good compact equation such that the boundary is totally geodesic. So this is a model. So, this is a model example, the hybrid space in the Bohr model. So, we can take G plus to be the Euclidean metric times 4 divided by 1 minus radius square and 2 power 2. And we can see in this model, the conforming infinity is just the round metric on the sphere. Sorry, this should be S n, not a minus 1. And in this And in this model, you can also see that we have different choices of the defining function. For example, the first one I write here is corresponding to the best expansion, best Taylor expansion at the boundary. It just means the expansion is in even power. And you can see in particular when any is odd, the boundary dimension is odd, there is no global term. The second defining function we can. The second defining function we can choose that is one minus radius square over one plus radius square. That is that compact equation is just as a half sphere. And the metric can be write explicitly here. The boundary metric is still the round sphere of lower dimension, no problem. And in this competition, we can see it has very good geometric property that the integer which That the inquiry rich curvature is a positive constant, and the inquiry scale curvature is positive constant, and the boundary is totally geodesic. And the third one we take is the flat disk compactification. So, in this compactification, the interior curvature vanishes and the boundary curvature is a constant. And the boundary curvature is a constant. Actually, in general, this is for the standard model. In general, we can take some similar idea to choose some special type of compactification such that we can see different things that connecting the interior and the boundary. Okay, here I write some main problems or fundamental problems that related to this CCE. To this CCE. The first problem is that given some closed manifolds and the ways are conformal class of metric, whether there is a high-dimensional Einstein metric such that it's conformal infinity is a given one. That means we need to solve the Einstein equation here with some Dirichlet condition. Generally speaking, this. General speaking, this is very difficult. I mean, the existence and the uniqueness and the compactness problems are all very hard. I think many there are many, many works discussing this kind of problems. I think in the audience, there are many works given by the audience here. For example, for the existence, so far we're not. So far, we know that there is some perturbation result given by Robin Graham and Jack Lee. That is, if you have a metric that is very close to the rounded sphere metric, then you can have an Einstein filling in the ball. And well, however, there are also some non-existent results. For example, in recent years, Professor recent year, Professor Han gave the, and Gurski gave the non-existent example that on the seventh sphere, you can construct some positive scale curvature metric such that in the eight balls, there is no Einstein fueling. And for the uniqueness, there's also some issue. I mean, so far we know that the uniqueness is true for the model case. That means if the boundary is a run. That means if the boundary is a round sphere, there is only one interior filling that is a hybolic metric. But you also can have many examples that says there is no uniqueness. For example, the Hawking page and for example, the S1 cross S2, you can have different filling like hybolic manifold filling or ADS short shield filling. So that is very hard to. Very hard to answer in general for the uniqueness problem. And for compactness, I think there are very recent work by Chang and Ge Xing and Qing that study the compactness problem for this CCE setting. So here, I mean, there are still many, many open. I mean, there are still many, many problems here. There's another thing we also care about is that the relation between the interior and the boundary. That means, if the CCE exists, can we read some interior information from the boundary? This is actually, I mean, what the ADS-CFT correspondents wanted to study. I mean, because the CCE is actually the mathematical model for the ADS-CFT. Model for the ADS safety theory. The second problem is, of course, help to understand the first problem. So here, what I want to study is here is the volume comparison thing. You can see the formula here is very clear. This formula is given actually is a joint. Given actually is a joint work, not joint work, it's a series work by Bishop Gromov and the duty Java Hari and Li and Ching and Shu. In the formula, the right part is just the Bishop-Bromov volume comparison theorem. The lower bound is given by the other authors. So, this is very interesting problem because. Interesting problem because after we know the lower bound here, we can have a direct answer to the rigidity problem. That is, if the boundary is the round sphere, then in this inequality, then every equality holds, then the interior metric must be the standard hybolic metric. Standard hybrid metric. And from this, they also proved Li and Qing and Shu also proved our gap theorem that says for any epsilon positive, there exists some delta positive such that if the boundary Yamabi constant is close enough to the round sphere Yamabi constant, then the be constant, then the integral sectional curvature is close enough to negative one. In my work, I want to give a new lower bound for this inequality. To state the new lower bound, I need to introduce the fractional GGMS operator first because First, because the new lower bound is given by the fractional EMRB constants. The fractional GGMS operator can be studied in two ways. The first is by scattering theory, and the second is by magical measure space. I will introduce both of them because both of them help us to understand the thing here. So, first, we try to study the We try to study the fractional GGMS by scattering theory. This is studied by a group of people in microlocal analysis. The scattering theory closely related to a spectrum of the Laplacian. So here I denote the interior Laplacian to be Laplace plus, that is just a Laplacian for the negative Einstein metric. Maros and Mazoo. Maros and Mazu first give the spectrum of this Laplacian. Actually, they studied it in more general case, but I only apply their theorem here in our special case. They actually only require the manifolds to be asymptotically hybrid. Here, our Laplacian will have the spectrum of the Laplacian will consist of two parts. One is absolutely continuous part that is. Absolutely continuous part that is fixed by the dimension. And the other is the pure point part that is just the L2 eigenvalue. And that is disproportionate numbers between 0 and n square over 2. In some good case, this L2 eigenvalue can disappear. For example, J-Cli proved that if the boundary Yamabi constant is non-negative, then there is no error. Non-negative, then there is no L to Eigen value. So only the continuous spectrum part. Based on this, we can study the resolvent for this Laplacian minus spectral parameter. And they proved that the residue of this one is in some certain type of pseudo-differential operator of order negative two. Of order negative two. So here zero and SS just describe the boundary behavior for this pseudo-differential operator. And this shows that this resolvent is a family of operator and it's it again it defined it directly in half plane that is the real part of S greater than n over two. Than n over 2. And for the other half plane, you can extend it to meromorphically to that part, to the other half plane. And of course, there are some pause will happen in the other half plane. Well, actually, in Well, actually in the directly defined plane, I mean, sorry, I should be a little careful. This resolve defined directly for the real part of S sufficiently large. And then it metomorphically extended to the whole complex plane. And the poles may have an there are two, there are different types of poles, and the poles may have. Type of pose, and the pose may happen when the real part less or equals to n, actually. After we know about the spectrum, we can study the generalized eigenfunction, that means the solution for this equation. Given a certain kind of directional data, we can solve the equation here, and we find. Here and we found that general speaking, the equation, the solution will take this form. It has a very good expansion near the boundary. Here, x, I should point out that x is some special one usually. By fixing a boundary metric, we can take x to be the best one corresponding to the boundary choice of the metric. X is a geodesic normal defined function here. So actually, the first series can be constructed formally. You just construct the formal series solution. And the second part coming out by using the resolvent to correct the error thing. So the second part behaves like the normal. Part behaves like the Neumann term. And so we can define the scattering operator that is just the generalized direction to Neumann map. That is from the leading term of the first series to the leading term of the second series. And Josh Sabruito and Graham Tsworski and Glamoux and some other people. And some other people, they studied the property of these scattering operators and it shows that it's a family of conformally covariant elliptic state differential operator of complex order 2s minus n on the boundary. And the principal part can be characterized explicitly by this. It's just a constant times the principal symbol. Principal symbol of the boundary Laplacian to a certain power. We noticed that this is an analytical family if this real part of the parameter greater than over 2 and this 2s minus n is not integer and the spectrum parameter does not fill in the L2 eigenvalue. In the L to eigenvalue. And it has some minimum continuation to the other half plane. We want to say that these discrete numbers were corresponding to some pulse, some finite rank pulse, not finite rank, finite order pulse. And that pause can be characterized explicitly. For example, if s times If S times minus S fill in the L2 eigenvalue, then the rescue is just the projection operator to the L2 eigen space. This is just some finite rank projection operation. So it's very small. And if 2s minus n equals to 2k, if this happened, that actually means what? That means in this expansion, you actually have some log term appears. Have some log term appears in the second series. And the rest is some locally defined differential operator. We can try to re-normalize the scattering operator just by take the scattering operator times some constant. The times some constant depend on this spectrum parameter, such that the leading term is a power of the boundary laws. And this kind of operator automatically has the conformal covariant property that is also can be read from the expansion here. Read from the expansion here. Because if we choose a different boundary. A different boundary representative and choose a different x, then the solution is the same, but it has different expansion. And you just look at the relation of the two different expansion, you can find out the scattering operator should have some conformal covariant properties. Okay, so this P2 gamma is just what I'm saying is that this P2 gamma is just. Saying is that this pdo gamma is just some conformal covariant operator that was leading to the appliance to power gamma. So it's a fractional GGMS. And we can also define the fractional Q curvature in a formal way like this. And in particular, if gamma is k then the p2k is just Then the P2K is just the classical GGMS operation. For example, K equals one is the conformal operation, K equals two is a penny s operator. This is proved by Tsworsky and Gram explicitly. And the conformal covariant information is given here. By degree is given by these two numbers. So you can see they are fractional, they are continuous family. And of course, we can define the fractional Yamabi constant in the automatically. Okay, I want to point out that this definition for the fractional GGMS operator depends on the integer Einstein fill in. So it only depends on the boundary metric. So it may not unique. It may not be unique. That means if we have different filling, you can have different definition. So, generally speaking, it's not unique. It's not unique for the boundary, I mean. But for a standard model, you can see it's uniquely determined because for a standard model, we have the rigidity theorem, I mean the uniqueness theorem. And actually, you can write out the operators explicitly by using. Explicitly by using the spectrum theory. This formula is given by a vector in clear time. The second way to consider the fractional GGMS is by using the metric space. And this is the idea given by. Can I continue? Continue? Yes, go ahead. Okay. So sorry, my internet connection is not very good. Sorry. The second way to study the fractional DGMS is by using the metric measure space. That is given by Kafari Sylvester, Yang. This is Yang Rei, and Jeffrey Kays and Alex Chang. I will go quick. Um, I will go quick. Uh, uh, that the idea is uh that I mean, we consider operators on X, but we can do it first on a product space. Take the first factor to be X and the second factor to be some space form. So in this product space, you have some very intrinsically defined operators, conformal invariant operators. Then you let this Operators, then you let this kind of operators acting on functions that only depend on x. So that will give us operators certain kind of conformal invariant operators on X. And with the bi-degree of the conformal invariance given depend on the dimension M here. And this M. And this M, this dimension M for the space form is actually, well, quite formally, and we use it quite formally here. So you can take it to be some continuous parameter. So that means in this way, you can construct some operators that acting on function of x, but has conformal covariance. That conformal covariance given by some continuous parameter. In particular, for gamma between 0 and 1, if we consider the operators of order between 0 and 2, then we can find out it can be given in this way. We can try to study the, you know, so. So equation, second order equation in the interior with directional data given on the boundary. And this second order interior, we're using the conformal invariant operator defined here. Actually, I also give the formula explicitly here. And then And then, by looking at the Neumann data with a certain weight, then it gives the P2 gamma. That is what we defined before. And in particular, if gamma is just in the middle, half one, then this parameter m is just a zero. Then the conformal operator we're looking at is just a conformal partial in the integer. Conformula partial in the integer. So the equation we look at is just the conformal partial acting on some capital U equal to zero and with some Dirac data F. Then the Norman data, the P1 is just the negative of the Norman data. And because of this, we can find out that the Yamabi constant is the Yamabi constant defined by P1 is actually just equals to the second. Actually, just equals to the second type as coova Yamabi constant for manifold with boundary. That means you have an integral in the integral and some conformal invariant integral divided by some volume of the boundary, volume to certain power, I think, of the boundary. And for gamma between one and two, Gamma between one and two, you can do the similar thing, but the interior equation becomes a four-order equation, fourth-order equation. And you need two directional data to solve in the equation. And one is such as F and the other is set as zero. And then the P2 gamma is defined in this way. It's some kind of Neumann data with a weight. With a weight. And in particular, if gamma is in the middle, three over two, then this first order operator is just the Pennis operator. And f is directial data. And the second condition is just the first order derivative, first order normal derivative on the boundary vanishes. Okay. Okay, so here what we use is the is a P2 gamma for gamma between zero and one. That means the operator is of order between zero and two. And we use the Yamabi constant given by these operators. And we find out that the volume ratio actually has a lower bound that is given by. Lower bound that is given by this fractional Yamabi constant. And because of this, you can give a similar gap phenomenon in terms of the fractional MRV constant. That just means if your fractional Y MRV constant is close enough to the fractional MRP constant of the wrong sphere, then the interior sectional curvature is close enough to negative one. Enough to negative one, okay. It's similar like what Li and the Shu and the Ching did. And I want to make a remark here that actually when gamma equals one half, that means the operator is of order one, we actually provide a batch lower bond. It must be bad, otherwise, we the result has nonsense. It is better. It is better because of some comparison theorem we studied before that, yes, if you have the first, you know, the first order Yamarvi constant and the second order Yamarvi constant. The second order is just the cluster one given by the conformal law function. The first order is what we just defined it. We actually have a comparison argument like the Argument like this. The equality holds if and only if the isometric is a hybrid space. That means in general, this is a strict inequality. So that means the lower bound we gave is a little better than the previous lower bound. The previous lower bound. Okay. And of course, we have some questions here. So we want to ask whether, you know, for more general gamma, for example, gamma between zero and one half and gamma between one half and one, whether the lower bound still provides a better one, and which one is best. We have a conjecture that the limit of the lower bound. The lower bound as gamma goes to zero is the best one, but so far we don't know how to prove it. It needs much more further study. Okay, at last I want to give a sketch of the proof. So we follow the steps of what Li and Ching and Shu did in the Did in the paper, and we first construct and we will first study the simple case that is gamma equals to one half. This is very much clear. And for general gamma, the idea is quite the same, but the computations and the formulas are much difficult to write out. So for gamma, sorry, sorry. So for gamma equals to one half, we first consider two types of compact equation. The first type is by a smooth defining function that we denote rho here. Rho is coming out, rho is equals to u to a certain power and u solving the linear equation. So here all these equations. So, here all these equations, all these solutions are smooth. And of course, rho is also called the adapt compact equation sometimes. And we take the compact equation to be rho squared plus. And to compare with the other one, we also denote r bar to be negative log rho over two. So this r bar is almost the Bar is almost the distance function, it's asymptotically the distance function. And now, t is the real distance function. We fix some p as the central point, and we denote t to be the distance in metric in the Einstein metric, and we denote t tilde to be t plus two log one plus e to negative t and we define. And we define the second compact equation in this way. So these two compact equation has a similar form. And the t tilde and r bar both asymptotically the distance function actually. The difference is that the first one is always smooth. The metric is smooth, the defining function is smooth, and the levels. Is smooth and the level set is also smooth. And the second one, we're using the distance function, so we cannot guarantee the smoothness when t goes large. So that will take some issue. And we denote gamma t to be the t level set and sigma r to be the r level set. And we denote the restriction of the above matrix to the Above matrix to the level set by this thing, and the difference of these two factor alpha and t tilde is denoted by v. And we can prove that this v is bounded everywhere, and the gradient is bounded almost everywhere. everywhere and it's a function of w12 and and if we take c to be exponential to minus one over two v then this c has a leptus extension to to to the boundary and the two different metric in the integer has a conformal transformation in terms of c in this way To see in this way. So, this is what we use in conformal geometry. Now, now we can derive an inequality like this. So if we consider everything is smooth, then this is very clear. In the first integral, we do some integration by part. We do some integration by part, and then we use conformal transformation. We transform from G-bar metric to G-tulia metric. We will get to a second. And the difficult part is that at some point, the T is not smooth, and hence, this V and this P, this conformal factor, is not smooth. And so we need some discussion of the cat locus. Cut locus. The good thing is the difficulty here is almost the same as what Li and the Xuan did previously. So the cut locus in our manifold is not very bad. It consists of three parts. And the first two parts actually has very low cost of dimension. The co-dimension is at least two. And the third part. And the third part consists of possibly countably many disjoint smooth subsurface in X. And actually, if you look at each point in the third part, there exists a neighborhood of U. There exists a neighborhood U such that in this neighborhood, you can only see a smooth subsurface. The cut locus only has a piece of smooth suburb. A piece of smooth hub surface in this in this neighborhood and hence and moreover Li and Shena Tin proved that the distance function if we look at the if we if we look at a point in the third part and we know locally this is just a piece of hype surface if piece of hype surface if we you know just dig out this p this hype surface then we will get two normal uh normal direction that is from the interior and and for these two normal direction we find out uh and they find out that the the normal derivative the summation of the normal derivative has a fixed sign so it goes back to this inequality So it goes back to this inequality. We can say, okay, if smooth, then everything is clear. If not smooth, we can first dig out the cut locus. And what we throw out here is something has fixed the sign. So that will keep the inequality. And then in the smooth part, we just do integration by part and Integration by part and conformal transformation to get this inequality. Okay. And in that inequality, we'll find out that sorry, my mouse is too sensitive. This curvature actually has very good estimates. This one has negative sign. Has negative sign as long as it at the smooth point. And this one is almost a constant. Notice that this G tilder metric is given by the conform factor that using the distance function. So it's a very special one. If we look at the standard model, that means the compatibility is something which has radiosymmetry. So, because of the sign and the estimate of the main culture here, we can prove that the Yamabi constant is bounded by the volume here. This is just this inequality. I mean, because the left-hand side is larger or equals to the Yamabi constant, and the right-hand side. And the right-hand side, as long as this curvature has fixed the sign, this one, this R has fixed sign, and this H has a good estimate, and the right-hand side will be just bounded by a volume. So that is this one. And at last, we have a volume limit of the T level set, and that is similar as before. So we can see the T level set goes. So we can see the t level set goes actually when t is large enough, it's a Lipschitz graph over the boundary. And the volume in this new compact equation, new compactified metric has also has a nature limit. This should be G infinity. And the volume ratio of the T level set. T level set compared to the T level set in the standard space that is computed in this way. And it is just things like this. Okay. And this is what we used in the previous inequality. Okay. So because of the Yamabi concept. So, because of the Yamabi constant has less than the because of, I should write here, because of this one. And we final have Yamabi constant like this, sorry, inequality given by the Yamabi constant like this. So, this is for gamma equals to one half. Gamma equals one half. And for gamma, general gamma, the idea is the same, just everything we need to take consideration of the gamma. And we will choose a depth defining function as the smooth one first. And then we choose a second one that is not smooth, but also using distance function. And it's just a composition of the distance function. Composition of the distance function composition by this capital P C is capital P C coming from the standard model. Okay. And then we have an estimate of the difference. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry. Very quick. The difference has a uniform bound and the gradient is a little different here. In the previous Here. In the previous one, the gradient always has a lower bound, but here may not give gamma less than one half. So, generally speaking, you can see it's in W12 space for the weight of the volume. That just means when gamma is greater than one half, then this one has literally extension. But if gamma is small, this one has just a C2 gamma extension to the boundary. This is not a big problem. Actually, the Actually, the change of the regularity here is only in the normal direction, that's because we have a different rescale the normal coordinates. For the tangential part, I mean, if we consider things on the level set, it's almost the same as before. So we can derive some inequality similar as before here, but much more complicated. More complicated. And also, here involving some discussion of the catalogus. And the essential part is that we have some estimate for the curvature thing. The interior curvature has that fixed sign, and the boundary curvature with a correct weight goes into the fractional Q curvature we defined before. So the inequality. So, the inequality represented here actually giving an inequality between the two gamma Yamati constant to the volume for to the volume here. That is this. And at last, considering the volume of the level set P, again, we have to remove the inequality finally. Inequality primary. Okay, I will stop here. Thank you for your attention. So, thank you, Professor Wang Fang, for a very less talk. Some questions and comments, please. Thank you for the beautiful talk, Wang Fang. Let me ask, do you expect general monotonicity formula like U and Q? Formula like u and q did between what between this gamma index. Yes, that's what we expect, but we cannot prove it in this moment. So, your method of proof between y2 and y1 does not apply in general. This theorem, yes. Yeah, this one, we so far we only have this one. We we expect you to get some. We expect to get some saying about the fractional one, but so far we don't have. So the method of proof of this theorem is very different than the result you present today. Yeah, it's different. It's quite, it's very, very different. Okay, sure. But may have some, yeah, I should say that it may have something. Something. I need to reconsider it. I mean, this work, I mean, what I taught you today is very recent work. I haven't got much time to think about the previous problem again. Yeah, probably you have. I see. I see. When gamma tends to zero, do you is there a geometric meaning of this Y2 gamma or is a normalized Y2 gamma? The Y2 gamma. You expect it to be the best concept. Yes. I mean, I is there an interpolation of that? No, but I think there is something that is worth to study. Okay, sure. Yes. Okay, sure. Yes.
