 Okay, um, it's my pleasure to um um wish Andrei um happy birthday. Um, happy birthday and many productive years. And to introduce the next speaker, um, so our next speaker is uh Srimati Srinivasan, and she'll speak on the finiteness theorem for special unitary groups. Please go ahead. Matthew, are you there? Are you able to hear me? Yeah, I can hear you now. Okay. And everybody's able to see my screen? Yes. Okay. Okay, so I'm going to talk about good reduction of unitary groups of quaternion xQ Hermitian forms. But before I begin, I just want to mention that this project came up when I. This project came up when I met Andrey Ruppenchuk while he was visiting the institute. So I just want to thank him for introducing me to this topic and also for sharing his research. And also want to wish him a happy birthday. So let me just start with some preliminaries, introduction. So the concept of good reduction is already known, well known in the literature in the context of abelian varieties. Of abelian varieties and elliptic curves. In the context of algebraic groups, good reduction started with Harder over number fields, followed by many other people. But then recently, Chernasov, Rapenchuk, and Rapinchuk, they addressed the question of good reduction for spinar groups over two-dimensional global fields and also over function fields of curves over certain fields. I'll describe what they are. What they are. But the goal of the presentation overall is to extend the above results to special unitary groups of skew Hermitian forms over quaternions. Okay, so this is the brief overview. Let me dive into details. So I'm going to fix my notations. So K will be a field with discrete valuation V, and O V is the valuation ring. K sub V denotes the completion. V K sub V denotes the completion of K with respect to V and K upper V here is the associated residue field. Okay, and throughout my talk, my G will be an absolutely almost simple and simply connected algebraic group. So what do I mean by good reduction? So G is said to have good reduction at a given valuation V. So G is defined over K. So it is said to have good reduction. If we can find a reductive If you can find a reductive group scheme script G over the valuation ring such that when you base change to completion, you get G base change to completion. Okay, so given this definition, Chernosa, Rapenchuk, and Rappenchuk asked in their recent paper that can we equip K with a set of discrete valuations such that the set of isomorphism classes of forms of G. Morphism classes of forms of G have good reduction at all valuations in your given set is finite. Okay, so we are given G and we are given a G over a given field K with equipped with we want to equip with discrete valuations such that the number of forms of G with good reduction at all the valuations is finite. And why do we care about this question? Well, the answer to this question, suppose if you are able to find such a set of discrete valuations such that Discrete valuations such that the number of forms of G-with good reduction is finite, then it has important consequences, such as properness of local global map and Galvoch homology and in determining the genus of an algebraic group and in eigenvalue rigidity problems. Again, I'm not going to talk more about the application part of it, but I just want to let you know that there are interesting applications if the answer to the question is affirmative. Okay, so what do we know so far? Well, the answer is affirmative. Far? Well, the answer is affirmative for any group G where K is number field and B is set of non-Archimedean places. Okay, so in this case, if you take any group G for this pair K and B, the number of forms of G that have good reduction at all these places is only finite. And this is due to Gross, Conrad, Jevin Baker, and Lauran. And what about other fields? So here I want to make a definition due to Irapp and make a definition due to i rap and chick so um i'm going to uh i'm going to introduce my little k so little k is a field it is said to be of type m prime where m is co-prime to characteristic k if for every finite separable extension l over k if you take the group of units of l and morrow by the mth power then the quotient is finite okay so those kinds of fields are said to be of type fm prime fm prime and what are the examples of course finite fields uh definitely an example and we also have uh local fields higher order local high dimension local fields qp with um laurent series in many variables over qp okay so now your big k the field that i'm interested in is the function field of a smooth geometrically integral curve denoted by c over little k over little k where your little k is of type f2 prime. Okay, and what are the valuations that I'm looking at? They are the valuations coming from closed points of c. So c is one-dimensional, so any point determines a discrete valuation, and I collect all the valuations coming from the closed points of C. Then for this given pair K and B, what do we know? Okay, so I'm going to be interested only in this pair for the rest of my talk. So my base field is the function field of a curve over a field. as the function field of a curve over a field of type F2 prime and V is the valuations coming from the closed points of C. Then for this pair, what do we know about the questioning? So it turns out that the question, the answer to the question is affirmative for these kinds of groups. So SLD, where D is a division algebra. So this is of type A. And it's also true for unitary groups of Permitian forms of some quadratic extension. It's also It's also type A, and we also know that the answer is true, answer is yes for Hermitian forms over quaternions, unitary groups of Hermitian forms over quaternions. And also the recent paper shows that it is also true for spinar groups. Okay, this will correspond to type B and D. And we also know that it is true for all simple groups of type G2. Well, for this particular pair K and V, we know that the answer. Particular pair K and V, we know that the answer to the question is affirmative for all these groups. Well, what is missing? So we have some cases which are missing here, as you can see. So, based on the above evidence, Chernosov Rapenchuk and Rampensuk conjectured the following. They conjectured that, in fact, the answer should be yes for all the groups for this particular K and B. Okay, so whenever you take K to be a function field of curve over fields of type Fm prime and all. Fields of type fm prime, and also if we take the valuations coming from the closed points of the curve, then for any g, the number of forms of g with good reduction at all these places have to be finite. Okay, so that is the conjecture posed by Chernasu-Rapenchuk and Rapenchuk. Well, what is missing in this conjecture? What is unknown is one of the cases that is unknown is the special unitary groups of quaternion XQ. Quaternionic skew Hermitian forms. So you have H. H is a skew-Hermitian form defined over a quaternion algebra, which is over the base field K. And also remember that K comes with a set of discrete valuations coming from the closed points of the curve associated to K. Then we don't know for this case whether the number of such groups with good reduction at all the places is finite. Well, the result that I want to talk about in the The result that I want to talk about in this presentation, or at least give a brief idea of how the proof goes, is to show that the answer is in fact true, the answer is affirmative for these kinds of groups. Okay, so I want to show that whenever I have K and B as before, and if I collect all these special unitary groups of skew-Hermitian forms, of n-dimensional skew-Hermitian forms over some quaternion algebra. Some quaternion algebra, then the number of such groups that have good reduction at all the valuations is just finite. And moreover, we also know that it is bounded, upper bounded, by this quantity here. Well, I'll tell you what these things are. The L here is just log to n plus 1, which is where n is the dimension of your, the rank of your skew Hermitian form. And what are these upper V's and lower V's here? Well, HI is the Galoch of homology over. Commology over K and HI lower V denotes the kernel of this residue map. So we have residue maps in Galoch homology. So K is the field that you have, that it started with. K upper V is the residue field. So you have the direct sum is over all the valuations. And you take the kernel of this residue map. And the kernel of the residue map is denoted by Hi sub V. know h i sub v and the co-kernel is denoted by uh h i upper v okay um now okay so now how do i sketch the proof so i just want to give you a brief sketch of how the proof works well let's say that you have um you you are given a special unit You are given a special unitary group of a quaternion unit skew-Hermitian form, S over Q. So, H is a skew-Hermitian form over Q. Now, we are asking whether it has good reduction at a given valuation, V. So, now I want to translate this question to an underlying form, the underlying form here. So, I want to rewrite this question in the context of good reduction of the underlying form H. So, I want to ask, H. So I want to ask whether the underlying form H has code reduction at V. So here I'm cheating a little bit because you also need to have like, so ideally you want to ask if some scalar times H has good reduction at V. And again, I haven't defined what good reduction means in terms in the context of skew Hermitian forms, which I will do in a minute. But the point is you want to reduce the question on the group, good reduction of a group to the good reduction of the underlying form. And you want Line form, and you want to use Morita theory to get a quadratic form from the skew-Hermitian form H. Okay, so the skew-Hermitian form over quaternions are not well studied in the literature. So, you want to somehow translate this to an well-understood object, which will be a quadratic forms. And the way you do it is by taking your quaternion and splitting it over K of Q. So, K of Q will be the function field of the conic associated. Of the conic associated to the quaternion, and once you split it, then you will have a skew-Hermitian form over a split quaternion. And given a skew-Hermitian form over split is over a matrix algebra, you can get a quadratic form using Morita theory, okay, which I'll again explain how it is done. But then the end product is you'll have a quad, you'll have a quadratic form associated to every skew formation form H, not over the field K that you started with, but The field k that you started with, but you, um, but but over the field k of q, which is an extension of k. All right, now, what do we do with this uh q sub h? So, recall that our valuation v is over k. Okay, so but then what you end up here is a quadratic form over an extended field k of q. All right, so what we want to do is we want to extend the valuation v, that is over k to a valuation v. over k to evaluation v tilde over k of q such that if h has good reduction at v then the class of q's of h is unramified at v tilde again i will i'll redefine i'll recall what this notion means something being unramified but then once we know that um if h as good reduction implies the class of q sub h is unramified all we need to do now is just count the number of unramified classes Number of unramified classes using Galba cohomology. Okay, and this problem is this problem can be easily handled compared to what we started with here. Okay, so this is how the idea flows and this is how you come how you show that the number of unitary groups of quaternion units, Q Hermitian forms that have good reduction at all evaluations is just finite. Okay, so you want to reduce all the way to homology classes via Um, via Galois homology, and then use some diagram chasing to show that the number of unramified Galois homology classes is just finite. Okay, all right, so let me start with the first step here. How do I go from the group to the underlying form? Okay, so what do I mean by good reduction of a form? So, h, q, h is a skew-Hermitian form over a quaternion q. We say that it has good reduction at v. First of all, there. V if first of all, there are two conditions. One is the quaternion should be unramified at V. What this means is that the quaternion when you base change to the completion should come from an Azumeya algebra over valuation ring OV. Okay, so in this case, the class of the quaternion lies in the unramified Brouwer group. And the second condition is that we need Q to be unramified. We need Q to be unramified. We also need that the skew Hermitian form H also comes from a form over the Azume algebra A V from a non-degenerate skew Hermitian form over A V. Okay, so if both the objects come from an analogous object over the valuation ring, we say that this pair has good reduction at the given valuation v. Okay, so now when do we have that the group has a good reduction? When do we have that the group has a good reduction at v? Well, the group has good reduction at v if and only if the underlying form alpha v h v has good reduction at v for some alpha v in k v star. Okay, so note that the group doesn't care about you know whether you're multiplying h with a scalar or not. So the group remains the group remains the same if you scale the h by some scalar. So the notion of good reduction of algebraic group can be translated to the notion. Group can be translated to the notion of good reduction of this pair H over Qv. Okay, so now that so we need both the conditions Q and H to be both to have Q should be unramified and H should also have good reduction, but then what we know is that the number of unramified quaternions is just finite. Okay, this is because this class, the unramified homology class, H2K sub V is finite. H2K sub V is finite. So therefore, the number of Q, the Q's that are unramified at every valuation in V is finite. So this is again a result due to, I think, John Naso-Raptonchick and Raptzh. So what we need to do is just, we need to just focus on a fixed Q. So for a fixed Q, how many H do we have such that alpha V H V has good reduction at all valuations? Okay, so given a Okay, so given a fixed quaternion q, you look at all the skew Hermitian forms and you ask how many of them have good reduction. How many of them, when you multiply by some scalar, has good reduction at all the valuations. Okay, so again, this talk, I'm just going to slightly forget about the scalar. I'm just going to talk about how many Hermitian forms, how many skew Hermitian forms over a fixed quaternion have good reduction at all the valuations. Okay. Okay, so well, we have a skew Hermitian form over a quaternion, but then we don't know how to count the number of them which have good reduction. So what we need to do is we need to somehow reduce the skew-Hermitian form to a well-known object. Suppose if your skew-Hermitian form H is over your matrix algebra M2 of K. Suppose if the quaternion is split, the quaternion over which H is defined is split. H is defined is split, then Marita equivalence tells you that you can get a quadratic form of twice the rank over the field K here. Okay, so there is an association between a skew-Hermitian form over a split quaternion to a quadratic form of twice the rank over the field K. Okay, so the association goes this way. So suppose if your n is 1, then you have a skew-Hermitian form over this. A skew-Hermitian form over this main over the matrix algebra whose matrix is given by this. Okay, so again, the involution that I'm looking at is a canonical involution. So if this denotes the, this represents the matrix for the form H over the one-dimensional form over M to K, then the multi-equivalence spits out a quadratic form of rank 2 over K. And the associated matrix for the quadratic form is just obtained from these entries. But, you know, I think you can just see, you just wrote. Know, I think you can just see you just rotate the entries clockwise and then change signs accordingly. Okay, so the point is you've given a given skew-Hermitian form over m to k, you get a quadratic form of twice the rank over k if the quaternion is split. Well, now the h is not, now the q is not split in our case, need not be split in our case. So q can be any quaternion, it need not be split, but then we know that it splits over q of q. So k of q is the function field. Q is the function field of the conic associated to Q, or you can also say, like, it's the function field of the Severbrower variety associated to Q. I'll give an example in the next slide. So what we want to do is you want to somehow split Q generically. So you split the Q over the function field so that you get matrix algebra, not over K, but then over the function field K of Q. Then what we have now is the form when you extend it to K of Q. form when you extend it to k of q also splits so h sub k of q is a skew hermitian form over the matrix algebra over k of q now we go back here and use merita equivalence to get a rank 2n quadratic form over k of q okay so q sub h sub k of q is the quadratic form associated to the skew hermitian form h sub k of q which is obtained by base changing h to k of q where the quaternions of q where the quaternion splits okay so it's to simplify notations i just want to write it as q sub h instead of q sub h sub k of q so given a h over a quaternion q sub h is the quadratic form that you get via morita equivalence by taking h base changing it to the function field of the conic and then using morita equivalence so this gives you the quadratic form okay so here's an example um So here's an example. Suppose if your quaternion is just given by 1ijij, where i square equals t, j square equals t, and ij equals minus ji. What is the conic associated to q? It is the equation, it is the variety defined by this equation, dx squared plus dy square minus 1. Now what is the function field of this conic? The function field of this conic is just the fraction field of this. This conic is just the fraction field of this ring. Now, how do we split Q? You take Q, and if you base change it to K of Q, you get a matrix algebra, and the association goes by taking I to this matrix, J to this matrix, and Ij to this matrix. And you can see that the relations on the left-hand side is also satisfied by the right-hand side. So, this gives you an isomorphism. Now, suppose if your form H, if the skew. Uh, if the skew-Hermitian form H is given by a matrix whose diagonal entries are these pure quaternions. Okay, so we know that uh skew-Hermitian forms over quaternions can be diagonalized, so we can find a diagonal representation. And suppose if we have this as a diagonal representation, then using this association, when you when you base change it to K of Q, you get the associated matrix. This will be the matrix over K of Q. And they are multi-equivalent. And the multi-equivalence tells you how to find the corresponding quadratic form from this Q-Hermitian form. Okay, so again, you just rotate the entries and then change the sign. Okay, you can see that this matrix is of rank 2n over K of Q and it is of course the matrix is symmetric. So it represents a quadratic form. Okay, so this is the example. Now that we have a quadratic form associated to every skew Hermitian form over k of q. Hermitian form over k of q, what can we do with it? Well, I want to translate this to cohomology. Well, the important step is to use Milner isomorphism, which will take i n mod i n plus 1 to the Galvoch homology over K of Q. So here I is the fundamental ideal of the wit ring over the field K of Q. Okay, so and then so if Q sub H belongs to Q sub h belongs to the left-hand side, you can map it to the homology class via the Muller isomorphism. Now, what do we do with that? Well, we have a class over K of Q, not over K, but then the point is to extend the valuation V to a valuation V tilde on K of Q, such that if H has good reduction at V, then the class Q sub H is unramified at V tilde. Okay, so the starting point is Q Hermitian form. Starting point is a skew-Hermitian form over k on which the valuation v is defined. But then, using all this process that I have just described, we got a class, class-associated quadratic form over K of Q. So the K of Q is an extended field. You also want to extend the valuation to K of Q such that if H has good reduction, then the class Q sub H is unramified at V tilde. So being unramified just means that, so the class Q sub H belongs to the So, the class Q sub H belongs to the left-hand side here. Being unramified means it is in the kernel of the associated residue map. Okay, where the valuations here are V tildes coming from the extensions that I just talked about. Okay, so you want to nicely extend V to a nice extension to extend it over K of Q such that the residue map, when you take the residue map and when you take the kernel, the kernel has to be somehow Has to be somehow manageable. Okay, so this is the whole point. So the whole point is to extend the valuation accordingly so that you have a nice kernel here. Okay, so the kernel of the above map is just denoted by h n k of q sub v tilde. Okay, so again, this is Galva homology. Note that it is over K of Q. All right, so now what is the question? Now, suppose if the number of H's which have good reduction is Which have good reduction is finite, then that means that the number of the unramified cohomology classes over all v tilde is also finite. Okay, so we want to count, so we want to know if this class is finite. Okay, but then this class is still large, very large. We don't, it need not be finite. But here's an interesting fact by Goho. He says that if you take He says that if you take the cohomology class associated with a quadratic form, that actually comes from a skew-Hermitian form over a quaternion. So if you take a cohomology class of such a thing, then it lies in this cohomology class, HINR. What is HINR here? It is the kernel of this residue map. However, here we don't have evaluations coming. We don't have the valuations coming from all the valuations in V tilde. Here, the valuations are different. Okay, so what are the valuations here? So, K of Q is the function field of the conic associated to Q. So, it's again a function field of a curve. Every point corresponds to a discrete valuation. So, you take all the valuations associated to the points in the conic. Then, the kernel of this map, this residue map, is denoted HINR. Okay, so by his. Okay, so by his result, it means that the cohomology class coming from masculine Hermitian form lies in this Hin R of K of Q. Well, now the question just translates to if suppose H has good reduction at P, then the class of Q sub H is actually in the intersection of this class, this kernel, and also the kernel that we just talked about before. Also in this kernel, if H has good reduction at all places in. if H has good reduction at all places in V. Therefore, we just need to count the size of the, we just need to find the size of this intersection of the cohomology classes. So the question is now is the number of elements in the unramified cohomology class denoted by H i and R also with the V tilde below if this is finite? Okay, so we just need to answer this. And how do I answer this? Well, we have block of a spectral sequence in Kato. Spectral sequence in Kato complexes yield a long exact sequence in cohomology. So, note that this is the etal cohomology here associated to the curve C, where C is the curve that we started with, whose function field is K. And here you have the residue map, and here again you have the etal cohomology. Well, it's a result of Irapnal chip that whenever you have K and V as before, these cohomology. V as before, these cohomology classes are finite. Okay, so these two are finite. Therefore, what this means is that the kernel and the co-kernel of this residue map, which is denoted by upper V and sub V as before, the kernel and co-kernels are finite. Okay, so now what do I do with this? Well, I just use some Galvoch homology and some diagram chasing to show that the thing that you actually want to show finiteness for is bounded by these two quantities, which comes from the current. Which comes from the kernel and co-kernel of this residue map, all right? So, this tells you that HINR, which is what you want to show, is finite as required. Okay, so tracing all the way back, it just tells you that the number of forms, skew-Hermitian forms over a single quaternion that have good reduction at all the places is finite. Okay, so this is just a general idea of proof. And of course, I haven't gone through all the details here. We also need to take care of the scalar. Details here. We also need to take care of the scalars that are multiplied with H. But then, this is the general idea of how it is proved. Well, what we don't know is we don't know if it is true for higher-dimensional divisional algebra. So, if you don't know if you have a skew domain form over a divisional algebra of higher degree, is it still true that the number of such groups with good reduction at all the valuations is finite? Okay, so this is an open question, and I think I'll just end here. Thank you. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? Okay, if there are no questions, let's thank the speaker again. And the next talk is at 12:15. Talk is at 12:15 in 10 minutes.
