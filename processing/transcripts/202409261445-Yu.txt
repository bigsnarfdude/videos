Yeah, thank you very much. And thank you for the introduction. And also, I want to thank the organizers for organizing this wonderful workshop and for the opportunity to speak here. Yeah, so I'm going to report on some work in progress with Bohan Fang, Chu Chung Morisa Liu, and Zhong Yuzhong. So maybe just as a very broad overview, this talk is going to be about This talk is going to be about this problem of all geneous mirror symmetry of toric collabial threefolds, but via topological recursion. So, I think also in terms of timing in this workshop, it's perfect because we just had this wonderful course and some lectures on topological recursion, as well as its, I guess, most recent developments. So, I will definitely be able to refer to the experts in the audience if you have questions about topological recursion. Optopological recursion. But just so I think it's also probably not a bad idea if we now turn to some specific example or application of this beautiful theory, which is this mirror symmetry problem. And so it's also appeared in Zoo's talk early this morning. So yeah, so maybe let me take an entry as an entry point, take the perspective of mirror symmetry and go back to maybe a very classical picture, which is the mirror symmetry for Which is the mirror symmetry for collaborative threefolds. So, this is a kind of a duality relation between dual families of collaborative threefolds. So, we have simplexity geometry on the one side, which I refer to as the A model here. And on the other side, we have complex geometry, which is the B model. So, on the A model here, we have this X, which is a symplectic. So, it's a Kavi R threefold, but we consider some symplectic. Threefold, but we consider some symptomatic structure parametrized by these Kayla parameters, which we call tau. And on the mirror side, we have a dual family or mirror family of collabial threefolds, and also a family of holomorphic three forms on them, parametrized by these complex parameters, which I'll denote by Q. And the mirror symmetry relation just predicts that under certain transformations of the parameters, or maybe also viewed as. Maybe also viewed as isomorphisms of this module spaces, which is called the mirror map. There are many, many different layers of relations or identifications of the two models. So, for example, we can look at variations of hot structures, which on the A model side come from maybe quantum cohomology or the Dubrovin connection. And on the B model side, we can speak about the Gauss-Manning connection or some other theories. Some other theories. So maybe that's one layer. And another way of thinking about this problem is through the lens of enumerated geometry. So on the A-model side, we can consider these Gromo-Witten invariants, which in some sense governs this quantum coherence structure. So near symmetry can be viewed as a certain tool to compute this inhibitory invariance. So traditionally, in Ginus0, for example, we can just consider a certain Just consider certain period integrals of these holomorphic three forms. And in higher genus, we also have lots of tools and lots of developments. So, for example, this BCOV theory that we mentioned this morning. And of course, if I want to continue this list, I will not be able to do it maybe in a few hours. And so I guess a common thing in this study is that usually the genus. That usually the genus zero picture is somewhat manageable, but if you try to go to higher genus, then it becomes quickly becomes quite challenging. And of course, there has been a long history and also several recent active research on this hyogenous problem. So, for example, in the classical quintic threefold case. So, for this talk, I'm going to focus on maybe a simpler case. Be a simpler case in that sense. So, we're going to focus on the case of toric Carbial threefolds on an A model, or this usually appears in some kind of local mirror symmetry problems. And so these are more combinatorial and more accessible, but especially for the purpose of studying hyogeneous mirror symmetry, we have also certain advantages, or fortunately, we have the following strategy. Have the following strategy. So, in this case, usually the B model is given by also some threefolds, but in this case, we can reduce the B model to a family of curves, which is much simpler to handle. And once we have these curves, we can run this very powerful machine of topological recursion. And that will provide us the way to access higher genus data, or in other words, it will provide the quantization of this genus zero B model. A zero B model. So essentially, these ideas are the main building blocks of this so-called remodeling conjecture. So yeah, so maybe I'll spend some more time on that. Oh, I should mention that, please feel free to stop me if you have any questions or comments. Yeah, so again, we have this Tauric data. And so on the B model side, for the mirror threefold, we can use Threefold, we can use the so-called Hori-Wafla mirror, so which I'll denote by this X check. So this is a hypersurface in C2 cross C star two, and it's given by this defining equation where we set UV is equal to some H. So here Uv are the C2 coordinates and XY are the C star two coordinates. And this H is a certain Laurent polynomial in XY. So it's decided by the Tauric data of By the toric data of x, and it's parametrized by this complex parameter q. So, I will not try to write down a general definition, but I will try to give some examples later. So, we have this threefold. And so the first idea that I mentioned is that we can do some kind of reduction in dimensions from 3D to 1D. So, in this case, we reduce this genus 0B model on the Horavafa mirror to just The Horobuffer mirror to just a family of curves. And it's actually pretty simple. So this curve is just defined by setting both u and v to zero. So we just consider zero is equal to h. So this is an affine curve in C star 2. So if you think about it, then this 3D Horvalfomir is realizable as a family of conic bundles. And this curve is precisely the locus where the bundle is. The locus where the bundle is degenerate. Okay, anyway, so we have this family of curves parametrized again by Q. And the second idea is that we use this Checkoff-oriented logical recursion invariance, which will produce for us this family of differentials omega Gn's. And we're just going to use them as the hierogeneous B model. So this is a proposal originally appeared in the work of Bouchard. In the work of Bouchard, Clan, Mourinho, and Paschetti. And so I think by now it's been a while by now, and it's already somewhat classical application of topological recursion. So I guess my job is today to try to describe this picture in more detail and also explain our kind of new twist in this story. Yeah, so this whole project. Yeah, so this whole proposal is on remodeling the B model. So now let's go back to this mirror symmetry picture. So we keep this A model data, but on the B model side, we'll just replace the B model data by this curve together with a certain one form, which is essentially our omega 0, 1. So it plays the role of some holomorphic, actually in this case, meromorphic volume form. And our goal now is to try to describe all geneous grommets. To describe arginous grommet invariance, which is this A-model problem in terms of this topological recursion invariance omega g n. And as Maxine mentioned in his lectures, so this is now a series of differentials, but in order to get some numerical invariance, we have to do some extra work. And here in this talk, we'll be talking about two particular ways where we can take these differentials. Where we can take these differentials and extract some information out of this, out of those. So we can, as usual, do local expansions of omega g n. And if we do them correctly or appropriately, we'll be able to recover the open-close Gomeritan variants. So this part is the content of the original BKMP proposal. And it's been solved by Einar Orinton and my collaborators, Feng Liu Zong. A few years back now. And the second way we can get numerical invariance is by performing Laplace transforms on the differentials, which is, I guess, also not new. And if we do that, then on this side, we'll be able to get the augenous descendant chromoid invariants. So, this is our, I guess, recent progress that I'll be trying to explain. Yeah, any questions? Yeah, any questions? Oh, this is the short name for a Bouchard Khanberry. I think it's maybe 2007 or 208, some time ago. Yeah, sorry, I didn't keep track of the dates, but yeah. So it's shortly after this check of Ina Orenton papers, I guess. Okay, so maybe I can start going into the details a little bit. So let's consider some simple toric geometry. So our A model here, as I mentioned, is this X, which is over the complex numbers, it's a Tauric Clavius threefold. So all this story can be applied to manifolds or overfolds, but just for simplicity, we're going to stay in a smooth case for this talk. Moose case for this talk. So, the simplest example is just C3. So, here I have a picture where you have these three complex coordinate axis. And associating to this picture, we will have two kinds of combinatorial data. One of them is called the torque graph. So this is in more detail. This is an image of this, or maybe this axis under the so-called moment map of a certain real tutorus, which is the real Calabiel tutor. Which is the real collabial tutorus that preserves the collabial form. So here we have just three legs or three edges attached to a single vertex, which is the origin. And if you consider the dual picture or the toric fan, this is just given by a single smooth three-dimensional fan. So I'm drawing this in a particular way. So you have, I guess, the three one cones. Three, one cones, and so on. So, this is a single three cone. So, this is the, I guess, the local building block, and we can try to glue some things like this together. So, we get some more examples. And so, for example, we can consider this resolved conifer, which is the total space of O minus 1 plus O minus 1 over P1. So, here we have three cones, and so we have two torus fixed points and these axes. Taurus fixed points and these axis. And another example is the KP2 example or local P2. So in this case, we have three charts and corresponding to three vertices and some edges like before. So more general examples of this can come from taking a canonical bundle of just a toric surface. And so the toric fan in And so the toric fan in this case is always going to be the cone over some polytope with some regular triangle triangulation. So in this case, this is the cone over this square. And we have this, in this case, the cone over this triangle. And a toric graph is just the dual graph of this triangulated polytope. Yeah, so here we want to make just a small assumption that this x is semi-projective, or in order. My projective, or in other words, is a GIT quotient, so that the mirror symmetry story will work better. And equivalently, if you want to think about this from the symplectic point of view, this is a symplectic quotient, or communatorially, it means that the support of the fan or maybe this polytope is convex. Yeah, so this is the A-model geometry, and just from this. Geometry, and just from this data, we can get a hold on the B model geometry or topology of the mirror curve. So, yeah, so the mirror curve, just as I mentioned before, is given by this equation where h is zero. So, instead of writing down the most general form of this Laurent polynomial, I just give this polynomial in these two examples that we have. So, in the case of this resolved conifer, in the case of this resolved conifer we have h is equal to x plus y plus one plus this term qxy so one way to think about this term is that so if you go back to this polytope and if you place this point at the origin then we have 001001 so that's the first three terms and this qxy corresponds to this one one lattice point and we put this complex parameter q here Q here. So, topologically, it's going to be kind of like a fattened version of this Tauric graph. So, we have this genus zero curve with four punctures corresponding to these four legs. Okay. And we can try to run the same thing for the second example, which is this KP2. So, here this equation is very similar instead that in the last term, we have qx inverse y inverse. x inverse y inverse and that should correspond to now this point which we can give coordinates minus one minus one so that's the exponents of the xy term yeah and and similarly sorry similarly uh the topology of the curve is also somehow uh can it can be read from the torque graph so we have now this genus one curve uh with three punctures corresponding to these three uh infinite letters These three infinite legs. Yeah, okay. So basically, the correspondence between the two pictures is that if you look at the tropicalization of this curve, then it's related to the toric graph, or maybe more precisely, it's an amoeba that's close to the toric graph. So, this has also been studied a very long time ago by this. Very long time ago, by this real algebraic curve community. And we have some quantities that can describe the topology. So, here, the genus of this mirror curve, which is this G here, it will correspond to the number of compact divisors in X, or this number of closed regions in, I guess, in a Tor graph. So in this case, we have genus zero because all the divisors are non-compact, but here we have this vertex, which corresponds to a compact device. Which corresponds to a compact divisor. So the genus is one. And also, we have some punctures on this curve. So this curve is not compact, but the punctures will be corresponding to the number of non-compact axis in X or the non-compact legs in the toric graph. So finally, we have this quantity N, which is the number of patches of CQ or in. Of CQ or in this pair of pens decomposition, which is the same as the number of torus fixed points in X or number of C3 charts in X. Or yeah, or another way to say this is this is the dimension of the cohomology of X over C. And these quantities are related by some equation. Okay, so now we have this data, so now we can try to run topological recursion on it. To run topological recursion of it, so I'll, yeah, so I'll first start on the B model side and we try to go back to the A model. So, at the first step, we know that we have to specify this 0, 1 data, or maybe equivalently this X and Y, or DX and DY. So, here we're going to do is to take a pair of parameters U1, U2, from this R2 plane minus the origin, and we consider this function x hat, which is This function x hat, which is minus u1 log x minus u2 log y. Yeah, so this is a meromorphic multivalue function on a mirror curve. And it's probably better to think about dx, which is now a meromorphic differential on the curve. And this x hat has exactly n simple ramification points, and one on each of the pair pen decompositions on CQ. On CQ. Yeah, so roughly speaking, we're in this very or the classical check of airline oriented situation or the classical TR situation. So I just want to mention at this point that later on these parameters will be viewed as certain kind of equivariant parameters of this collab DL2 torus. And the real part of this function can serve as a superpotential of a certain A superpotential of a certain equivalent Landau-Ginsberg model. So, yeah, so on the picture side, we can think about this real part of X hat as a projection of this curve onto the real line. So, this curve will be sort of the space for this algorithm model. And so, that's x hat. And for the y hat, we'll just take it to be minus log y over this u1. And so we'll just set omega 01 as u1. we'll just set omega 0 1 as usual to be y d y dx or y hat dx okay so so that's 0 1 and 0 2 is somehow standard so we take omega 0 2 to be this fundamental bidifferential of second kind or in other words this Bergman kernel on a compatification of the mirror curve which where we're just filling all the punctures Where we just fill in all the punctures. So, yeah, so as we've seen different times in this workshop, this is a symmetric meromorphic form on CQ bars squared. And it has a double pole along the diagonal with bi-residue one. So locally, in local coordinates, this is roughly speaking dz1, dz2 over z1 minus z2 squared plus some holomorphic term. So because here are So, because here our curve can have higher genus, so there is just a technical point where, in order to fix this omega 0, 2, we have to choose a certain Torrelli marking or a certain normalization, which means that we want to pick a symplectic basis of the compactified mirror curve. So, here we call them the A cycles 1 up to G, and also the B cycles. So, we choose these cycles such that the periods of omega. The periods of omega 01 along the A cycles will exactly give us the mirror maps, which I didn't explain in detail or write down. So basically, this is given by tau i, which has the asymptotics log qi plus some Laurent, sorry, some power series in Q. So this fixes the A cycles, and we pick the B cycles such that they form a symplectic basis, and we'll use the A cycles to normalize. The A cycles to normalize our omega 02 in a sense that basically the integration of omega 02 on A cycles are all zero. So, this is the way we've uniquely fixed this form. Okay, so yeah. So, I just want to say that this part is completely standard. And now we have this initial data, we can run this machine. So, in higher GN, we run the check of finite oriented logical equation on this. Orientological equation on this spectral curve, which is the topo C with x hat, y hat, and this omega 02. And the output of this powerful machine is this family of symmetric meromorphic forms, omega g n in this stable range. And moreover, we get also these meromorphic functions, which are called the free energy. So roughly speaking, they correspond to the n equals zero. correspond to the n equals zero case. And so they're more or less the residues of omega g1. So get this omega g's for an odd genus. So this is the B model data that we have and that we'll use as the B model for the mirror symmetry picture. And in this case, we're in this very nice semi-simple case. So we have this very powerful result by doing Barkov's. Result by Dunin-Barkovsky-Arnton charging and speeds, which is a graph sum formula for these differentials. So we can write omega g n as sum of gamma from this g g n. So this is a collection of decorated stable graphs with genus g and leaves. And over this graph, we'll just associate some weights, which is this WB, which is WB, which is some B model weights of the graphs, and we take this over a factor of the size of the automorphism group. Yeah, so this is a way of concretely writing down this omega g n in this way. And this can be used as certain quantization expression for this genus zero data, initial data. Yeah, so I guess roughly speaking you just have some vertices and some edges and some half edges. So maybe something like this. And the genus is like a number of loops. And we have, so these n leaves are some. And leaves are some outgoing half-edges that are not part of anything. So we have to decorate the vertices and edges in a certain way, which I will try not to explain. Yeah, yes, this is our setting is semi-simple. So we're just working on this Tauric case. So, yeah, so everything's, yeah. Right. Yeah, so I think this will be, so this point will come back when I talk about the A model. Okay, so this is our algorithm. So now let's go to the A model. So now let's go to the A model. And so, as I mentioned in the beginning, the purpose of this remodeling conjecture is to relate this topological recursion output to solve some problems in the Grom-Witten theory of X. So, here we want to consider both the open sector and the closed sector. So, for the open sector, we want to choose a certain Lagrangian as our boundary condition. So, here we will just consider the so-called Argonautic Walfa brains, which I did. Which I denote by this L. So, pictorially in C3, it looks like this. So, it's somewhere here. So, instead of giving the defining equations, I'll just mention some important properties. So, this Lagrangian is preserved under the action of this real Clabio II torrent, and it's a non-compact Lagrangian. Also, maybe I forgot to mention that RX is also non-compact, so it's kind of some local. Non-compact, so it's kind of some local geometry, and topologically, it's an R2 bundle over S1. So the base is maybe this S1. So it bounds a disk in this axis. So in fact, it intersects a unique axis in X, and we assume that this axis is non-compact. So in other words, this is some kind of an outer Lagrangian or it intersects outer Lag. Yes. So, yeah, or if you're familiar with this large n duality story or turn Simon's, then this Lagrangian will just correspond to the L naught under the conifer transition. Yeah. Yeah, so we assume that it intersects some non-compact lag. So on a toric graph, we just can mark this lag. And on the mirror curve, it will just correspond to a Curve, it will just correspond to a certain puncture on the curve. So here is this puncture. So the open grammar weight invariance will roughly speaking count stable maps from bordered Riemann surfaces to this pair XL. So something like this. So we have a domain, we have some curve of some genus, and then some number of boundary components. And then we just map this curve to this. map this curve to to this geometry and we require that these boundaries will land on this Lagrangian so uh yeah so I'll probably not try to give a precise technical definition and so we package all this invariance into some generating functions so here we have this f g n of xl so this packages invariance of genus g n with n boundary components and moreover we can also just And moreover, we can also just consider the closing variants, which are maps from borderless domains, so we do not have any borders. And we just, so this is the usual FG of our collabios 3-fold X. And so, yeah, so going back maybe to the discussion about semi-simplicity, so here we are in this generic semi-simple situation, and we also have this A-model graph sum. So this goes back to the Goes back to the, I guess, work of Gilenthal-Telemmer and classification and also by zone in the overflow case. So we can write this FGN also as a sum of indexed by the same set of graphs. And so the difference here is we change the weight of the graph by essentially the A-model data. So this WA. So the expression is completely parallel. And this is an expression which is the quantization of the G. Is the quantization of the Genesis0A model? Yeah, so now we are starting to have this parallel. And so then the theorem, which is the remodeling conjecture, is on a high level the following statement. So under the mirror map between A and B models, this Fg N, which is the generating function of open invariance, can be obtained from expansions of omega g n near actually just Near actually, just near this puncture that corresponds to the Lagrangian. So, in this example, again, we expand all these omega g n's near this puncture under some suitable local coordinate, which is some open coordinate. And so that's the open sector. And on the closed sector, this closed Gromwitten potential Fg can be obtained from the B model free energy omega G. So, this is, I guess, a manifestation of this philosophy that actually to get some statement on the closed sector, it really helps to also consider the open sector and taking a certain maybe limit or some limit. So, this is proved in a smooth case by Einar-Orington and the Oberfold case. Orange and the overflow case by Fang Liu Zong. And this is maybe about seven or eight years or maybe more already. So this is, yeah. So maybe just an outline of the proof and the proof exactly by relating this. So we want to relate these two quantities and we just do them by comparing the A and B model graph sums. So basically we want to match this W A with this W B for each of the graphs. Will be for each of the graphs. And in the back of the story, it's so these graph sums come from their basically their Fabinian structures on the two sides. And we extract this information from the Fabinian structures. So in this identification, we have to pay some special attention to these unstable cases. So especially the identification of lead term is given by the 0, 1 case. So this is the count from genus 0 domain with From genus zero domain with a single boundary, so it's a disk. Yeah, so maybe so it's just this. And so for this statement, we have to do some extra work, and this will actually appear as a building block in this general identification. So we need this separate disk mirror theorem, which roughly speaking relates F01 to omega 01. So this we have to do by hand before. To do by hand before, so this is done by Gwebbazaslo, Fanglio, and Fong Lio. And it's based on a genus zero toric mirror theorem. So underlying this all genus picture. So in a Tauric case, this is due to the work of these people, so Gibbon-Tau and Kohl-Corti-Iri-Tani zone for general orbit folds. And this is also studied from the perspective of Poisson maps by Chong, Chokun, Fonteny, and Kim. Choken functions in the queue. Yeah, so the big picture is that we just have these graph sums and we try to relate them. And at the fundamental level, we need some special ingredient in this unstable 0, 1 case. So this theme will come back when we go to the descendant Gromwyton picture. Any questions? Yeah, so now let's go back to maybe our plan. So, our plan with this remodeling conjecture is to get augenous invariance from topological recursion. And so far, we have considered this BKMP proposal, which is on this open-closed part. So, what I'll try to explain in the remaining of this talk is this second way of extracting numerical invariance. Numerical invariance by doing Laplace transforms on omega g n, and the output will be related to the descendant from within invariance on the A model side. So here, yeah, let's maybe define some more in immersive geometry. So here I want to define this descendant gromwaten invariance. So I guess this is also, maybe people don't need this definition already because it's classical. So here we choose So here we choose some invariants, and in this case, we can pick some equivariant insertions, gamma1 up to gamma n, and we insert them into this double bracket, which is a generating function of genus G n-pointed descendant invariance. So we take each gamma i over Zi plus psi i. So this pi i has appeared, I guess, all over in this workshop. These are the psi classes. Workshop, these are the side classes, and we have some formal variables these. Yeah, so if you expand this expression in terms of power series of z inverse, for example, then you get all possible numbers or all possible powers of psi. So this actually parametrizes all possible powers of descendant insertions. And also, we may have some additional primary insertions. So this is absorbed. So, this is absorbed in this double bracket notation, which I will not go into. So, similarly, this generating function can also have some A-model graph some formula, so completely parallel to this open-close picture. And in this case, the lead term is somehow different. So, in the case before, we have this lead term as this disk potential, but now we here the lead term is. Here the lead term is also the zero one case in this case, which is this one-pointed genus zero insertion or this one-pointed descendant potential. And our goal here is to obtain this all genus thing by, again, Laplace transform on the on the B model side. And one of our missions is to pick suitable cycles where we perform this Laplace transform. And that will be some kind of mirror symmetry state. Kind of mirror symmetry statement, which I'll try to explain. Okay, so yeah, so maybe now let's try, let me try to explain the realm of cycles that we consider. So because we're in this T-equivariant setting, we somehow want a T-equivariant B model as well. So the way we do that is to take, consider the certain cover of the mirror curve. So basically, the mirror curve before is an affine curve in C star 2. Is an affine curve in C star two. We just consider the exponential covering from C2, and we pull back this mirror curve to upstairs. So we have this C2, the Q, which is this Z2 covering mirror curve. So this Z2 is actually identified with the character lattice of our collaborative torus T prime. Okay, so on this cover now, our X. Our X hat now is actually a function, so it's well defined. And yeah, so as I mentioned before, we will consider the pair C tilde and X hat as some kind of T equivalent Landau-Ginsburg model. And this function is the superpotential of that model. And now naturally, we want to consider the group of relative one cycles for this Landau-Ginsberg model. So it's H1 of C tilde Q relative to The Q relative to the part where the real X is very large. Yes. U is some parameter we fixed before. It's a pair of real numbers. Yeah, so it depends on this choice, which I didn't write in the notation. Yes, so this is some extra choice. Yeah, you're right. So I just didn't put that in the notation. So I just, yeah. Yeah, so here, so here, this, you want U2 are really the equivalent parameters for the torus, but we can pick a certain choice of these parameters. Yeah, so we have this. Yeah, so we have this group of relative cycles, and then we can consider this Laplace transform of 0, 1, or also known as the oscillator integral in this case. So we integrate over e to the minus x set over some form of variable z along some cycles in this group. So this integral is defined. And this integrals will provide some kind of integral structure on a B model, which is some integral. On a B model, which is some integral structure in the solution space of, in this case, certain key equivalent p-card focus systems. Okay, so this is the cycle part. And on the A side, we'll have, we'll consider the following thing. So we consider some kind of k groups or equivalent k groups. But in this non-compact setting, we need some modifications. So in this case, we'll consider this K plus K group. I'll try to explain this later, but for now, this is some version of the covariant K-group. And we consider the so-called framing, K-group framing, or this gamma integral structure. So this is proposed, actually studied by many people, but for example, in the work of Iritani for the compact case. So taking a sheaf E, we will define a characteristic class kappa. Of characteristic class kappa of E, which is roughly speaking the product of some Z-modified turn character, and the gamma class of X, which is this characteristic class. And then we will insert this kappa of E into our 0, 1 potential, or so we get this kind of expression, which is also known as some quantum coherence central charge of this sheaf. So because this is roughly the pairing of the... Is roughly the pairing of this class with maybe the equivalent j function of x. So, this provides some integral structure on the A-model side now, maybe in a solution space of this quantum differential equations. Okay, so we have this ingredient, and our main result just says that there's an isomorphism, which we call mirror plus, or some mirror isomorphism. So, this goes from the K. So, this goes from the K group to this group of relative cycles, such that if you pick a certain number of classes or certain number of equivalent sheaths, and under this mirror cycle map, if you look at the G n descendant potential with these kappa insertions of this sheath, this is equal to Laplace transform of omega g n along this mirror cycle. Along this mirror cycle. So, this is multi-integral. And here we have, yeah, we have this exponential. It's in progress. Yeah, this is what I'm reporting on. Hopefully, it'll be 2024. It'll be 2025. Yeah, so this is like, yeah, so. Yeah, so maybe let me comment on this. So, this mirror map, so I'll try to give some explicit construction later. But this isomorphism basically can be viewed as an identification of the integral structures on the A and B model site. And similar to the original BKMP case, so this proof is again based on just comparing the Graphson formula. In the graphsum formulas on the two models. And in this case, so I mentioned before that the lead term is for this A model size is different. So the lead term is this 0, 1, so this one pointed genus 0 case. So this is something we have to prove by hand as the basis of this whole quantization picture. And so this statement is actually quite well studied before, and for example, the compact case by Example, the compact case by, for example, Iritani and Fong, and also many other people. Yeah, so for the remainder of the time, I'll try to maybe explain this K-group in a bit more detail and also the construction of this mirror cycles. But any questions? Oh, sorry, what do you mean by one dimensional? Yeah, so here I just mean this simplest topological k0, which is just the k group of the derived category of. K-group of the derived category of coherent sheaves, but we need some modified version, which I'll explain because we're in this non-compact setting. No, no, yeah, sorry. Yeah, so let me actually get to that point. Yeah, so we have this K plus. So this will count for certain T equivalent sheaves, but with bounded below support. So here, so the reason we needed Here, so the reason we need it is the following. So, it's the following picture. So, on this right side, we have this sort of Landau-Ginsburg model from the curve. And the cycles we consider are cycles relative to real part of X had been very large. So, maybe roughly in this picture, the cycles could end on these punctures. So, they sort of open to the right. And now, if we just consider an arbitrary T-equivalent sheaf on X, we'll A T recovery sheaf on X, we will not be able to find appropriate cycles. So we want to consider sheaves whose support is also bounded below. So we allow this support to be infinite on the right, but maybe we want to put a stop on the left. And so in this case, now we come to the, I guess, the choice of these equivariant parameters. So if we fix these parameters appropriately or if we fix their ratio appropriately, we get Appropriately, we get some one subtorus of the Carbiot 2 torus, and that will give us a moment map, which is now a map from X to also the real line. So, this is the mu here. So, we want now just to consider sheaves whose support is bounded below under this moment map. So, roughly speaking, the molen map should be some analog of the superpotential on a model site. Yeah, so to be more precise, this K plus. More precise, this K plus is the Gaussian group of a subcategory of the boundary driver category of T-equivalent coherent sheaves on X, whose support or whose so these are complexes and we want to have make their cohomology sheaves have support bounded below under this this mu. So, this is a certain generalization of some previous work of Barrows. Previous work of Borisov and Harja on K-groups with certain compact support. So, again, in this case, our X is non-compact. And so, they propose that the appropriate dual for the usual K-group in this case is to just consider some KC. And we can modify their construction a little bit to have just one-sided support. So, this is the group we consider. And the simple lemma is that this group is generated. Lemma is that this group is generated by the classes of the T-equivalent line bundles on toric divisors and curves that are bounded below under this moment map. So in this case, this is the KP2 case. So we will just consider she's basically supported on this compact divisor as well as this divisor. So this divisor is not compact, but it's mounted below. So this is okay. And basically, this K group is the group of sheaves. This K-group is the group of sheaves with support in this red region. So, to consider, to construct this mirror isomorphism, we'll just try to construct mirror cycles of these generators, which are structure shapes of such torus orbits with some twists by equivalent line bundles. So, I'll just try to explain how this construction is done for the case of Tauric divisors and the Tauric devices and the case of curve is similar. So, yeah, so maybe, for example, we want to construct the mirror cycle to structure sheaf of this divisor with some twists possibly. And so the intuition is exactly from the toric geometry, or you can also say from SYZ mirror symmetry, or all these other more combinatorial constructions. So basically, So basically, we go back to the very beginning of all this picture. So, the torque graph of X, which is this blue one-dimensional CW complex, this is related to the choptarization of this curve. So this curve is again some fetted version of this graph. And here, the C3 charts of X, or equivalently, the Victor's fixed points of X are in correspondence with the pair. Are in correspondence with the pair-pens decomposition of the mirror curve. So we will just try to run this construction locally and then eventually patch all these cycles on the local patches. So you get some global cycle. Yeah, so first we look at this picture in, or we look at this local picture at a vertex, which means that on X, we're just considering a single C3 chart. So for example, we have this vertex with three legs. We have this vertex with three legs, and they have some torus weights. So we have we denote them by w1, w2. And on the mirror side, it will correspond to a pair of pants on the mirror curve. So for example, like this. Oh, is there a... Okay. Yeah, so a pair of pants like this. And now let's try to construct the cycle for, let's say, this device, which is bounded below. So the proposal. So, the proposal is that we just look at this cycle, which we call little gamma. And so, this, so, if you look at the tropicalization of this curve, the amoeba is basically the flattened version of this picture, and this gamma is one of the boundary components. So, we just take this cycle. And so, the proposal is that this cycle exactly works for our purposes. So, if we take some lift, which we So, if we take some lift, which we call big gamma, of this cycle to the curve upstairs, and we compute the Laplace transform of omega 0, 1, we get this expression where we have some prefactors and this triple gamma function. So these gammas are in terms of these torus weights. So, this exactly matches the restriction of the central charge of our structure shape. Charge of our structure shape with some twist to this vertex. So, roughly speaking, this is where this gamma class insertion that we put on the curve come into place. So, that matches this Laplace transform oscillator integral. And here we have some freedom. So, we have these numbers A and B controlling sort of the pre-factor. And we have exactly Z2 choices of such. So, here we have. Choices of such. So here we have Z2 choices of the lift because this cover is a Z2 covering. And basically, it corresponds to different choices where the cycles have constant imaginary parts A and B. So those choices correspond to the Z2 choices of T quadrant line bundles that we can use to twist O of T, or equivalently the Z2 choices of T prime characters at this vertex. So these choices will basically So, these choices will basically match up under the C quality. Sorry, could you? Yeah. So, these are the T prime weights of this legs. Oh, you don't see this on the mirror curve, but they appear in this X hat, which is related to your earlier questions. Yeah, so in general, so this is a vertex in a big picture. So this could be linear combinations of the U's depending on the particular position or the direction of this chart. Yeah. Yeah, if you just put U and if you just consider. Yeah, if you just put U and if you just consider a single C three, then these are just the U's. Yeah, so this is the local picture. And so the last thing we want to do is just try to glue these local pictures together. So we go back to the global picture and let's say we want to construct the mirror cycle for this D. Now, again, with some possible twists. Now, again, with some possible twist by some parent line models L. So, the thing we do is exactly just to patch all these local cycles. So, here we have this KP2 example, and this D is this divisor. So it contains two torus fixed points, which correspond to two C3 charts. And on the mirror side, on the curve, we have this pair of pants decomposition, and you'll touch these two pairs of pants, which correspond. Paths which correspond to the two fixed points. Okay, so on each of these charts, we take these curves that we just constructed, so gamma one and gamma two, and of course some lifts of them, and we just try to glue them together into a global cycle on this mirror curve. So, the reason why this works or this process is valid is the following reason. So, here we have this global twist by some key. Have this global twist by some key equivalent line bundle. But this line bundle is determined by the restrictions to all the vertices. So it's determined by the key prime characters after you restrict to p1 and p2. And the restrictions will have some compatibility condition. Basically, given by this edge that connects these vertices. Yeah, so the characters are not randomly chosen at the vertices. And so locally, if we do. And so, locally, if we do this cycle construction, then this compatibility condition will ensure that on the lift, the cycles can be exactly glued together. So, yeah, because the characters are compatible and on the lift, they'll appear sort of on the correct chart or in a cover. Yeah, so at the end, we just get some global cycle that works for the That works for this mirror construction. So, this process, by doing this process, we can get all the mirror cycles of the twist of divisors. And completely similarly, we can do the things for curves. So maybe let me just. So, if we want to consider maybe this curve corresponding to this ray, so very roughly speaking, we just take a certain double cover of this edge. This edge. So maybe we have a cycle going on the top and then going back on the bottom. And we also glue those constructions in the end. So this is how we get this explicit mirror plus. And we show that it's an isomorphism. So it's a match of integral structures. And so that, yeah, so that's like the only part of the proof that I want to explain. Oh, so the compatibility condition is that, so this picture is downstairs, but we want to construct cycles on the Z2 cover. So we want to make sure that, for example, when we come to this point, we appear at the same point on the cover so we can continue in the next touch. In the next patch. So if we don't, so this compatibility condition basically makes sure of that point. So we are able to continue this. So we don't have to do any jumps on the cover. What do you mean by numerically? Yeah, it's an explicit equation that I was too lazy to write down. So basically, the difference of the two characters have to be. If you take the pairing with the torque data around this edge, then it should be zero, something like that. Yeah, it's explicit and complex. Yeah, it's explicit and combinatorial, but I just didn't write it down. Yeah, and that's the same equation that guarantees the gluing on the curves. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's my that is all I want to say, and thank you for listening.
