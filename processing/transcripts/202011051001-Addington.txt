It's a pleasure to welcome Nick Addington from Oregon, who's going to tell us about categorical SL2 actions on some moduli spaces of sheaves. Nick. All right. Thanks, Matt. Thanks for the invitation. Thank you all for showing up on this fourth day. It's lovely to see everybody, even if it's not, you know, what it would be. This is joint with my student Ryan Takahashi, and you see the archive number is. And you see the archive number is there, although we need to revise the intro because Nakajima wrote to us and sent us a bunch of great references to his work that somehow we didn't know. So I'm hoping to do that soon. And there's the outline. First, I'll talk about spherical twists giving you stratified Mukai flops between moduli spaces. Then I'll talk about some SL2 actions and state the theorem. Then I'm going to do a long and beautiful geometric example and then maybe say a word about what goes into the proof. The proof, sort of the techniques that may interest you. And then at the end, I'll talk about some possible future directions. And this software, by the way, is Daniel Ruse exernal. So we're trying to keep it mirror symmetry here. It's the way I teach. We'll see if it works for this format. So I'm all day, S is going to be a K3 surface. A K3 surface of Picard rank one generated by an ample line bundle H. So if you throw a dart at the moduli space of polarized K3 surfaces, you expect it to hit such a K3 surface. And then we can talk about, you've heard, well, many of you already know, and the rest of you have heard this week about the spherical twist around OX. Uh, around OS, the around the trivial line bundle, which is an equivalence from the derived category of coherent sheaves on S to itself. And it sends a sheaf F or a complex F. Well, you have the cohomology of, well, sorry. You take OS tensor the cohomology of F and you have an evaluation map. Have an evaluation map to f itself, and you take the comb of that. Or, as Isette told you, you can also think about the ideal sheaf of the diagonal as a Fourier Mukai kernel. And this is an equivalence that was first brought in by Mukai under the name reflection functor, and then Seidel and Thomas. And then Seidel and Thomas worked on it, and many people since. And the second ingredient is going to be a moduli space of sheaves on S. So I'm going to take the moduli space of sheaves of rank R, first turn class, sorry, first turn class is going to be H. And then I'm going to use Mukai vector. So this is the rank. This is the first churn class. This is the first churn class, and this is some repackaging of the second churn class. And what you need to know about it, let's see, is that the Euler characteristic of a sheaf is R plus S, the holomorphic Euler characteristic. And as we know and love, this is a compact hyperkaler manifold. Hypercalor manifold. It's smooth. There are only stable sheaves. It's very well studied. And I want to talk about the Brill-Nutter stratification of this moduli space. So you heard a little bit about the Brill-Nutter question for moduli spaces of sheaves on K3s from Isette last time, but that was when the first churning class was big. First churn class was big, then it becomes a hard problem that he's got some results on. When the first churn class is just one times h, then the whole thing was worked out by Markman and Yoshioka 20 years ago. And so I'm going to tell you that story right now. So for this talk, let's suppose that the Euler characteristic is greater than or equal to zero. In the paper, we Is greater than or equal to zero. In the paper, we can deal with negative as well. Then a generic sheaf in your moduli space has H0 is going to be chi, which is r plus s. As I said, H1 is going to vanish, and H2 vanishes because of stability. This is actually always. But then it may jump on some closed subset of the moduli space. This cohomology may jump first to H1, H0 could become chi plus 1, and H1 could become 1, chi plus 2, and 2, etc. So this closed set where the cohomology jumps, I'm going to call the Brillnutter locus. Nutter locus inside the moduli space, and it has some strata. Smaller and smaller closed sets as it as the cohomology jumps more and more. And as I said, Markman and Yoshioka about 99 working independently showed that this jumping. Working independently showed that this jumping happens. There is some expected codimension, and everything happens as you expect it in the expected codimension. Now, so I talked about the spherical twist, and I talked about this moduli space, and what do they have to do with each other? So what does the spherical twist around? The spherical twist around O do? Well, I'm going to talk about two cases. So if zero is, if chi is between zero and r, so in other, remember chi was r plus s, so that's just saying that s is less than or equal to zero. Then for a generic sheaf in my moduli space, whoops, module, moduli space. Modulized space. The twist around O of F is the co-kernel of the map that I'm about to write. So it has chi, the thing has chi-sections, I said, and you get an evaluation and no higher cohomology. So you get an evaluation map from there to F, and it's injective, Markman shows, and you take this co-kernel. Take this co-curl. And this is in the moduli space. Markman shows, and I think Yoshio here shows it as well. The moduli space of sheaf. It's a stable sheaf is my point. And the Mukai vector has to be this. Sorry, S minus chi. So that's also known as the moduli space of minus SH minus R. On the other hand, if F is in the Brillnutter locus inside of M, then the twist around the spherical twist, this cone that we talked about, is either an unstable sheaf or a two-term complex. So we get a birational map from our original moduli space to this other moduli space that's well defined away from this, you know, when the cohomology hasn't jumped. That's where it's well defined. And I should also maybe I want to belabor this just for a second. If chi is greater than or equal to r, so in other words, So, in other words, s is greater than or equal to zero. And I go into this detail just because it'll be important in the example. And the example is really beautiful. Sorry, this is an R. For a generic F, you still have O chi going to F, but now should be strictly greater than R. So now you have some kernel here and some co-kernel of that evaluation map. And so the twist, the cone, twist around O of F has H minus 1 is that kernel, which is a vector bundle, and H0 is the co-kernel, which has finite support. So it's not a sheaf. Chief in general, but the twist around: oh, if I take the dual, maybe I better do this on the next page. So it's not a sheaf, but if I take the dual and shift it by one, this is. It by one, this is a stable sheaf in. Well, it's going to be M. Let me get the numbers right. Chi minus R H chi minus S, also known as M of R, sorry, S H R. And if this And if this right, so either way, you get TO gives a birational map from this M, which was M of R H S to M of either minus S H R or M of minus S minus S. M of minus R S H R depending on the sine of the sine of S and I guess in more modern language you could you could think of this as some wall crossing within the moduli space of Bridgeland stability conditions as Isette alluded to last time. And it might be an interesting project to sort of think about other wall crossings and what can be said there. And let me say if there's only one Brillnitter stratum, so if the cohomology of the sheaves jumps once but not twice, then this is a Mukai flop. And if there's more. And if there's more than one, then it's what's called a stratified Muccai flop. And Markman, in this 20-year-old paper, studied the sort of the geometry of the stratified Mukai flop in a lot of detail. And Yoshioka, in his paper, he also In his paper, he also allows a twist around some other spherical vector bundle other than O. We could do all that, but it sort of to allow a different spherical vector bundle just makes makes all the notation heavier. So we stick to O. And I'll say there's an example soon. Hey, Nick, can I ask a question? Please. So what's the generic by right? The generic birational transformation for one of these wall crossings is it is it a stratified Macai flop or is it like some postet stratified Machi flop? I think you'd have to ask Byron McCree for that. That's I'm I'm I feel like well the most basic birational map between two hypercaleers is a Mukai flop, and so I think that's what you expect to find most of the time. Once you're into things more Once you're into things more fancy than that, I wouldn't like to say. Yeah. Yeah, I shouldn't speak for Emmanuelle, but I remember having a conversation where it was some type of post-set stratified thing where. Right. And I should say that the hypothesis that the Picard rank is one here is really doing a lot of work. The birational maps become much more complicated when that doesn't happen. Okay. Thank you. Okay. So I said stratified multiple. Okay, so I said stratified Mukai flop. So the local model of a stratified Mukai flop is something that's well known to representation theorists. There's a map from T star of the Grossmannian Kn to the cotangent bundle of the dual Grossmannian n minus Kn. And they're both resolutions of some. And they're both resolutions of some nilpotent orbit closure. I'm not great at saying those words. But that's the local model. And our starting point, which is not the beginning of the literature, but it's how we got into it, was a series of papers by Kautis. Let's see if I can work on my handwriting. Kautis Kamnitzer. Chemnitzer and Likata in 2009, they introduced the notion of a geometric categorical SL2 action, which in particular gives you back like one of the things they proved. Gives you back, like one of the things they proved is that it gives you a an ordinary categorical SL2 action in the sense of Roukier and his people. But of a particularly nice kind. And their example. Nick. Yes. And what is the particular property of geometric categorical classical action? Yeah, maybe I'll come to this later. I'll come to this later. Here, let me say one more word and then try to answer your question. So, the weight spaces are, you take the derived category of the cotangent bundle of Grassmannian various numbers n, and I'm going to try to be fancy here and copy and paste so I don't have to write many times. Zero n. 0n and then 1n all the way, you know, at some point in here, you have drive category across money and Kn if I had a huge board, my life would be better n minus k, and then at the end, so you have this finite sequence of code of Of non-compact hyperkalar manifolds. And then, so maybe to answer Sasha's question, you have you need some raising and lowering operators. So at each step, you have some correspondence and some line bundle on it. And the functors, you pull up to the correspondence and push down. They're tensor with the line bundle and push down. So you have some raising operators E and some lowering operators F, which are more or less. F, which are more or less adjoint to the E's. And what's special about there, right? And there are many compatibilities between these E's and F's, but you know, you have some divided power things when you go more than one step. So there's a lot of data with some. And how does H act? Yeah, so, oh, this is weight minus n minus n plus two. minus n plus 2 minus n plus 2k n minus 2k and wait n. So you categorify n by acting with the by tensoring with the cohomology of p n minus 1. That's what h looks like. And then what's special about their example is rather than getting whatever compatibilities they need as isomorphisms Compatibilities they need as isomorphisms of complexes, they really get them just on the level of cohomology. And then they have some one-parameter deformation of all their spaces. And in that direction, the SL2 machinery does not deform. And so this allows them to show that all their complexes are formal, and so that isomorphism on the level of cohomology was good enough. This sort of borrowed from. Borrowed from Seidel and Thomas's idea that a Pn object is a hyperplane section of a spherical object. And so that's their example. And as a corollary, I'll say a little more about that later. Well, not only do you get an SL2 action on the ground. Get an SL2 action on the Grotonik group as you expect, but you get an equivalence from the derived category of between these two guys that are related by Mukai Flaw. Right, and the equivalence is not just the graph of the birational map. Not just the graph of the birational map, but there's sort of you take the k-step correspondence from this one to that, and then you go also down one and up k plus one, down two and up k plus two, and you make some big complex out of these. But it just comes out of their out of their definition that you get an equivalence like this, and they really tell you exactly what it is. Can I ask one more question? That equivalence is strongly non-unique in their construction, right? Because they have to totally. Because they have to totalize some convolution, and there's um the the convolution might turn out to be you're always surprised that convolutions turn out to be unique more often than you think they will. But they have a lot of flex, like they choose some line bundles on these correspondences, and there are many, many possible correct choices. Um, so there's certainly some non-uniqueness there, right? But I think there's a comparison that Kaudas did with. A comparison that Kaudas did with Kalamata's paper. The kernel they get is not the kernel that Kalamata gets in the case of G24. And that's possible. The difference was the choice of convolution at the end of the complex, if I remember correctly. You could be right. You could be right. Sorry, let me try to come to my own theorem before it's going to be a problem. Someone's fine. No, no, no. Before I mention our work, I should say a work about Nakajima. So Nakajima many years before, well, the cotangent bundle of your Grossmanian is a Nakajima quiver variety, one of the simplest ones. And so you get an affine SL2 action. Two action, and I scarcely know what affine means on the direct sum of some cohomologies of your Gross Mannins. As you get an affine Lie algebra action on cohomology of any, I believe, set of Nakajima quiver varieties suitably chosen. And then also him in 2003, he had a little paper which. 2003, he had a little paper which languishes in some conference proceedings, you know, not as well known as it should be, but it's a beautiful paper. So by analogy with quiver varieties, he gets an SL2 action on the cohomology of some moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces. On K3 surfaces. And then Yoshioka in 07, he allows several spherical objects in an ADE configuration. Let me say spherical vector bundles. Vector bundles in an ADE configuration. And from that, he gets a fancier Lie algebra acting on the cohomology of some moduli spaces. And I should say it's a direct sum over suitably chosen Mukai vectors. Some over suitably chosen Mukai vectors. We actually didn't know these papers when our paper came out, and then Nakajima wrote to me. And I wish I'd known them a lot earlier because they could have saved us a lot of trouble. So here's our theorem. Let me leave that there so where you can see it. So the theorem, this is me and not Richard Thomas, but Ryan Takahashi. We construct. We construct a geometric categorical SL2 action satisfying all their axioms on the following moduli. So we have the derived category of this moduli space RHS that you saw before. And then that's in weight chi, which was R plus S. r plus one hs plus one and so on and in the other direction d of m of r minus one hs minus one and so on to the left and this is just like with the grassmannians this is a finite sequence of hyperkaler manifolds because eventually those moduli spaces become empty when you go far to the left or far to the right so this is in weight So this is in weight chi plus 2, weight chi minus 2. And as a corollary, so I'll say more about that in a second. As a corollary, you get an equivalence between these two things related by a stratified Machai flop between M of R A. chi flop between M of R H S and the derived category of M of either minus S H minus R or D of M of S H R depending on the sign. This was if S is less than or equal to zero. I should say there's a slightly picky thing where when these ranks become negative off to the left, Become negative off to the left, then you make that switch that I described earlier. So you could compare this. Dan Helpern-Leisner, of course, has been announcing for many years, and finally, his paper came out saying that any two moduli spaces of sheaves that are on a K3 surface that are birational, that they're derived equivalent. So, in some sense, you knew this from him, but the method is very different. And this gives you. And this gives you, like, you really see what the equivalence is. It's this convolution that Countess describes, Kautus et al. And, you know, we had Barbara Covey's talk yesterday about flop-flop functors, and I would love to, the flop-flop auto-equivalences. So I would love to know something about when you do this flop equivalence and go back, is there some spherical functor story there? I would love to understand that. That Nick? Yes. And what is the analog of primitive part of representation, of a silt representation here? Yeah, I guess it's the right, because the raising functors are not fully faithful in general. Fully faithful in general. Sort of the first raising functor kind of is sometimes a p functor. So does that mean that they're faithful? Nick, did you say p functor? Yeah, sometimes the first, like the leftmost raising operation is a p functor. And the leftmost space is just a point, right? It depends. It depends. It depends. Sometimes it's just in the example that I'll do, it's just a point, but it could be a bigger, it could be a modulized space where the real neutral locus is empty. Yeah. And that does happen. So you say it's sometimes a p-n functor, but do you have examples where it's not? No, you're right. You're right. It's always a p. Where it's not, no, you're right, you're right, it's always a pn function. It's always just you have a pn bundle and then you include it as a coisotropic. Yeah, I think it should always be a pn functor and then so to sorry, I guess the two-step raising operators are not usually thank you. Yeah, so the first one is always a p-functor and then the next one is fancier. Anything else while I'm stopped? Okay, now I want to spend time on a geometric example. On a geometric example. And I might spend a long time on this example because I really love it. And it's what we came here to do is talk about geometry, right? Nick, one more question. Yes. So if we follow the analogy with representations of a CL2, then the second leftmost category should be split in two parts. One coming In two parts, one coming from the leftmost, and the second, I mean, if you restrict the raising operation to the second part, it should be again a PN functor, right? Because it's like, yeah, I mean, I agree. There should be something interesting to say that I haven't thought hard about it. I mean, of course, it's not going to be like a semi-orthogonal decomposition, right? Because I mean, it's hypercolor. It can't have. Right. Have right, um, but still, I mean, it would be, I think it would be interesting to understand the structure that arises on on each particular category. Yeah, I agree. That that would be that would be a good project if someone wants to think about it. Um, I guess sort of the kernel of the lowering operator should be then in like the next raising operator should act really nicely on it. I agree. Nicely on it. I agree. Maybe kernel is a bit naive, so maybe you need to consider something a bit more fancy, but yeah. Okay, so here's my example. I'm going to take a K3 surface of degree 10. So if you know, then you know, then S is obtained as the Grossmannian 2,5 with its Plucker embedding in. 2.5 with its Plucker embedding in P9, intersected with three hyperplanes and a quadric. So probably you assume it's Brill Notre General, right? Yes. Yeah, the Picard group is generated by H. And so H embeds S into P6, which is just the P9 from the Pluker embedding is the intersection of the three hyperplanes. And let's see how my board technique. Let's see how my board technique goes. You know, some of you were at this conference in Stony Brook in the middle of Superstorm Sandy, where we were giving talks on a flip chart. Somehow every conference is like this now. You're on this little tiny screen. So I'm going to look at the moduli space of sheaves of rank one, first churn class H and S equals zero. And there's that's supposed to have a Mukai flop to. That's supposed to have a Mukai flop to m of 0h minus 1. And then there will be more. I could go this way: m of 2h1. And there's only one more thing in that direction, but I'm not going to talk in that direction. Minus 1h minus 2. And we saw earlier that we should replace that really with m of 1h2. And the last one is. And the last one is m of minus 2h minus 3, or really m of 2h3. And what are all these? Well, this thing is the Hilbert scheme of six points on S, and the map sends a length six subscheme C to the ideal sheaf of C twisted by H. Ed, is this visible? Ed, is this visible or is it too small? Yeah, that's fine. That's all right, okay. And this one is a, do I want to say this now? This is a Boville-Maucai integrable system. So its general element is Is generally you have a degree four line bundle on a curve C, which is my surface cut with a hyperplane. So I want to look at this space here, and I want to look at its Brillnetra stratification. And sorry, I should say we're going to get a birational map between these two, and then the other three that I've got in green are also. The other three that I've got in green are also going to be very interesting. So, what's the Brillnetter stratification of Hilb6 of S, which I said was M of 1H0? Well, generically, generically, six points. Generically, six points, points in S, they span a P5. So I have my surface. Here's S, I have six points on it, and they're going to span a P5 in this ambient space P6. They're going to span a hyperplane. And that corresponds to sections of the ideal sheaf of C twisted by H. Twisted by H, there's only one hyperplane that contains it, right? It's only one section. And then what happens? So the spherical twist, twist around O is going to send this ideal sheaf to, well, I have a section of it, and I take the co-kernel, which is, when you sit with it for a minute, it's the canonical bundle of C by minus. Of c by minus psi, where c is the curve. Oh, sorry, where c is your surface cut with this hyperplane. So maybe I'll try to draw it. Let's see. It's actually a curve of genus six. Beautiful. Yeah, the geometry or the drawing? The uh well, yeah, so this is this is okay. So, this is due to um Boville, actually, this by or I don't know who wrote it down for who the oldest reference I know for this example for this birational map is a paper of Beauville. But, but, but, but, um, oh, and I should say. Oh, and I should say you can resolve that. Well, in codimension two, within that Hilbert scheme, they only span the six points only span a P4. And so there, this birational map is going to be undefined, but you can resolve. map is going to be undefined but you can resolve it by by taking pairs a sheaf in your moduli space and just mark a line in h0 of f and that will map here and here and that's the graph of your birational map but what can i do if my six points only span a p4 um well then Well, then, well, then the spherical twist around O. How's my time doing? I do want to, I love this. I'm going to spend time on it. The spherical twist around O, well, I have a map from now O squared. No, sorry, that's not the right thing to do. I have two sections of this thing, and so there must be some curves. And so there must be some kernel, which you figure out is O of minus H, and there must be some co-kernel, which is typically going to be O of four points. And so if I take the cone of this evaluation map, that's a complex, not a sheaf. But if I take its dual and shift by one, you might not be surprised to hear that it's actually the ideal sheaf of four points. Of four points twisted by h, and that gives you that's this moduli space here is Hilb 4. Nick, but in the spherical twist, you also need to take into account H1. Yeah, this is why I'm saying it's not the spherical twist, it's just the cone on the evaluation map where you ignore H1. Okay, yeah. And the H1 was. Then the H1 would allow you to go the other way because the H1 gives you some extension by O, and then you go this way. And then the spherical twist turns, gives you a birational map between this Hilbert scheme and this moduli space of rank two sheaves, in fact, which is a Mukai flop. There's more detail than I can do now, so I'm going to try to choose my details carefully. Of course, what are the four points? What are the four points? The K3 surface intersected with this codimension two linear space. It's a K3 surface of degree 10, so it's 10 points. And you have six, and you take the other four. And the intersection can't be one-dimensional because of Picard one assumption, right? Exactly, exactly. So I have some other correspondence here, which is. Here, which is pairs a sheaf f and a two-dimensional subspace of h0. And I should say that maybe I'm running out of space to write it. Oh, sorry, trying to get too fancy. I have a sheaf F and a two-dimensional subspace of H0. H0 and going this way it resolves this way it resolves the Brillno it resolves the Brillnitter locus and going this way it's generically a P2 bundle because if you have four points how many ways can they sit like they span a four points should span a P3 and how many And how many ways can I put a P4 around that? There's a P2 worth of ways to do that. Sorry, so this is generically a P2 bundle. And then I want to talk about one more stratum because in codimension three, the six points span only a P2. Span only a P2, sorry, a P3. Sorry, co-dimension 6, thank you. And so you have three sections of the ideal sheaf, and it turns out that it has to generate. And the kernel is some rank two. Is some rank two vector bundle, and it's not too hard to guess that it's sorry, that it's S, where S is the tautological bundle. Maybe S was a bad choice because S is my surface. I'm going to call it T because T is my tautological bundle on Grossmannian 2, 5, restricted to my K3. And all right, so I also have some correspondence here. So this is a point. This M2H3 is a point corresponding to just the dual of that tautological bundle. And you have a correspondence here that's an isomorphism onto the smallest Brillnüter stratum. And then here. And then here it's a so this is injective this way, and this is just a Gross Mannian actually 3, 5. Because going back the other way, you want three-dimensional subspaces of H0 of T star, and that's five-dimensional. So, okay, this is a lot of detail, but they're very beautiful details. And if you like this kind of thing, there's more in the paper and you can see. In the paper, and you can sit with it. I said that the local model of this stratified Mukai flop was just something with the cotangent bundle of Grassmannian 3,5. And sure enough, this Grass-Mannian 3,5 sits in here as a Lagrangian. And so locally near that Gross-Mannian 3,5, you have, it looks like it's a cotangent bundle. And that's what this stratified Mukaiflop is. Okay, there's a there's a yeah, there are more details in the paper, or you can work them out yourself. Or really, just if you choose any random numbers for the degree of your K3 surface and your Mu Chai vector to start with, I promise that you'll have just as much fun. But that's the geometric flavor of this kind of thing and the analysis of the real nature stratification and the shape of the flop. Any more questions? Okay. And what is the leftmost correspondence between the leftmost space and the second leftmost? So the very leftmost space over here is M of 3H2, which you might guess is the tautological quotient bundle. And this is a point. Yeah, you mentioned that. Right. You mentioned that. Right. And so it's just the longest correspondence is the tautological sequence from T to O to the 5 to Q. This one from here to here is you get a Lagrangian P4 in Hilb4 and you do the Mukai flop of it to get to this M of 2H1. No, no, no. I mean between M2H1. I mean between M2H3 and M1H2. Ah, oh, yeah. So you just pick, you choose a section of the tangent bundle, or sorry, not of the tangent bundle, of the dual of the top. You choose a section of T star. Okay. And its co-kernel gives you the ideal sheaf of four points. It's like O to T star. It's like that. So, this is a, yeah, this is this is just a P4, right? Because you don't get any, like, C2 of the tautological bundle is four. And so, yeah. Let me, I encourage you to play with it. It's also in the paper. Yeah, thanks. Yeah. And this is precisely an example of. An example of PN functor. Yes. Yeah. Well, it's just a Lagrangian PN before, but you could get other examples that are nice PN functors. So you also have Grossmannian functors in the picture, right? I guess. I guess. I don't know as much about Grossmanian functors as I could. Yeah, there's this could be worth studying. This example could be just the source of. Examples could be just the source of, I mean, which would allow to define them properly. Yeah, yes, I agree. Yeah, you can really get, as maybe the point is, if you're looking for examples for these definitions, then you can really get your hands on them in this setting. So let me say a word about what goes into the construction, not a lot of detail, and then a word about Not a lot of detail, and then a word about open directions. So, ingredients in the construction. So, maybe without writing more, well, you have these spaces, derived category of M of R H S. Well, let me not write the derived category. M of R H S and then M of some R plus T H S plus T and you can go back and forth. There are some correspondences, which we found these correspondences inspired by Kautus Kamnitzer and Lakata, but they turn out to be the same as Nakajima's. And in one direction, you mark a T-dimensional. In one direction, you mark a t-dimensional subspace of h0, and in the other direction, you mark a t-dimensional quotient of h1, and it's a lot of fun. Then you need line bundles, right? So the correspondences are like the ones I was showing you before. You need some well-chosen line bundles. Line bundles on the correspondences. And this is the thing that when you're just acting on cohomology, you don't have to worry about. And when you're acting on derived categories, somehow it absorbs all your energy. You know, Caudis is the master of this kind of thing, but we managed to work it out in this case. Then there are some. Are some so there you do some work then you check some easy conditions Which I'm going to omit it omit things like the part part of Kaudis Kamitzer and Lakata's definition is like that every all your all your Fourier Mukai kernels should be sheaves and their support should satisfy some conditions and that you're raising operators and you're looking That your raising operators and your lowering operators are adjoint up to a shift, and that's all easy. Then you have two sort of medium-hard conditions. So, for example, if I do, if I do, if this is, say, R steps, and no, this is a bad choice. Let's say that this was M steps. Let's say that this was m steps, t steps. Uh, t steps, you got it, t steps, and this is t prime steps. Then you could, you could do, you could raise like this, and like that, you have some divided power. Raising operator divided power kind of thing and then raise t prime steps. This is the same as if you went all the way plus t prime tensor the cohomology of the Grassmannian T plus T prime. So, if it's like two steps, you're just saying e squared is e divided two times two. And I'm telling you this because there's a kind of interesting cohomology and base change thing that happens. If I call this map F and this map G, and up here I put the fiber product, and here F tilde and G tilde. And then this, there's a map. Then, this, there's a map here that's a Grassmannian bundle. It's this Grassmannian. And like, if I look at G upper star, F lower star, as I go around this fiber square here, this is not going to work well. As I go around that fiber square there, It's not exactly, well, you don't get cohomology and base change because the fiber product is too big. It's approximately F tilde lower star, G tilde, upper star tensor, the sum of wedges of the excess normal bundle with some shifts. So, this is the fiber product, it is not transverse, right? It's not a Tor-independent square, but you have some excess normal bundle, which is luckily a bundle. And I forget if it's either the tangent bundle of W over Z or the cotangent bundle of W over Z. I can never keep it straight, but Ryan can. And I guess I should thank Sasha for a math overflow answer that helped us clean that up. The second one, and this is maybe the most interesting, you need a deformation of each moduli space. Such that the SL2 machinery doesn't deform. So your correspondences won't move with you in that direction. And this is Kaudis Kamnitzer and Lakata's innovation. And then it allows you to show. It allows you to show that kernels, the kernels that you're interested in have isomorphic cohomology sheaves rather than actually quasi-isomorphic. So it sort of makes everything formal enough that you can save yourself a lot of effort. And as I said, it's inspired by Seidel and Thomas's thing about if you have a spherical object and a deformation. Spherical object and a deformation where it won't come with you, sorry, a PN object, and a deformation where it won't move, then in the total space it becomes a spherical object. And you mean huybrechts, Thomas? Ah, yes. Did I say Seidel and Thomas? Yes, thank you. Huybrex and Thomas. Right, and for them. Right, and for them that their deformation is coming from some extension of the cotangent bundle of your Grossmannian by there's some nice extension that goes here of O of the Grassmannian by the cotangent bundle. And then they take this as the total space of this bundle. The total space of this bundle. It's like a if you're just talking about projective space, it's a quillen bundle. Um, and us, we take the deformation. ITIA class sorry, do you mean the ITIA extension class? Yeah, I mean, I guess like this X group is H1 of omega of the Gross Mannian, which is one-dimensional. Which is one dimension. Is that what you're saying, Sasha? I think it is called Hatia extension. Okay, maybe so. For us, the deformation is a twister family from some hypertail metric on our moduli space. You pick some ample line bundle on your moduli space, it gives you a hypercalor metric, and then you get a And then you get a and then I see my time is short, so so let me the third ingredient or the the the hard one is categorifying EF minus Fe is the weight times the identity. Identity. Let me not say like that. This is really the painful one. But there's some nice geometry that you can see in terms of some fiber product has two components of which one gives you Fe and one gives you... Let me not say that, but I don't know if Shondor is still here, but he gave me a lot of good advice about some Cohen-Macaulay trick that we needed to make this work. That we needed to make this work. In the last minutes, let me just say something about the open directions. Like, where could you take this? And let me be clear: I am not planning to work on these things. So maybe you and Ryan could collaborate. Could collaborate if you want to email him. So, first of all, we could replace the twist around OS with twist around several spherical vector bundles. So, several spherical vector bundles in an ADE configuration. So, you'd categorify a different Leon. Categorify a different Leon. So, this would be categorifying Yoshioka's paper from 07. And probably it contains many, many lemmas that you might want. Second, we had some freedom choosing the line bundles on our correspondence. On our correspondence, on our correspondences. So, if you take advantage of that freedom, maybe you can, instead of an SL2 action, you can get like an affine SL2 action. So, you should compare Kaudis Kametron and Lakatus paper 1112.6189, where they do something. Where they do something similar with the Grassmannians. And third, and sort of vaguest but most exciting, well, we said that SL2 acts on the cohomology, like the, let me say it this way, the sum overall T's of the cohomology of M of R plus T H. R plus T H S plus T and this was Nakajima and we categorified. But you also, there's this famous Heisenberg action on the direct sum overall, well, of the cohomology of the Hilbert schemes. Of the Hilbert schemes. This is due to Nakajima and Gronovsky. It also acts on, you can just do the sum of the cohomology of the moduli spaces of R, H, and S plus T. So you just vary the second Chern class, not the rank. This is Baranovsky. And then this is. And then this is categorified by Andrei Negutz and his paper, sorry, his student Yu Zhao has a new paper with some interesting things in it. And so you could ask, the question is to ask how they interact. To ask how they interact. Like if there's some interaction between the SL2 and the Heisenberg action. Sorry. And maybe you get some double affine SL2 business. And I should say you should ask Cautis about this if you're interested in this project. Okay. Okay. Yes, thanks. I'm going to stop there. All right. Well, let's thank Nick for a great talk. Other questions? Hearing no questions, I guess I'll ask one. So, what's the, I think now I remember it's this line bundle business that you choose that also influences the convolution when you describe the kernel that gives you the Fourier MI equivalence. Do you have any words to say about what that kernel is here? How choosing a different line bundle is going to change the kernels? No, just give me a kernel that gives the That gives the equivalence. I mean, Sabin has this paper about you. Yeah. You take the fiber product and it's not Cohen-Macaulay, and then you put some smart line bundles on each component of the smooth part, and then you just push forward and Cohen-Macaulify that way. Is this what you're asking? Yes, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that or you know, I guess. I guess my guess would be it would just be, you know, some that sounds like that's something you could do globally with just the Brill Niles for the stratification. Yeah, but as like all the work is in choosing the smart line bundle. So presumably you can take what we did and figure out what line bundle it gives you. But I don't think it's going to obvious if your dream is that once you look at that example, you'll know what to do in general, right? And I just hope, I just hope. And I just hope to learn something new every day, man. Yeah, I give that at most a 25% chance of working, which is not to say it's not worth trying, but you know, spend two days and not a year. Any other questions? Yeah, can I ask a question? Oh, sorry. Hi, Andre. Hi. I think I overstepped on Sasha. Go on, go on. Go on, go on somehow. The Nakajima and Gronovsky part, the crucial thing I think that they proved was that this Heisenberg group action was irreducible, that this was the unique irreducible module for whatever algebra they had. Is there some kind of understanding of what kind of mo SL two module you get? Two module you get is can you describe it in some kind of um you mean as you as it acts on maybe the cohomology of these things or the K-theory or something on the cohomology I assume it was known from from a while ago but um well yeah it was known to Nakajima but not the rest of us um so you're saying is it irreducible in some sense no is it a special module A special module somehow. The main point, if I remember correctly, about the Heisenberg group action was that when Nakadima and Gronovsky did this, they wanted to understand the dimensions of these cohomology groups. And their main point was that they saw the dimensions in small degrees. They noticed there was a pattern, which was a pattern of the dimensions of some kind of special irreducible module, and they said, Okay, let's try to prove this is irreducible. Okay, let's try to prove this is irreducible. Somehow, for them, it was not just that it carries some action, but it's a very special module for that group. Yeah, well, I mean, SL2, like the representations are not as rich, right? But as but yeah, I don't know. I can't answer this question, but we do know sort of everything about the cohomology of these moduli spaces from Markman and others. Others. So maybe I believe your question might have a good answer, but I'm afraid I don't know it. Okay, that's fair enough. Yeah. We could look at a small example, maybe. One more question, Nick. So you construct this SL2 action on modular spaces of shifts on a K3. Of shifts on a K3 surface, right? With Picard number one, which means that numerical K0 has rank three, right? Yes. Can you do the same for a K3 category with numerical K0 of rank two? I like this question. I mean, we everywhere we're using 10 special things about the choices that we made. But okay, you want to take your K3 category from a cubic. But they're the sequence of moduli. You don't have a sequence of moduli spaces there where sort of the dimension goes up and then back down. It just goes up and up, right? So maybe this is more like a knock. So, maybe this is more like a Nakajima thing than a more of a Heisenberg thing than an SL2 thing would be a thing. No, no, no. You still have two parameters, right? Right? Of course, it goes up along some lines, but I mean, it depends on the choice of your trajectory, I think. Yeah, no, this could be a really nice project as well. I haven't thought about it. And I have a question. Do you think there is a chance that this SL2 categorification can be extended to an action of webs, SLN webs? So, I mean, well, I'm not sure what an SLN web is. Like, this is related to what you talked about, right? Yeah, it is, but this is so the webs is what I think is also. I think it's also so Cautis Kominser and company did back then. So you're saying if I have n minus one spherical bundles in an idea that so for your gross like in the context of T star to Grossmanions, it's the idea that you have that your Grossmanian Kn. Your Grassmannian Kn you think of it as a point of multiplicity k point of multiplicity n minus k and then your next space is k plus 1 and n minus k minus 1. And you visualize your raising operator as a diagram where you start with a thread of multiplicity k, thread of multiplicity n minus k, and then you split off one thread and glue it to the thread and glue it to the to the to the other one yeah i mean this if it's a natural thing then i bet it works in this in this yeah so there yeah so for t t star t star grassmannians it works because there are the kind of intermediate spaces there are t star t star to other partial flag spaces yeah so in this case you would instead of just marking a sheaf in your moduli space with one subspace of the um of the um of of the um of the h0 then you could mark a flag of subspaces of h0 and then you get an equally rich yeah yeah thank you yeah that's that that's that's great and very inspiring yeah good thanks again i invite you to work on it because i'm not going to i had one more question nick um i thought that the whole point of some of these categorical Of some of these categorical group actions was that even though on cohomology they were just an honest group action, they carried more interesting intertwining functors or things of that sort, because things are not equalities but isomorphisms, which allowed you to construct things like not invariance. Ah, yes. So Sasha Polishuk asked the same question: Should we try to make not invariance out of this? Not invariance out of this action. Yeah, that would be a very fun project. I mean, of course, there's another way to make knot invariance out of hypercalers, which is this Rozansky business. And you could dream that they were connected or that they were unconnected. That might be a long-term dream to think about whether this not invariant would be anything interesting. I know that for sure the Negutz's work is aiming. Work is aiming, or maybe he did do categorify some of those kind of what are they called? The not invariants, the categorical not invariant obtained by, I forget his name, the professor at Columbia. No, no, no. Different one. Okay. The guy who's a professor at Columbia now, Russian. I'm sorry, I forget the name, but there is a The name, but there is um there are definitely famous sorry akonkov no, not sorry, yeah. I'm talking about the kovanov invariance of knots, which are categorical in nature. So I'm wondering if the kovanov invariance
