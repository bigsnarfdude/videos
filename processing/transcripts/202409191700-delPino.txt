Okay. Okay, so I will speak about a model, the variational model, which is by now. Yes. Maybe you did. And you didn't watch the programs, so it's 25 minutes. It's quite short. It's quite 25 minutes only. Okay, okay. Give all only the other slides. Only the other slides. Okay. Um okay so um okay so the the yeah the model that I that I would like to present some results today, okay, we'll do it rather quickly. So it consists of finding critical points subject to constraint for this energy, which is For this energy, which is composed by a perimeter of a region in the space, in the Euclidean space R3, plus an unlocal term, given by an integral convolution operator of this form. So in the setting of this model, so per limiter of omega represents the area of the boundary, okay? Okay, and this one is a measurement of Columbian interactions between, if you wish, particles located inside the domain omega. So, in the so-called Gamma liquid drop model, this quantity represents the energy of a nucleus. This is a model in nuclear physics. And what is a nucleus? It's a collection of so-called nucleus. Is a collection of so-called nucleons. The nucleons can be protons and neutrons, and which are assumed uniformly distributed, say, representing a constant density inside omega. And the volume of omega is therefore proportional to the total number, okay, of nucleons. So, this guy represents surface tension that holds the nucleons together, okay. That holds the nucleons together, okay. While this guy is a measurement of repulsion and like Coulomb repulsion between the nucleons, so we are interested in stationary regions, namely, if you wish, critical points of this energy under the volume constraint that a prescribed volume M. Okay, so a basic example of a stationary region are the ground states, which are minimum. Are ground states which are minimizers of the energy, in case that they exist, of course, minimizers with the volume constraint. On the other hand, what is it known for this problem? It is known that minimizers, in fact, do exist for sufficiently small mass while they don't exist for large mass. So, this is not. The stationary problem amounts to finding a region omega. Finding a region omega with vanishing first variation of the perimeter with respect to normal perturbations of the boundary that preserve the volume. I will represent this in terms of an equation. This is not hard to derive. In fact, I will quickly review this later. So, when you do a computation, finding a critical point, omega, so a region that makes first variation equal to zero subject to Volume M, then you arrive at the derivative perimeter, which is mean curvature, evaluated at points at the boundary, okay, plus this Coulomb interaction term, okay, and this should be equal to a Lagrange multiplier lambda, okay, which is connected with the invariance of mass of the perturbations. Now, Boran Wheeler actually introduced this specific problem to compute the minimal energy required for. To compute the minimal energy required for nuclear fission. So, finding solutions of this problem with prescribed volume is an interesting problem of which I will speak a little bit next. Okay, so first of all, and this is important, okay, balls with volume M are always solutions of this problem. They always satisfy this. Their mean curvature is constant, right? And this guy is invariant under rotations, and that makes, in fact, Rotations and that makes, in fact, informerisable, this makes it a constant two. So they are critical for both Mikervashur for the Colombian term, and therefore they satisfy the full equation. Now, let me recall the classical isoperimetric inequality. The classical isoperimetric inequality tells us that the perimeter with volume constraint M is actually achieved. M is actually achieved. Yeah, the minimizer, sorry, the minimizer is achieved under the volume constraint, and the solution is nothing but a ball, okay? A ball of with mass with volume m and this result for the Colombian term actually traces back to Ries in the 1930s. Now, since the two terms describe opposite effects, yeah. Opposite effects, the surface tension and the Coulombian interactions, then the problem of finding non-trivial critical points is indeed delicate. Now, let me do the following. I will scale out the mass m, okay? So, so that see what happens if I actually consider only regions with volume one. You obtain after this computation with scaling, okay, and the integral. With scaling, okay, and the integral, you arrive at a problem that looks very much like the original one, except that now this E has volume one, and now there is this M appearing in front of the Columbian interaction. The mass appears in front. And what this suggests is that for mass sufficiently small, the perimeter will be dominant, and then by the isoperimetric inequality, it is presumably the case that minimizes exist. This is, in fact, true. This is in fact true. While for MLARS, the second guy dominates and there should be no lower minimizers. That is also partly normal. Okay. So let me consider the following number, the following mass. This is a critical mass. Okay, what is this critical mass do? It's a number, it's an explicit number at which, let me explain you what these formulas mean. This means that the energy This means that the energy of the ball of volume M actually is two times the energy of two balls with half the volume located at infinite distance from each other. So this is what these formulas roughly say. Of course, what this means essentially is that if the mass is bigger than this star, this is going to happen. The energy of two balls located at infinite distance will be actually lower than the one of the ball, and therefore the balls would no longer be a minimizer, go a minimizer. There is a conjecture actually related to this thing, which is by Choxy and Pelletier. They conjecture that if the mass is less than m star, than these specific numbers m star, then the infimum is attained precisely. Then the infimum is attained precisely when omega is the ball. And if m is bigger than m star, the infimum is not attained. This is what they conjecture. Now, what is it known? It is known the following. It is known that there exists a number m1 in principle smaller than m star, okay? Well, definitely smaller, such that for m less than m1, yeah, both are minimizers. And here are authors involved in the proof about the same in. In the proof, about in the same year, in fact. On the other hand, this was proven much later, more recently, by Frank and Nam in for a mass volume between zero and M star, the specific M star I mentioned before, there exists a minimizer, except that the minimizer may not be a volume. In here, balls are minimizers. On the other hand, if they also proved, Frank and collaborators proved that if And collaborators proved that if m is bigger than 8, in reality, no minimizes exists at all. These results have been extended for more general risk potentials in which the Columbian interactions are replaced by, say, inverse of fractional Laplacian or the perimeter by fractional perimeter. And there are a number of results of that type. Number of results of that type of extensions. Here, I show you some authors involved in this regard. So, let me summarize what happens. There is this small number M1 for which balls are minimized between 0 and M1. There exists a minimizer between M1 and M star, except that we don't know if they are minimized balls. And balls are actually not minimizers between M star and 8. And beyond 8, there is no minimizer. And beyond A, there is no minimizer at all. Okay, and there is yet another number: 10. Okay, the mass 10. At the mass 10, balls cease to be stable, namely they are no longer local minimizers. Not only they are not global minimizers, but they are not even local minimizers. And the mass then is the critical value for that. Now, concerning solutions to the problem with large mass that are not necessarily minimized. Mass that are not necessarily minimizes. What is it known? In reality, not so much, but I will tell you some interesting things that actually trace back from the analysis of Boron Wheeler in 1938. Okay, both are stable if the mass is less than or equal to 10, okay, while a bifurcation takes place when mass is 10. Mass system. Here I have this diagram in which chi star imagine chi and chi star imagine are m and m star. Okay, I am taking this picture from these authors, from a recent paper in 2023. So what we have is a ball, then a surface of this shape, and then a surface with this shape. They are called prolate and oblate. So, and you see a prolate-like thing. thing to the left of m star of sorry of 10 and to the right of 10 you see a shape like this so what should happen okay here we have a minimizer the wall is mini is should be minimizer actually it's not known but it's uh no no it should be local minimizer definitely uh while this branch presumably gives you Presumably, it gives you rise to things that are not minimizers, solutions that are not minimizers. And to the right, perhaps what happens is that along this, there is a branch like this, perhaps still local minimizers. This is what is known. Let me tell you a little bit more about the picture, which is numerical computations, okay? Numerical computations. Computations, okay, numerical computations by Suandu, recent, in which the number one, the mass one is somewhere here, okay. And at the mass one, what we see is the ball, is exactly the ball. To the left, we see this other shape, and what they detect numerically is an evolution of the shape, which could end up with some. Could end up with something like this when mass is very small, mass, you know, almost zero. Yeah. While if you go to the right, you see instead these things and you see that there is a toroidal forms coming in in the thing. Okay. So this is what is known numerically. Okay. Rigorously, there is very little work. There is very little work except the local bifurcation analysis, as was done by Frank and collaborators relatively recently. Okay, let me mention a result by Ren and Wei in 2011. What they found is that for all mass sufficiently large, there exists an axiom symmetric torus-like solution, so solution of this form. Okay, and the radius, the large radius of the total. The radius, the large radius of the torus, you know, is going to be of this order. And the negative radius, sorry, and the small radius will be like the log of the mass to negative one-third. The solution found this way turns out to be unstable. It is, however, stable under natural axisymmetric perturbations. You can see a survey about this problem until 2017 in this paper. Now, concerning the possibility of finding other solutions, let me tell you some related story for the Constant Minkervas problem. So, what are the Delaunay surfaces or undulates? The Delaunay surfaces are, as maybe all of you know, okay. Maybe all of you know, okay, surfaces of revolution that have constant mean curvature. And they can be parameterized by the next size that I call A. So this is a standard shape. Let me assume that the boundary is parameterized by a function f. This function f can be represented explicitly. This is a solution of an ODE of a certain second order ODE. A certain second order of D for the constant mean curvature of the boundary. Now you can decompose the Delone surface as an infinite union of these cells that I call sigma k and that are periodically distributed. The solutions are periodic in the vertical variable. Now, let me fix the number n and consider the truncated delone. I will call it sigma n, and I will even consider from sigma n normal. From sigma n normal perturbations h okay that I call sigma n h so they have this one and when is the unit normal vector yeah so this is the type of solution that I want what I would like actually is to consider to find a surface that has this form the form of a delunnet okay however where the axis of it is replaced by a big circle yeah this is um Big circle. This is how it should look after the corresponding transformation in polar coordinates, in cylindrical coordinates. Okay, so this is what I would like to find. So the purpose actually of the top is finding this thing. These are just parametrizations of the object. Okay, so I consider the sigma nh to which I apply the cylindrical coordinates transformation that I use this convention. Formation that I use this convention. And the three-dimensional region enclosed by this guy, I call it omega tilde nh. Okay, this is just notation, nothing special. And let me observe that when n is large, the volume, of course, of the region becomes large and it's n times a fixed number, which is the volume of a single cell, which you can compute directly. You know, it's a number between these two. Number between these two explicit quantities. So, this is our main result. So, what we have is that given a mass m sufficiently large, there exists a smooth domain omega with mass m and of this specific form. Omega is gamma, gamma is actually a small number, so this gamma to negative one-third is a big number times a domain of the form. A domain of the form a Delaunais perturbed, okay? Explicit Delaunais perturbed. This is what this is. So this solution is a scaling of the explicit Delaunay perturbed. And we find the normal perturbation such that this equation calls. So this is our main result here. Say, let me observe one thing. The problem is, of course, connected with the constant mean curvature problem. Curvature problem. On the other hand, these solutions are embedded. Okay, and if you consider the problem of finding constant mean curvature surfaces that are compact and embedded in RN, the only solutions to that, this comes from Alexandroch in the 1950s. The only solutions to that are balls. There are no more solutions than that. On the other hand, the presence of the Colombian interaction term, in reality, could give rise to Could give rise to embedded surfaces like this. And this opens maybe a full universe about new solutions to this problem. Now, concerning the derivation, so this is completely standard. Actually, the derivative of the perimeter, so Lagrange multiplier rule essentially will tell us that what I am looking for is derivative of the energy, first variation of the energy like this, equal to Lagrange multiplier. equal to Lagrange multiplier lambda times the first variation of the volume. If I make the computation of the corresponding first variation of the Coulomb term, I find an expression like this. And for the volume, an expression like that. And in addition, this is well known actually, you can expand the area of the surface as of the normal perturbation. Of the normal perturbation as the original fixed area plus the disturb associated to the mean curvature. Okay, so at a constraint critical point, what we should have is a relation like this. And so this is what I want to solve. This is the equation I want to solve. But solving this equation is in reality because this H is an Hermit Reich expansion, then this. Expansion, then this is going to be this is going to lead me to this guy. This derivation appears first in Boren-Wheeler. Now, concerning the X, we need that, we will actually need a finer expansion of the mean curvature of sigma H, of course, because that will appear here in the equation. And let me tell you: what do you arrive at? Okay, well, here is it is just a derivation. This is more or less standard. But concerning, you know, the point is that the mean curvature of the perturbed sigma H guy becomes involves the Jacobi operator of the surface, okay, of the constant mean curvature surface. Okay, this is what I want to solve after scaling. Is what I want to solve after scaling with some constant omega that is in principle arbitrary. What I would like to achieve is this volume. And the result actually depends strongly on the sign of an integral. This integral depends on the parametrization of the Delaunay. And this integral actually has a sign, is positive actually, for a between zero and some small number, and also for a bigger than one-fourth and one-half. In between, we have an In between, we haven't, I mean, I mean, it sounds a little bit silly, but we haven't been able to prove yet that for the A less than one-fourth and positive, the solution is possible, the interior is positive, where we believe so. The main step in the proof is actually constructing a solution of this form where for a gamma conveniently chosen. And in fact, what we are able to find is that if you consider a large number n, large number n. n, large number n, then you can find a perturbation h and a number gamma with these conditions. In fact, this gamma is of order one over log n and the function h, its size is inverse of log n as well, and such that this equation is satisfied. Once this is obtained, actually by using a continuity argument involving the dependence on A, we are able to prove the full result that I claimed before. Result that I claimed before. So the proof is based on the Lyapunov-Schmid-type reductions, say asymptotics or general perturbation things. The basic thing is actually expansions of the knee curvature operator and of this guy. And you find on this surface, on a LONF surface, you obtain something like this. Like this, and you may wonder: well, why do I care about this? This is very important because this error is not, you need a solvability condition for it. So it's not for free that we can solve the equation. And that allows us to choose the number gamma. Well, in fact, the mean curvature of the perturbed guy can be expanded like this. And also, here it involves the Jacobi operator and the solar. Jacobi operator and the solvability condition involves the solvability for equations, linear solvability of equations involving the Jacobi operator. So what we find then is, okay, this is just, I mean, it's geometric computations that are more relatively known, okay, that that that that made the the this guy appears. made the this guy appear okay so the full the full problem let me go quickly there yeah for the coulombian interaction we have similar things and uh and here are fredhum alternative type results for the h for the so for linear equations for for linear equations involving the jacobi operator so um what we will actually need uh is to Is to obtain perturbations that preserve volume, okay, or at that main order preserve volume. So, this is what we impose actually as a condition. And we can find a nice test function which is explicit and that help us to obtain an appropriate solvility condition to preserve that condition. In fact, the main lemma, the main engineer lemma is that you can always solve a problem of this one for any right-hand side. For any right-hand side, and you can construct this solution by involving two Lagrange multipliers, C and D. And at the end, what we need to do, because this D is a part of lambda in reality, of the constant lambda, the C is explicitly this guy, and what we want is that this C be zero, right? And we are able to find that, and that leads us to. us to a condition on the number gamma. Gamma turns out to be something that makes this integrated against y2 essentially equal to zero. It is not so easy to get that because there are terms of error that are at main order orthogonal. However, they are different ordering sizes. So it's not actually trivial making the full resolution of the problem, but what we need to do is to obtain, to solve. To do is to obtain, to solve first the problem in H, yeah, as a fixed point guide, as every fixed point problem, and then we find gamma such that this is equal to zero, the C. And the C equal to zero, luckily, okay, is something that we can find explicitly. And look at this relation. Here is this ugly integral that I showed you before in the statement. And this is what tells us that gamma can be chosen. Gamma is a scale. Gamma can be chosen. Gamma is scaling, so it should be a positive number, okay? And this gamma is positive. I mean, because what we want at main order is that this guy is zero, okay? Because we want this full C is zero. And that will tell us that gamma is explicit number divided by log n at main order. Okay, here is the full thing, and then here is an explanation of the continuity argument that I mentioned before so that we can. Before, so that we can find solutions for any large mass m. Okay. And that amounts to taking an n that is sufficiently large and in addition, making a very tiny, very small adjustment of the number a. So, um, so sorry, just 30 seconds to mention something that is a joint project now with Rupert Frank and Monica Musso. Monica Musso. Perhaps you remember this guy. This is supposed to be the limiting, the numerical limiting behavior to the left when mass goes to zero of the branch coming out of 10 of the mass equal to 10. But as you go to the left, you appear to end up with a situation like this: two tangent balls connected by a narrow neck. We believe this narrow neck is catenoidal, so this shape is. So, this shape is more or less the one of a Delon of a Delonnet thing, however, embedded. The Delonnet is embedded, however, is non-compact, okay? But this guy is compact, and we believe we are in a position to find a solution that has this form for very small mass, which is quite connected with what I told you now. Okay, thank you very much for your attention.
