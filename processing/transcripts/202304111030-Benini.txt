It's my pleasure to welcome our second speaker for today, Anna Miriam Menini from University of Parma, who will tell us about Transidelta's Penon Maps. Hi, it's such a pleasure to at least be able to speak about this new aspect of PenonMaps, yet another phase of this nice problem. Face of this nice problem, and I'm so sorry I cannot be there in person, and the organizers know, but this is what it is. And for this time, we'll have to deal with a computer. So, I'm going to talk about transcendental canon maps. Most of the things that we'll talk about, especially all the general theorems, Especially all the general theorems, our joint work with Arozio, Fornes, and Peters. And some of the examples are with other people who work in the University of Parma, which are called Saraco and ZEDA. They usually don't do dynamics, so you may not have heard much of them. Have heard much of them. And another one is with Saraco and another undergraduate student of us, which is called the Ronica del Tran. So, this will be somehow a summary of results that you can have about transcendental maps. And mostly, we have been working with what we call the Hanon quadrant, which is with Arozio, Fernes, and Petters. You may know all of them, certainly. And it's interesting because somehow this problem of looking at Henon maps. This problem of looking at Henon maps in which the term, so let me write this down. We all know the hero of the conference, which are map of the form f of z w equals f of z minus delta w comma z. And for basic theme of this of the talks in the conference, this f of z was in fact a polynomial. And when I was still a graduate student, Furness suggested that we look at it when f of z is actually the exponential map. When f of z is actually the exponential map, and see if we can get a complete description. And then, as we were in Rome with Arozio, with Leandro, and Han, we were looking for a cute topic to work on, and this came up to our mind, and we wrote to generic. So, we started working together on this. And we have finished paper three, and now we're working on paper four and five simultaneously. So, there is a lot of work to do, and let's see what we can do and some open questions. So, So for us, f of z will be an entire transcendental function, which goes from the complex plane to itself. And of course, we all know that being a polynomial has many advantages. One of the important ones is that there is this filtration which tells you exactly how orbits move. I'm not going to repeat it because most of you know it, and which basically tells you how orbits move from an unbounded part of the plane to the compact part of the plane where the interesting dynamics happens and then move away towards infinity. And one of the consequences of the filtration. Is that there is a dichotomy? Either orbits are bounded. Every orbit is either bounded or it converges to infinity in a very specific way. So it actually converges to the point 100 with this notation in which we have to swap in the second coordinate. Second coordinate. And there is really an attracting basin of this point. I will think, so as you can see from this notation, I'm thinking about C2 being compactified with the line at infinity. And while for polynomial, in a certain way, it's not so important which compactification you choose because this behavior at infinity really only tells you that the only way you can go to infinity is converging to a specific. Can go to change is converging to specific points. So, basically, no matter what complexification you take, it's either you go to the boundary or you don't go to the boundary, it doesn't matter how you go to the boundary. But for transcendental maps, if some of you know something about one variable, this will feel familiar. So for transcendental maps, there are many ways of going to infinity, even in one variable. And so, the compactification that we use actually is relevant. Okay, so you can really think about being an attractive. So you can really think about being an actracking basin of this point 100. And in fact, essentially your polynomial extends to the line of infinity. And then there is a big advantage that we, up to this point, have no idea how to deal with in the transcendental case, and we didn't focus on that, is that you can use this very powerful forms of currents, Dean, Siboni, Jordan, you name it, all these very strong people who have been working a lot. Strong people who have been working a lot and know algebraic geometry and are able to use currents because we are polynomial henon maps. Henon maps for short are trans are polynomial automorphisms. So you can pull back and get all this nice measure, etc. And this allows you to study for many things, for example, the distribution of periodic points, saddle points, etc. But this is really a super strong formalism, and we have no analog for it in the transcendental case. Because points in transcendental in one variable have infinitely many pre-images, and somehow this infinite degree in the one dimension translates into not really being able to pull back and get nice convergence results for now. So, and then there is a very nice classification. There is a very nice classification of recurrent VATU components. And something that is really nice is that they are well understood when delta is small, especially if f of z is a quadratic polynomial. And this is really coming from the fact that all the dynamics, the Julia set, is a compact set. Set is a compact set. And so, if you make a very small perturbation, then you will somehow inherit the one-dimensional dynamics in your two-dimensional maps if your delta is small. And I may say something or not in the end about parameter spaces. So, this is completely thing that you are basically able to keep for translation. Keep for transcendental genomes. Now, on the other hand, the fact that we have polynomials instead of transcendental maps makes some questions very difficult. So we have seen in the talk by Berget that he and SÃ©bastien Diever proved that they can have wandering domains, so polynomial henon maps. Domain so polynomial phenomenaps can have wandering domains, but this was very hard, it took a long time to prove this. It was not trivial at all, and the proof is very abstract, at least to my understanding. So, we will see that in transcendental human maps, it's much easier to construct such wandering domains. Such wandering domains for several reasons. Well, because they arise naturally in one variable, and also because you have this superpower, which is approximation theory. So in polynomials, you cannot construct examples by using approximation theory, because when you have a sequence of functions, if their degree is not bounded, they will not converge to a polynomial, but just to an entire function. While to have an entire transcendental function, it's much easier to construct counterexamples or examples with interesting behavior. And another question, which seems to be very difficult, is whether there can be rank one limit functions. And this is a problem that I particularly like. So I'm going to say something more about it when I talk about photocomponents. But in the polynomial case, we all know that there are recurrent photo components and no recurrent. Recurrent photocomponents and non-recurrent photo components. So the question is whether if omega is non-recurrent, which means that at least some orbits converge to the boundary of a two component, for example, parabolic basins, then can the limit sets have rank one. And there are some results by Jubich and Peters. Which say no if delta is small. I think small means just one over d squared, not 10 to the minus 15, like Pierre Dergier was saying. Pierre Berger was saying. And on the other hand, for automorphism, is for automorphism, for general automorphism, not polynomial henon maps. The answer is yes. And the results by Jupiter Lilov. And more recently, another construction, similar construction by Bracci, Bochtaler, Bracci and Peters. Peters. So, this is a problem that I particularly like about rank one limit functions. And in fact, one of the things that I will show you today after showing some general theorems is that it's not too difficult to construct wandering domains and not too difficult to construct rank one limit functions on the line at infinity. Okay, so the line at infinity is one of the main characters in this talk. So let me Let me give just one minute of motivation, maybe two minutes. Well, one of the reasons is that one of the things that I find to be one of my main motivations is that there is not much known about general transcendental automorphism. Automorphism. So it's very difficult to make general theorems about general transcendental automorphism. And I really think that transcendental henon maps Or THM, which is a very promising name for a mathematical object, if you ask me. So, transcendental henon maps have the big advantage that you can actually prove theorems which hold in general. So, for transcendental human maps, you can prove general theorems. And sometimes they generalize to larger classes of maps. We will see a couple of examples. If you're lucky or good, depends on the point of view, they can generalize to wider classes of automorphisms. And so I like to think of them as it's So, I like to think of them as a springboard to jump into this world of transcendental automorphism, which is basically unknown. The other reason is that they really do exhibit some unique behaviors with respect to polynomial maps, especially in the line at infinity. For example, escaping factor components, which means for two components on which the function converges to the line at infinity. I will give the definition later, but it just means that the iteration. It just means that the iterates converged to the line at infinity. So we all know what the projective space is and what the line at infinity is, right? If there are any questions, just let me know. I'm just assuming that since such a specific conference, most of us know about the projective space. But if I say anything that sounds weird, just let me know. So I cannot see your faces, so I cannot guess from that. And they really do exhibit some unique. Bit some unique dynamical features. So it's really a pity to deny ourselves access to this rich and unexplored world. And finally, so this is like purely emotional way, reason to study them. Okay. And then there is another, like say, more practical reason is that the new proofs, so studying what we can do for transcendental henome maps, they can give some insights. Can give some insights on how to study polynomial henon maps sometimes. It's not uncommon that you study transcendental and you need to find a new proof and suddenly the new proof also works for polynomials and you get a different proof. And I think it's very interesting to see things from more points of view than just having one single proof. Points of view than just having one single proof. For example, you can really get. So, one of the things like about rank one limit functions, it can kind of tell you what can happen that can give rise to a rank one image function or not. So, really, I think that, so this is about it for the motivation, and really there are two types of results. Some are general theorems which hold for every Henon map, rather transcendental Henon maps. And the other ones are interesting examples. And of course, by interesting examples, we kind of somehow mean things that we do not know how they can be realized or that are difficult to realize for criminals. Let me first, before getting into the two types of results, let me tell you something about the FATUSAT. Okay, so let us talk about the FATU set by looking at the compactive. The FAT2 set by looking at the compactification of C2 with P2. So we say that the family is normal, the definition, and family Fn is normal on a domain U of C two And of course, every fn out. I'm looking at it as iterates, but you could let me define it as a sequence. Let me let me keep it as a sequence of iterates. So, this is these are map from a domain U containing C2 to C2 is normal, and this is important, is normal with respect to P2. So, if every sequence has a sub-sequence F and K, which converges uniformly on compact subset of U, obviously, to G. And the point is that G goes must be holomorphic from U to To P2. So it must be a holomorphic function to P2. P2, and here is the key. P2 is a complex manifold. P2 union one point at infinity is not a complex manifold. So in a sense, it kind of seems more natural to think of this normality in terms of converging to a holomorphic function. Of converging to a holomorphic function rather than converging to a function which goes to something which is not even a complex manifold. Now, we could debate about whether P2 is the only compactification of C2 that makes it into a complex manifold. And the answer is no. There are other choices. So we may debate about which one is the best choice. But I think it is kind of possible to argue that. Kind of possible to argue that it would really be a nice idea to get a complex manifold for your compactification before defining normality. And really, normality needs a target space which is compact. Your domain may not, and you don't care because it's a local notion, but you really would like your target space to be compact. And well, then of course the Fatusat. The Fatusat, if you want the forward Fatusat. Two sets, if you want the forward FA2 set. Ah, and of course, why do people in polynomial automorphisms not care about which compactification they use? Well, because if you go to the boundary, if you go to the boundary of C2, you only go in one way. You can reach one point. So, regardless of which compactification you use, you don't care. You will get the same result. So, the Fatou set, or if you want the forward Fatu set, is the maximal set. On which the family of iterate is normal. As usual. Okay, is normal with respect to P2. Okay, and this is a fact. If you can prove it using normality argument, if g is a limit function, which means that you probably guess that there is a subsequence of differings which converges to g. Okay, just this definition of limit function. So if g is limit function, then either On FO2 component, then either G of omega is contained in the line at infinity or G of omega is contained in C2. Okay, so you cannot have limit sets which are half on your line at infinity and half inside C2. They're all nice in the line of infinity or they're all in C2. That there is no way you're gonna be both things. Be both things, which is kind of like saying if you don't have Meromorphic families, if you don't have Meromorphic functions, but you already have entire functions, your image function is either infinity or has no poles. Anyway, so one thing to keep in mind for the people, I don't know if there is anyone, but like something to keep in mind that F is still proper. So, if you have a sequence of points, this is not normal, this is not usual in the transcendental wording one variable. Okay, so let me just mention this. If you have a sequence of points Pn and the points Pn converge to the line at infinity, or if you want the norm of Pn goes to infinity, then their images f of P n also converge to the line at infinity. Also, they converge to the line at infinity. On the other hand, they are not uniformly continuous, just as any nice transcendental map should be. Okay, so with this in mind, let me tell you one of the main differences between polynomial and transcendental and the One of the main differences, in my view, apart from the topological degree being infinite, no, sorry, apart from this fact that you cannot use currents, but like one of the very basic differences is that there is no compactification, no extension, no way to extend F to the boundary. F to the boundary. And by no way, I mean no way. And let me state this as a theorem. So in a certain sense, the transcendental Henon maps have essential singularities on any point on the line at infinity, in which sense, in this sense. So theorem, and this is with the historical list of co-authors, so with Arrozo, Fernes, and Peters, is that each point. Each point on the line at infinity is an essential singularity. And in other words, for every p on the line at infinity and q. And Q, again in the line at infinity, there exists a sequence of points Pn converging to P, not an orbit. Just sequence of points which belong to some complex lines, such that their images converge to Q. Okay, so in picture. So, in picture, you take your C2, you take your line at infinity, choose B, choose Q. You can always find a sequence of points whose images converge to another point. In a certain sense, a neighborhood of every point on the line at infinity spreads all over the line at infinity. And really, the proof. And really, the proof is a clever application of Picard's theorem in one variable. So, I'm not going to really give proofs in this talk. It's going to be kind of a survey. But for example, this is not very difficult to see. It's a trick using Picard's theorem. Now, the good news about the yes, I got a question. Yeah, I have a question. Yeah, I have a question. So, is this also true for other compactifications? If you take P1 across P2? So, we studied a little bit the compactification with P times C. Sorry, P1 times P1. And we did not check this. So, good question. We checked it for other, we did not check. It's, I don't know, I need to think about it. And it seems like actually there. And it seems like actually the other compatifications of C2 are basically up to blow up and blow down just the line at infinity and P1 times P1. So one may actually study what happens when you vary the compactification in the theory. I think this is something interesting. So the good news about this essential singularity is that not having Not having this behavior, this nice behavior at infinity, in which points near infinity converge to 1, 0, 0 opens up a lot of possibilities on how to go to infinity. Even in the normal set Even in the normal set. Okay, so now that we have this compactification in mind, we can look a little bit about some global theorems that you can go to translate in online. And I think here some of the motivation about using them as a springboard to study more general transcendental automorphism may become a little bit more evident. So the first thing that you can do is that you can classify recurrent FATU components. And the classification. So, if you want to take a five-minute snap, the classification is going to be very similar to the one that we have for polynomial henomes, only the rotation surface are not necessarily annuli or architecture disk. They could a priori be E or C star. Okay, but the interesting thing about this theory. The interesting thing about this theorem is that it works for all automorphisms of C2 with constant Jacobian. So we don't need transcendental Henon maps, but by looking at the proof of transcendental Henon maps, we could prove it for polynomial automorphism with constant Jacobian. So this is again with the Rosio-Fernescent peters. And it states that if I have an automorphism of G2 with constant With constant Jacobian delta and omega, an invariant recurrent two component. And of course, we all know that the term recurrent here is crucial because for non-recurrent, it's not even known for polynomials. So if we have a recurrent for two components, A recurrent for two components, then basically, I'm gonna say it in words and then I'm gonna write it down. You have your FA2 component omega, and you can always find a surface which I'm gonna draw for rank one, but it could be rank zero or the whole manifold, a sub-manifold, which you can think of as a surface if it's rank one, or a point if it's rank zero, or the whole component if it's rank two, and there is a retraction. And there is a retraction which basically encodes all the dynamics of the iterates when the iterates go to infinity up to an automorphism of my manifold. So the one-dimensional manifold or nothing if you have a point or an automorphism of omega. So let me state this, then there exists a holomorphic retraction rho, which goes from omega to C. Which goes from omega to sigma, where sigma is a closed complex submanifold such that for every limit map, so every limit of a subsequence of iterates, this limit map is This limit map is equal to the retraction. So I move from omega to sigma by my retraction. This is unique. It does not depend on the limit function. It's fixed. It only depends on the photo component. And my limit function is equal to this retraction composed with some automorphism of sigma. Okay. And now. Okay, and now what are the possibilities for sigma? So if the dimension of sigma is equal to zero, then omega is an attracting basin, as you could guess. Of a fixed point, and we all know that it is the holo. That it is b holomorphic to C2 just by Erosai moving. Nothing new here. Okay, if the dimension of sigma is equal to one, then sigma is B holomorphic. This bit, this wiggly thing is B holomorphic. Wiglitting is B holomorphic, okay, for all of the talk. This is a B holomorphic to some rotation domain, which could be D, D star, an annulus, C or C star. And F is conjugate to what you imagine it to be. So basically, a rotation on the surface and the missing map in the other direction. So e to the i theta z z over. Z Z over e to the i theta. You need this because the Jacobian is constant. Sorry, additional z, this is delta w. This is a change of coordinate. And if the dimension of sigma is equal to two, then there exists a sequence of iterates. It converges to the identity. Which of this can be realized? I'm getting there. I'm getting there. Okay, so we do not know which ones are realized of this, but it doesn't seem, I think, for polynomials, so we do not know which ones. So, we do not know which ones of these are realized. And we did not work on constructing any examples of this because it seemed, I mean, it seemed kind of not so difficult to construct an example of these rotation surfaces embedded in a FA2 component. It didn't seem to be something really new unless you managed to make it with one of the ones that we don't know exists for polynomials. Know exists for polynomials, so it didn't seem something very new. This is easy, so this is easy to do. You just take an attracting fixed point, and you will have all the local dynamics various than Rudin. And the rotation domain, I don't remember if we constructed examples or not. I don't remember. I should have checked. I just didn't think about it. So good question. Another thing that I would like to point out for the non-super expert is that this idea of having this, I call them rot, I think of them, we think of them as rotation domains. And kind of there is no, but we don't have a conjugacy to the rotation. Don't have a conjugacy to the rotation, to a rigid rotation. And somehow, this reminiscence of being a rotation domain is encoded by this property that you have a sequence of iterates converging to the identity. So when we have a disk, I think you should be able to see my video. When we have a disk and we have a rotation there, one of the features is that if you take a point, the orbit of this point are dense on some kind of curve on the disk. If you have a straight disk on the actual. Disk, if you have a straight disk on the actual circle, and they're not only dense, but like there are many sub-sequences which converge to the identity. Okay, so this kind of weird property of having a sequence of iterates converging to the identity is encoding this idea that this is somehow a rotation domain, even though we have no idea whether we have a normal form, a conjugation or not. And we have no idea, of course, if there is a center, but as far as I understand, not even for polynomial maps, you know whether there is a center. You know whether there is a standard. Okay, so I'm sorry. If it's, I should have said something more. So if it is general, yes, I didn't just say I made a mistake. So I'm just adding something. So if it is, I was thinking about Henon maps, but if it is actually just consonant Jacobian, it could also happen that some iterate is the identity. Some iterative identity. Sorry, I should have said this, just not for a transcendental genome. Yes, so there was another question. What if this is still true if the chipman is not constant? I didn't get that. Sorry, I couldn't hear why. Uh any of this uh can still fold. Do you know anything about the casement that you got and it's not constant? Case on the Chicago is not possible. Would you mind writing it in the chat? I just cannot, or somebody closer to the microphone maybe could say it. But if you copy it, okay. Let me find the chat. I have no idea whether Jacobian is not constant, but I have heard rumors that somebody is working on that. Somebody is working on that. But that person told me not to be able to. So you can ask me in private, and I will ask the person whether it's disclosable the identity of this secret person working on this. Okay. Another thing that is really cool, in my view at least, is that so somehow you see nothing really new with respect to polynomial halon maps. But now something that is interesting also. That is interesting also is that another theorem, again by the same people, is that the Fatusat is always pseudo-convex. So again, this holds more generality, but we need a different hypothesis. Let F be an automorphism of C2 for which F minus one has an escaping point. An escaping point. What is an escaping point? A point for which the orbit goes to the line at infinity to the boundary. Okay? Then every photo component of omega, every photo component omega is pseudo-convex. Now, depending on your point of view, Now, depending on your point of view, you may think who cares about pseudo-convex, or this may be the most important result in the talk. Okay, I'm not going to get into opinion. But these two terms are very nice when you want to register as proposals and do some marketing on why it could be important to study transcendental genomes. Okay, so let me tell you a couple more theorems, a couple more results which hold for all transcendental genomes. One result is One result is that, so this is B to the convexity. Another result is that there are always escaping points. And this is why it shouldn't be holds, okay? Because the inverse of a trans-Nelta canon maps is just like for polynomial canon maps, it's basically a transnal canon maps. So, kind of whatever you prove for f, you prove it for the inverse. Then, there are always escaping points. This is kind of easy to do for polynomials, but just like in the transcendental case in one variable, you need to go about much more difficult theory in order to prove the existence of escaping points. And you do it by using Lehman-Valeron theory. If you have no idea what it is, it tells you how transcendental entire functions. It tells you how transcendental entire functions in one variable behave near infinity, and the fact that you have this special form for transnon non-maps allows you to apply one-dimensional result. So the special form just like for polynomials is. Just like for polynomials, the special forms allow us to use results from 1D. And let me just tell you that it's much more than just having escaping points. In fact, you get uncountably many orbits. And for each orbit, so uncountably many escaping orbits. Countably many escaping orbits. And you can study their symbolic dynamics, but for each orbit, you also get for each point in each orbit, you get very nice stable manifolds which move along with the point. So they move along with the point, and somehow the dynamics on this manifold, these are Dynamics on this manifold. These are stable manifolds, so complex lines, and they're all consisting of escaping points because the orbits of points in this stable manifold converge to the orbit of your escaping points. And it's not unthinkable to think that under some good assumption, you would actually get stuff which goes to infinity, which is equivalent to R times C. So it would not be unthinkable that in some cases. Think about that in some cases, if you want, this is a conjecture, at least in some cases, escaping points, so all of them code could have a structure which is equivalent to R. Which is equivalent to R times C. Okay, and you can see the C. This is the C. Okay, and the R you cannot see, but like it's not unthinkable that at least in some cases you could get curves of escaping points, each one with a stable magnifying. Okay, now another thing which is kind of trivial for polynomials, but not transcendental, is that there are always periodic. There are always periodic points. And refining, in fact, there are always subdues. Saddles always exist. And this is not trivial because when you try to solve the equations, instead of getting a nice polynomial equation, which has exactly the number of roots you want, you get all these transcendental equations, so you may have no root. So it may have no root, infinitely many rules, finitely many rules, you just have no idea. So you need to kind of prove it in other ways. And finally, this was a question raised by Siboni, and also Romain de Giovanni has worked on this type of questions, is that transcendental Henon maps always have infinite entropy. Okay, and again, you need to be a bit careful. Okay, and again, you need to be a bit careful with your definition of entropy because your C2 is not compact, and we don't like maps which are not compact for our entropy business, but you can deal with this. And yes, as you would expect, you have infinite entropy. And I must say that this is a theorem by us, but from examples were constructed already in Dujordain thesis. Okay, so this is it for now about the general theorems. Okay, and another thing that is very, I think, is interesting about transmandal Henon maps is looking at new dynamical features, new interesting dynamical features. So if you want examples. Can I just ask whether I'm supposed to have 15 minutes or one hour? I'm not planning to take the full hour anyway, just to know how quick I need to go. It's actually one hour, 30 minutes. So you can go as much as you want. Okay. Okay, so I'm gonna take one hour then, and I will keep some time for questions. I thought I was supposed to speak 50 minutes or one hour, so I prepared that, but let me go on. I have definitely things to say. So one example is that you can construct transcendental henon maps with subtle points. With saddle points whose stable manifold is dance in situ. Okay, so they are all so unless otherwise stated. Unless otherwise stated, it's with the usual four people. And the corollary is that the Julia set, the forward Julia set is equal to C2 for such maps. And in fact, this is like a parameter space argument. Parameter space argument. So they do not only exist, they form a G-delta subset of the space of all transplant vacanon maps with a fixed Jacobian. Okay, so this is kind of this is a kind of not a construction by perturbation or anything. Well, not a construction by approximation theory or something like this. It's really a parameter space argument. And you can see that this is really different from what happens in polynomials. Different from what happens in polynomials because in polynomials you always have the attracting basin of this one zero zero. And an open question that we may or may not have an example, we're not sure yet. So we're not sure whether this is done or not is the following. Can you have, it seems like I think, let me put probably solved. Probably solved mathematically, it has the same value, which means nothing, but it looks emotionally nicer. So, can we have Fatusat two components coexisting with the Julia set with non-empty interior? I call it Julia. Here. I call it Julia Sat. I mean the forward Julia Sat. And we have some example what it didn't package properly. So as long as it's not packed, it's not true. And the other question is: what about replacing J plus by J, which is as usual the intersection between J minus and J plus. Okay, so the points whose orbits are chaotic, both forward and backwards. And of course, it looks much more difficult to check because it's a much smaller set. Now, this follows ideas. This kind of construction follows some parameter ideas. Parameter ideas, which were known before. There is a paper by Peters, Vivas, and Walt, and another paper by Arosio and Larlsson. Okay, so this has ideas. Well, like every proof has external ideas. The other class, I think this is an interesting example because Example because in polynomial maps, you cannot have dense stable manifolds, and because you cannot have that the Julia set is everything. And then another type of examples that you can construct is type of two components, which do not exist or are very difficult to construct for polynomials. So, yes, I have a question, Roma speaking. Is it the case that the Julia set always J plus contains always neighborhood of the line at infinity? Isn't it? I got isn't it the case that the Julia set J plus contains a neighborhood of the line at infinity Yes no it doesn't contain a neighborhood of the line at infinity but it's always unbounded I think I don't think that J plus always contains a neighborhood of the line at infinity because uh um Okay, let me try to answer Roman's question. I'll write it down so you tell me if I misunderstood. Is that a question? And the answer is morally yes, but not exactly. So I think what is true is that Is that if you take any you mean using the fact of the essential singularity, right? Or maybe you were thinking in another line. So, well, I think it's true that if you have a photo component omega, then this photo component cannot contain any neighborhood of any point on the line at infinity because of the essential singularity business. And so there always needs to be points of J plus accumulating on the line at infinity. But I do not think that they make up a full neighborhood of the line at infinity. However, if you insist very strongly, I'm going to take it back and think about it till further notice. Does this make sense, Orno? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Make sense or no? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Thanks. Okay. And that's what I think this is what you meant. I mean, I think what you really meant is that it implies that it's unbounded. Okay, so the other types of things that we can construct are wandering domains. And finally, we can construct what I like to call Baker domains. Also known as escaping photocomponents. Let me give you a definition and then let me go a little bit into these examples. So what do we mean by escaping part two component? If it is a part of component, If it is a protocomponent, as you could guess, and the limit functions. Let me put it this way: if I'm gonna write for every image function. I'm gonna write for every limit function, but I didn't check. I didn't think about it. It should be just one is enough. Yes, for every limit function, or for a limit function, it's enough to do this because the map is proper. We have that for any limit function h, we have that h of omega is contained in the line at infinity. Line at infinity. Okay, so you are escaping is exactly as you imagine. You have your line at infinity, your photo component omega, and iterates converge the line at infinity. And I'm drawing it this way because it's very difficult to draw the boundary of an escaping factor component, the line of infinity, but somehow, so you cannot have a disconnected set like this, I think, but you can also not contain neighbors. But you can also not contain neighborhoods, so I'm not really sure how I should draw this. So, escaping is exactly what you imagine it to be: that the iterates converge to the line of infinity or escape to the boundary of C2. Now, let me tell you about wandering domains and about Baker domains, since apparently I have a lot of time. So, about wandering domain? You can construct something that is so I think it's interesting to think about boundary domains. It can be thought of in many ways. You can look at what the limit functions are on boundary domains, or one question that seems to be interesting is to look at whether the boundary domains converge. The wandering domains converge to infinity, or whether they oscillate back and forth between the infinite part of the plane and the bounded part of the plane, or whether they have bounded orbits. They are sets for which all limits functions are bounded. So we can construct escaping wandering domains. That is their sets going to infinity. So their domains Un, we all know what wondering domain is, right? So Un converges to the line at infinity as set, and they are beholomorphic to C2. This is construction again with the usual people, and we can construct oscillating. Wandering domains again be holomorphic to C2. These are domains for which some subsequence u and k goes to the line at infinity and some subsequence u and tilde j conver accumulates in a compact set. In a compact set. And yes, you should write this more precise. And then Boctaler Arozio, Boctaler and Peters constructed wandering domains which are short C2. Short C2. I don't remember where they go to infinity or are oscillating. But if you have no idea what the short C2 is, it's basically something which is not P holomorphic to C2, but is Kobayashi flat. And it's constructed as an increasing union of balls with some properties. Okay, so this is something that is liked from the geometric point of view. Is liked from the geometric point of view. They have a nice geometric structure. And these two types of wandering domains, so the escaping ones and the oscillating ones are constructed in a kind of similar yet different way by using approximation here in one variable. So I was not planning to talk about this, but since we have time, I'm going to just say a word. And so. I have one question. I have one question. This example of oscillating wandering domains, does this answer Holman's question? Why? Does the domain, can that intersect JPluster? Yes, yes, yes. Yes, exactly. This is what I was trying to answer to Rama. Is that And is that you have two components which accumulate on the line at infinity? But you also have a simpler one. You don't even need to go to Baker domains. You don't even need to use one domain. You can use the other escaping component. Once you have escaping components, you cannot have a full neighborhood in J plus, I think. And I think what Romain was really saying is that the J plus is spreading all over the line at infinity. Is spreading all over the line at infinity. Right. Right. It's much simpler because it's unbounded, of course. So I think it's interesting because it uses wrong approximation in 1D. Let me just show you the picture. Just show you the picture. Okay, so we have C2, and we're going to write C2 as C2 in this plane, the C plane, and W as R. This is not true, of course, but we are going to use the approximation in the Z plane. And if you remember, our function was f of Z W equals F of Z minus delta W comma Z. W, Z. So basically, the freedom we have is this F of Z and delta, okay? Delta, but basically, it's F of Z. So we are really looking for finding a function which is one variable, which does the appropriate behavior in two variables. And this is kind of a standard construction that you can do with these transcendental genomes, where standard means we have used it in several papers. And it works like this. Like if you take, so finding when a domain is wrong in C2 is kind of difficult, but being wrong. Difficult, but being Runge in C just means that your domain is simply connected. So if you take a sequence of disks in the C plane, you can approximate singular Henon map. You can choose how your Henon maps behaves on these large cylinders, which now are drawn as a small disks times R, but in fact, they're a small disk times C. So you can prescribe your behavior here. And if you are careful, And if you are careful on how to make so what is the catch? The catch is that you can prescribe where the z goes. If you take z naught, w naught, you can prescribe where the z goes up to some approximation error, but you cannot prescribe what the second coordinate does because the second coordinate is going to be the previous z. No choice there. But of course, if you do it in two steps carefully enough, you can basically prescribe both coordinates, okay? Describe both coordinates. Okay. So the two ideas here are to use Lung approximation in 1D and do approximations in two steps to prescribe both the Z coordinate and the W. And of course, you need to be a little bit careful. And of course, you need to be a little bit careful in how you do it. But in this way, it's kind of not too difficult to see that you can do results. And how do you get them to be oscillating? To get them to be oscillating, you use stable and unstable manifolds. And this is very easy to describe and not so easy to do the computations. So, let me just give you the description. So, if you have a saddle point, you get your stable and your unstable manifold. And for a moment, we can imagine the this is not true, but it kind of works eventually if you are careful. You can imagine your unstable manifold to be in the z-plane. To be in the z plane, so and your unstable manifold to be in the w plane, and what happens is that you can do approximations on points here, prescribe your value, and then these points will move along the unstable manifold for a number of steps. Then you can use approximation again in two steps to move back close to the stable manifold. And here you have a And here you have something called also the lambda lemma, which tells you if you are nearby this stable manifold, you will move along percent number of iterates and you will get close to your p. But once you're close to the stable manifold, then you can just drift along the unstable manifold under the dynamics and do go farther away in order to be able to do a new approximation in one variable. In one variable, and then repeat and come back. Okay, and this gives you the oscillating behavior. And the point is that you only do approximations. So the black blobs mean so that you eventually get wandering domains. And you need to prove that they're wandering domains when you construct in this way. But the places where you do the approximation is after when you go far away along the stable, the state, the unstable manifold. And the rest, so once. So, once you are close to the manifold, you just drift using the dynamics of the stable and non-stable manifold. Okay, I'm going to skip the construction of the escaping wandering domains, which is completely different. It uses basically infinitely many attracting basins composed with a translation. So, I'm going to skip this, keep it possibly for the questions, and I'm going to move to the escaping components to escaping to Baker domains. To baker remains. Is there questions? I know this was sketchy. So let me move to Baker Domains. Well, this is not the official name. The official name is Escaping Components, but Baker Domain sounds more poetic for the talk. And let me tell you. And let me tell you briefly what type of examples we have. And the interesting thing here is that we do get an example of a map with Jacobian one, delta equals to one, on which we still have this escaping for two components converging on the line of infinity. And we have other examples in which a Jacobian is bigger than one, but we get very nice Frank-Mann limit function. So we have example one. Is I'm gonna write the explicit form of the map so that you get the idea of how this is constructed. This is with Arozio, Furness and Peters. And the specialty of this construction is that it has a Baker domain, an invariant Baker. Baker domain with the following properties. The iterates converge to one single point, 110. It's b holomorphic to C times H, which is reasonably interesting, I find. And there exists a conjugacy, obviously, to the linear part. And obviously, colomorphic. Okay, so the nice feature about this is, in my view, what is cool, apart that it was the first example, is that this is minus one. So like the Jacobian S modulus one. This is not an expensive map. The other examples are with different people. Are with different people. So this one is with Sarako and Zeta. And it's a different type of math, thinking it's in a different way, which is f of z w equals e to the minus z plus 2 w, z. And you see this time the Jacobian is no longer of modus one. And again, this has an invariant Baker domain. Invariant data domain. And in this case, the features are a bit different. I'm going to keep that for comparison. Is that you have that the even iterates converge to some limit function h1, which goes, of course, from omega to the line at infinity, and the odd iterates converge to a different function. Iterates converge to a different function, h2, that you can write as 2 over h1, again from omega to the line at infinity. And what I think is interesting is that they have rank one. So the limit sets h i of omega is equal to the line at infinity minus zero infinity. So it's really rank one. Thanks. Except for two points. Yes. To one and although I think the geometric structure is kind of interesting because this is B holomorphic to H times H, so it's hyperbolic, and again, there exists a linearization to the linear part. And finally, which I think is also interesting for different reasons, why one may wonder this limit set, this is the line at infinity minus. This is the line at infinity minus two points, so it's not a hyperbolic set. Can you have limit sets which are hyperbolic? And those are like in this example, the two limit sets you have two different limit functions, but the limit sets coincide. They are the same set. They're just flipped. If you, it's not true. So there is no, I think you can prove that there is no extension of any type of the map on the line at infinity. Okay, I think this may be one of the reasons why it's not difficult. Why it's not difficult, or this we manage to construct examples where the limit functions are rank one. One of the big obstacles to getting rank one limit functions in the polynomial Henon case, as far as I understand, is that the dynamics on the boundary of two components seems to kind of prevent this one-dimensional limit set. And this is what Jubich and Peters use to discard the existence of the limit set on the boundary of the photo component when. Of the fatal component when the Jacobian is small enough. Okay, but of course, if you converge to the line at infinity, you have no extension of the map. And in fact, you can also not extend along the fatal component, which is a bit counterintuitive to me at least. And so there is no dynamics on the limit sets in a way. This may be the reason why we get it for transcendental kinemaps and possibly not for polynomials. And we do not find a way. For this very reason, there is basically no way. Very reason, there is basically no way that we found to transfer these rank one limit functions from the line at infinity to the finite part of the plane. So, the last example is again rank one limit functions. It's a very similar map, apparently, but quite different dynamically. So, it's e to the minus z squared plus 2 e to the pi i w. So, again, expansion, but with a rotation by pi. And this has a And this has a cycle of Baker domains. And then this is the last thing I'm going to tell you for today. Omega 1, omega 2, omega 3, omega 4. And they have the following properties. So again, the even iterates and the odd iterates converge. And the odd iterates converge to different things, and they are related. Okay, not as nice as the other ones, but they are related for every eye. And what I think is particularly interesting is that for each of them, H1 of omega one. Of omega one and omega three is equal to the right half plane and H two of omega one omega three is equal to the left hand plane. Okay, and it switched for omega two and omega four. So the limit sets are hyperbolic and disjoint. I think this is kind of interesting. Well, at least I tried to prove that you could not have hyperbolic limit sets for a while. And another, well, the geometric structure is the same as before. So this is not new, this is holomorphic to H times H, and there exists the linearization. Okay, so I could end with a long list of open questions that we can stop anytime, but maybe I could take questions before or what do the organizers think? I do have some open questions on this on this chat. On this step, on this escaping factor component. And I thought it would be kind of interesting to list some of them, but maybe I could take questions from the audience before, and this is what to say. So let's do the question.
