Thanks a lot. There we go. Okay. Thanks a lot for the first of all for the invitation. As we were saying, it's a pity it cannot be in person. Also for the very nice introduction. And yeah, I'm sorry I cannot be in person. And furthermore, I'm sorry I cannot I would not be able to join most of the other talks because I'm at an overlapping workshop that that is taking place in person in Germany. That is taking place in person in Germany. And so, in particular, I'd like to apologize also to Lars because I missed your talk. And so, there might be some overlap in kind of the things that I'll be discussing here. Okay. So, I was asked rather than to give like an overview of the swamp plant program, that I'm more like to, this is supposed to be a discussion session on progress, challenges, and prospects of the swamp plan program. So, the way this will go is, I will be giving up. is I will be giving a short talk, like half an hour talks, hopefully. If not, please let me know. On some aspects on the swamp plan, I will focus, I'll be focusing also on mostly on what are the challenges, what are the things that we cannot do in the swamp approach, okay? But again, this is only meant as a starting point to get the discussion going. Okay, this is what we should be doing is really discussion. So that means that at any point, you should please interrupt me. And usually I say, You should please interrupt me, and usually I say that you should interrupt me with questions or whatever. Now, you should interrupt me with for whatever reason. You have a comment, you have a thought that is kind of like trading off a little bit. You want to say, What about this? What about that? This is what this kind of event is supposed to be. Okay, so please just interrupt me for whatever. Okay, it's unfortunately that we cannot do this in person, which is a lot more familiar. I cannot see your face and so on. So, just interrupt, okay? Good. So, I'll start with a very with a brief introduction about the about this one. A brief introduction about what the swamp land is, like just very high view. So, the swamplan program starts like I guess most people here, a lot of people are here, because we are interested in trying to understand quantum gravity, what are the effects when quantum mechanism and general relativity come strong. And so the standard answer to the question, when does quantum parity matter, is that, well, gravitational interactions are very, very weak. Interactions are very, very weak. The energy scale associated to this is a non-normal, even the kinetic term of the graviton field is non-normalizable, and it has an associated energy scale of 10 to the 19 GB, that's Planck mass. And so it's extremely out of reach. It doesn't seem like you're going to be able to do any particle physics experiment like LHC, for instance, which probes energy scales of a TV. This is very far out of the way. So there might be interesting physics around the corner or at the energy scale and also in different sectors, like principal. Scale and also in different sectors, like for instance, without dark matter or whatever, that will also be even lighter than the electroweak scale. But the usual law is that, you know, because gravitational effects, you expect they're suppressed by this power of n Planck, well, you don't expect that you're going to be able to do anything in the near future. And so, you know, you could just turn to work on very interesting problems in dark matter, particle physics, so on and so forth, from Muller Lauren's Victor Theory approach. Or, if you're still interested in quantum gravity, you can focus on theoretical problems. You can try to understand what happens in situations where you engineer gravity to be strong, even if you cannot access them experimentally nowadays. Like, for instance, you can ask what does happen when a black hole evaporates, right? So, questions of black hole evaporation, there are fundamental questions that you can ask and people are actually answering in very general terms. In very general terms. Or you could also go to cosmology, where the high energy densities in the early phase of the universe in the inflationary regime probably allow you to, they bridge to a large extent the gap between the energy that you can access in this huge energy scale. So that's all good. But it seems very hard to pinpoint things that are actually universal in properties of quantum gravity at low energies. Like from this discussion, there would seem that there is none. Well, the basic idea of the Swampana. Basic idea of the Swampland approach, of the Swamp Land program, is the observation, or the I would say this is pretty well established by now that in some sense, this is not true. There are consequences. There are universal things that one can say about effects of quantum gravity at low energies, even if the argument before suggests otherwise. And the reason for this is that I would say that at the basic level is something like the equivalence principle. It doesn't make sense to It doesn't make sense to talk about gravity by itself without talking about its coupling to matter, and therefore it's natural to talk about the properties of matter. So, if we are talking about not just gravity, but gravity with matter, the Lagrangian that we should write down is something like this. That is the Einstein-Hilbert term plus some quantum field theory Lagrangian, which is the Lagrangian of low-energy effective field theory. And, you know, we know there's a lot to know in quantum field theories, but I think it's fair to say that we actually know a lot already. lot already and we can actually write down quantum field theories that we believe are completely fine the basic approach in the sample and program is that there are quantum theories that quantum field theories that we believe are completely fine on their own but can never appear like this in the low energy effective field theory of a theory of gravity so they're coupled to gravity via the square root of minus g term here okay um so that leads to a picture which is the picture one usually draws when discussing the swamp plant which is like the looks like a fried egg Looks like a fried egg. So you draw a blue blob, and the blue blob is the space of all concealed all quantum field theories that you can write down. And within this blob, there's some smaller region which represents the quantum field theories that you can consistently couple to gravity. And those are said to be in the landscape. The rest of them, all the other theories that you cannot consistently couple to gravitation, are usually called Are usually called, they're referred to by contraposition to the landscape. The landscape is a nice place, is where you would like to be. And so, all the other guys, which are perfectly nice quantum field theories, but not stuff that will arise when coupled with gravity, you call the swamp. So, the basic idea of the swampland program, what we want to do in the swamp run program, is to find out which is the problem. Could I ask a question? Please, please. You were saying there's evidence. You were saying there's evidence, yes, that they cover us. So, so will you tell us the evidence? Yes, yes, that will be actually one of the main points of what I'm saying now. What is the evidence and how to make it better? Well, is it evidence or is it conjecture? It's for some things, it's evidence. For some things, actually proofs. For some other things, it's evidence and they remain very conjectural. And I will distinguish these two. This is like. Okay, I will come back to asking questions. Come back to asking questions. Okay, yeah, please. Please do. This is what this is for, okay? For to have a good discussion. Okay, so the idea of the Swampland program is we want to ascertain which features of quantum gravity are universal, which things can distinguish theories in the blue blob from theories in the green blob. Okay? So now, can we prove this? Can we can we so what's the evidence of this or how can you? What's the evidence of this, or how can you argue for it in general? And the answer is: if you're asking, can you prove any of these things in full generality? The answer is in general, no, because we don't have a framework to prove things in general in quantum gravity. We can have proofs in particular contexts, which have very large regimes of validity, like holography or preservative string theory. And we can also give arguments coming from Black. Give arguments coming from black hole physics that are, you know, they relate some of the swamp plan properties to properties of black hole evaporation and stuff like that, which we believe is completely general. But the ongoing work in the swamp plan program is to, on one hand, to prove swampland conjectures in as many general contexts as we can, check the conjectures when we cannot prove them, and on the other hand, for those principles that we believe work, we want to apply. That we believe work. We want to apply and propose them, to propose new conjectures and apply them in the context of phenomenological interest. So, this is a web of some conjectures, some of the more, perhaps more famous conjectures. And some of them, for instance, like the absence of global symmetries, this is basically, I would say, established. Completeness hypothesis is closely related to the absence of global symmetries. The Wiggerati conjecture. The Wyguardi conjecture also has a lot of support for it. And as you go down this diagram, the conjectures get more and more interesting, but there's less and less support for them. So actually, as I said, this is just to entice discussion. So I'm not going to be giving you a review on Swaplan. There's several reviews recently by Pafa and French, Palti, and the most recent one is by Valenzuela and Friends. She also gave a review talk at Strings 2021 that you could check. So yeah, so one of the things that I wanted to focus the discussion a little bit on is what is the support for these Ramblin' conjectures and how can we make it better? So swambling statements, they typically have two kinds of support. So there's general arguments coming from black hole physics. Sometimes you can argue that there will be You can argue that there will be a problem with entropy bounds or very general properties of radical physics. And the resulting statements you believe are true in any theory of gravity, which is Einstein at low energies. And there is also, well, you make such different arguments, it's good to ask yourself if you miss something. So you can check the argument against string theory. So also another avenue of support for the swamp plan is that there's significant empirical evidence. Is there's significant empirical evidence coming from string theory compactifications. And as I said, you can sometimes upgrade this evidence to proof in restricted contexts. But each different statement has different degrees of support, so not all statements are born equal. And as I said, some plan conjectures, they tend to fall into a diagram like this. They tend to form along this red line, where the more interesting ones, the more interesting statements, they tend to be. ones the more interesting statements they tend to be the the less rigorous um um so some somebody has called this this this picture i the first time i saw it was from hiroshio guri and some people have referred to this as the oguri hertzprung russell diagram like referring to the diagram in astrophysics which is the the main sequence where um stars uh typically live um so for to give you just the example of two conjectures that are probably Example of two conjectures that are probably at the extremes of the interest versus certainty diagram. On one hand, something that we are pretty certain is that there's no global symmetry in quantum gravity. For instance, in holography, in alias CFT, you can prove this. It's just a consequence, essentially a consequence of Nether's theorem in the dual CFT. You can also prove it in perturbative string theory. And recently, there's been even some arguments using all the story about black hole evaporation. Story about black hole evaporations, islands, and entanglement entropy to argue that global symmetries are indeed broken in gravity. But saying that a theory has no global symmetries, it's not very powerful constraint, because that just means that the symmetries are either gauged or broken. And if they are gauged, the gauge coupling can be very small, so you wouldn't notice. Or if they are broken, the scale at which they're broken can be very high. So it's not very constrained. On the other hand, you get statements like, for instance, the observed fact that in all strictly asymptotic limits, this is like a generalization of the Dynesiber problem, in all asymptotic limits that you can find in string compactifications. And by asymptotic, I really mean strictly asymptotic. There doesn't seem to be, there's several different kinds of nogo theorems that show that you cannot get the sitter solutions there. Solutions there. So, you know, you could start with these statements about asymptotic potentials. And there's one family conjecture, which is the non-decider conjecture, that tries to conjecture that something like that, or there are variants of the weaker versions of it, like the TCC bound, which says that there can be a desitter but has a very long lifetime, that extrapolates sort of. That extrapolates sort of this evidence that you have in perturbative coordinates in string theory, and they try to make it into a general statement, the general points of the string landscape. So, for instance, for these ones, they are basically supported by empirical evidence coming from string compactifications. Or this one, for instance, is supported by a black hole argument, but not a very, not, they certainly don't have the same amount of support that the absence of global symmetries has. Okay. Okay. So, with this basic introduction to how the swamp plan works, I think I can get the way I've been writing things is to build up towards the first challenge. I'm going to present five challenges that I think the swamplan program should address. And so, one challenge that I think we should try to address is indeed how tracks is the interesting corner of the Aguri Herzpron. corner of the of the Auguri-Herzprun Russell diagram which is this green blob here uh that's conjectures which are of which we are certain of and which are at the same time interesting okay um so I will tell you that there's we we've so some progress has been happening in this one program I will say in the past few years is the observation that this novel osmetric conjecture can actually move here can be Move here can become both interesting and rigorous if one uses supersymmetry, one combines it with supersymmetry. Now, that's not ideal from the point of view of connecting to the real world because in the end you want to study situations with very little to no supersymmetry. But as a point of principle, that these swampling constraints can really say something interesting really about low-energy physics is this. This is, I think, I think it's quite exciting. So, for instance, I'm referring to works mainly by the group of Harbar. So there's Kumbunbafa, Hicho Kin, Hori Tarasi, and also Penn, Ling Ling, Zaos, Vetik, Heckman, Diarigal, also Washington Taylor and collaborators. They have been exploiting swamp and arguments where you combine supersymmetry. Where you combine supersymmetry to the supersymmetry with things like absence of global symmetries to put interesting values in the low-energy physics. I'm going to give you, I'm going to briefly mention an example of this. And this is an example of a project I worked in. So that's the one which is for me I'm most familiar with. So for instance, in a paper with Kumbrun Baffa last year, we were analyzing supergravities in seven, eight, and nine dimensions. Eight and nine dimensions. These supergravities, they are characterized by having a number of vector multiplets. You can have, you know, in principle, any number of vector multiplets: one, two, three, four, whatever. So, and then you go and you ask, okay, which values of the number of vector multiplets do I get in string compactifications? And there are some string compactifications that give you 17 vector multiplets. Another one gives you 9, another one gives you 1. But you don't get the values in between. And so we were actually able. In between, and so we were actually able to show that this is a consequence of supersymmetry coupled with the absence of global symmetries. Basically, we were lucky there was a global symmetry that you could argue was anomalous. But the point is that using supersymmetry, you can often access this interesting corner of the diagram of conjectures. So, I mean, we can discuss some more later on, or we can. Discuss some more later on, or we can stop now. If anybody wants to make a point or a comment, or please do so. Okay. Yes. Well, I can see that it is increasing probably in regard, but I don't see any why this is above the global symmetry statement. The global symmetries are more interesting than this. Well, so what I mean is by interesting here, I mean synonymous with. Interesting here, I mean synonymous with constraining really the deep IR of the theory. So, if I tell you, for instance, if I tell you the standard model, suppose that I tell you that B minus L is actually a broken symmetry, but I don't tell you which scale is broken. That's not really a very interesting constraint or low energy. You don't learn anything about standard model at low energies, right? On the other hand, for me, this is not very interesting. I mean, I mean, just I get a definition greater than six, and uh, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Right, your definition of interest, but if I would plot that the interesting thing about this diagram, I have called interest the physical interest in questions. No, I agree. And that's why the funnel plan is limited. No, no, no, look, look, look, look, I agree. So, so, okay, so, so there's several different definitions of interesting. So, what I mean, so this you can take the definition of interesting that it's interesting if it can, okay, so what I mean. interesting if it can. So when I said interesting, I really meant that it's able to constrain low energy physics. This is in general a problem for swampling constraints. So what we did here is like, okay, you know, fine, let's just do it in higher dimensions. And actually, so, and I agree with you, in the end, you want to go back to the more interesting questions of four dimensions. But at least you're getting constraints on low energy physics, which was non-trivial to do from this point of view. And honestly, to me, this was very, okay, actually, to me, this is very interesting because it was very surprising. Every time I was thinking about no global symmetries, Was thinking about no global symmetries. I was thinking like this: it's not going to give you interesting principles, interesting stuff at low energies. And now, with this, we actually did it. And not only that, we found that precise match with string theory. So, from no global symmetries argument, you get that the allowed values of the rank are 1, 9, and 17. So, you get the precise match of a lower effective field theory parameter with what string theory predicts. So, you get something like string universality. Now, of course. Now, of course, in the end, you want to do it for the low cases with no lower dimensions and lower supersymmetries. But this is a proof of interest. Probably the label of the vertical line instead of interest, put low energy, low energy, relevant low energy, something like that. Yeah, okay, that's a fair point, I think. Yes. But so my point, so what I would do the only thing I want to focus here, Fernando, is that I agree with your interests, but it's, you know, like baby steps. Like baby steps, so it was that if we were having this conversation two years ago, you could be saying something like, Well, but I mean, there's no global symmetries doesn't ever do anything as lowergies, and you know, I would probably have agreed. And I would have agreed. But I think global symmetries are very, very, very good. I mean, there are many people doing boundary building in the past. They were just imposing global symmetries at any low energy effective theory beyond the standard models. Oh, let's impose the symmetry and let's do this. And now you can, straight theory is telling you: no, no, you cannot play that game. Cannot, you cannot play that game. So, that's already put in very strong constraints and low energies. You can say, oh, probably that symmetry may be, as you say before, that may be broken gauge symmetry very, but I think it changes the rules of the game somehow because people are not free to add something. But they don't look, but they don't, unless if you just say there's no robust images, that doesn't change the rules of the game at a quantitative level. Because anybody can still write whatever effect. Because anybody can still write whatever effective field theory they want with global symmetries and say, oh, sure, there's going to be broken by some effect, which is, you know, the Planck scale or like beyond, or, you know. So, but then they're less trustable. So this is an extra layer of assumptions. And before that wasn't the extra layer was not there. People say, oh, let's put any symmetry I want. Yes. Global symmetries are a very strong result. And if it is true, it's a very If it is true, it's very important. I agree qualitatively. But it's, yes, I think I see your point. To me, it's the really the I got really excited about this because I have the hope that actually in some cases you can make it more concrete to use arguments like the ones you can use in nine dimensions with extension supercharges, but do them for the standard model, for instance, stuff like the standard model or extensions of the standard model. Okay, so that's Standard model, okay. So that's that's that's the idea. Uh, once you learn how to do it in the cases under control, you do it what would you have expected for a standard model? I don't think. Oh, oh, no, no, no. So, what I'm saying is, okay, so for instance, this is actually this is actually something I'm thinking about. But for instance, like things the so the way this constraint of low energies for non-gloss images works in nine dimensions is because basically saying that the design symmetry that is broken has to be objects that break it. Broken, it has to be objects that break it, then you can then do compactifications with these objects, and that leads to new anomalies that you would not have studied from a field theory point of view. And so, you can ask the same question with global symmetry in the standard model, and then that leads you to think about competitions of the standard model in weird backgrounds. And maybe, for instance, you can say things like when you have like proton triality, maybe that can constrain the number of generations, that kind of thing, with arguments like that. Okay. No revolution. Okay. Thank you. Peter has a question. Yes, yes, yes, please. Well, I have a question. So, in in this plot, when you have S T in the lowest, that's string theory or what? Yes, yes, that's string theory. No, because there's one thing maybe one should, from the general point of view, distinguish. You see, if you assume string theory, then a lot of the conjectures are pretty empty. Yeah? So, so therefore, I've So, therefore, I think one should maybe separate the issues. What is a string theory result? So, I very well believe this weak gravity conjecture in string theory. Yeah, I think one can prove it there. But that is not the statement. So, actually, when we are looking at the real swamp land, of course, we could say string theory is the only game. The only game in town, so let's forget it. Quantum gravity has to be string theory. Then it's fine, but still, I think, given this general statement about evidence, we don't have evidence that string theory is the only theory of quantum gravity. So maybe one should separate that. And okay, this is one thing. So these arguments, which are bigger than six or ten or eight. Big bigger than six or ten or eight, of course, they are in a certain way string theory state. No, no, no. Let me let me this is just super gravity. No, they assume supergravity, but supergravity is not the same as string theory. You can but you say string supergravity. No, you okay, so this is an argument, for instance, the one I was just discussing works for any theory of supergravity in, say, eight dimensions. You take an eight-dimensional supergravity and ask which ones are consistent, and then you can say, well, maybe there's a consistent one which has. And then you can say, Well, maybe there's a consistent one which has rank three. And there's no string theory talking here. But then you say, Oh, well, if you have the rank three one, then there would be a global symmetry that imposes no global symmetries. You follow through the argument that we did, and then you find that rank three is inconsistent, and at no point string theory enters the argument. Okay, okay, okay. But so that on one hand, that's good, but on the other hand, you have a very good point, I think. And in fact, you're just anticipating challenge number four, I think, which is because for some other conjectures, it really is like you're. Because for some other conjectures, it really is like you're saying. And that's a problem. Okay, I only also have a remark about this question about the usual no global symmetry argument. If I take, for example, low energy effective field theory and I have a global symmetry, that is a low energy artifact. So you could break it at high energies. You said that yourself. So from that point. So from that point of view, you see a lot of things that might be swampland. From that point of view, you cannot declare because you see, if gravity is weak at the Planck scale, if I have a standard model symmetry, global symmetry, this is broken by Planck scale operators, and that's fine. So this is no problem with, from that point of view, there is no problem with the low energy theory. Yeah, you might have different arguments why it's in the swampland, but from this one you cannot really. And you asked me two years ago, I have agreed with you. And what I've learned in these two years is using supersymmetry, you can sometimes make stronger arguments. It's not just non-global symmetry, it's global, not global symmetry, plus supersymmetry. Okay? Okay. Yeah, so yes. Can I maybe offer another argument? Can I maybe offer another argument? So, I think one sort of very interesting example that is, I guess, not typically discussed. Well, it's not really like in the same swamp plant type spirit. But if you think about the black hole information paradox, I think it's sort of a similar effect that you see there. Because there, I think there are good arguments to expect that sort of around in a place where curvatures are still very low, like around the page time, there is basically there should be some sort of modification. There should be some sort of modification to basically standard semi-classical gravitational physics in order to be consistent with unitarity. So then it's a question, I think in that case, you're still sort of far away from the Bank scale, but you do expect that there are some effects that modify sort of your standard description. But then I guess the question is what that is. I mean, there are these developments, replica wormholes, and those give you some ideas and you can discuss how much quantum gravity that really is. Quantum gravity, that really is. But I think it's clear there should be some sort of modification at least of the standard description. So I think I would call it sort of shonky in nature. So I didn't hear the last part, Lars, but I agree. I vaguely mentioned this before and it's going to come up again. But yeah, there's universal arguments also that they're getting increasingly precise. But I think you guys are jumping to challenge number four. So I hope you get back to this point. So, I hope you get back to this point. But I guess I should. This is great, by the way. Thanks so much for participating. But, but I think maybe I can get going because it's already half an hour and it's challenge one out of five. Yeah, is there any other comment? There is another question from Alan. Right, I just wanted to ask: is T-duality a global or a local symmetry? T-duality is a locality. If you ask me, The duality is a local, if you ask me, the duality is a local symmetry. Why? Because, okay, so one simple way that you can, because you can do it locally. You could say it like that. Okay, so for instance, you can consider backgrounds which are called like T-falls, right? So you can do compactifications where you do a T-duality transformation and you glue to configurations. There's two configurations, like with radius R, radius one, over R, they're really identified, right? Yeah, but it's not clear to me. Yeah, but it's not clear to me why it is local. I mean, it's uh let me okay. Perhaps with the argument, for instance, if you're doing t-duality in hydrotic string theory, I think in hydrotic, someone correct me if I'm wrong, but if you go to the cell dual radius, you see that t-duality is a Z2 subgroup of. Yeah, I mean, there is you can do it, you have a continuous parameter that you can vary. You get massless gauge bosons. Sorry? Sorry? You get massive. Yeah, but let's take a different. Is mirror symmetry a global or a local symmetry? So mirror symmetry is more like a change of coordinates, right? It's really the same theory you're describing in two different ways. Type 2A in one background, it's the same as type 2B in the mirror collaborator, right? So there's no notion. There's no notion. You could perhaps. I don't want to. You can maybe think of it as what's called local description. I think that the question you're hinting at is, are dualities global symmetries? And the answer is no. They're either redundancies of the description, or sometimes you can also understand them as spontaneously broken gauge symmetries. Okay, so let me give you perhaps another example. No, no, I agree. Okay, fine. Okay. Yeah. Just a comment is that, I mean, Comment is that, I mean, the result of strometer and YAW and so on, that where they reduce meter symmetry to T-duality. Oh, that's right. Both are global or both are local. Good, good, good. So I was thinking, good, good, good. So, so when you can glue two things, for instance, is when you do two T-dualities. So you can glue type 2A back to itself, right? Or type 2A back to itself. And so, okay, so good. I would say that I would say it's more like a spontaneously broken gauge symmetry sort of. It's like this type. Engage symmetry sort of is like the step to a step to B. Yeah, could be. I mean, it's anyway, it's okay. I mean, I'm honest. Something to think about at this moment. No, definitely. So, for some other dualities, it's clearer to me. So, for instance, like for SL2C duality of type to be string theory, that is, you could think of it as spontaneously broken gauge symmetry. You have the axiodilaton, right? And then you have different values of the axiodilaton. And, you know, tau is really identified to. You know, tau is really identified to tau plus one, but you could also say that it's spontaneously broken by the web of the X-ray latter. And you can actually go to points like tau equals i, where these subgroups of this thing become unbroken, and you can have a connection there. All right, good, thank you. But yeah, Fernando, I think you have a good point, Fernando. You should think that's a gaze image, I think. It was just a comment. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, yeah, no thanks. Okay. Okay, so supersymmetry is very nice. I think I tried to. Are you guys still hearing me? I just got the thing that my connection was unstable. Is it okay? We hear you well. Okay, good. Sorry. I'm a bit worried about that. So supersymmetry is very nice and it gives us a lot of control. But okay, the natural question is challenge number two. What can you do without supersymmetry? Do without supersymmetry or with little supersymmetry, okay. And unlike in the previous one, where I told you the question and some interesting answers, I think. For this one, I don't think I have general good ideas. But that's why this is a discussion, right? So, for instance, one thing that one can do is that, so there's a framework, for instance, which allows. So, there's a framework, for instance, which allows you to analyze systematically the scalar potentials that arise in n equals one supergarries in four dimensions using theory of mixed structures and the like. So you can find principle a general classification of what limits can happen there in principle. And so already that assumes n equals one, so it's not n equals zero. Was one, so it's not then equals zero. And another setup, in which again, I'm more familiar because I work a bit on this, in which you can perhaps say something universal, hopefully, is in situations where perhaps you don't have supersymmetry, but you have some sort of extra dimensions, some compact dimensions. And then you can wonder if there's no supersymmetry, there's nothing preventing the vacuum to decay. Perhaps you can have universal results in decay channels. In decay channels of non-supersymmetric vacuum, like bubbles of nothing. So it seems to be like people, there's recent literature by myself together with Ignati Artezabaria, Irene Valentina Quapazosa, or Divitetto, Petriskilo, and more recently by Divitetto Bowman and Cassani, in which they are able to construct. They're able to construct relative, so you basically were able to construct bubbles of nothing, which are basically configurations in which the extra dimensions of compactification shrink to a point and produce an instability that then expands at the speed of light. There's nothing inside. That's why it's called a ball of nothing. So it seems like we can construct balls of nothing in much more general situations than was previously thought. And in particular, the result by Diviteto and France, the last paper, is. by Diviteto and France, the last paper is very interesting because there was another actually another swamp and conjecture that one cannot have non-supersymmetric ADS. That one was inspired in string theory constructors. And then this is the one thing that I find very nice about the Swampland program is that there's one conjecture and then there's people who are like trying to prove it and there are people trying to disprove it. And there are people trying to disprove it. So, for instance, for this one, there was a paper. Actually, I don't know what the motivation was that, but to the effect that's what they were doing. There was a paper a couple or three years ago introducing, but I think Oscar Varela and Lofo Guarino, they were introducing vacua with introducing certain vacuums of massive type 2A supergravity, which were not supersymmetric. Symmetric, and you know, they were surviving any attempt to show that they had any kind of instability, any kind of instability or anything. You know, they were shown to be perturbatively stable, then people showed that they were stable. Also, if you take into account all the galocycline modes, then people showed that this was stable against brain nucleation. And now, these people found a bubble of nothing that makes this vacuum unstable. So, perhaps trying to get universal results in, you know, Universal results in, you know, about what is the action or what the ingredients you need to have all of nothing. So that to put universal upper lifetimes, even if they are very long for the vacuum, is very interesting. So that's one thing that you can see that here, rather than giving you interesting ideas, I'm just giving you approaches, which I think maybe can pan out, but I really don't know. And another thing that is happening recently is papers by Recently, these papers by particularly by Curiori, Paramelbaran, and Donini, and also Tim Ras. We are starting to, well, we already started. I think also Alan wrote papers on this, of course. We are starting to explore non-supersymmetric string theories. So non-supersymmetric string theories, you have a very interesting interplay where you have the space-time spectrum, the Bosons and Fermians do not match. Bosses and fermions do not match, and yet they conspire in such a way that the UV behavior of things like the vacuum energy is much tamer than just a random field theory. Um, so it also, I think this is also something that at least I'd like to understand better, not super strict theories. And let me just end with challenge number two by asking if there's any experts here that maybe can clarify this for me. So the spectrum of non-suppression is streaming. The spectrum of non-spread energy stream theories has this almost post-Fermi degeneracy, which is not exact. But if you go to a very high energy level, the difference between the number of bosons and the number of fermions compared to the total number of bosons of fermions goes to zero. So at very high energies, it almost looks like a supersymmetric theory. And the worst sheets that we have are always supersymmetric. So I'm wondering if non-supersymmetric theories are actually secretly supersymmetric in the UV. Yeah, so I just, yeah. Yeah, so I just, if anyone has anything to say here or to comment or the heterotic string theory is on one sector, it's not super symmetric, right? Yeah, sure, but because you need to level match in the end, like the actual specific level match states is right for each fermion, you have a positive theory which is zero, one supersymmetric is the suppression metric, right? Metric records. Yeah, that's just something I was wondering about. There is another question from Alan. Yeah, no, just a comment on your question on misaligned supersymmetry, which is in four dimensions or dimensions or uh in um and ultimately it's uh it's it's i think the arises from the modular properties of the of the partition function has maybe well elaborated by by other authors uh also by susha recently yeah uh but yeah i think just uh because you asked is it uh secretly uh supersymmetric Super symmetric. So take another example, but compactify to two dimensions. And there you have what Costas Kunas called and Yanis Loakis and others called massive supersymmetry. So it takes something similar to the Jacobi identity. You know, the Jacobi identity is V8, the vector character minus S8. Minus SA and that gives you the Jacobi identity. So the vector character in A dimension minus the spinal character. That's the Jacobi identity, which is the origin of supersymmetry. So take that in two dimensions. You have V24 minus S24, which is the vector minus the spin, but in quantification to two dimensions, that's equal to 24. 24. That's just an identity of theta functions. So the theta function identity, which gives you a mismatch at the masses level, because it's equal to a constant. But there is the massive spectrum is supersymmetric because you understand. Right, right, right. I don't understand the details, but I roughly see what you mean. Yeah, so it comes about from an identity of data functions. Of data functions. So it's a Jacobi-like identity, but in quantification to two dimensions. Right, right. So what I'm wondering. And if you then interpolate to four dimensions, there will be a remnant of this identity in the spectrum. So you may have a mismatch at the massive level, but there will be a matching at the massive spectrum. At the massive spectrum. So, if you read the papers by Kunas and Florakis, they discuss this. Okay, yeah, thanks a lot. Maybe we can move on if there's no other points related. I mean, this is just my take on what you can do without supersymmetry. If anybody else has any other ideas, I'd be happy to look. Okay, so there's one more point that I wanted to bring here, which is, okay, fine, maybe asking what we can do. Maybe asking what we can do with or without supersymmetry is too difficult. So maybe we can go to an easier question, which is: could one argue that any consistent quantum theory of gravity in some form must have fermions? So this is like an easier thing. Like, okay, so maybe if you want to argue that, you know, supersymmetry is necessary for stability or you want to understand things without supersymmetry, you could first ask, supersymmetry requires fermions. You could ask, is there any possible quantum theory of gravity which doesn't have fermions? Which doesn't have fermions. And then when you read this question, the answers that would pop to my head would be like, well, it's obviously not necessarily look about bosonic string theory. But we don't really know if bosonic string theory has fermions, for instance, at the non-perturbative level. Or you could ask about the dual to Vassiliev theory, which is the ohm vector model, and that's a bosonic CFT. So there would be a theory of quantum gravity in ADS with affirmations. But the fact that the boundary The fact that the boundary CFT doesn't have a certain kind of states, like fermions, doesn't mean that you don't have them in the bulk. For instance, depending on boundary conditions in ADS CFT, for instance, you can find boundary conditions for a 3D CFT such that the dual ADS4 cannot have monopoles. And that doesn't mean that it doesn't have monopoles. It just means that the total monopole charge in ADS has to vanish because of the boundary conditions. So maybe in Vasiliev theory, you can have massive non-perturbative fermions, but they must appear. Gravity fermions, but they must appear in pairs or something like that. So it's not an obvious point whether we can argue that any quantum gravity theory must have fermions or even light fermions, right? There is this coincidence that will appear later on that any, in the standard, in the real world, the scale of the cosmological constant and the scale of neutrino masses roughly match. Is that a coincidence or is there an argument that one could give? There's an argument that one could give for that. So, I actually find this question, it's to me, this is very interesting. It's on the sweet spot because this is the kind of things that you can perhaps tackle by using holography. So, it becomes a rigorous question and it's still very interesting. So, I just wanted to bring this, to give a little bit of a spotlight to this question. Okay. Okay, so challenge number three is what happens to the swampland conjectures with something that is called the something that has been there in the swamp literature from day one that actually is related to the idea that you can break a symmetry at an arbitrary energy scale that Hans Spitter was saying and then doesn't give you constraints at low energies, which is what people call the loophole in the swamp. Called the loophole in the swamp. So, what is the loophole? I'm going to explain what the loophole is quickly with the most well-known Swamp constraint, perhaps the Wiggarity conjecture. So, what does the Wiggardi conjecture tell you? It tells you there's some particle whose mass is lower than its charge in Planck units. So, it satisfies this inequality. There's some mu1 gauge field, and there's a charged particle whose mass is lower than its charge, like this. So, that's all good. But if you think about this, this is not really, this is a constraint on the Not really, this is a constraint on the spectrum of the theory, there's no question about it. It's giving you new information on the theory, but it's it might not be really like the way it's written here, it's really not giving you any information about what I would call, perhaps Fernando would disagree, but I would call like interesting stuff, like IR stuff, because we don't know what the value of this integer charge is, you know, like the regularity conjecture doesn't tell you. So, if the particle that satisfies the regularity conjecture has a charge of 10 to the 19, you know. Charge of 10 to the 19, you know, or you know, just some huge number, the mass on the left can be correspondingly very large, and maybe this particle is already a black hole, and it's not really an interesting constraint on the Lownery effectivity theory. And in fact, so far, there's no general argument for an upper bound on this parameter Q. So that's a very interesting problem that we need to work on. And so even though we have arguments, Even though we have arguments coming from black hole physics and this kind of stories for the Wiggarity conjecture, none of the arguments, as far as I know, gives you an upper bound on the value of the charge of the Wiggarity particle. So unless we do that, it's very difficult to argue purely generally without appealing to string theory that the Wiggarity conjecture constrains the low-energy physics. But then you go to string theory, you ask, what are the values of Q that you get in string? Ask what are the values of Q that you get in string theory? And sometimes you get, you know, you can, most of the time, you get one, every now and then you get two. And I think people know examples where Q is, you know, the last explicit example in perturbative string theory is six, and with F theory you can get to 10. So, you know, it's still in practice is true that this parameter is very small. So that's a very, that's, I think, is perhaps to me, this is the most important, one of the most important. The most important one of the most important problems in this one plan, and it's one I've been thinking about actively in perturbative string theory. And it's actually related to a couple of other questions that we cannot answer in general. So first of all, I'm just posing this as interesting questions for discussion to see if people have ideas or have thought about these things, which is, first of all, I don't think we have a general argument which tells us. Argument which tells us how many light fields you can have in quantum gravity for any quantum theory of gravity before you reach the Cutoff scale. For instance, if you think about, even with supersymmetry, if you look at supergarities coming from 14 equals 2 coming from Calabi-Yaus, because there's no Calabi-Yau which has Hutchinsum of order a million, there's no low energy effectivity theory that we can get in string theory, which has a million light fields, a massless field, like a million. A massless sheet, like a medium vector. There's probably some ways in which you can try to bound that. And in fact, you can argue for bounds like this to some extent in 80 CFT. And the number of massless fields that you can have often gets related to the size of the extra dimension, to the end of the Large N field theory. And if this charge in the regular particle, it's say n, then the n then the the the the the theory effectively at low energies has some sort of z n symmetry so it's also related to the question which now you can pose independently and nothing with gravity of how large can a discrete symmetry group be if you're given a a certain a certain energy scale for the cutoff of the effectivity theory. And the answer again is that in examples, in holographic examples, we know that we have explicit holographic examples which have, let's say, a Z and symmetry. Examples which have, let's say, a Z and symmetry with n arbitrarily large, but then the extra dimensions are of the order of the of the of the of the A D scale. And so it's a theory. It seems that you can get M to be very large if the curve of the effective theory comes down in Planck units. That seems to be a general trend, but it would be nice to have a proof or an idea for an argument for this. Yeah, so that's another set of questions that I find very interesting. Set of questions that I find very interesting. I don't know if there's any comments or questions regarding these points. Can I ask something? I always wonder, we discussed once a couple of years ago, remember. Remember, we had discussed about this something always in the back of my mind, the continuous spin representations of the concurrent group. I don't know if that can be called a swambling part because we don't know. Uh, swambland part because we don't know if the effective theory exists. So it can be beyond the outside of the swambler. So there should be an extra stage. But have you thought about that? Because I think that's very curious. I mean, the fact that Monkari invariance allows you to have them and you don't have them, it's an infinite number of them. And in string theory, you can easily see at this perturbative that they will not be there. So I think that I would like, I always wonder if that can be. I always wonder if that can be related to the Swamp Grand conjecture, but I realize that probably it's not even true that the effect of the TLX is. I don't know. Yeah, so, okay, so I was reading up a bit on this, and I think there's some old, I try, I can try to dig that up for you, but there's an old paper I think by Wigner, right? So he's the one who figured out these representations, and they're weird, right? So he says something to the effect that a box of continuous spin fields would have an infinite. Of continuous fields would have an infinite heat capacity, right? Yes, but I call that an entropy argument. That's an entropic argument, but you know, that's still... So in that sense, it's not an explanation. And then Weinberg says you haven't seen them in real life. So I've called that a phenomenological argument. Okay, but there's no explanation yet. I mean, that's one of the weak points on Weinberg. So where I say you try to do something with... So, whereas if you try to do something with perturbative stream theory, they are simply not there, period. You don't find it. So, that should be something that can be promoted to, I don't know, to some general statement or something about quantum gravity. I don't know. Use the comments. This is just for discussions. I think that that's one of the things that's always in the back of my mind. That's very nice. So, let me ask you then, because then let me ask you. So so let me ask you then because then let me ask because so I think that you proved that that there's not there is perturbable string theory so that's that that's it in perturbative string theory and of course the question is could they arise at like strong coping or something else right but but then you were unhappy with the entropic argument which I actually found very convincing you say it's not an it's not an explanation but but let me just phrase it a little bit differently okay but it is like an entropic I mean so there is capacity with the which should not exist so so so it's it's So it's not a real argument. So Weinberg doesn't use it in his book. He doesn't use it. But Weinberg is more pragmatic. And he said, well, we haven't seen them, so let's forget about them. That's not the perfect place for the explanation. I agree. So what I want to understand is what would Constantine explain for you? Because let me just do the following. Let me just modify just a little bit with Wigner's argument. So I will now just say that, you know, I. That you know, I believe that the entropy in some region of size R is upper bounded by this area. That's the holographic principle. You can have more entropy than a black hole of the same size. And now the continuous spin guys clearly violate this. So is that belief that is not a proof? I mean, there's not a question that you can solve and say this should not be there. That's the thing. That I think is what should be. Someone should be asking for things that you can prove that there are. Asking for things that you can prove that they are not there. These arguments are just hand-waving things, but there are no explanations of anything. So, Fernando, so you can prove what exactly, what kind of arguments you're, for instance, the thing that I just said, okay, this argument of Beckenstein boundaries, I haven't done it, but I believe you could actually turn into a very rigorous statement about why there's no continuous representations in ADA CFT. I was gonna say, and then I realized there's. I was gonna say, and then I realized there's no continuous representations of the conformal group. So, actually, that's entirely the truth. No, I think it would be nice to come up with, I mean, strong arguments, even for, I mean, as you say, in this case, it would be non-perturbative. And yes, I think that that would be nice to have. So, here, let me then perhaps emphasize something, which is, I like proofs as much as the next man, but a lot of the Man, but a lot of the Swamp Brand approach is not so much about proving things because, as I said, you can maybe prove it if you're lucky in ADCFT or in perjury string theory or this and that. There's not going to be a general. I don't think we have a general framework right now. A lot of it is about relations between conjectures and trying to unify lots of statements coming from just once. But maybe there's one that you don't prove, and maybe that one is still a belief, like things like the Beckingstein ball, which is what I just described. But I think there's a very reasonable belief that you can argue from entropy. You can argue from entropy arguments, sorry, from thought experience of black holes. You can argue about in AD CFT. And so, you know, you define things in just one belief. Even if you cannot prove that one belief, I think that's progress. Yes, at the end, the main thing we want is to prove something. That's that. I think the rest conjectures that we may have too many conjectures that may not be true. I think, no, I agree. But when one uses the word conjecture, But when one uses the word conjecture, that doesn't mean that it's like some random statement that is strong. Like this, a proof is best. But ultimately, what we want to know is which things are true. And there are things that are true and yet we cannot prove. And we are very convinced that are true, even if we cannot prove them, like ADS-CFT itself, for instance, like hasn't been proven. But, you know. Yes. No, I agree. I agree. There's something that you can accumulate evidence and then absolutely. I think we have to make progress as much as we can. We have to make progress as much as we can. There's no exactly, exactly. And for instance, I'm one of the people in the swamp, I think that I've been more obsessed with, like, let's just go through ADS and prove it. And sometimes that limits the scope of what you can do. But yeah, long story short, I agree with the continuous representations are very interesting. Sorry, everybody. Is this another question? Hi, Miguel. Sorry, I have my voice a little. Sorry, I have my voice is a little bit gone. I have a slight cold. Not COVID, but just a slight cold. That's fine. In ADS, what argument are you thinking about in terms of bounding light or massless fields? Are you thinking a black hole argument or a bootstrap type argument? You mean on the context of the discussion we just had with Fernando? Not for a continuous spin, but just here, here on the slide, you made a comment that you should be able to bound the number of light fields in ADS. The number of light fields in ADS on general brands? So, I don't know, I have no idea. So, from the bulk point of view, you could try and argue with things like the species bound and then try to argue for the species bound itself. This is actually a question that I ask in the Slack at strings. So, for instance, people from scattering amplitudes, you know, the bootstrap, the S-matrix bootstrap, that's the kind of questions that they. Matrix boots, right? That's the kind of questions that they might be able to address in the future. I think this would be easiest. Okay, for instance, so for the number of light fields, I'm not so sure, but you can try and you can okay. Let me actually wait a couple slides and then I tell you something more concrete that I think maybe could work for this, but maybe it's just a very long shot. Maybe it doesn't work. Okay. Okay. Sounds good. Okay. Maybe it's just one slide then. So I got. Just one slide there. So, I got the challenge number four, which is, I guess, what a lot of people here have been hinting at: which is if you want to argue for something in general, you want to prove things in general, you need to get outside of empirical string theory. It's great that you can prove something in particular string theory, but that's not the end of the world. So how can we prove things in general in quantum gravity? So, it's very nice that we have tools to prove things in AD CFT and also in flat space. In flat space. So, for instance, one thing that one can do is that you can show versions of the Vigarity conjecture by imposing unitarity and boundedness of scattering amplitudes or assumptions about entanglement entropy in ADCFT. And versions of these conjectures just come out as general statements. And notice ADCFT is actually, in a sense, more general than string theory. If it turns out that the string theory is all the quantum gravity there is, well, then it's the same. But otherwise, like any quantum theory. But otherwise, like any quantum theorizing ADS is described by a CFT, even if somehow it's not part of string theory. As Lars was indeed now, we can also show this history of global symmetries from islands and entanglements and so on. And I actually would like to highlight a nice paper by... Fortunately, I didn't write down the there was we got a nice talk at the swampland seminars. You can watch it in the YouTube channel. Can watch it in the YouTube channel by João Nedones. And they had this beautiful approach about imposing unitarity and vergibundance of scattering amplitudes. And they applied it to 10-dimensional string theory. So this is an example of something which is as far away from the real world as one can imagine. But they were actually able to bootstrap the value of a certain coefficient of the coefficient of high-relative term in the 100-Lagrangian, and the value they get. Lagrangian and the value they get for the for they get an interval they get a confidence interval this has to be between here and here and there's actually two values in string theory and they are both within this very small interval so that's i think a very good approach in which we might hope to prove things uh in in the in the near hopefully in the near future so that's something i like to learn the scattering amplitudes um uh so those are the and you can this way by thinking about perhaps Can this way by thinking about perhaps AD CFT, you can make a lot of questions like the questions that I was asking before, you can make them more rigorous. So, for instance, the order of discrete symmetry in the bulk, it's just the order of discrete symmetry in discrete global symmetry in a CFT with gap to the spin two primaries. So, for instance, if you have a Z and symmetry, let's say in 2D CFT, you can hope to use things like molar invariance to constrain these kind of things. To constrain these kinds of things. Another question: how many, like the question that Sab was interesting: how many light fields do we have before the cutoff? Well, this is the kind of question that, in a sense, people are studying with a particular version of this question is whether there's pure gravity in ADS3. And then people are trying to address this from the point of view of the model or bootstrap. So, this would be a generalization. Like, do you have instead of pure gravity, just pure gravity plus a quantum field theory, which is large n? Which is large n, and the dimensions of order, and it's just the field theory stuff and the dimensions of order the central charge. Is there a bound on the number of fields that the QFT can have? And it's not unthinkable that you can get things like this from modular bootstrap. There's one thing that the current approach to molar bootstrap doesn't do is the modular bootstrap is about imposing molar invariance of a partition function in a 2D CFT, but it doesn't, one thing that you One thing that it doesn't impose, you solve the consistency conditions over the reals, but the coefficients of the partition functions themselves are integers. So maybe that's something that we can use. So try to solve linear programming problems in the bootstrap over the integers. So that's, of course, a lot more complicated, but maybe there's some machine learning people that can help with that. And of course, with gravity conjecture, you can just relate to the dimension of the charge primary in the dual CFT. So maybe, Saf, maybe, maybe I maybe. So maybe Saf, maybe I maybe this to some extent it shows that I actually have no not a great idea, but uh I'm trying, as many of us are, I think. I mean, intuitively, there should be something sick about a theory with a trillion massive scalar fields and gravity. And it's very hard to make it precise why it's sick, but yeah. Yeah, I think it's easier if you're imposing that the effective Ethereum works up to some energy scale that you specify. Up to some energy scale that you specify, then it's way easier to prove. You can have arguments like if you have a trillion light fields at some point, like species bound arguments, like perturbatively, they're going to overrun the corrections to the right and propagator and so on and so forth. But the difficulty here is that you don't want to say that. You want to really constrain the set of massless fields. It's not a neat energy scale. So that makes it difficult. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, so I think this is like using holography to prove these things is promising, and there's techniques that people are developing. And I think this progress is happening perhaps relatively quick, I would say. It was only a few years ago that this was a bit unthinkable. There was a paper again by Penedones, Polcziski, and more people in 2009. And more people in 2009, in which they argue that the solutions of crossing symmetry in the dual CFT match order by order the corrections in, you know, match order by order the effective range that you can write on in ADS. So there would be like no swamp constraints coming from crossing symmetry unless you go to number two at the effects in n. And now people have linear functionals from the bootstrap point of view that do just that. Bootstrap point of view that do just that. So that's good. So challenge number five. It's a particular case, I think. I wanted to give at least one very, very, very concrete question, which is very interesting, I think, from the Swamp Land point of view. And actually, there was a bunch of discussions or like discussions on the Swamp Land in strings this year. And I think this was the one question in which everybody agreed. This was the one question in which everybody agreed it's super interesting, and we need to figure out. That's a concrete question, which is whether we can have a scale-separated ADS vacuum. So ADS vacuum you get in string theory, things like ADS5, you get things like ADS5 versus five and ADS times some internal space. And in mostly every example, certainly in every example which we have fully controlled in string theory, the size of the internal space is the same as the size of the ADS space. As the size of the ADS space. So they are really describing 10-dimensional solutions. There's no genuine, let's say, four-dimensional or five-dimensional ADS solution. So the question is, can we find a candidate? Can we find a theory like this? And there's actually a vacuum, it's called the DGKT vacuum, which was proposed in 2004, which it's a construction in supergravity with a 10-dimensional string. String uplift that uses ingredients which are a bit weird, like smeared orientifos, like in principle in an actual string construction, orientifa should not be smeared. So it's something that has a four-dimensional vacuum of gravity, which actually has scale separation. And it almost looks like a 10-dimensional vacuum, but there are still some, there can be still some doubts about whether it works or not. So a very important question is to figure out if this vacuum really exists. This vacuum really exists. And then there's two things, two comments here that I think I can make that are perhaps interesting. The first comment is that it should be a dead end CFT. It shouldn't have any relevant informations because relevant informations are total titanic scalars and we don't want that. And then the 3D version. And then the 3D version. And perhaps a concrete place where we can make a lot of progress, which is since one year ago, there was a 3D. This is a four-dimensional. The DGKT is a four-dimensional solution. And so it's equal to a CFT3. But a year ago, Van Rita and Colabaras had a paper in which they constructed a compactification of massive type 2A on a manifold with G2 anonymity, which produces, it's just like a three-dimensional version of GGKT. Just like a three-dimensional version of the GKT. So the dual CFT is two-dimensional. And now if you want to understand that CFT, it's perhaps easier because you again have tools like molar embarrassments. So I think that by thinking about this three-dimensional version, maybe we can make some progress about this. I don't think you have to jump to... I mean, I think in all of the 2B landscape constructions, which tend to be F-theory constructions. Which tend to be F-theory constructions, they're coming from a limit of an M-theory compactification, which would have an ADS vacuum in three dimensions. So, and there's a huge number of them, right? I mean, any Calabial fourfold would work. So, I think you will find massive numbers of predicted scale-separated ADS vacuum already in the 2B construction. This 2A thing is really weird. I mean, I think you're too generous. I'm really weird. But then you need to stabilize moduli and so on and so forth, right? No, this second step of No, this second step of, I mean the Minkowski classically, but the second step of including instant funds is supposed to produce a stabilized ADS vacuum. You're saying it would produce exactly stable ADS vacuum with scale separation. Well, there's an enormous range of values of depending on how you tune these parameters. But yeah, it could be scale separate. Yeah. Right. But the devil's in the details, right? Like that's that's where the difficulty for all this comes from. Right. So for instance, any flux compactification, like you take a carbon. Any flux compactification, like you take a Clavia threefold with flux as well, if you were able to stabilize everything, maybe you stabilize to a value. The reason why this question is important or interesting is because an ADS, you know, a scale separated vacuum is like the first ingredient, then maybe you can uplift to the city with KQL mechanism. So, but I think the reason I would focus more on the M-theory case than this case. So, this, what are you calling this DJ KT? Is this the math? You calling this DJKT? Is this the massive 2A? Yeah, it's a massive. So, I mean, there has to be a point where one says, you know, you go back to Roman's original paper on massive. There is no Claviow solution, a large volume of Massive 2.8. It's just gibberish. And then adding in an ingredient that's not known to exist, like an orientable plane, and then claiming this is somehow a model. I mean, that's just nonsense. I mean, so I don't think I feel as strongly as you do, but I agree that this series. Do but I agree that there's serious, serious reasons why should one should do that, that one should doubt that. Like at least we need to make sure, like, maybe there's a way to look. So, these mirror intervals don't make sense, maybe there's a way to fix things so that they make sense. Maybe. Well, okay, there might be. I'm not saying there's no way to make it make sense, but I'm saying on the face of it, if you say I start with a semi-classical solution, which fails horribly to solve the classical equations of motion and gets worse at large volume, and I add in some ingredients that are localized, and then I get something that's a solution. Get something that's a solution. Okay. You know, I can do that. I can do lots of things that way. No, no, I know. I know. I'm not defending the argument. I'm saying that perhaps the simplest example of a construction like this. And so we need to understand if you can somehow fix it and make it make sense or not. That's all I can. I think you can frame the bootstrap question just in CFT. I think there's plenty of evidence that if there are scale-separated ADS solutions, there should be CFT2s with lots of special properties. Lots of special properties. Oh, yeah, yeah. And try to constrain that. I mean, that's a well-defined question, right? That's the approach I wanted to hint at here. Like, like with the 3D version of it, like, go to modular invariance and try to ask. Yeah. That's why I said this is a well-defined question. And you can, in principle, answer it with bootstrap methods. And then... It's hard. Even with the bootstrap, it's very hard. No, I know, I know, I know, I know. I'm saying in principle, I'm just putting out a problem which I think is very interesting, but also difficult to make progress on decisions from the CFT side is very difficult. Difficult. I think as a community, we have to come to some agreement at some point about what should constitute a model. Like this, talking about something, you know, maybe I'll talk about it Friday a little bit more. No, that's that's great. That's what this is for. This is a discussion. So that's this. Well, I mean, I actually have one more point I'm going to make quickly. Could I just ask a question? It would help me a lot if you were telling me what is a DGKT vacuum. Oh, yes. So it's a vacuum. So it's a vacuum of massive type 2A. It's massive type 2A on a trial orbital with fluxes. And you do a truncation to 14 equals 1 super gravity, solve the equations of motion of the 14 equals 10 per gravity, not the 10 dimensional ones. And then you can find vacuum, which in principle have scale separation, in which the internal dimensions are much smaller. This is that the internal manifold is much smaller than the Than the 80s. That's what we're looking for. And actually, I can maybe not right now, but if someone could help me and find the paper, because it's a famous paper, this is the wolf and trived, I guess. Ms. Castro and Trivedi. That's right. That's right. If someone could actually put this on the chat, I don't think Trivedi is part of this. It's someone else. You're talking about the massive 2A one, right? Yeah, yeah. One, right? Yeah, yeah, but but Hans, it's also important to realize that it is not a solution of supergravity, of massive 2A supergravity because a Richie flat space in 10 dimensions, a Richie flat space is not a solution of massive 2A. It is a solution that gets worse at large volume because you never dilute the Roman's mass. So you're starting with something which is a very bad approximation to anything. And then you add in an oriental ball plane, which is a string ingredient, a localized oriental plane, like 06, I think. Plane, like 06, I think they use, which is a string ingredient that is also not known to exist in Master 2A. And then you're adding some extra stuff like flux or whatever. To be fair, I think that's something like, so to me, the problems that they use is smeared 06. Something like the 06, I believe, exists in massive type 2A, simply because I can take the 06 in type 2a and I can make it cross at the 8-prayer, presumably. I don't see what's a problem with that. That tells you that it exists in some domain-wall solutions, which is certainly true. Solutions, which is certainly true. By the way, I don't object to the existence of orientable planes in Massive 2A. I bet if we understood what Massive 2A is quantum mechanically, we probably could define them. The real problem is if you put a localized codimension three object into something that is not a solution, it does not give you a solution. That's the more basic issue. You know, you can smear it, but there's no such thing as a smeared orientable plane in perturbative string too. I agree. String team, I agree. Now you have to add something more to this. You know, so at what point do you say, wait, I've just made up a bunch of approximations that are very hard to make any sense out of. And I call it a model with an effective field theory description. I think you're right. It's like Fernando said, we need proofs, not conjectures. Oh, I agree. Yeah. Can I ask a question? Yes. Yeah, I wanted to add a comment about what Saf said that maybe. What Saf said that maybe it's easier in type 2B. I don't think it's easier to study this in type 2B. Like, even if we forget about the Keller moduli and forget to talk about KKRTE or large modulus scenario and just think of complex structure, it becomes the question of whether you can get this small W naught or things like that. And that's also a very, I mean, it's a difficult question that, I mean, this year people have been trying to make progress on that, and there has been some progress, but they always involve. But they always involve string scale volumes. So there is no example which is really scale separated that we can trust. And yeah, I don't know. I mean, at least in this DJKT, it's kind of classical and you can try to find the uplift to 10 dimensions and so on. But in Type 2B, I find it even more difficult to see how to proceed. Well, I think the thing that I like better about the M3, it's M3 rather than Type 2B. Rather than type 2B, I'm thinking of because that's automatically three-dimensional. And the thing I find more appealing about it is there, at least, I could believe the starting point makes sense. Like, makes sense in that it's not completely gibberish. I mean, it's something that, you know, if I went to Romans and said, here's a Clabio solution of your theory, he would throw me out of the room because, you know, there's no such thing. Whereas here, at least you're starting with something that's sensible and then you're Finding something that's sensible, and then you're making assumptions that there are instant phone corrections that have the right properties, which may or may not be true. But there's, you know, 10 to the 30s. Yeah, but the study all these instanton corrections and everything is also, I mean, like a very hard task. It's not just like, okay, like there will be a lot of people. No, no, I totally agree. I'm very much on that perspective, from that perspective as well. But I mean, I think there are degrees of models that I'm... I think there are degrees of models I'm willing to tolerate. And this 2A one is just beyond that degree. I mean, I can't deal with something that I don't know how to make any sense out of from the beginning. I know how to make sense out of the words in the M-theory and 2B models, but I can't understand even the starting point for the other ones. But you know, maybe there's some way to make them make sense. I know Thomas Van Ritt and friends. I know Thomas Van Ritt and friends have changed the topology from a clavial to something else, and that is a first step in the right direction because a clavial will never work. It has to be something that's, you know. Right. So I think you're talking about the very first reference here. Like they actually do, so the DJKT solution has a CFT3. It's an ADS4 solution. So they construct an ADS3 solution, a manifold of G2. It's a G2 manifold. I think. But probably he means that the papers of Tomasiello and Sodaniel Jankan. Macello and also Daniel Jangas, that they go away from the SU3 structure and go to SU3 because SU3. Yeah, Tomasiel, you're right. Tomasi Elo went in this direction of, you know, because you can show just from supergravity that you have to be something that's not clavier, right? I mean, from classical supergravity, it's not more than that. So, you know, if somebody could explain what it means. If somebody could explain what it means to start in spring theory with something that's not a solution classically, and very badly not a solution classically, then we can proceed. I mean, then there's a step to go forward. But I don't know how to do that today. Sorry, I don't understand what you say, Caravillao, that this is not the solution. Is your problem the Romance mass or what? Yeah, the Romance mass. It's not a solution of massive 2A. It's a solution of 2A. Perfectly fine. It's horribly not a solution of massive 2A. Solution of massive 2A. Why not? The Roman's mass is a background vacuum energy that never dilutes, right? Regardless of how big you make the compactification. It never dilutes. So it's a problem that gets worse at large volume. Okay, in that sense, yeah. The only hope, there are solutions of massive 2A you can get by dualizing things in 2A with fluxes, but they never look like large volume solutions. They look like things which are not topologically clever. They look like things which are not topologically clavier, and they have some balancing act of cycles that are small against the Romans mass. And you can only do that. Just to make sure, you mean that, for instance, when you look at type 1 prime away from the type 2A background, the size of the interval is small. It's stringier. No, I think there's something much dumber than this. I think that, like, if you just start with 2B, with a conventional T6 quotient flux solution, there is actually a T-duality that will take it to a massive two-way solution. Massive two-way solution. But the massive two-way solution has small cycles and it has fluxes that have to balance against this Roman story. But it's not collabial, the resulting thing. So it has nothing really to do with this discussion of let's start with a large volume collabial. So, you know, again, I'm not, I'm happy to learn to think about this in a different way, but I need some rules that make sense. I understand. No, I understand. I think that's, I think. Thanks for that because at least I learned things there. Thanks. So, and even though it's very interesting discussion, maybe we can come back because, but because we're running out of time, let me just flash challenge number six, which was actually said there were five challenges, but this is like the next one, which is the thing that we want to do in the end, which is in the end we want to make concrete predictions from Swamp principles for low-energy particle physics in our vacuum. So, for instance, there's a lot of interest in the sample literature about the Interest in the sample literature about the rate at which towers become light in asymptotic limits and so on and so forth. And the reason for that is that, in the end, what you want to do, if you understand scalar potentials in general string theory or in quantum gravity, you can perhaps use them to make interesting predictions on inflation. I think another sector in which we can hopefully say stuff or interesting stuff is in properties of particle physics of dark matter. And so, for instance, we have this Festina-Lente bound based on an extrapolation of which gradient arguments to large. Extrapolation of Wigright arguments to large black hole arguments in the theater that tells you that the mass of any charge state has to be bigger than its charge. And so that might constrain models of dark matter where there's a U1, there's a dark U1 or something like that. And I think most interestingly, there's been a bunch of very interesting works by Irene, Luis Ibanez, Fedora Gonzalo, Alberta. On exploiting the coincidence between the neutrino mass scale and the vacuum energy scale to try and explain that from the point of view of the swamp, try to relate that to some of the swamp conjectures. And to me, this coincidence, some people might, I mean, you can just say it's a coincidence, but to me, I really have the feeling that there's something behind that, and hopefully, something we can understand from somebody. Hopefully, something we can understand from Swamplar principles. So, this was my last slide. It was to get the discussion started. We had already a lot of discussion, which was great. So, thanks so much for that. We have 10 more minutes for discussion, I think. It was also up to the organizers, but these are all questions that I find very, very interesting. And there's many more. So, if there's anything that you would like to bring up, please do so. Thanks, Miguel, for leading the discussion. So let's continue. Yeah, maybe we can make some applause. Okay. Michelle, Cat. Hi. I have a very naive question. So in the old days, there were sort of bounds on the dimensions of representations of light general. Of representations of light general representations, like Dennis and Mart Russell had something you cannot have 126 plat of SO10 or so. Do you have something similar to offer from this swampland, or is it just okay, they proved it, of course, for a certain version of a string model? Okay, so can you give me some more details? Because I don't think I'm familiar with these results. Sorry. So what's the context? People looked at string models, string of multiplications, these were heterotic strings, and they've These were heteroctic strings, and they found that, for instance, you cannot have a light 126-bit. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. I see. Oh, I see. Very interesting. No, as I said, I'm not familiar with this, but that sounds sorry about that. Maybe someone else is and can say something, but that's very interesting. So I don't know what's special about the 126 representation of a SOTEN. It's generally, you cannot get arbitrary large, of course, but well, I mean, 126. Well, 126 plat is something some bottom-up model builders like sometimes. But there was also an issue about the corresponding level of the Kalismudi algebra. So the question is that for a given level, you have the measurement of the representations are very much constrained. Yes. And so that's you cannot go beyond that much. And the question is, if there is a bound on the level. So usually you only get. So, just for that, you only get k equals to one, but people think you can start playing and getting higher levels. But it's not a free game. So, in principle, I think it's a good point that Michael made. I think there was even something beyond the level. Even there said, even if you break to diagnose subgroups as master sufficient, even then, they don't get 126. But there was a coop theory argument on top. I agree with you. Very good point. Yeah, now that you. Very good point. Yeah, now that you phrase it like this, there's something similar that appears recently in some of the literature. Like, for instance, for the street, it's a different scenario, but in eight dimensions, like you can actually put upper bounds on the... So you also care about the current algebra of the of the of the so in eight dimensions with 16 supercharges, there's a p-field and the gravity multiplet. So you must, by completeness principle, you would expect that you have strings and you can study the current algebra on those. You can actually put constraints on the current algebra because the word volume theory has to be an SCF. Because the word volume theory has to be an SCFT and central charge has to be lower than what is dictated by supersymmetry and anomaly inflow. So, then in situations like that, you can put bounds on the level for some groups because there's not a lot of room in central charge. I imagine, I'm not familiar, but I imagine the situation you're describing is in four dimensions and there's a lot more room for the central charge to grow if you would change the other part of the sigma model. Then there might be something there, but yeah. Then there might be something there, but yeah. Thanks for explaining this. Next question. Sorry. You mentioned that there's an argument based on islands about the absence of global symmetries. Can you more or less explain how people do it? So unfortunately, I'm not familiar with the details, but the way this works is so you. So, you study, right? No, I'm sorry, I can probably send you the papers, but I cannot explain the details. They study black hole evaporation. They turn on, I think they turn on a chemical potential, so they force the black holes to have some charts, and then they study the different contributions. At some point, with the rules of the LA prescription, there's change in saddles, and they are somehow able to argue that this means that the global symmetry has been broken. I think they compute. Right. I think they compute, right? I remember more. They compute the expectation value of the charge as a function of time and they can show that at some point it just disappears. Okay. Okay. Interesting. Thank you. Yes, it would be nice to know the papers. Yes, yes, yes. I can. If someone knows the papers I'm talking about, send it by email at some point. I can send it to you, yes. Yeah, thank you.
