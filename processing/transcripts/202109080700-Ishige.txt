First of all, I'd like to thank the organizers for inviting me and giving me opportunity to have a talk in this nice online workshop. I also thank the organizers again for their nice organization of this workshop and this severe situation. Anyway, in this talk, I'd like to. Anyway, in this talk, I'd like to talk about the preservation of negative power concavity by the directory heat of row in convex domains. This is a joint work with Professor Paolo Sarani from University of Florence in Italy and Professor Asuka Takatsu from Tokyo Metropolitan University in Japan. She is one of the speakers of this workshop. Let me start with the introduction. the introduction. In this introduction, I'd like to introduce a common notion of power concavity. Let omega be a possibly unbounded convex domain, and alpha is real number or plus minus infinity. And let u be a non-negative function in omega. Then we say u is alpha con k in omega if u satisfy the following proposition. U satisfy the following property. In what follows we denote by P over U the set of positive set of U. Can we say U is alpha concave if in the case of alpha equal to infinity, positive set of U is convex and U is constant function. In the case of positive alpha, this means that u to the power This means that u to the power alpha is concave in the positive set. So the usual concavity corresponds to one concavity. And in the case of alpha equal to zero, alpha concavity means that log of u is concave in the positive set. And in the case of the negative alpha, u to the power alpha is convex in the positive set. Not convex, not concave. This is convex. This is convex. Finally, in the case of alpha equal to minus infinity, alpha concavity means that all of super level set of U are convex. And we often call the local concavity local concavity. Also, we call minus infinity concavity case concavity. Next, I'd like to introduce two Next, I'd like to introduce two typical examples of log concave function and a negative concave function. Exponential or minus x square, this is zero concave, log concave, because log of this function is, of course, minus x square. And this function is concave. So this function is concave. And this function is a variation of Gauss canon. variation of gas scanners so one can easily imagine that concavity is very important in the study of parabolic equations and this function 1 over 1 plus x square this is half minus half concave because this function to the power minus half that is this is the root of 1 plus x square this function is convex This function is convex. So, please see this. So, this function is minus half concave. And these functions are not concave, but these functions are concave and minus half concave. And in this notation of concavity, we have the nice property, the following nice property. Let u be alpha concave and beta is smaller than equal to alpha. Then, beta is smaller than equal to alpha, then u is always beta concave. This property makes a hierarchy among power concavities and this direction is stronger and this direction is weaker. And local concavity, okay, usual concavity is one concavity, so local concavity is weaker than usual concavity. And casei concavity is the weakest concavity among power concave. weakest concavity among power concavities. In particular, a non-negative function u is not K side concavity, then we cannot expect any power concavity for the function u. So this is with Kesla. By using this notice notion, I'd like to introduce some known results on power concavity of solutions for elliptic and parabolic equations. And parabolic equations. In 1976, Bless Jamp and Rieb proved the following. Let phi be a log concave in Rn. Then, the corresponding solution to the heat equation in Rn, that is exponential theta plus cell phi, this function is concave in Rn for all t positive. This means This means that heat of flow on the Euclidean space preserves the local concavity forever. And their proof is based on Bloomin's inequality. And in 1983, Correbar introduced concavity maximum principle and he studied power concavity properties. Power congravity properties for some elliptic problems and heat equations. In particular, he proves the following. Let omega be a convex domain in Rn and U be a solution of the Caucasi delicate problem for the heat equation. And if inside data is logoconcave in omega, then U T is local concave in omega for all positivity. Positivity. This means that for any convex domain, the direct heat flow preserves the local concavity forever. And in this talk, preservation of local concavity by direct heat flow is important keyword. Furthermore, Corebar proved the following property for fast Dirty Gligen function. This part. Let omega be. Let omega be a bounded convex domain E Rn, then the first adirical eigenfunction for La Prussian is long concave in omega. And these are very famous results in this field. And the argument by Corlebar was extended to some non-linearity equations by Kennington and Cabot. Indeed, Kennington and Cabo obtained the following obtain the following some properties of power concavities for elliptic equations. First example is the inhomogeneous elliptic equation and case B is a special case of A and F that is case of F equal to 1. This is called torsion problem. Also they treat it the case of non-indelectric problem. nor in the elliptic program okay i'd like to skip the details of the result to save the time of my talk and subsequently and greco and cabor extended the arguments by correbar kennington and cabor to various non-linear parabolic equations and as they show the preservation of the concavity for various parabolic non-linear parabolic equations and advanced And Arubanes-Radulio introduced a method based on viscosity solution and they studied the convexity of solutions. And Lee and Basque obtained the preservation of some positive power concavity for forest medium equation and evolution of P-Raplast equation. And from 2008, And from 2008, I had a joint work with Paolo Sarani and we'll start. We introduce a notion of parabolical power concavity and we show its validity. Also, we prove the the preservation of concavity for various nonlinear parabolic equations and parabolic systems. In the next section, I'd like to explain the motivation of this talk. As we stated in the previous sheets, Brask, Camp and Lieb and Corlebar produced the following. Let omega be a convex domain and U is a solution of the Cauchy-Diracle problem for the heat equation. problem for the heat equation and if initial data phi is non-concave then solution is non-concave for all positive t that is preservation concavity by the delegate heat flow and we have the following question okay how about the case i concavity is case i concavity preserved by the delivery heat flow okay delic uh case i concavity is the weakest concavity among the power concavities. Cavity among the parallel concavities and long concavity preserved. But what happens for KSI concavity? This is the first question. But we have already known the answer. One-dimensional case answer is yes, because roughly speaking, if each other data is case I concave, then the intersection then the intersection number of initial data and constant function is 0 in this case, 1 in this case, and this is 2. 0, 1, 1, 2. On the other hand, for one-dimensional heat equation, the number of zeros of solutions for one-dimensional heat equation are decreasing with respect to time variable. So if we variable. So if initial data have this shape, then the intersection number of solution u and constant function are 0, 1, 1, 2. That is the solution u is k cycle k. So we know that the answer for one dimensional case is yes. So the problem is in the higher dimensional case. This is the starting point of my joint work with Paul Salan. joint work with Paul Salai. And I'd like to explain the key idea to show this because this is important this talk. Okay, let dimension n is greater than or equal to. And first we consider the case inside data is a kerosenic function of half space xn is negative. Then, okay, for any t, okay, we fix time t equal to 1. times t equal to 1. Then the shape of solution u to this direction is like this. Solution converts to 0 as xn tends to infinity and solution converts to 1 as xn tends to minus infinity. And solution u takes half at the xn equal to therefore any positivity and we have some symmetry. So the boundary of So the boundary of super level set u greater than half is always this hyperplane xn equal to 0. Next, we add a catastrophic function of some ball to this initial data. But the ball, this ball is included in this half space. Okay, like this. So in this ball, initial data takes two. data takes two in this part one this is zero then by this characteric function we see that the boundary of this super level set should be pushed to this direction because we have asymmetry on the other hand gas kernel has exponential decay so the effect of effect of this part decays exponentially as x tends to infinity. So the boundary of this super level set super level set combines to this hyperplane. So the shape probably, okay, so we see that this boundary combines this hyperplane, but this boundary moves to this direction. So we see that this super level set includes this hyper half space, but this is not a half space due to this part. On the other hand, if a convex set includes a half space in the Euclidean space, then the convex set must be half space or the whole of Euclidean space. Of Euclidean space. So, but this is not half-space and not all Euclidean space. This means that this set is not convex. Okay, on the other hand, of course, this function, this initial data is casei conc. So, okay, we see that okay, this set is not convex. So, exponential Laplace alpha is not case icon k, but initial data is case I conc. So, this is a So, this is a counter-example to the first question. And in this argument, we see that asymmetry of initial data breaks a convexity of label states. So, the first question is: can I concur the presumptive heat flow answer at higher dependent case? Answer it to no. And by motivated this. And by motivated to this question, we have the following two questions. What is the weakest or strongest concavity preserved by the delicate heat flow? In the previous our joint work with Paulo and ASCA, we have already known that strongest concavity is local concavity. So the question is, what is the weakest concavity? Question 3 is, Pen is the case like concavity. Span is the case like concavity preserved by the delegate heat flow. If inside data is long concave, then long concavity is preserved. That is, solution is case I concave, however. So if, but if initial data is not long-concave, then what happen? K-CI concave preserve or not? What is the sufficient condition to preserve the case I concave of initial data? This is our question. Okay, now we already state the main result of this talk. But we treat only one theorem. Let omega be a convex domain, possibly unbounded. And alpha is negative. And the dimension. And the dimension n is greater than or equal to 2, then there is this alpha, negative alpha concave function phi in omega, such that the solution of the Cauchy delivery problem for the heat equation is not casei concave for some time t positive. Okay, there is some there is a negative. there is a negative okay alpha concave function for fixed solution is not case i concave for some positive t this means that this function is not this solution is not case i concave so this function this solution is not alpha concave because case i concave is concavity the weakest one so as a corollary of zero a we obtain the following negative power concavity is Negative power concravity is not preserved by the direct heat flow. Okay, so the CRM, by using this result, we see that local concavity is the weakest and the strongest concavity preserved by the degree heat of lobe among power concavities. This is the main result of this talk. And I'd like to explain the key idea of the proof. Of the proof to ZLMA. Similar to question one, we key pointed how to construct a counterexample. Okay, in the question one, we said inside data calisthenic function of half space plus a catastrophic function ball. In that case, inside data is just a case I concave, so it is not enough. so it is not enough to obtain our theorem. So the but in this case also the question one asymmetry of initial data breaks the convexity of superlevel set but this proof is more delicate of course and let alpha is negative and we set phi inside data phi is like this 1 plus x square to the power minus 1 over 2 to the power minus one over two alpha and this function is alpha concave alpha concave times this characteric function so this function is alpha concave okay this function is alpha concave with a positive subset so that this function alpha concave we are and from this uh initial data decays at decays at this power x to the power minus alpha as x prime 10 to infinity. And this decay rate is kept by the heat flow in Rn because this decay is slower than exponential decay. On the other hand, at initial time this is zero, this part is initial data zero. data is zero so okay is already like this then for any positivity solution has exponential decay at x tend to infinity so the this direction decay to this one and this direction is exponential decay by using the this difference of decay of solution we show that the super level set is not convex Convex. So we imagine that for small enough epsilon, we imagine that superable set of corresponding solutions like this. We directly show this by contradiction. So we assume, okay, let epsilon be small enough and we assume that this superlevel set is convex. And by symmetry, And by symmetry, the correlate set is represented by some nice function theta, epsilon, and such that u of x prime theta epsilon equal to epsilon. And okay, we calculate the derivative of theta epsilon at this point by using the standard argument that is implicit function seven. function seven because we see that theta epsilon prime this is theta is okay implicit ms and we have this formula and by explicit representation of solution we have the upper bound of this derivative and also we have the lower bound of this part and we see that theta prime is bound prime is bounded by some constant L epsilon in bus. L epsilon is this length. And okay, now we assume that this super label set is convex. So we know this derivative. So if this set is convex, then we can make this triangle. And the theta zero epsilon must be in smaller than 0 epsilon must be is smaller than this part. So the by using the convexity, so theta 0 is bounded by L epsilon times this derivative and this is the L epsilon minus 1. So the theta 0 is bounded by some constant for all small epsilon. But on the other hand, a solution has exponential decay. So we see that theta delta epsilon is bounded by that epsilon is bounded by some okay root over two log epsilon over some constant but epsilon tends to zero this quantity tends to infinity so that we have a contradiction this means that this parabola this boundary or the this set is not convex that is u dot t u dot one is not case i concave in Rn. Not case I concave in Rm. So this is the key idea for the proof of a sermon in the Euclidean space. In the general convex domain, we multiply some number times convex domain omega at the constant tend to infinity. Then if a domain has zero point, then the domain convex. Then the domain converts to Rn. And by using this argument and also the similar transformation for the heat case, we can construct a counter example for general and convex domains. Okay, this is the summary of this talk. What is the weakest and strong concavity preserved by the heat row? The answer is stronger concavity among power concavities. And question three, when is the case like concavity preserved by these? K psi concavity preserved by this heat of flow? The answer: if i is negative power concave, then k psi concavity is not necessarily preserved by the delegate heat flow. This is the answer of my talk. And in our joint work, we also treat a more general concavity, but okay. Okay, and we don't know concavity is the weakest one among F-concavity, but we still believe that Rochoncavity is the weakest one preserved by the declaration of row among F-conca. Thank you for your kind attention. So thank you very much, Kazuiro. Very beautiful talk. So is there any question? Okay, so maybe I have a couple of questions. So, regarding your summary, question number two is: What is the weakest concavity preserved by the heat flow? So, I don't know if I got it. For For a large alpha, is the power concavity preserved? No, no, only zero concavity is preserved. Okay, only zero concavity is preserved. Okay. Yes. And so basically, it's the only one preserved, the local cavity. Yes. Okay, because then the question is if you generalize a notion of If you generalize a notion of concavity, then what happened? I don't know. Okay. And the second question: so you do all of this in the Tirichle framework. Is anything known in the Neumann framework? So for homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions? Of course, the solution combines to the constant. Yes. And the second function has sign-changing. So. So maybe we don't have. I don't know. Maybe in that case, you should even weaken even more the notion of concavity. I don't know. But I don't know, but more difficult. And in the case, just final question. In the case of non-linear diffusion, what happens? If anything is known. If anything is known. Okay. Okay, there are many results on the preservation of local concavity, but as far as I know, there are few results on the non-preservation. And in the previous work with PARO, we showed that for We saw that for some positive concavity, not preserved for polar medium equation. So that we can get some result, but a little bit too weak.
