Thank you for the invitation. And so, this, I think, this talk. And I will like just to show some, it's preliminary work. It's the first time I'm presenting this, and I hope you will like it. So, what we are trying to So what we are trying to understand is how these contact networks and mobility networks can tell us about how the epidemics is moving. Okay, so we have seen when we started having the COVID, we started seeing these plots of Google reports about mobility in our work. Mobility in our workplaces and transit stations and at home, right? So, and we started wondering whether social distancing is working or not, whether people decrease the number of contacts really once the pandemic was started, especially in Mexico because we started having the phase one, phase two, and so on, and whether actually people stay at home or at least whether they stop going out for dinner. Stop going out for dinner. Sorry, I need to remove this. Okay. And we've seen that there were a lot of papers already because in Mexico it came a little later after Asia and Europe, and then there were already a lot of papers about how to incorporate social network or mobility network data in these studies. So we started by doing one study in Mexico in May looking at how the mobility change after different phases of the pandemics was reported. So in particular in Mexico, we started with phase one just at the end of the very end of February. February. And then we had phase two, which was declared as the national journey of social distancing. And here in this plot, you can see actually like there is a kind of a very high decrease in mobility. And then we look at other key dates that are very holidays in Mexico, like the Day of Children, which is the 30th of. Children, which is the 30th of April, and then the Mother's Day, which is the 10th of May, and how this increases. So, this was our first study using geolocalization data provided by a broker of mobile phones that use Android and iOS and they provide latitude and Of like the coordinates, geolocalization coordinates for each mobile data. I have to say that this data was given to us for academical purposes and all the devices are anonymized. So we started trying to build in network network networks. Networks to study this phenomenon of how this is changing during the pandemic. So, first, here is an example of how we do it with Mexico City. So, this is Mexico City, and then we have the basic geodesic areas, and we have the H trees, which are polygons that were actually created by Uber. And this is how we And this is how we say divided all our regions. Then we define it at home for each device where we check what is the place or the polygon where the device spends most of the time from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. And then we decided that this is we defined this as the home of the device. And once we have the homes of the device, Once we have the homes of the devices, then we build bipartite networks where two devices are linked to one polygon if they are seen at the same time in this polygon. So the devices here are like a proxies for people. We do this for all the devices. For all the devices that are provided per day, and then we count this per every 10 minutes. We see which devices are in which polygon. And with this, we are able to build the contact network per day. So, we are doing this per day at the moment. So, once we analyze this, we first We first saw that the degree distribution of this network is this one with the long tail. It's not quite a small word, but it's a little bit like that. And then we started asking questions like with whom do people from Mexico City meet, for example? Do you know if, well, if you don't know Mexico City, downtown is like really, really crowded every day? It every day. And we were wondering: like, if people who live there are meeting with people from all over the city, and this plot shows that it is actually like that. So it actually meets people from downtown, are actually in contact with people from almost all over Mexico City. So, in this plot, I'm actually showing not only Mexico City, which not only Mexico City, which is a yellow plot, but also outside like the outskirts of Mexico City. Then we were also checking in which regions are there more contacts, so in which regions are Mexico City. So we counted for each polygon how many devices we observed at certain time. And then we can actually see how dense is. Actually, see how dense are the contexts in Mexico City, and what we observe is that people from the suburbs of Mexico City stay at home, so are the ones that not really stay at home, but they have contacts mainly in their neighborhoods. This is what this heat map is showing. So, this is what we did only to characterize. only to characterize how what's the behavior of the contact network of Mexico City. And we did it for a day in February. And then we tried to characterize or to describe the same network, mobility network for the same day, so for Mexico City. The way we construct this mobility network is we take two We take two, let's say, two polygons, and if we see a device at a certain moment in one polygon, and then we see it again in the next, in another region, then we say that this person moved to the other polygon. And then, if we observe several devices in one polygon, several people in one polygon. Polygon several people in one poly one polygon and then moving to another polygon and then moving to the other one we in different times. So basically we have a theme series for each for each device. Then we start counting how many people are moving from one polygon to the other polygon. And this basically gives us a weighted directed network where nodes represent the polygons or the regions where people The polygons, so the regions where people are. Each node has also weight, which is the number of devices that are there. And the edges represent, or the RX represent how many people are moving from one region to the other. And the weight on the edges is how many people move. So once we have our mobility network, we started analyzing, especially. Analyzing, especially again from Mexico City. And in this plot, I'm just showing where my visits come from. So the bigger the plots, the dots are, it means that this part receives more visits. And the ages is just basically where they come from. And basically, well, Mexico City, it's a very transited city, so you can see that it's everywhere. So, you can see that it's everywhere. Here, I'm actually just highlighting the edges or the arcs with more mobility. So, this is just another plot to show you how the nodes, to show you some nodes with high indegree. So, it's where places where visits were gets most visits. You can see there are a lot of Can see there are a lot of small arcs, which means that people are moving like in neighborhoods or around the neighborhoods. But there are also some very long arcs where that means that people are traveling long distances. In this one, I'm showing you the same. It's just another visualization, like which regions of Mexico City received more visits. More visits, and in this case, greener regions that means that there are more visits in that part. Then, what we did is we used this network and calculated the maximum spanning tree. And this tells us from where to where occurs high mobility. So, if you see, there are a lot of dots that you see in this plot, but it's actually That you see in this plot, but it's actually like very small ages. So that means that people move a lot in the neighborhoods, but there are also some very, very long ages, especially the red ones have very high mobility. So a lot of people are basically crossing the city, the whole city, either from north to south, south to east, west. Yeah, so then this is the study that we just did to The study that we just did to characterize these contact networks and mobility networks during, so this was pre-pandemic, and then we wanted to study what this is telling us about the COVID spread. So one thing that we did is we checked the distribution in the mobility network for the degree distribution in our network. Distribution in our network for February for three different dates. So one is February 18th, which is pre-pandemic in Mexico time. And as you see, the distribution is very uniform. Then we did it for the 14th of April, which was already when the national journey of social distancing was declared in Mexico, like in March. In March, so in April, let's say, like all the country was quiet, more or less, and we can see that the decrease in mobility, or at least that's what we can see in this distribution. But then we look at the 10th of May, which is Mother's Day in Mexico, and we actually observe some increase in mobility. So, these are some maps where we are just highlighting what are just highlighting what the let's say the the arcs where the or the regions where there was more mobility if you see here this is February 18 so there is high mobility locally and also and across the city when we look at April 14 for example we already see a high decrease oh I have to say here sorry that so the greener So, the greener the arcs are, that means that there is higher mobility, the greener and the thicker they are. And the regions are color from red to yellow, so the more yellowish, that means that it's more dense, so there were more people visiting such places. The redder it is, is that there is less people. So, if you see, for example, for April, so there you can see the map is a little bit more. We can see the map is a little bit more ready, so there are less people visiting, and also there is less mobility. So we have less highly weighted arcs. But if we look at Mother's Day in May, then this increase a lot. So what we did is just look at the difference between February and April and May and February. So maybe you don't see much difference here. Maybe you don't see much difference here, but so the darker, let's say the lighter blue you see is that there is a big difference between February, which when we had no pandemic. And the lighter the blue is, that means that there is a bigger distance in mobility between April and February. So in this case, it's let's say. This is, let's say, a big reduce in mobility. And in the right one, it's between May and February. So it's the 10th of May, as I said, in Mother's Day. And here the difference in mobility is not so big. What we saw in, oh, I think I miss okay. So, and when we had a look at other cities, so for we had a look. Other cities. So we had a look at other cities in the same day, so in the 10th of May. And we saw a lot of, this is with the contact networks, in which places there were more contacts. And then we look at the epidemiological weeks, and we see that after the 10th of May, there was an increase of cases. That was the same case for Cuernavaca, which is another city. And then we had a look at. We have a look, we had a look at different cities, and not in all the cities, so we cannot see a general pattern, but for other cities, such like the peak or Tampico, Morelia, we saw a lot of a big increase in cases after in the two weeks following the 10th of May, which is Mother's Day. So that means that, and what we observe is that was an increase also in contact and was an increase in mobility. So, I just want to show you a case that we study when we ignore social distancing. So, a couple of weeks ago here in Mexico, there was the reopening of Six Flags, which is this entertainment park. And here we can see what are the people who are like, let's say in this entertainment park. And after they leave, how this starts spreading in the city and basically discovers. And basically, this covers the whole city. So, this was a study that was done with the contact networks, and we can see that all the people that had contacts, then we had other contacts with first neighbors and then second neighbors. And basically, we cover the whole city, which could be the case of like when we had a spring break, right? So, the conclusions, I well, like network construction for us was a lot of fun. Fun the contact networks and mobility networks can help us to study the dynamics of the pandemics. And our analysis agrees with previous studies where they show that less contacts, less mobility, then there is less spread of the virus. Every city, region, state, and country can have different contact and mobility networks, so therefore very different behaviors of the virus spread. And yeah, so this is the type of analysis we're working on. The type of analysis we're working on and studies of this network, and we would like to answer many questions, like not only in Mexico, but also Latin America and all over the world. So, we are at the moment trying to get the data for worldwide data to continue these studies. And just lastly, I would like to acknowledge all the people who were working in this project. Guillermo Deanda, he's mainly working with the contact network, and Mil Carmelo. Mainly working with the contact network. Emil Carmenes is working with the parallelization because this is a huge amount of data. So he's creating efficient algorithms to treat this. Plinio, which is in charge of all the back-end to make this possible with the visualization, Alfredo and all other people have been working really hard to have these preliminary studies. And thank you all for your attention. Thanks, Maribel. So if there So, if there are questions again, please put them in the chat. There are a couple here already. So, this first question I think is about the construction of the contact network for Mexico City. Yes, yes, that's right. So, we are in contact with a broker of data from the US and he's providing us this data. So, at the moment, it's just an agreement between Is just an agreement between us for academic purposes and it's GPS data basically from all the devices. All the devices are anonymized because of the privacy. And what we have is basically coordinates, right? And one last question. What fraction of the cell phone coverage in Mexico is provided by the company that you got data from? We actually don't know. This is something that we cannot know. So we just know that it's all. We cannot know, so we just know that it's all the devices from Android, as I said, and iOS. So, probably, well, that's what that's the majority. And from all the companies, basically, the broker of data, they buy from all Mexican companies, but we don't know how much, what's the fraction, and they actually don't tell us. So, I think they also don't have this information. Information. Okay, great. So maybe I'll stop the questions there, although there are
