Happy to introduce Gabrielle Dorfsman-Hopkins, who will tell us about funding line bundles on perfect latency. Great, thank you so much for the invitation. It's so awesome to be here. I was very excited to be invited two years ago and then to finally have something to talk about here. So, yeah, I want to talk a little bit about until perfectoid spaces. I think if you look at my math subject classifications, I think I sometimes put one. I think I sometimes put one and two are intertwined with algebraic geometry and number theory, and then commutative algebra comes third. So I hope that I can keep an audience interested. I'll just sort of start by saying what the goal of this project is. Perfectoid spaces are certain sort of analytic objects or even topological rings, if you'd like to look at the local picture, that have some tilting operation that connects, say, something in characteristic zero to something in characteristic P in such a way that topological information. That topological information and ATAL information can sort of freely be passed back and forth across these characteristics. And that's been seen to be very powerful. Sort of more mysterious is what happens to coherent information, things like modules over these rings, or shall we say, like coherent sheaves, whatever that might mean, maybe line bundles and vector bundles over these spaces, and how those change across characteristics. And so this is maybe step zero in trying to understand that correspondence is the question of line bundles. So that's the. Line bundles. So that's the goal of this project. And I guess the first thing I want to do is give a few definitions of perfectoid spaces and how, you know, what properties they have that make this project go. And I'll try to have plenty of examples throughout, both in the local and in the global picture, so we have some stuff to hold on to. But I'll just define the sort of underlying algebraic object. So we take a complete topological Topological ring, say R0 is called, I guess we'll call it integral perfectoid. If there exists maybe some non-zero divisor, call it Call it pi or var pi if you'd like in R0 satisfying a few conditions. So the first condition, I suppose, is that R0 is in fact sort of has the pi-adic topology. So it's complete with respect to this particular element. Second, so there's this funny condition that guarantees that we're not discrete, which is that, let's see, what do I want? I want p to divide pi to the p. To divide pi to the p. So often maybe we'll take p to be a pth root of pi to be maybe a pth root of p. And then third, this is the sort of perfect part of perfectoid, is that I can look at r0 mod p or mod pi, and that's going to be a perfect ring or a ring in characteristic p, and I can apply for Benius and naturally think about that as landing in R0 mod pi to the p. And so I want this to be an isomorphism, and so this is the sort of integral. And so this is the sort of integral perfectoid case. And then let's say r, which will be r0 invert pi, then is called tate perfectoid. And so condition three sort of encodes some perfectness, and then the first two conditions are sort of about the topology of this topological ring. Oopa. So a few examples. Of these sort of algebraic objects are one can take the ring of integers. So if Cp is a completion of an algebraic closure of QP, then one can take the ring of integers, and that'll be integral perfectoid inside Cp. So this is sort of the geometric perfectoid situation, but there are arithmetic perfectoid situations. So I can take Qp. So I can take qp and then, well, in here I've got zp, but if I mod out by, you know, well, first of all, it's hard to find a pth root of p here. So I'm going to need to start adjoining pth roots of p. And if I want this condition, if I want really this sort of surjectivity on Frobenius, I need to actually adjoin all these pth power roots of p. If that's going to be my pi. So this will be my integral perfector. And then I guess we'll take some p-adic completions just so the topology works out. Completions just so the topology works out, although the geometry doesn't change. When you do that, and then if I have maybe k to be a perfectoid field, so now let's just let k be a perfectoid field. So cp or qp join these pth power roots of p. Well, I might try to look. So we're in the sort of context of analytic geometry. And in p-adic analytic geometry, we often sort of the underlying rings we think about are our power series. Think about our power series ring. So I might look at a Tate algebra, and this will have some integral part. And this just corresponds to p-adically convergent power series. But the absolute value of this x is going to be one. So when I mod out by this var pi, x is not going to have any pth roots yet. So in order to satisfy this perfectoid condition, this sort of surge activity on Frobenius on the special fiber, I'm going to need. On a special fiber, I'm going to need to adjoin a lot of pth power roots of my variable. And this will give me sort of this perfectoid tate algebra. And so condition three right here introduces a notion of perfectness, right? In characteristic zero, well, everything's sort of perfect for trivial reasons. In characteristic P, perfect rings are very interesting, and you have tons of pth power roots flying around. And so this condition is sort of a characteristic zero or mixed characteristic, if you'd like. Or mixed characteristic, if you'd like, the integral case, incarnation of the notion of being perfect. And in fact, in characteristic P, being perfectoid and being perfect is essentially the same modulo, these topological conditions. So these are sort of some of the examples. And then I guess I'll just vaguely give a definition that a perfectoid space. Sort of like how when you build schemes, you locally take spectra of the rings that you're interested in. Here we're going to take, we're going to sort of build them locally by some rigid analytic, often called attic. Well, we're going to use Huber's theory of attic spaces, but we're going to locally build it from attic spectra of perfectoid rings. And so. And so, strictly speaking, if we're sort of in this take case over these fields, these are called perfectoid spaces. And if we're in this integral case, these are often called perfectoid formal schemes. All of the results that I'm going to talk about today are sort of insensitive to which picture you're looking at, except for if you're working in the integral case, you need to throw almost in very liberally. And rather than introduce almost mathematics, I'm just going to play in this character, in this sort of generic. In this sort of generic fiber kind of world. Okay, so now a really important operation, the operation that I think is really interesting that perfectoid spaces have, it's this operation that is often called tilting. I think this is sort of the first motivation by Schulze when they were introduced, although they've turned out to have lots of other applications. And so let's say R is Let's say R is a perfectoid ring. So, what I can do is I can define the tilt of R. And so here's how you're going to do it. So, as a multiplicative monoid, I'm going to take the inverse limit. So, I'll put a little flat symbol here along the map, the pth power map. The pth power map of R. Now, this is not a ring map if you're in characteristic zero, unless you're a freshman in calculus class. But it is a map of multiplicative monoids, so you can sort of write this down, right? We think about the elements here as being, you know, a zero, a one, so on, where ai to the p is a i minus one, all of these elements of r. And then we get, you know, as multiplication is sort of inherited in the natural way, and addition is kind of funny. It has a lot to do with the rules of addition on the vit rate. To do with the rules of addition on the vitring that was talked about earlier this morning, I'm not going to define the addition law carefully, but there is some funny addition law. So, with some funny addition law. And so we get some nice map, which we'll call sharp, again, of multiplicative monoids from R flat. Of multiplicative monoids from r flat to r, which is just projection onto the first coordinate. And this will be sort of the map that we use to think about our result on line bundles. Let's see, I think I had a few remarks in my notes. So I'm going to go see. Right, I guess, yeah, we should say a few remarks. Some of the programs. Some of the properties of this is that one, the characteristic of this tilt is actually p, where sort of we're fixing. I guess I should have said right at the beginning that I'm fixing a prime throughout the talk. So this is a positive characteristic ring. I'm not telling you how addition works, so that is not meant to be obvious. But one way, maybe a more natural way to define this tilt is to look at R zero modulo this pi, and then take the This pi, and then take the perfection, so the inverse limit along Frobenius, and this will be sort of R0 tilt. And this certainly is a characteristic P ring. And if I take the generic fiber of this ring, I really will get the tilt of R. And then two, sort of importantly, tilting localizes. R0 is my integral ring, and R is going to be, yeah. So I'm being a little vague. R could already be the. R could already be the integral perfectoid ring, but when I write perfectoid ring, maybe I should be saying tate. And then r0 is this ring of definition. So a perfectoid tate ring is sort of the generic fiber of an integral perfectoid ring. So when I say r0, I'm sort of tacitly thinking about the integral picture. Yeah, and so the next picture I want to say is that tilting sort of localizes and glues to a functor. To a functor which takes a perfectoid space to a perfectoid space of characteristic P. Okay, and I want to talk for a moment. I think one of the sort of intriguing and incredible aspects of this theory are the tilting equivalences that tell us that this tilting functor is in some remarkable way. Is in some remarkable way is not very lossy. It preserves a ton of information. So theorem, these are the tilting equivalences due to Salta in his thesis, which I will write in the following way. So I guess I'll write this as a number of different things. If I look at the category of perfectoid rings, At the category of perfectoid rings over some perfectoid ring R, then tilting gives me a functor to the category of perfectoid rings over the perfectoid ring R tilt. And this is an equivalence of categories. I'll just write that as a little sim there. And two, this equivalence glues. So if I look at perfectoid spaces over x, tilting gives me an equivalence to perfectoid spaces over x tilt. And so these are sort of nice algebraic equivalences between. Are sort of nice algebraic equivalences between some geometric or algebraic objects in characteristic zero and some geometric or algebraic objects in characteristic p. So, this I would say are sort of like algebraic tilting equivalences. But we also have there exists a canonical homeomorphism between the underlying topological space of X and the underlying topological space of X tilt. Topological space of x tilt. And it comes back, you know, so points on these addict spaces correspond to valuations, and it comes down to pulling back valuations along this sharp map. And then I guess the fourth thing I'd like to say is that, in fact, if I look at the atall site of x, I get a tilt functor to the atall site of x tilt. And this is also an equivalence of sites. Equivalence of sites. So here we have some sort of algebraic way to pass information. And here we have topological, goodness me, sort of a topological way to pass information in a very meaningful way. So I'm not going to say really anything about the proof of this fact. It goes through sort of a variant of Falting's almost purity theorem and then some interesting deformation theory. But what I will say Is you can recover in the case, so we can recover sort of by part four down here, thinking about x as being the perfectoid space associated to this funny ring I wrote down, p to the one over p to the infinity. And so I can look at the algebraic Galois group of this, which is determined entirely by the atal site of the associated. Atal site of the associated perfectoid space, and we get an isomorphism between the Galois group of the field that is its tilt. This is fpt to the one over p to the infinity. Maybe I want some more parentheses flying around. And so I get this sort of Fontaine and Fontaineble isomorphism from, I think, the 70s. Is maybe 78. I should have written that down. But you get this Fontaine and Fontaine-Berger isomorphism and somehow globalize it to a geometric setting. Okay, so this is my very, very brief crash course on what generally perfected space looks like and what kind of information you can pass back and forth across characteristics using this framework. And it looks like. And it looks like the stuff that can freely go across is sort of this algebraic information about rings and perfectoid rings, and this topological information about topological space and the underlying atol site. And so, like I said at the very beginning today, the question that motivates this project is what about coherent info? Is there some sort of tilting? Is there some sort of tilting equivalence for coherent information between a perfectoid space and its tilt? Are there any questions before I move on to section two? Okay, um Okay, um, so I guess this is my title: Until Bundles. So, I think the sort of most easily accessible coherent information, at least to me, is the notion of invertible OX modules or projective modules of rank one in the local picture. Or if you'd like, you know, line bundles in the geometric picture. Geometric picture. Can I pass this sort of information back and forth across characteristic? And I want to start with an observation. So to me, a line bundle is a invertible OX module. So an observation is that if X is perfectoid, so let's say the characteristic now is P, so I'm not looking at these mixed characteristic perfectoid spaces. So if X is perfectoid, then one of the things is that it's automatically. And one of the things is that it's automatically perfect. And by virtue of being perfect, this tells me that Frobenius acts invertibly on the sheaf of units OX star. And so I can pass to cohomology. And this tells me, in particular, P acts invertibly. On the Picard group of X, which is just H1 of OX star. Noticing that Frobenius acts on OS star when I pass the cohomology. This is the pth power map on the associated line bundle. So for a perfectoid space, we see that the Picard group is uniquely p-divisible. So the initial question is: okay, I've got all these tilting equivalences. I have Tilting equivalences, I have similar algebraic info, I have very similar topological information. Maybe, I mean, a first guess would say that the Picard groups should be the same, somehow coherent information. You know, the Picard group, it feels like a topological thing. Maybe there's a tilting equivalence on the level of line bundles too. And so, if we were trying to look at a counterexample for that, the first, all we would need to do is produce a perfectoid space whose Picard group has, say, p-torsion or something like that. Or something like that. Then it couldn't possibly have the same Picard group as its tilt because the tilt has a p-torsion-free Picard group. So that is what we're going to do. So this is a very nice example that came out of an Arizona winter school project from 2017. There's a big list of names that I should read. So I will go do that. This example is due to Blakestead, Gwertz. Let's see this in alphabetical order. EH, Ben Hoyer. Koji Shimitsu. Koji Shimitsu and Yao. I hope I'm not missing anybody. And they proved the following. So here's an interesting example. So let's let K be a perfectoid field. And let's let Q have absolute value less than one and bigger than zero and have Have a compatible system of p-power roots in k. You can start in a smaller field and then just base change up to adjoining all the p power roots if you'd like. So now I can form an elliptic curve whose k points will just be k star modulo q. modulo q to the z. This is sort of an elliptic curve with bad reduction, a tape curve, if you'd like. And then I can form an inverse limit. So I'll call E infinity to be the inverse limit of the system of take curves where I take pth powers one over p to the n of q. So I can sort of form this tower of elliptic. So I can sort of form this tower of elliptic curves with bad reduction and passing to the inverse limit. So they showed this is a perfectoid space. And this is sort of in characteristic P, if you want to form a perfectoid space from like a variety, you pass to the perfection. In characteristic zero, you have to be a little more creative, but it generally looks like throwing in a lot of pth roots of stuff. And so this is what you're going to do here. So here's a perfectoid space. I'm calling it. A here's a perfectoid space I'm calling it E infinity, um, and it's sort of a cover of E. Does this work in general? Is it the same as taking like the beginning of the right and then taking the cover of E? It's not. This is a different thing. This is, in fact, that will have a map to this. Yeah, so yeah, it's actually kind of interesting. So, for the abelian variety, I won't be able that you can show that the Picard group of the abelian variety constructed the way you said is uniquely p-divisible. Uniquely p-divisible. But if you do this sort of slightly less canonical thing, you get perhaps unsurprisingly a more pathological example. So, what's the reason? Why is this a perfectoid space? Oh, let's see. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I'm not just going to throw that up there and say, oh, the Picard group. No. Let's see why the Picard group is not sort of what we're looking for. So now, subsequent work of Ben Hoyer. Well, Ben Hoyer, what he did is constructed actually a sort of degree map from the Picard group of E infinity, which landed in Z one over P and was able to compute the kernel of this map to be precisely what you might expect, sort of like the K points of this pick E infinity, which is going to be K. infinity, which is going to be k star mod q to the z one over p. And so this is sort of an exact sequence that gives you neuron severity and pick zero. And similarly to like what you might expect for an elliptic curve, the neuron severi is z, but we've got some perfection. And pick zero corresponds to points that come from finite levels. So Ben Hoyer gave us this exact sequence. And now we can see that pic of E infinity Of E infinity can inherit torsion from, let's say, p roots of unity in K star, which certainly can exist if you make K star big enough. And you can also have the failure of P to act surjectively by having certain elements of K star which don't have certain P power. Have certain p-power roots. So we have some perfectoid space, but this tells me in particular that pick of this tilt is not isomorphic to pick of E infinity. So this comes from actually looking at this degree map at finite level. Green map at finite level and then passing to the inverse limit and then showing that sort of it remains exact. And this comes from actually looking at the special fiber very carefully. Oh, I mean, I can take a pth root of unity in here that's not a power of q. And then its pth power might be one. Yeah, any pth root of unity, I think, any non-trivial p-theat. Unity, I think. Any non-trivial p-throot of unity should give me white. Okay, so now I want to talk about how to build a comparison map. So I'm So, I'm not exactly, I guess I shouldn't expect these Picard groups to always agree, but it's not so hard to build a comparison map and then try to analyze the obstructions to it being an isomorphism homologically. And this is exactly what we're going to do probably with the rest of, well, the next little bit of this talk. So, here's the setup. So, you can identify. Maybe this is a silly way of doing this, but one can identify x and x flow. X and X flat and view sort of O X flat star and OX star as sheaves on the same site, on the same topological space. And now the tilting construction tells me that this really is isomorphic to the inverse limit along the pth power map of OX star. And this now is a And this now is a map of a homomorphism of groups. So, although tilting did not give us an algebraic construction of the tilt because addition broke down, this map is still multiplicative. So I do get a projection map here, which is just projection onto the first coordinate. And so passing to cohomology, right? And certainly, if I just, if I take the pth power map here, then projection onto. Then projection onto the second coordinate will factor through like this. So, passing to cohomology, I can take h1 here, which will be pick of x flat, and this has some map, which I'll call say theta 0 to pick of x. But it also factors through, I guess I should give myself slightly more room. Let's go way over here to pick. Way over here to pick of x, but then I have the pth power map, right? So, this is l goes to l to the p, and this will factor through like this, just sort of by taking cohomology of this triangle. And I can pass all the way to the inverse limit. Oh, goodness, I backed myself into a corner here. Well, it's just a limit along the pth power map of pick X. Power map of pick x, l goes to l to the p, and I get a unique factorization here, which I'm going to call theta. So I get a comparison map from pick of x tilt to pick of x, but really by passing to the inverse limit, I get a map from pick of x tilt to the inverse limit along the pth power map of pick of x. And this is some sort of perfection, right? I guess there's two notions of perfection. You could take a direct limit or an inverse limit along. Take a direct limit or an inverse limit along with power map perfection and copperfection, but I don't know which one is which. But this can be thought of as maybe a perfection of the Picard group of X. And so maybe if this is not an isomorphism, this might be. And that turns out to be true. So that's, I guess, the main result. The main result is, okay, so I need one more assumption. So I'm going to let X be a perfectoid space. So, I'm going to let X be a perfectoid space. And then I'm also going to assume that if I take the global sections of the structure sheaf of X, this is a perfectoid ring. So it is an open question as to whether this assumption is vacuous. It's unknown whether the sections of the sheaf on a perfectoid space are perfect. Perfectoid space are perfectoid. This is sort of some complicated descent theory in the algebra of perfectoid rings, but for very nice perfectoid spaces, for things that are like proper in some reasonable sense, this is just going to be our base field. So this is often true, potentially a vacuous assumption. Then this map theta from the Picard group of X tilt to the inverse limit along the Pth power map of the Picard group of X. Of the Picard group of X is in fact an isomorphism. So that's sort of what is this telling us? This is telling us that this example over here, that sort of the failure of them being an isomorphism is the failure of P to act invertibly on the Picard group of your characteristic zero space, that that's really, in a very concrete sense, the only thing that can go wrong. Once P acts invertibly on your Picard group, Invertibly on your Picard group, the tilting won't change it. Great. So one can immediately extract some consequences. So I'm going to call this map pi because it's a projection. And I can pretty immediately compute, right, sort of the kernel of pi. This is the inverse limit of. inverse limit of the p to the n torsion of the Picard group of x. I need to be p to the n torsion at the nth level to land in one here. And so this we'd like, if you'd like, is the piadic tate module of x. And the image of pi, let's say, is the maximal p-divisible submodule of Of the Picard group of X, which is very much related to the Picard group of X, everything that's a p to the n power for all n, but it's not exactly that. So it might be a little bit smaller, but if you have like bounded p torsion, then this is often the same as pick x to the p to the infinity if you have, say, bounded p-torsion. Otherwise, there might be a derived limit showing up in something. So in particular, this comparison map from pick of x to pick of x tilt to pick of x, well, we know it surjects onto the p-divisible submodel. Onto the p-divisible sub-module, and that its kernel is the p-adic tate module. So here's this comparison map I was interested in, and I actually know sort of its image and its kernel explicitly in terms of the action of P on the Picard group of X. So we get some immediate corollaries, which is theta zero is one. zero is one injective if and only if the piadic tape module is zero so this will happen for example if i am if pick of x is p torsion free or even more generally has bounded p-torsion uh wait what am i saying yeah What am I saying? Yeah, yes. And then, two, it'll be surjective. Well, I mean, if it's P divisible, right? So if P acts surjectively on the Picard group, and then three, it's bijective if and only if pick of X is uniquely p-divisible. Is uniquely p-divisible. So we really can get a characterization of exactly how much these two things agree. Yeah, this same example that I'm erasing. If k star is small enough, it might not have, for instance, a pth root of one. So it's, in fact, for this example. So, it's in fact for this exact example, sort of the injectivity and the surjectivity are fighting each other. Because if I throw in more roots to get surjectivity, I start to lose injectivity. Right, and then so one might ask, I mean, one might ask about the ring theoretic picture, right? What is the local picture of this type of situation? Type of situation. And so here's a proposition of Bot and Schulze that is a corollary of the sort of atoll comparison theorem in prismatic cohomology. And the result is the following. Let's say R is perfectoid over a field, over a perfectoid field. Well, I mean, over any field. Well, I mean, over any field, well, let's say a perfectoid field. Then they can show that P acts invertibly on the Picard group of R. So, what is this telling me? This is telling me in the affine case, there is no difference. Somehow, the difference between the Picard group of X and the Picard. Between the Picard group of x and the Picard group of X tilt is really a global phenomenon locally, right? So, a corollary to this is that pic of R is isomorphic to picavar flat. So, for these perfectoid covers, in the affine case, in the case for just perfectoid rings, the group of finite projective modules in characteristic zero is the same as the group, sorry, of invertible projective modules, of projective modules of rank one in characteristic zero and in characteristic p. In characteristic zero and in characteristic p, these two things agree. That's one sort of consequence of this. And then there are some other examples that I suppose one could write down. So, some other examples where this is going to be an isomorphism. Where this is going to be an isomorphism is one could take X to be the perfectoid cover of projective space built in Schultz's thesis, or more generally the perfectoid cover of a Tauric variety, also built in Schultz's thesis. Then, here myself and here with myself. Peter Weir and Anvesh Ray, we showed that pic of X is uniquely p-divisible. So in these two examples, we also have no change of the card when we tilt. And then in the example that Jakob was asking about, so if I have a an abelian variety, then I can perform a. I can perform a uh, I guess what do I want to call it? Sometimes this is called a tilde, which is the inverse limit along the multiplication by p map of a. And this is perfectoid. And then Ben Hoyer shows that pick of A tilde is also uniquely p-divisible. So here. So, here tilting won't change the Picard group. So, in a large class of examples, the Picard group is preserved by tilting, but not always. Oh, and I guess we can sort of look at it for the example. I'll do one more example and then give myself a little bit of time to talk about the proof. I think it's sort of worth. I think it's sort of worth, I think this sort of maybe fleshes out a little more carefully Jakob's question from a moment ago, which is so we were looking at this E from before, which was K star mod Q to the Z. And then from here, we formed some E infinity. And now one thing we could do is we could do the same thing in characteristic P. So I can let E flat. So, I can let E flat be that, well, I take the perfectoid tilt of K. And then I mod out, well, because this is equipped with a Pth power system, I can sort of tilt this element. So I'll call this Q tilt to the Z. And this will give me some E infinity tilt. And so my until the Picard group of E infinity tilt to the Picard group of E infinity. infinity restricts to a map from k flat star mod q tilt to the z one over p to k star mod q to the z one over p and then this sort of projects from just my sharp map from k flat star to k star 2k star. Sorry, this should be projection. And so somehow we can, the kernel and co-kernel of this map on Picard groups can be fully understood in terms of the kernel and co-kernel of this projection map on the multiplicative groups of these two fields. And so it's controlled by, for instance, the kernel of this map is the p-adic k module of k star. And the co-kernel of this map is generated by elements which are not pth powers in k star. So we can understand the co-kernel. k star. So we can understand the coat kernel and co-kernel of this map specifically in terms of elements of k star of this field that are either pth roots of unity or that don't have pth roots. Okay, so these are some examples of things you can unwind. I'll pause briefly for questions before forging on ahead. Okay. So I guess I want to say I haven't said anything about why this is true. So I'd like to. So let's say a note on the proof. Note on the proof. There's sort of two parts as one might expect: a sort of local calculation involving sort of topological algebra and then a globalization involving some homological algebra to sort of glue the result together. And And so I'll say a few words about that. There's one sort of main technical ring theoretic result. So the main technical input is the following. So first I'm going to set some notation where let's say A is an abelian group. And I'm just going to denote by lim the functor that is the inverse limit along the pth power map on this abelian group. And so the main technical input is the following proposition, which is if R is a perfectoid ring, A perfectoid ring. Well, again, we should think about R being a perfectoid ring as almost meaning, and you can make this almost in a precise way, that almost the pth power map is surjective on this multiplicative group. This is far from being true. But somehow you can approximate the image of the pth power map. You can approximate elements in R star in some topological way by things in the image of the Pth power map. things in the image of the pth power map. And so that should maybe make it not super surprising that one can have an approximate ML condition along the Pth power map of R star. It's not, if the Pth power map on R star were surjective, then you'd have a multiplicative, you know, a mid-tag Leffler condition and this R1 limb would vanish. But it's not surjective on the nose. So one has to do some topological approximation and then get. And then get this vanishing. So, somehow the perfectoid condition plus some analytic stuff allows one to prove this technical thing. Yes, yes, it's exactly. Yeah, that's why I wanted to just sort of say that first. But yes, it's the PH power map here. Yeah, exactly. Right? And so, how, I mean. So, why? Why does that vanish? This is actually kind of interesting. So, the first thing is that the perfectoid condition gives the ML condition on the nose on sort of so R0 is going to be this integral subring. And then I can mod out by this sort of. mod out by this sort of pth root of p and take unit groups and here for benius is actually surjective on the notes so i get an ml condition which tells me that here r1 limb r0 mod pi star actually vanishes two then i'm going to use an exact sequence that looks like That looks like this. This should be an R zero zero mod pi star to zero to sort of deform the result. So to obtain the result for our zero star. And so these are the sort of the two easy steps, I would say. And then third, I guess I can write down. I guess I can write down this exact sequence zero to r zero star to r star to r star mod r zero star zero to reduce it to analyzing this quotient ring. And here, to sort of reduce it to showing that this R1 limb vanishes. Vanishes and there you're going to actually need sort of the full power of the perfectoid theory. So here you really have to do some analysis and sort of cover your neighborhood by addict spaces and do some analysis and sort of look at this. There's this sort of very difficult comparison theorem in Schultz's thesis that, or this approximation lemma, that it's able to sort of show that here we do have an ML condition. And that's, I think, at least for me, that was like the most difficult part. At least for me, that was like the most difficult part of this entire project. Was showing this vanishing of this inverse limit. So that's the main technical input. Once you're there, then the result falls out of a spectral sequence. Which, thankfully, for me, but maybe not for everyone in this audience, I will have time to write down. No, I think it's kind of fun. No, I think it's kind of fun. I think it's interesting because it really does tell you where the different pieces fit. So, now so with this in hand, with this sort of technical lemma in hand, what I'm going to do is I can identify sort of OX flat star with the inverse limit of OX star. And then I can look at the following composition of functors. So I can look at sheaf of abelian groups. Of functors. So I can look at sheaf of abelian groups. On I'm identifying x and x flat topologically, so I'll just write x. And I can take inverse limits to sheaf of abelian groups on x, and then take global sections to abelian groups. Or if you'd like, I can take global sections to abelian groups, and then inverse limits of the global sections and get two spectra. And get two spectral sequences, right? So let's say E P Q two, which will take H P on X of R Q lim of, let's say, O X star. And this will converge to H P plus Q on X of O X flat star. O X flat star, where I'm sort of passing the doing the limit on the ints. Is that right? Oh, of R limb. No, no, no. Right, right, right, right, right. Sorry. Of actual R limb of OX star, whose H0 term will be OX flat star. And I can do this in the other direction. So this will be our P lim of HQ X. X of OX star converging to the same thing. So these are just the composition of functor spectral sequence in the two different directions. Yeah, it's the limb along the multiplication by P map or action by P map. Yeah. Yes. It's the same limb all around. No, no, no. This is totally, totally, totally fine. No, no, no, this is totally, totally, totally fine. Yeah, absolutely. So that's what this limb is. And so what falls out of this spectral sequence? Well, I get two exact sequences. The first one takes me to zero to then E10, which is H1X, and then limb0 is OX flat star to H1X. H1 X of this R limb OX star. And then I get the global sections of this R1 limb of OX star. And then the other exact sequence will be zero to R1 limb of the global sections of X of O X star to the same thing in the middle. In the middle, and on the right, I have the inverse limit, R0 limb, of H1 of X of OX star. And these are equal. This right here is the Picard group of X tilt, which I care about. And this right here is the inverse limit of the Picard group of X, which I care about. So the map, the comparison map that I'm trying to show in is an isomorphism. That I'm trying to show an isomorphism is this diagonal. And then you can start crossing things out. So, in fact, you can show that this goes to zero because there's no R2 limbs. And then this goes to zero by the technical input. This is by my lemma that I'm going to erase next. So this gives you injectivity right away. Right, so now I have this exact sequence zero to pick of x tilt to the inverse limit of pick of x. And then sort of my barrier to surge activity is the global sections of this R1 limb of OX star. But then again, this thing on the right here also locally vanishes by this proposition that I just wrote. This proposition that I just wrote down on the left. Like this sheaf itself locally vanishes on the basis of perfectoids, because on these perfectoids, the R1 limb vanishes on the notes. So I can actually get vanishing of this by the lemma as well. And so the technical lemma gives me all the vanishing of the cohomology groups that obstruct this to being an isomorphism. And I think then you win. So that's. So that's generally how one might argue such a thing. There's some sort of topological algebra in the local picture, and then a spectral sequence that the topological algebra makes sort of easy to analyze. Cool. Are there any questions? Well, first, let's thank. Oh, I could say one more thing. Sorry. Yeah, yeah. I'm looking at the Yeah, yeah. I'm looking at the clock. I'm worried I rushed a little bit. But I wanted to say one more consequence that I think for me motivate like the whole reason I thought about this project was I was once giving a talk at Columbia and Johan de Jong asked me a question that was like, how could your result be true? Here's a thing that like, here's some example of, you know, sometimes when you reduce mod P, Picard groups of things grow. P, Picard groups of things grow. And so I was studying this map from a different angle, and I got a very vague sense of certain cases where this was injective. And he was like, How can it be true? Think about an elliptic curve cross itself. The Picard group can really grow when you reduce mod P if that elliptic curve is super singular. And so I thought about that example for a long time and was able to sort of then think about, you know, one thing I spend a lot of time. About, you know, one thing I spend a lot of time thinking about is what are Picard groups of perfectoid covers? Right, so for example, if A is an abelian variety, I said earlier that one can look at the inverse limit along multiplication by P of this group A. And one might ask, what is the comparison if I do pick of this? I have some natural map from the inverse limit. From the inverse limit along pulling back by P of the Picard group of A. And in almost every example that I had ever seen, this was an isomorphism. And so I just wanted to sort of point out that the first example I ever saw where this was not an isomorphism was, well, Johan brought up this thing to me. I thought it meant my theorem was wrong. And then I think would stead what it meant. Wouldstead, what it meant is that this is often not an isomorphism. So, for instance, if I let A be you know E cross E, where E has super singular reduction. Then I get sort of this kind of map from, let's say, pick of the reduction. Of the reduction, let's say A, I'm just going to write K flat to pick of A tilde, K flat. And now I know that this is isomorphic to pick of A tilde. And this has a map from pick of A. And so in particular, for instance, if A is the supersingular reduction, this here has Neuron Severity rank 3. Three and this here has neuron to very rank six, let's say. Isn't it a big AK plus? Yeah, so what do I really mean? So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to start with EA over QP, and I'm going to like reduce it mod P in like the silly way, right? I just look at the Z B model, get something over F P, K flat is an F P ring, so I just base change all the way up. That's that's, I think, what I mean here. And then A tilde is. And then a tilde is not perfection, but this sort of inverse limit along multiplication by p. This is what I mean by a tilde. It won't be the perfection because the perfection is a homeomorphism. And here you might have some p-torsion. But I guess the point here is that now all of a sudden this is forced, at least over Z1 over P, to have Picard rank six, or to have Neron Severi rank six. Her to have her own severity rank six as a Z1 over P module. So there's no way that I can hit it with all of the Picard group of A. So, for instance, somehow I think this is really, really remarkable because what this says is completely in characteristic zero. I can start with an abelian variety completely in characteristic zero. I can take some perfectoid cover, never leave characteristic zero, and somehow witness the jumping of the Picard rank when I mod out by P. So, I mean, this was sort of. I mean, this was sort of one application of why I was thinking about this that I sort of squeezed in, I sort of shoehorned into the last five minutes, but yeah, I took it. Huh? Why does item 1 to be true? Ah! Yeah, that's a very good question. So this is actually another theorem of Ben Hoyer: is that this is uniquely p-divisible. Divisible, and that this Divisible, and that this is the tilt of the perfectoid cover. Well, the fact that this is the tilt of the perfectoid cover, you can sort of see because the tilt is determined entirely by the special fiber. And because I'm sort of starting with the special fiber by reducing and then base changing up, the special fibers sort of have to line up. Yeah, so this is this is so this being an isomorphism is, I guess, a result that we were talking about. Isomorphism is I guess the result that we were talking about today. This being uniquely p-divisible is a result of Venhoy, and this is because they have the same special fiber. Yeah, and so that's, I think, where that can come from. All right, thank you. Any further questions? Yeah, I'm sure with the modular the perfect line modeler so I mean I guess this is I I think the Picard group of that is huge, right? And I don't know if P acts invertibly on that Picard group. I actually don't even know what the tilt of that is. Is there some like good If there's, is there some like good moduli interpretation of the tilt of the perfectoid modular curve? Yeah, that's where I would expect to look. Yeah. I mean, so yeah, I don't know off the top of my head of any applications of this to studying that. I think somehow, if you could understand what its tilt is in terms of some moduli interpretation, then this could tell you explicitly what the Picard group is in terms of some character. What the Picard group is in terms of some characteristic p-data. Some sort of, so that might be helpful if you're interested in what the line bundles on that perfectoid modular curve are. But off the top of my head, I feel like that, yeah, that Picard group is just going to be really, really big, like not even just like invert P, I think you're also going to like have like an infinite Z1 over P rank as well, which is, I mean, which is great, but it's hard to get a lot of control of. Of control of, I think, that's sort of generally the case for coherent data for sort of a random perfect data space that you look at is just like everything is enormous for whatever it's worked. Yeah. Yeah. The thing you wrote down that for the detail group of R and R side, there are R tactories, I think that probably doesn't repeat the detail comparison. I think that I think that just something to tell the declaration. So I think that's true for the integral case. I think that's true for integral perfectoid rings. I think it's the et al comparison that passes that result to the generic fiber. Yeah, yeah, but you're totally right. You're totally right. For the integral perfectoid case, the fact that the Picard group is uniquely p-divisible really is a result of the deformation theory and sort of the fact that you can deform line buttons. Of the fact that you can deform line bundles uniquely from some sort of perfect ring at the center of everything, yeah, absolutely. Are there further questions? All right, if not, let's think you're really good. Let's just have 15 minutes, and then our last part.
