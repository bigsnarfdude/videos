I'm not going to tell you to read the title because I discovered that it's a bit too long, an entire slide. So I'm directly going to talk to you, tell you what I'm going to talk about, which is a bacteria which is called Myxococcus desentuse. We'll call it Myxo for simplicity, for the entire length of the stalk. So Myxococcus is a soil bacteria, so you can find it in the soil. So, you can find it fine in the soil. And it has a very particular shape. It's a rod-shaped bacteria, as you see here in this video. And it is able to move alone and also in groups. And it is very efficient to change its direction. Instead of doing a U-turn, it changes its polarity, just switches the direction and goes the other way. So, yeah, and it also has this intrinsic velocity that allows it to move. Velocity that allows it to move, as you see here, to move forward. And when it moves in groups, it does some sort of pattern that we call swarming. Basically, it moves in packs, and all the cells are usually aligning with each other, as you see here, and moving while being aligned, right? So these are videos that we took in the mignola. So so what's the flow? Is it blood flow over there? Or That's the bacteria. And behind is just the bacteria going. It's just moving in some sort of, we're just filming it moving in the NFP tree dish. It's not moving towards anything for now. However, it will, right in the second video, because this is a nice bacteria when you look at it like that, but it's in fact a predatory bacteria. So it eats other bacteria. In particular, we have in this nice video Mixo, who will you will witness how So, who will you witness how it will eat E. coli, this entire population of E. coli? Why am I showing you this video? Because it's the video that contains all the information we need and everything we want to study in the lab. Basically, when Myxo will go and start eating E. coli, at some point when it starts lacking food, so after eating, it will start exhibiting some really nice patterns, right? So, here we see that some bacteria are starting to starve. So, this is To starve, so this is forming some protein bodies, and here it's uh, it's I don't know if you can see, but this is uh a pattern that is waves. Basically, that's what we're saying. Basically, when the first time I saw this movie, it's like I see it just vibrating, but you will see a zoom in on that right after. This is a pattern that we call the ripping pattern, and here, what we don't see because it's extremely zoomed out, is the swerving pattern right after the prey. So, if we zoom in on the prey. So, if we zoom in on the prey edge, we will see this pattern, where the waves that I told you about are here, which is the rippling pattern. So those are waves that are traveling either to the right or to the left, right? And they are colliding. And to the right, we have the swarming pattern that I showed you. So, those packs and cells that are moving in packs, right, and align. So, knowing, I mean, seeing that we had. I mean, seeing that we had two questions we wanted to answer in this project. The first one is: what are the mechanisms that are regulating these reversals of bacteria when they start switching their direction of movement? And what is their role in the formation of patterns? And the second question is, whether we can explain, starting from the same individual rules, those two distinct patterns, the rippling, the waves, and the swarming, the packs. So, to start answering this question. So, to start answering these questions, I'm not going to show a slide, although I should have. We started with some extensive data analysis. So, all these movies you saw took up about, I think, three years of the PhD of Jean-Baptiste. So, just so you know, this is an underestimated time of work, but this is a huge amount of work. And thanks to that, we were able to start studying the spatiotemporal dynamics. Special temporal dynamics of these two patterns, right? The rippling on the left and the swarming on the right. So the first thing we looked at, first metric we decided to look at, is the times between two consecutive reversals, right? And so when we looked at that and then we plotted the distribution, right at this point we discovered that these two panels are in fact different in these tangential reversal distributions, right? We have a unimodal distribution for the swarming and a bind model for the rippling. Forming and a bi-model for the reptilian. We have two distinct behaviors here in the same population and the waves. The second thing we looked at was the spatial alignment of these cells. When we looked at the rippling, we saw that their orientation is in fact quasi-1D. They're just rippling like this, right? Whereas when we looked at the swarming, so this is a video of some swarming pattern forming, it's forming as we look at it. Look at it. The cells, just like ants, actually leave behind a trail of sugar. And this lets other cells, other bacteria, follow this trail of sugar, and this is what will form the groups, right? So this alignment here is more 2D. It's an alignment with the sugar trails that are left from the cells. Okay, then we wanted to understand what about these two distinct behaviors. These two distinct behaviors, right? So, when we looked closer at the rippling behavior, we drew what we call the chimograph when we look at all, we plot all of the individual bacteria trajectories in time and space, and then so these are three particular trajectories, and we see directly the crossing of the waves, right? You see them here. And then we observe that, in fact, the reversals, which are in blue, in the blue circles, In the blue circles, we have very frequent reversals when the waves are colliding, which would explain the first peak, whereas some cells are able even to cross the waves, so they have less frequent reversal, which would pertain to the second peak that we observe. Okay, then what about the reversal dynamics? What do we know indeed about individual bacteria? How do they reverse? How do they reverse? So we know that starting from a bacteria that is living its life and moving in its movie, will at some point receive a signal, which we will define in a few minutes, and this would make it reverse and change its trajectory, right? When it does so, it goes through a phase that we call the refractory period, which is thought to be incompressible since. Incompressible since very early on. It's the refractory period that is incompressible, where in which, even if a cell receives a signal, it cannot reverse. It has to wait until it ends. When it ends, it goes through what we call the sensitive period, and when it does, if it receives a signal, it could be even higher than the first signal it received, it will reverse very fast. What about this signal? Who is this signal? This signal is thought to be. This signal is thought to be the contact signal, which is basically when densities of cells, when a group of cells encounter and collision, they exchange a molecular signal upon collision and this makes them go the other way. So that's what we call the contact signal. I'll call it the C signal. So up until very, very recently, this was thought to be the signal that explains the reversal of the bacteria. The reversal of the bacteria. So, and up until that moment, we knew that the reversal frequency of the cells is regulated by the signal. So, more signal, more reversal, more frequent reversals. Up until this really nice paper that can be summarized, I think, in this very nice graph that I am not going to explain. I'm just going to tell you exactly what it does. They discovered in the Mino Lab in 2018 that there's a new player. That there's a new player that is actually capable of accelerating this refractory period that was thought to be incompressible. Right? So, this incompressible refractory period was in fact very, very much compressible. And it's in fact also signal dependent. So, the refractory period is also regulated, can be shortened or it could be longer by the signal. So, a simple question that we thought or that we asked was: what is the role of the regulation of Role of the regulation of the reversal rate versus the regulation of the refractory period on the collective dynamics, not just individual material, and on the formation of platinums. For that, I have 10 minutes left. For that, I'm going to have to explain to you two mathematical models that are present in the literature. Why? Because instead of, I mean, Why? Because instead of, I mean, to answer these questions, instead of just starting to do our own mathematical models, maybe some other models answer our question and then we have very little math to do. So two models exist in literature. There's the age structure model and the phase structure model, which I'm going to summarize in this simple drawing. So the age structure model says that there are two densities, row. says that there are two densities rho plus rho minus moving as with like plus plus v so moving to the right let's say if we're in 1d and moving to the left minus v for rho minus where they are structured and so we have they depend on time on space and on the time since that's reversal which is here the age or s which i call s and this s goes through as i told you before this incompressible uh refractory period up until it the the the bacteria enters its sensitive period where it can Bacteria enters its sensitive period where it can reverse depending on the signal. And when it reverses, I mean, it starts going to right-moving density, starts going to the left, and then its age goes back to zero. So it starts aging again, right? So in the equations, this looks like this. So we have the evolution in time, transport, the aging, and finally, we have the reversal rate here, which is the gamma here, which is basically. Which is basically the C signal, which can be written like this: basically, to reverse right-moving bacteria depend on the density of left-moving bacteria for all ages. So, that's to be short. What's the phase structure model? It's actually quite similar but also quite different. Basically, we have also two moving densities, rho plus and rho minus, that depend on time, space and phase this time. Time, space, and phase this time. This phase is periodic, so it goes through from 0 to 2π. Right-moving cells with plus V velocity go through, after reversal, go through a refractory period. They go through the space at constant velocity. And then when they enter the sensitive period, this sensitive period can be modulated by the signal, the same one, the contact signal, up until they arrive to pi, where they reverse, and then they start going to the left, and then they reverse. Start going to the left and then they reverse, etc. Right? And so the equations are not extremely different. We have evolution in time space and then we have the evolution in the phase, right? The phase velocity. This phase velocity also depends on the conduct signal. And in both these models, it's the reversal rate that is regulated by the C signal, right? Here and there. It's how fast I get to reversing. Okay, so. Okay, so we wanted to create a theoretical framework where we can study the two different regulation mechanisms, right? The reversal rate versus refractory period. So we took the first paradigm, so the age structure model, but we did not forget the phase structure model. You'll see we also worked on it. Where so we structured the equation also by age, by time since last reversal, where we have, so now you know the equations, you have evolution, time space, and age, and where. Time space and H. And where it's in the right-hand side, where we will have the two different regulations, we either have the regulation of the refractory, the reversal rate gamma, depending on the C signal, and the refractory period is taken as constant, or it's the reversal rate that is taken as constant, and the refractory period is dependent on the C signal. Right? It's the same C signal, and of course, whenever sensitivities reversed, Whenever sensitivity is reversed, we find out at H0. And so, to cut a long story short, we did a linear stability analysis on this model, on the age structure model. And we observe in the analysis that this analysis, the linear stability analysis, depends on two non-dimensional parameters, right? But here we plot them as one with respect. We plot them as one with respect to one of them, which is basically the ratio between the refractory period and the average reversal time. And we look at the eigenvalues. So the linear sub-trial analysis, when we perturb the homogeneous steady state, then we look at the sign of the real part of the eigenvalues in the Fourier modes. And so something very interesting that comes out right directly from this plot is that when we modulate, when we regulate the reversal rate, we have The reversal rate, we have very slow pattern formation here, which we observe in very low eigenvalues. Whereas, when we modulate the refractory period, we are very fast. After this small threshold, we are very fast in the region where we have pattern formation. Just to show you a plot of our simulation where we see that starting from a homogeneous state, we can obtain very fast. We can obtain very fast our rippling behavior. This is the same chemograph I showed you for the data, the biological data. So, as I promised, I'm not going to show this. So, the conclusion of this analysis, of this question, is that actually modulating the refractory period is much more efficient in generating patterns than modulating the reversal rate. Rate, right? And we did this in this model, in the H structure model, but we can also do this in the phase structure model. So we changed the model by Igoshin, the phase structure model. We changed it so as to take into account that this refractory period can be shortened or lengthened by its signal. And we also obtained, we also saw, I just summarized the result in these two chymographs, that when we modulate the reversal rate, The reversal rate, phase velocity in this case, we have a slower pattern formation than when we modulate the refractory pair. So maybe I can end this in three minutes. So now that we answered our question about what is the role of different regulation mechanisms on pattern formation, we know that one is more efficient than the other. What makes cell reverse? Reversed. Up until now, we hypothesized the C signal, which is present in all literature. However, the C signal is designed for rippling, right? This contact, this very 1D contact and the molecular exchange is very rippling-like. Whereas in the swarming, we actually tested it and it's absent from the data. So we don't have one single signal that is able to explain the two reversals and the two different patterns. Whereas we saw that they share an interface, they're not happening at Interface. They're not happening at different time scales or different space scales. So we had this new hypothesis that is inspired by chromodynamics, actually, which is basically if you put yourself, if you look at these bacteria, these individual bacteria, you see that in swarming fields, they are extremely congested and they don't want to overlap. So they are constantly deviating their trajectories and realigning and redirecting. And this is actually. And this is actually something called frustration. Basically, what we're saying is that our bacteria are frustrated. And this is what we observe. This is our intuition. So we wanted to understand whether this is true. Are we detecting frustration? And how is that linked to cell reversals? So very fast, I'm going to show you what frustration looks like. I need you to pay attention to this yellow bacterium here, which is trying to enter this pack of cells that is. This pack of cells that is extremely congested, and we can see that at some point it says, you know what, I'm out. And then it just leaves. And so, this is exactly what we want to capture mathematically. It's frustration. And actually, it's quite simple. It's already defined in quite dynamics. We can define two vectors, its own intrinsic velocity vector, the one that is aligned with its body axis, that has the speed that it has, its intrinsic speed, versus the velocity that the. Velocity that's the green one versus the velocity that we observe, that actually adopts. And the frustration is actually a quite simple formula, like something regarding the scalar product, right? We want to measure the deviation between these two velocities. The question is, is this frustration correlated with reversals? Basically, what we're asking is: are frustrations higher statistically just before a reversal than anywhere? Reversal than anywhere else in the bacterium's trajectory, far from a reversal? Okay? The answer is yes. We found that in both swarming and rippling, about 60% and 40% of reversals actually occur at very, very high frustrations. So we do have a correlation between frustrations, elevated frustrations, and reversals. I'm going to end this in 30 seconds. So, we wanted to test whether we can explain both patterns with all the ingredients that I told you about. And so, we did a very simple 2D model, individual-based, where each bacterium is represented by a chain of spheres. And with a fairly simple interaction mechanism, whenever two spheres of two different bacteria interact, we apply a repulsion force, and bam, it's just it repels. Just it repels, and it's very, it's quite a simple model. Yeah, I know. And so we inject the following ingredients: the modulation of refractory period, frustration-based reversals, and the differences of the background alignment, right? The 1D alignment. So cells are always wanting to align 1D in the rippling and 2D with the sugar trails in the swarming. And we're hoping that this simulation reproduces this. Reproduces this. And we do. We do reproduce this. And we're very happy that this is the result. So we are able to simulate the coexistence of these two patterns that are sharing interface, the swarming networks, with the same individual rules. And so our conclusion is that the background anisotropy and using those same individual rules can explain the coexistence of these two different patterns. Of these two different budgets. Thank you. Have anyone liked to compare the movement of bacteria to the movement of a pack of little fish in the ocean? I think both of them are called squarming. Yeah, but. Former, yeah, but um, compared in what sense do you mean the same rules or the same? Um, so if I'm not mistaken, I think that in animal packs they use the same rules in the sense that we have pneumatic alignment, constant pneumatic alignment, but um I'm not sure we went, I mean, I'm not sure people went this far as to compare bacteria and fish. Fish, but they are moving in search of food, I assume. In sorry, in search of resources, right? Yes, yes, they they become.
