Thanks for inviting me. It's great to be here. The title doesn't give away the fact that this does have something to do with algebraic dynamics. And at the end, we'll see that everything is reduced to a question of whether two points on an elliptic curve lie in the same orbit of a certain automorphism. But it'll take a while to get there. There. So, what I'll be talking about today, let's go. Walks. So, by a walk, what I mean is a path that goes from integer lattice point to integer lattice point. There'll be certain prescribed allowable steps. The steps are chosen from the kind of unit steps. Kind of unit steps in the north, northeast, east, so on direction. So I have them here. A step set will be a subset of this. And I identify steps with pairs of numbers between minus one, zero, and one so that one can think of steps as just these tuples. So here's an example of a step set. These are a lot. Of a step set. These are allowable steps. I'm going to start always at the origin, and I'm going to stay in this first quadrant. And I'll come to a motivation for this in a little bit. So this is what a walk would be. And I want to, yes? Is 00 in a loud step? Excuse me? Is 00. Yes, it is. There'll be times when it won't be. There'll be times when it won't be, but for now it will. Okay? So I'm also going to assign probability. So not each step will have necessarily the same probability as another step. And what I'm interested in is the probability of starting at zero, taking k steps, and Steps and ending at a given point, L, S. Okay. And I would like to understand what this is, either asymptotically or explicitly or whatever. So for each K and each L and S, I could calculate that, but I'd like to know what happens as K, L, and S grow. So let me be a little more formal here to get notation down. So I'm going to. So, I'm going to describe what's a weighted model. So, I assign probabilistic weights to all of the possible steps. So, the ones that have non-zero probability will be my allowable steps. The ones with zero probability, I can ignore. And so this will be the setup. This will be the setup. There's a certain special case that is when all the probabilities are the same. And I can think of that as an unweighted walk. So I just give all the steps, the possible steps, the same probability. And in that case, essentially what I'm counting is the number of ways I can get from zero to the point ls by taking k. LS by taking K steps, K allowable steps. So again, I'd like to understand this. And a standard way of understanding the asymptotics of these kinds of things is to look at a generating series. So what we do is we code up these probabilities. So the integers L, S, and K, I make them exponents of X, Y, and T. Of x, y, and t. And so for ls and k, the coefficient will be the probability of going from zero, the origin to ls in k steps. And a little thought, you can see that this formal series actually converges for small values of x, y, and t. Okay. So why does one do this? Why does one do this? Well, it turns out that algebraic and analytic properties of this generating series can be translated to asymptotic properties of these coefficients. And for example, in calculus, we know that if you have a power series in one variable, and you know the radius of convergence, let's say is r, then the coefficients grow like one over the nth root of r. You don't learn. You don't learn it that way. The way you usually learn it is to calculate the radius of convergence. You look at one over the nth root of the coefficients, look at the Limb soup of that, and that gives you the radius. But you can do it backwards. So if you know, for instance, the radius of convergence of these series, you can say something about the asymptotics. If you know that it converges up to some singular point and you know the type of singular point, you can give even more. You can give even more finer information. And this is the field of analytic combinatorics. So the particular things I'm interested in are the questions of whether this series is actually an algebraic function or holonomic or differentially algebraic. And just to be clear, when I say holonomic, I may refer to something being X holonic. Refer to something being x holonomic or y holonomic or t holonomic. And what I mean, for instance, for x holonomic is that this function satisfies a linear differential equation just in the derivative d dx, but the coefficients can involve all the other variables. And if I say holonomic without x, y, or t, what I mean is it's holonomic in each variable separately. There are many ways of characterizing. There are many ways of characterizing it, but this is the simplest. And I can do the same thing with differentially algebraic. Here, I'm allowing any polynomial relation among f and its derivatives, not just linear. But again, it can be x differentially algebraic y or t. Okay, so the questions I want to address are: when is this a generating series? When is this a generating series of this type? So, why? Why do I want to do this? So, first of all, why are people interested in walks? Well, these things come up in physics and chemistry and statistical mechanics. Since I know almost nothing about that, I'm not going to say more. But they come up in combinatorics a lot. Many combinatorial problems can be reduced to counting walks. And here's a classic. Walks. And here's a classical problem over 100 years old: the ballot problem. You have two people running for an election. You know that A wins, but you'd like to know the probability that A is always ahead. As you count the votes, what's the probability that at any stage A will be ahead? One can translate this problem into counting walks. Counting walks, you start in the quarter plane. You go northeast if A gets a vote. You go southeast if B gets a vote. And what you're looking at is walks that never touch the x-axis. So, if you could count those, you can do this. And it's not hard. I've given the answer. But there are many problems. The answer, but there are many problems in combinatorics that can be reduced to counting walks. So, why the quarter plane? So, walks in the plane, we know all of them are rational, this generating series. And for walks in the half plane, we know they're all algebraic. So, since we know that, that's not interesting. But what about walks in the quarter plane? And that's the goal of this talk. What that's the goal of this talk to understand the differential and algebraic behavior. Okay, so I'm going to begin discussing this classification. So I'm giving an introduction to the talk now. The heart of the talk will come later. So not so long ago, people Uh, people associated to a walk a curve in a group. So it turns out that the curve was an algebraic curve of genus zero or one, and the group was, well, you'll see, is a dihedral group, which was either finite or infinite. So there are these two invariants of the walk, which I'll define. And the walks were classified using these two objects. These two objects. So, again, if one thinks about all the possibilities, there are lots of choices for your step set. Some steps will be meaningless. So, for instance, if your step set just has one step that heads south, you're not going to get any walks in the quarter plane. You're not going to go anywhere. Some walks are related to others by some kind of symmetry argument, and in the end, Symmetry argument. And in the end, there are 79 interesting ones. And this was given in a paper by Bouskey Melou and Marnie Mishna, 2010. And since then, we've been able to classify the unweighted walks, that is, the walks where all the probabilities are the same. And it's interesting when the this Interesting, when this group, which I haven't defined yet, is finite, the generating series is either algebraic or holonomic. This is the work of many people. The dot, dot, dot could go for a long time. When the walk is infinite, this generating series is not holonomic. And again, this is work by many people. Let me stop. People, let me stop and say, well, how do you show something is not holonomic? Well, one way, if it were a series in one variable, if you analytically continued it and ran into an infinite number of singularities, it can't satisfy a linear differential equation. Things that satisfy linear differential equations have only a finite number of singularities. And this was one method. Another method is we Another method is we know a priori what the asymptotic should be. There's a power of n involved, and that power has to be rational. And if for other reasons you can show that the coefficients don't have those asymptotics, then the series is not holonomic. So now the question is: okay, these series don't satisfy These series don't satisfy linear differential equations, but do they satisfy other differential equations? And I'm going to make some reductions before I give you the answer. So these are things that are not obvious, but they're nonetheless true. It turns out that the series in all of its variables is x differentially algebraic. If and only if, when you specialize the y variable, it's still x differentially algebraic. One direction I think is clear. The other direction requires some work, and I'm not going to say how it's done. It's not difficult, but it's true nonetheless. Turns out things are x-differentially algebraic if and only if the specialized equation where you specialize x to zero is y-differentially algebraic. I'll give some. I'll give some indication of why that's true. And finally, with respect to t, turns out that if something is not x differentially algebraic, it's not t differential algebraic. And this is a serious result. It requires quite some work. So, this question of the generating series being differentially algebraic, I'm going to focus. I'm going to focus on whether you, when you take the generating series, specialize x to zero, whether that's y differentially algebraic. So it's enough to do that. Just take my word for it. And here we are. So I'm going to look at the, I said there were five, so the models with an infinite group, whatever this. With an infinite group, whatever this group is. The curve can have genus zero or genus one. I'm going to focus on the genus one case. The genus zero case is known as well. And it turns out it's a very strange thing that for the unweighted models, infinite group, genus one, here I've listed all the possible step sets, nine of them are differentially algebraic. Are differentially algebraic and the rest aren't. So none of them are holonomic, none of them satisfy linear differential equations, but nine of them satisfy a non-linear differential equation. And it's very strange. So this was first proven by Bernardi, Busque-Meloux and Rochelle. Lou and Rochelle. And they gave, I should say, the nine cases that are differentially algebraic. Those were proven by these three researchers. They gave fairly explicit formulas to understand these. The remaining cases remained open until this work of Dreyfus, Martin Rock, and myself. And we were able to, using our techniques, at least show that these. At least show that these series were differentially algebraic in the nine exceptional cases. So one can ask why, what's with these nine cases? And to do that, Charlotte and I considered the weighted cases. So one can look at these weights and ask for which values For which values of the weights do you get something that's differentially algebraic? And in this case, the answer is when all the weights are equal, these nine cases show up. But maybe there are other cases. And maybe that helps to explain why these happen. So here's an example. This was one of the exceptional cases when all the weights are the same. The generating series is different. The generating series is differentially algebraic. And it turns out, in the weighted case, it's differentially algebraic if and only if this relation holds. And if you see all if all the d's are the same, then clearly it holds. Here's another example. So this is a situation where when all the weights are the same, it's not differentially algebraic, but there are situations when it is, and those are. When it is. And those are precisely the ones that satisfy this equation. So it's interesting, they're algebraic equations that let you decide whether something's differentially algebraic. And here's just kind of an exceptional thing. This wasn't on my list, but I wanted to mention it because the techniques also will say that this is differentially algebraic if and only if a certain relation holds. Break if and only if a certain relation holds. And in fact, in that case, the group is finite and the generating series is actually holonomic. So where did these results come from? So now I'm going to get to the body of the talk. I want to talk a little bit about just generalities, introduce what the group is, what the curve is, and bring in a difference equation. In a difference equation. Then I'm going to talk a little bit about if you have a solution of a difference equation, when does it satisfy a differential equation? And finally, I'll give criteria, and in order to make the criteria effective, I'll be talking about this two-ovin Mehron tate height on elliptic curves. Okay, so there are a lot of formulas. I'm starting with a I'm starting with a generating series. I'm going to code up the steps by making this Laurent polynomial. So this step inventory to i and j, x to the i, y to the j, the coefficient is the probability of using that step. Then there's this funny polynomial. So, this is the Laurent polynomial. The powers could be minus one, zero, or one. I'm forming a polynomial here. It looks very strange why I would do this, but it's what comes up in the functional equation. So, this power series satisfies a certain functional equation, which I've given here. If you look at just the, let's ignore these. Let's ignore these. Let's see if I can do this right. I can't. If I ignore the second and third line, you just look at the first line. That turns out to be the functional equation for unrestricted walks, walks on the plane that can go anywhere. And you can see from it that if you divide by this polynomial k, the generating The generating series is a rational function. The extra terms come about from an inclusion-exclusion. You subtract off the contribution of walks hitting the x-axis, of walks hitting the y-axis. You've subtracted off walks going through the origin twice, so you have to add that back in. That's just a hand-waving excuse for why this functional equation holds. Equation holds. And there is a method in combinatorics, a philosophy, that says that if you set this polynomial k equal to zero and restrict to that curve, that's a curve now. You restrict everything to that curve. If you understand what happens there, you'll understand everything in general. This is what's called the kernel method. And I'll show you what I mean by this. Okay, so what's the curve? So, again, I have the step inventory, the kernel. Now it's a bi-quadratic polynomial. Remember that this step inventory had exponents minus 1, 0, or 1. When I multiply through by x, y, the exponents become 0, 1, or 2. So it's bi-produced. So it's bi-quadratic, quadratic in each variable separately. Here is the functional equation. And the curve of the walk, I'm now going to fix t to be a transcendental, or think of it as an indeterminate. And I'm going to compactify the curve. So it's an affine curve. I could compactify it in the projective plane, but it turns out. But it turns out that's not useful. I'm going to compactify it in P1 cross P1. So I'm going to put a point at infinity in the X direction and a point in infinity in the Y direction. If I would compactify it in P2, I'd be introducing a singularity. This way, it will be non-singular. And there's another reason that you'll see soon. So, when this polynomial is irreducible, it's bi-quadratic. You can show that the curve is of genus zero or one. And here are a couple examples. So this is what these curves look like. I've given the non-homogenized form. To homogenize it, I would replace x by x0 over x1, y by y0. Over x1, y by y0 over y1, and clear denominators. So that's the curve. What's the group? Well, this was a bi-quadratic equation. If I fix x, there are generically two values of y that satisfy this equation. And similarly for x. So if I take a point and fix x, 6x, there is another value of y that satisfies that equation. I mean, they could be the same, but generically, there's another value of y. So I could send a point to that other point. I do the same thing with y, fix y. There are two possible values of x. So take a point, send it to its other point. And that gives you involutions of this curve. And I can compose them. Compose them. So the group is the group generated by this I1 and I2. So sigma generates a cyclic subgroup. I1 squared or I2 squared are zero. So this is kind of a dihedral group. If sigma is infinite, it's an infinite dihedral group. If it's finite, it's a finite dihedral group. Turns out that. Turns out these things have been studied by people who look at discrete integrable systems. And there's a wonderful book by Deutschermann on this subject. It covers a lot of the algebraic geometry. It's really, it's a great book. So as I said, the group is infinite if and only if this sigma is infinite. And we actually can get our hands on the group. So when the genus is zero, you can reparameterize the curve so that it's Parametrize the curve so that it's a sphere, projective line, and then the group becomes fractional linear transformations, and one can work with it. When the genus is one, when you compose two involutions on an elliptic curve, the automorphism you get is the shift by a point. So, in the genus one case, this sigma is you take a point and you, there's some And there's some fixed point that you fix, there's some designated point that you shift by. So I'm not going to prove this, but it's true. So in the genus one case, what we have is, well, we have this curve, let's say it's of genus one, and we have this group, and we have a nice automorphism of the curve that's given by shifting by a point. So, um So, one can effectively decide this, right? You have the equation, it's of genus one. It turns out if and only if it's irreducible and smooth. Now, what about the curve being infinite? Well, that's if and only if this sigma is infinite, if and only if the point that you're shifting by has finite order. So it turns out. It turns out that these are curves defined over a function field, q of t, let's say. And for those curves, we know what the torsion is. We have a list of all the torsion subgroups. It turns out that if the order of this point is bigger than six, it's infinite. So one could check. You take your sigma and you apply it six times. If you still don't get something that's the identity, it's infinite. I just want to say that this can all. I just want to say that this can all be checked. And one more thing: I'm talking about sigmas being an automorphism of the curve. Of course, it induces an automorphism of functions on the curve. And I'm going to use the same notation. If I start putting stars on things, I'm going to get confused. I don't think it'll be confusing, but if it is, complain. Okay, so what's the difference equation? So we start with this generating function. We have a functional equation. We have a group, a curve, and a group. And I said there's a difference equation. So let's look at the functional equation. I said the kernel method is set this k equal to k. Set this k equal to zero, restrict to the curve, we get this kind of an equation. And you see that when you specialize y to zero and you specialize x to zero, there's a relation among them. So they're related, and this helps quite a bit. It's not exactly clear here, but one begins to see why if one is differentially algebraic, the other one might be differentially. Algebraic, the other one might be differentially algebraic too. In any case, the generating series converges for small values of x and y on this curve. And with a lot of work, one can show they can be continued analytically on this curve. They become multi-valued, they have singularities, but you can continue this, these. This, these objects, to be multi-valued meromorphic functions on a curve. And this involves some delicate analysis. It was shown by several people. And furthermore, once it's analytically continued, this multivalued function satisfies this difference equation. So it's sigma of f minus f is some function. Is some function b, which is given here as a function on the curve. So the curve is some relation between x and y. x and y are meromorphic functions on the curve, and this is the involution applied to that meromorphic function. Don't stare at it too hard. There is some function like this. Once you have that these things are, that you're able to continue them analytically. Continue them analytically everywhere. This equation is quite simple. You apply sigma to this equation and subtract it and do a little algebra and you get this. The key analytic step, excuse me. The key analytic step is to get this function to be something, to be an object on which sigma can act. An object on which sigma can act. It exists only in a small neighborhood. If you take X and shift X by the point P, what does it mean to apply F to that? You have to know that it exists globally. But that's it for the analysis. The rest of the talk is going to be algebraic. So the analysis is used to show the existence of something. Existence of something, and from then on, it will be algebraic. So, what do we have? We have a difference equation on a curve. So forget f, sigma of y minus y equals b. Sigma is some automorphism of the curve that's given by the shift by a point. b is some function. And I want to know when is f differentially algebraic? F is this product here, this first term. Here. This first term is a polynomial. If I can show the product is differentially algebraic, then certainly q is going to be differentially algebraic. So you have a difference equation. When does a solution satisfy a differential equation? So now I'm going to talk about this. So again, I'll remind you: you have this curve. Remind you: You have this curve, you have a group, you have this distinguished element of the group that's given by shift by a point. I'm going to assume the group is infinite so that the point has infinite order. You have this function that is a multi-valued Meromorphic function on the curve, and when you multiply by some polynomial terms, it satisfies this difference equation. Satisfies this difference equation. On the curve, there's a natural derivation. So you have an elliptic curve. There is an invariant derivation. There's an invariant differential. Its dual is a derivation. So it's something that commutes with the group action, particularly commutes with addition by a point. And as a proposition, And as a proposition, we have the following. So I've already mentioned that this full generating function is differentially algebraic if and only if this restricted one is differentially algebraic. A little more energy is required to show that this is differentially algebraic if, when you restrict it to the curve, it's differentially algebraic with respect to this delta. Needs to be shown. Needs to be shown. And then one shows that this happens for this particular function if and only if this equation has a differentially algebraic solution somewhere in some field on which you can extend this automorphism and the derivation, and they commute. So it's a little strange. I'm talking about a specific thing, but it turns out that if I could show any solution. That if I could show any solution is differentially algebraic, this one will be. Yeah, is there that equation has no algebraic solution? Differentially algebraic solutions. No, but does that mean that it has no algebraic solutions? Yeah, in particular, no algebraic solutions. So I'm just saying this. It requires proof, but it's true. So the thing is, how So, the thing is, how are we going to do the bottom thing? Okay. So, now I'm going to talk about the following general problem. You have a difference equation, and you want to know when solutions are differential algebraic, when they satisfy differential equations. There's a general theory for this. I'm going to start with some field. I'm going to call it a sigma delta field, and that just means it's a field. And that just means it's a field with an honomorphism and a derivation, and they commute. And I'm going to assume that the things that are left fixed by the automorphism are some algebraically closed field. This isn't absolutely necessary, but it simplifies the presentation. And there's a very nice result of Charlotte Arnois from many years ago that says it gives, well, necessary and sufficient conditions for this. So the question is, you have this first order difference equation, and you have something, a solution that satisfies now a differential equation. Okay, and you'd like to say, well, if it satisfies some differential equation, it satisfies a very specific one. And that happens. So it turns out that if it satisfies some differential equation, it'll satisfy a linear differential equation. Furthermore, it's a linear differential equation with constant coefficients. It's not homogeneous. These are constant coefficients, but the inhomogeneous part is something in the base field. So, if you have a solution in some extension field that satisfies some differential equation, you'll have a solution that satisfies a linear differential equation with constant coefficients and some inhomogeneity. So, you'd like to see whether that happens. And this is equivalent. Happens, and this is equivalent to something else. So if it satisfies some differential equation, it satisfies a linear differential equation. But more importantly, there's a condition on B that happens. So B must satisfy a linear differential equation where the inhomogeneity is given by The automorphism applied to G minus G. So I'm going to skip the intermediate part. So, what does this say? This is, in fact, the point of Galois theory. I mean, what's the point of Galois theory? You want to say something about the roots that lie somewhere. And Galois theory says that, well, invariance of the Galois group will tell you that. And the invariance will be in the base field. So, for instance, if a cubic equation has a Galois group that's smaller than the symmetric group, then y squared minus the discriminant has a solution in the base field. It's that kind of thing. So, this tells us that to decide whether something has a solution that satisfies the differential equation, I only need to look at b. I only need to look at B and decide whether there's some linear differential equation like this and a G that satisfies that. And this was the main machine that was used in this paper of Dreyfus, Ardo-Rock and myself when we showed that the information is a very important thing. The uh in our paper where we looked at the unweighted models. So I'm just restating what I said, that one needs to look at these, decide whether there's a differential equation applied to B that satisfies this. And in the particular case that we're interested in, Ardouin and I showed something stronger. Stronger that you don't even need the linear differential equation. The linear differential equation is enough that it be of order zero. So this is a kind of case-by-case study. We looked at the group the walks into various classes, and for each class, we showed that this was enough. That is, the The generating series is differentially algebraic if and only if this b, this very specific function in the function field, can be written as sigma of g minus g for some other thing function field. So stepping through all of the steps, this is what one needs to do. One needs to do. In each case, we need to see whether or not this particular function, the function field of the curve, can be written as sigma of g minus g. So one would like to have a criteria for that. And we do. So I'm going to now look at some elliptic curve. I have this automorphism, which is given by addition by. Which is given by addition by some non-torsion point. I can choose local parameters, that is uniformizing parameters at each point, such that they're related, that is, the uniformizing parameter at one point is gotten by shifting the uniformizing parameter at a point minus the designated point. That is, somehow, the uniforming parameters are related. Parameters are related. One can do this. If you have a function, you can express it in terms of the uniformizing parameters as a Laurent series. And I'm going to give a condition on these coefficients, the C's, up here. So for each term of order minus I at a certain point, I look at all. Certain point, I look at all the points under the orbit, and I look at that term at all the points under that orbit and look at the coefficients. Now, we have a function on the curve. It only has a finite number of poles. So I'm only going to get a coefficient here at a finite number of points, and I add them up. That's going to be the ith orbit residue. And the condition. And the condition that I have a certificate, that is that B can be written as sigma of G minus G, is that all these orbit residues are zero. So I can look at B, I can calculate these orbit residues if I want, and if I can show that they're all zero, then I can satisfy this condition. And so to determine this differential algebra. To determine this differential algebraicity, I need to look at orbits of poles and these generalized residues. And this is really unpleasant. So there's a, one can reduce it further. So what I just said was that this B has a certificate, sigma of G minus G equals B, and only if the orbit residues are zero. It turns out, It turns out I don't need to calculate the actual coefficients. In each particular case, there are two poles so that the orbit residues are zero if and only if the poles are in the same orbit. So all I need to do is check out. I mean, it depends on the model, but there are always these two points, and I just need to check out, is one point in the orbit of the other? One point in the orbit of the other. So I have an elliptic curve, I have two points, I want to end an automorphism given by the shift. Can I decide whether one point is in the orbit of the other? And so it's really a question of bounding this n in the orbit. If I could somehow bound, if they're in the same orbit, then n has to be less than something, then I would check. So for this particular weighted model, Weighted model, the two points are given like this. Notice that one of these points involves the weights. So this turns out that for this model, things are going to be differentially algebraic if and only if this m is in the order of this n. So, how does one do this? Okay, so I'm just restating things. The generating series of the weighted model is differentially algebraic if and only if, depending on those prescribed steps, two specific poles of B, two specific points on the elliptic curve, lie in the same orbit. And these two points that you look at, they depend on the model. Look at, they depend on the model and not the weight, in the sense that they depend on the steps. It's kind of independent of what the points that you're looking at is independent or independent of the weights. Whether or not they're in the same orbit will depend on the weights. So how does one decide this? So in fact, it turns out that if you could decide, if you would know what this If you would know what this n is, and in this case, the n is going to be 1. That is the only possibility if m and n are in the same orbit, the only way that can happen the first time it happens is when n equals 1. Then, well, what I'm doing is I've stated it a little incorrectly, but let's. Incorrectly, but let's yeah, okay. So you need to get this symbol. It turns out it's not, yeah, it should be two, sorry. But one needs to find out how to get this bound. And so if I had some way of measuring If I had some way of measuring the size of these points, perhaps I could use that size to get this. And that comes from the Neuron tetai. So let me remind you of the Mordell-Vay-Neuron theorem. You have an elliptic curve defined over a finitely generated extension of Q. You have the group of K rational points, and it's finitely generated. I guess Mordelve did it when K was a number field, and Neron generalized this when K actually was a transcendental extension. So from now on, I'm going to assume that this elliptic curve is defined over a simple transcendental extension of the rationals, and that it doesn't descend, meaning it's not isomorphic to a curve defined. Isomorphic to a curve defined over Q. Then there's a very nice Q-valued bilinear form. I want to emphasize that it's Q-valued, that it takes numbers in the rationals. It takes its value in the rationals. It's called the neuron tape pairing. And associated to it is a, what did I do? Is a quadratic form. Quadratic form called the neuron tata height. So if you have an inner product, then you can define a norm. And this has wonderful properties. So first of all, something's a torsion point if and only if this height is zero. So in particular, if you mod out by the torsion, you get a lattice. And that's a And that's a very useful object that people use. Furthermore, if one point is a multiple of another point, then the heights are related. The height of one is n squared times the height of the other. So, in particular, if I could calculate these heights, the rational numbers, I could figure out what n is. It turns out that I can reduce, again, it's not a difficult calculation, the question of if is M gotten by taking N and adding Pn times to a related question of whether M is the n-fold sum of this object. And finally, it is computable. Finally, it is computable. So it's computable. That's a long story, and I'm not going to tell you how. It involves intersection on a related quadratic surface. And that's a story in itself. But one can compute it. So here's the algorithm. So I have some model rational probabilities. I'm going to Probabilities. I'm going to look at them as indeterminate. I have this elliptic curve, I have this group that's infinite, it's given by this, there's this automorphism. And I want to know whether the generating series is differentially algebraic. So the reductions that I made said that this is differentially algebraic if and only if this particular function b on the elliptic curve. B on the elliptic curve can be written as sigma of g minus g for some other function. A further reduction says that that happens precisely when there are two designated points that depend on the step set such that one is in the orbit of the other. So one determines, one calculates this neuron tate height of these points, and one determines if there are integers n such that h of n is n squared times h of sigma of n. If no, you're done. It's not differentially algebraic. If it is, then you perform this calculation. You apply sigma n times to n. times to n. Sigma was this business of shifting the, you know, fixing the x value, shifting the y, then fixing the y value, shifting the x. You can do this. What you get is polynomial conditions on the weights. And this happens precisely when those conditions are zero. So in order for sigma of n, in order to sigma sigma In order for n and m to be in the same orbit, you get a bunch of polynomial conditions by applying the sigma enough times, and they have to vanish if and only if this is true. So it's a long story. It's kind of like taking an elephant and suffocating it by closing the pores one by one and waiting for it to run out of oxygen. But it's a path that's motivated by theory. That is, once we have a difference equation, we have theory that gives us criteria when the solutions are differentially algebraic. And then those criteria can be made effective by tools from arithmetic algebraic geometry. And so And so here were the nine bizarre walks that were differentially algebraic, the generating series, but not holonomic. When we apply this method, it turns out that independent of the weights, some of them will always have non-differentially algebraic generating series, and some will have conditions. And some will have conditions. It just so happens that for the six of them, the conditions are trivial. And for the other three, the conditions give you something. And it's kind of interesting. The conditions turn out to be conditions on opposite directions. And this always seems to happen. There are other walks, even in the situation where you have a very complicated condition. Seems to be conditions on the opposite directions. This has been looked into a little bit, but I'm not quite clear why this always happens. It's maybe a good question for ecombinatorial people. So that's really all that I wanted to say. Thanks. There's some time for questions if people have it.
