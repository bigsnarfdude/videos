Mathematics, there's mathematics behind things of course, you know. But the main thing is also to be entertaining. This is work supported by the National Science Foundation. I should put the logo on there. So I cover three topics which connected with non-self-adjoint problems. Self-adjoint problems. One is conduction in the presence of a magnetic field. So magnetic fields are often associated with non-self-adjoint problems. And then I'll talk about a technique that's been useful to converting things to self-adjoint problems in this context. And lastly, I'll talk about space-time composites and PT symmetry. And PT symmetry associated with that. And so, sorry, I have to get used to this. So, primarily, I'll be dealing with the conductivity equation, this one here. And then there's a connection with the Schrodinger equation in the case where x is basically a scalar. And you make these substitutions and you write the Schrodinger equation. But I won't be considering the case where sigma x is a scalar so much. Rather, I'll have the sigma x as matrix or tensor valued, and it'll be non-symmetric due to the magnetic field. And that's called the Hall effect. And you can rewrite these equations in this form if you like. And then if there's Then, if there's a magnetic field present, the relationship here takes this form here, where B is your magnetic field, E is your electric field, J is your current, and sigma naught is symmetric, and S is a matrix, which may be called the whole matrix, if you like. But say in the case where, and then conversely, you can invert. And then conversely, you can invert the relationship between P and J. And of course, this is a linear relationship here. You can see you can rewrite it in this format alright. And for an isotropic material, this matrix AH is actually proportional to the Denny matrix with that constant of proportionality that's called the Hall coefficient. And then, if you prefer, and then a number of talks on dealing. Talks on dealing with this equation, which is convection-enhanced diffusion. So, V is the velocity field which causes the convection. And if it's an incompressible fluid, you have the divergence of V equals zero. And equivalently, you can write that as V is the divergence of anti-symmetric matrix element field. And then And then so you can rewrite this equation in this form, where sigma, the conductivity, takes this form, and again it has an anti-symmetric portion. So one of the things we did was achieving reversal of the Hall coefficient, the sine of the Hall coefficient. So normally the Hall effect is sort of measured, for example. Sort of measured. For example, you've got a conducting plate, you put an electrical potential across it, and then the electrons or holes, if it's a semiconductor, feels a force which is perpendicular both to the velocity and to the applied magnetic field. So the force, the velocity is in this direction, the force. In this direction, the force would be in the transverse direction, and that force forces the electrons to one side, and then you develop a transverse voltage, which is called the hole voltage. And the whole voltage is proportional to the voltage in the magnetic field. Anyway, the sine of that whole voltage, or the sine of the whole coefficient, for a lot of Of the Hall coefficient for a long while had been believed to tell one the side of the charge carrier. Because this same elementary argument, if you have electrons flowing, and electrons would flow in this direction, versus holes which would flow in this direction because they're positively charged, you find out that the whole voltage by that elementary argument has opposite signs. But actually, there's a counterexample. And okay, so mathematically, it's sort of basically equivalent to finding a periodic composite, for example, with just cubic symmetry, where the matrix-valued electric field, so you normally think of the electric field as being vector-valued, but if you've got a composite material, you've got an applied field which is vector-valued as well. Vector-valued as well. And so there's some sort of linear relationship between those that determine the so-called matrix value of the electric field. And you want that to have a negative trace of its cofactor matrix in some regions. And whoops, I get used to this. So we were sort of working on this in two dimensions, and this is sort of And this is sort of related to earlier work with Finching Sernessi. And this is Mike Brion and myself. So we came up with a geometry in two dimensions, which looked like medieval armor, you know, chainmail. And my colleague was looking through the internet and found out exactly the same sort of Japanese, it was basically Japanese medieval armor. And so we contacted the artist. We contacted the artist who actually made this, and the artist suggested, Did you look at the three-dimensional geometry? And that turned out to be precisely what we needed. So that was sort of a nice collaboration between art and mathematics. And so I should have mentioned the geometry looks sort of like this with interlocking rings and these black Rings and these black dots we had were materials with high Hall coefficient. And you can sort of see the principle is that if you've got an electrical potential across here, then the gaps, in the gaps, the electrical potential and the electric field get sort of reversed from what you expect actually. So that's sort of part of the motivation there. There. And then a group in Carlsruck, KOT, took interest and simplified the geometry and did numerical experiments and were able, our mature was three-phase, and they were actually able to get it with one phase plus void. And they did the experiments according to whether the To whether the rings were separated or loops. And anyway, things worked out. And then they did the actual experiments, which was sort of very nice. So this is 3D printing. So it's important to emphasize that this is not a computer generated image. This is the actual microstructure that they're running. The actual microstructure that they were able to embark to make, and as you can see, it got quite a bit of attention, and the things worked out experimentally, which was quite well. So, this is another microstructure that my co-author, Christian Kern, came up with. And the basic idea is that the easiest way to reverse the The easiest way to reverse the hull voltage would be to reverse the leads, right? Sort of tricking someone into believing that it's got the wrong hole voltage. And so the idea is that you should be able to reverse the leads everywhere microscopically in all three dimensions. And so this geometry here does that. You can sort of see there's a lead coming off here. There's a leaf coming off here when it's sort of reversed. Anyway, it's a little bit like a rat's nest, but it actually sort of works out. And then there's other effects you can get, which give you this whole matrix, which is sort of anti-symmetric. And this is also known as the, now known as the Carol Hall effect. And once again, the same group simplified it and did the experiments. So and again, that's sort of an image of the real microstructure. If I can ask, what are we seeing in this picture? Oh, in the right. Yes, so this is, now I have to remember, but this is okay, this is the The whole coefficient in the not in the usual direction, transverse direction, it's actually sort of in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. And I forget what NY is. I'm sorry. So, if I want to identify the effects, what what confirms? Oh, yeah, it's been a while since I looked at this, but uh I looked at this, but sort of so here you don't get reversal. So theoretically, for an isotropic material, you would get sort of zero relationship. You wouldn't get any value here. This would be zero, actually. And this potentially useful for measuring the curl of the magnetic field, actually. Field of the sort. So, this is just very briefly, but I want to talk about transformation to self-adjoint form. So, again, this is sort of for the conductivity equation. So, here I have my conductivity equation, but now I have some sort of source term on the right-hand side. On the right-hand side, which I've written as the divergence of S. This is sort of without loss of generality. Of course, S is then sort of non-unique rather than actually having some source F here for current. And so sigma is not symmetric, and so we can split it into its symmetric part plus its non-symmetric part, and this is, of course, the non-self. Part and this is, of course, the non-self-adjoint part. And then we can sort of rewrite our conductivity equations in this form here. J0 is not technically the current. This would be the current here. But this J0 has the nice property that has zero divergence. And then, so Gibinaski and Shikhaev had actually, they weren't looking at this equation, they were looking weren't looking at this equation, they were looking at the dielectric problem or equivalently the complex conductivity problem. So this corresponds to conduction or the dielectric response of the material when the wavelength is much larger than the unit cell of the object. And so anyway, they did this sort of transformation, which is sort of easily mapped to To the Hall effect type problem with the non-symmetric conductivity. And then you can sort of adjust things further. They have basically real and imaginary parts of the field, but you don't need that. So this is sort of a twist, if you like, here. You've got your electric field here and here. You've got your current field here and here. And this should be just S. This should be just S naught, S naught. Sorry, this is S naught. And S naught is given by this token of S. So the key point is this matrix L, which is now entering the equations or also entering the associated operator, will actually be a self-adjoint matrix. And another nice. Yes, right, because sigma A is anti-symmetric. And anyway, it's not just self-adjoint, but it's also positive definite if sigma s is positive definite, which is the sort of usual situation. The sort of usefulness of Usefulness of this is that one can then develop variational principles and use those to generate bounds, which can be used to work out the range of possible or potential range of possible values of the properties of materials, actually. And so, for example, in the complex conductivity case, A complex conductivity case, one gets optimal values of the range there. And you can, yeah. So you have the two rows E, J0, J0, E. Is that a typo or just... No, that's the way it is. Okay. Yeah, and this, I should say this, here I'll split it into its symmetric and anti-symmetric parts, but actually I could split it into two parts. It doesn't really matter that these are symmetric or anti-symmetric. Symmetric or anti-symmetric, but then you sort of lose the symmetry here. And you can extend this sort of trick to wave equations in loss media at fixed frequency and also to scattering problems. Anyway, so I just put that as sort of a side thing that I thought may interest you. So, okay, this is my Okay, this is my collaborator, Onela Matai. So this is field patterns. It's sort of a new type of wave in space-time microstructures. And I gave the talk in Korea. And so I thought this was, I came across this sign, I thought this sort of really typified what I found eventually. So, sort of each. So, sort of easy here, we're basically dealing with wave equation in one spatial direction plus time. And the main thing is that the coefficients here and here depend upon both space and time, but they will be piecewise constant. And then you've got the sort of usual sort of initial conditions. Sort of initial conditions. And there's a nice book of Luria, Constantine Luria, which sort of describes these space-time microstructures. And now they've become sort of quite a hot topic. So just to look at the simplest case, you're sort of familiar with the spatial interface, because it's time in this direction. You hit an interface, you get a reflected and transmitted signal. Transmitted signal. If it's time interface, you hit the signal goes along, and you have one component that continues in the same direction as the original wave. And then you've got one in the opposite direction, actually. And so this is sort of very So, this is sort of a very nice experiment of the group of Matthias Fink, among other people. And so here you have a time interface, it's sort of quite a nice experiment. You basically take a bathtub and at a particular time you jolt your bathtub up and so you're essentially changing gravity in the equations, which gives you some discontinuity. gives you some discontinuity and that gives you this basically a temporal interface and so what's nice here is that so this is the time when you jolt the bathtub that the waves which go backwards they end up reconverging to the smiley face here or even the eiffel tower there in paris obviously but Sort of like. And this is the miracle simulation. And okay, you can also map this to a conductivity equation if you like. It sort of looks like a conductivity equation where now the conductivity tensor has both positive and negative eigenvalues. And then because everything's piecewise quantum. Because everything is piecewise constant in each material or each phase you basically have the standard wave equation. So if we plot the characteristic lines in just a simple microstructure such as a checkerboard, checkerboard in space and time. So this is the single point disturbance here and this is the current development of The development of the characteristic lines, which look like a real mess here. But you may want to avoid that complicated cascade. One way of doing it is to have some zero impedance mismatch. And so the rays go straight through without any reflection at either spatial or time interfaces. But that's sort of quite curious even. That's sort of quite curious, even in that case. What they find is that as time goes on, the characteric lines all sort of munch up. So it's a little bit like a shock, but it's a shock in a linear medium. That's the sort of curious effect that one has here. So an alternative which we thought of as these field patterns where there's some sort of commensurability between the microstructure and Between the microstructure and the wave speeds. And so now the characteristic lines form this sort of pattern. And if you start off at a different point, the pattern shifts, but it doesn't develop this complicated cascade. And then you can have other geometries which are field pattern geometries. Here's one with sort of staggered inclusion. One with sort of staggered inclusions. So again, they're sort of moduli, a sort of piecewise constant in the different regions. And then these have PT symmetry, P for parity or reflection under spatial reflection, and T for time or temporal reflection. And you can sort of see here that the field pattern itself is a reflective. Reflective symmetry here in time, and then say spatial symmetry about this axis there. And so in the unbroken case, one can get propagation of waves. And so this is essentially the time coordinate here and spatial coordinate there. And you've got a point source here. And you've got a point source here that then propagates out. And you can look at this three-phase checkerboard, and this is the unbroken case, and you get waves that sort of propagate outwards. This is the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix, and they're all on the unit disk. And then, if things are broken, things sort of blow up. Things sort of blow up exponentially. So that depends upon the parameters in the model. And in the dispersion diagrams, so normally this would be k, but because things are periodic in space and time, that one ends up with a dispersion diagram where this is the so-called quasi-momentum, and this is then quasi-frequency. Then quasi-frequency. And now, what's sort of interesting is that the imaginary part of the dispersion diagram, the imaginary part now is of frequency, can take complex values. And those complex values of in the dispersion diagram correspond to these blow-up of the fields. Of the Freemasons. Anyway, thank you. Thank you for the talk. Are there any questions, comments? Marks? Yes. In your checkerboard examples, you had several of them there where it was is it the same in every gray square in a certain same material? Right. Okay, so it's really alternating between two things. And there'd be a big contrast or I should say that that's, yeah, in the standard checkerboard, that was true. Okay, so that was true in the standard, but this is three-phase. And so maybe there's there should be sort of slightly darker gray and lighter gray, right? And there's different wave speeds in the three different media. Three different media that you can sort of tell the wave speeds just by the slope of these lines. So, sorry, did that answer your question? Yeah, yeah, but the contrast doesn't have to be significant to get these interesting. I guess you have it in the slopes somehow. Right, yeah. I mean, yeah, so things can sort of scale, but basically you have to have the slope which is reflected in the model. Reflected in the moduli has to be commensurate with the microstructure, you know, geometric. Further questions? Yes, please. So in this slide, for example, you have this idea that some of the gamma give you broken, some of the gamma give you unbroken PDC image. Yes. Is there a pattern? You know more or less what is sweeping them that lose one or those? Speaking then that this fire fills it. Yeah, so the short answer is no, but, you know, sort of found numerically. But we're not experts in PG symmetry, but my understanding is that it's maybe not so easy to determine the sort of critical value. Early questions? Online participants? Probably not. But thank you, Speecher Eleven.
