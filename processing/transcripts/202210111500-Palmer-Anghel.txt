Schrödinger and Stone von Neumann. Sorry, yeah, I should have waited for that signal, the recording started. But thanks, Martin, for giving the talk and go ahead. Okay, well, thank you very much. So first of all, I'd like to thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity to speak, even though I submitted my title and abstract and registered relatively late. So this is So, this is first of all, I should say, as it says here, that this is joint work with Christian Laché and Ave Chalkat. So this talk will be about constructing new families of representations of mapping class groups. So, first, let's just give one screen full of somehow a brief motivation and more precisely what the aim is. Precisely what the aim is. So to see, to look for motivation for why one should care about having interesting representations of mapping class groups, one can look at braid groups. This is sort of the most classical example. So why should one care about braid group representations? What can they prove? So the most famous example of this is Is linearity of the break groups. So linearity means that it's isomorphic to a subgroup of a finite rank general linear group over a field. So it acts faithfully on some finite dimensional vector space. This is just saying that there is a faithful, this is obviously about representations because it's just saying there is a faithful representation that's finite dimensional over a field, which is this is a theorem of Bigelow and Crammer from about 2000. Kramer from about 2000, and they used the so-called Lorentz representations to prove this. And then, if you know that a group is a subgroup of a general linear group, this makes a lot of group theoretical questions about the group much easier to solve. So, this is one useful application if you know that it has a faithful representation of this form. Representations of break groups also have applications to knot theory, going all the way back to the. All the way going all the way back to the Alexander and Markov theorems. If you have a Markov function on the braid groups, then you have an invariant of knots or of links. And they have applications to algebraic geometry as well. They give in, so by the construction due to Libgober building on work of Moisheson, you can build invariants of plane curves, so algebraic curves in CP2, given a representation of the Given a representation of a grade group. So, those are some sample applications. And then, the main aim that I want to talk about today is a project to construct analogs of the Lorentz representations, so those used by Bigelow and Crammer, for mapping class groups of higher genus surfaces. So specifically, I'll look at the connected, compact, orientable surface of some genus with one boundary component. And then, well, this is what I'll talk about today. This is the aim that I'll give some results for today. And then the motivation for this is the further questions about whether this can prove that the mapping transcripts are linear and whether one can extend these further to DQFTs. This is my way of somehow getting part of the title of the conference into my talk because now I have mentioned cobordisms, but I won't really mention them again, I'm afraid. Really, mention them again, I'm afraid. Okay, so that's the overview of what the aims are. So, going back to the braid groups, the oldest representation of the braid groups that doesn't factor through the symmetric group is the Bogart representation, which can be defined very explicitly by sending the standard generators to particular matrices. So, some two by two matrix and then just identities. Direct summing with identities on each side. Entities on each side. This gives a representation of the braid group on n strands into the general linear group of rank n over Laurent polynomials in one variable t. And then since you can send t to a transcendental real number, you can embed this into gln of the reals. And a question that was asked by Berman, but might probably was also older. Was also older. That was the earliest reference I could find for it. Was the question of whether this representation is injective? This would, of course, immediately imply that braid groups are linear. And it's true for small n. So for n at most 3, it's true. But for n at least 5, it's false. And that was proven by a series of papers in the 90s. And for n equals 4, it's still open. So no one knows if the Bohar representation for B4 is faithful. But in any case, Before is faithful. But in any case, it is not faithful for high n. But this still leaves the question of whether there's some other representation that one can construct, which gives you an embedding into a general linear group over a field. So whether the braid groups are linear. And as I said, this was proven by Bigelow and Crammer, but not using the Bohr representation, but instead using the so-called Lorentz, one of the Lorentz representations. There's a whole family of Lorentz representations. There's a whole family of Lorentz representations which have a more geometric definition than the one I just gave of the Paul Power representation. So to describe this, first let's write dn for the closed two disk minus n interior punctures. So its mapping class group is the braid group. First, let's look at the diffeomorphism group. This acts on Morphism group. This acts on the configuration space of k unordered points in dn, so in the complement of the n punctures, just by applying the diffeomorphism to all points in the configuration. It therefore acts on the homology, and since the homology is a discrete, has a discrete topology, this action factors through pi zero. So in fact, factors through the mapping class group, which is a break group. Again, this is not quite the Lorentz representation yet. Not quite the Lorentz representation yet. There are two modifications that one has to do. So, the first one is not to look at trivial coefficients, but to look at twisted coefficients. So, we choose a certain quotient of pi one of the configuration space onto some group Q, which I'll describe the quotient on the next slide, which has a property that is invariant under the action, the induced action of the mapping class group, sorry, of the braid group. Okay, and the fact that this quotient is. Okay, and the fact that this quotient is invariant means that we get a well-defined action on the configuration space equipped with this local system, and therefore we get an action on the well-defined action on the homology with twisted coefficients. Okay, this will then be a representation over the group ring of this quotient q. And then the other thing is that we'll look at not ordinary homology, but Borel-Moore homology. And this construction with Borel-Moh homology works for exactly. With Beryl-Mohhomology works for exactly the same reason. Everything goes through in the same way, but the Beryl-Mohomology has a simpler structure. It's just concentrated in the middle degree, which is degree K, and there it's a free module over the ground ring. Okay, and so this is then for K, for a fixed K, this is the K-florentz representation. So, I haven't yet explained how the quotient is defined. So, this is how it's defined. If k is 1, then the configuration space of one point on dn is just dn. So, we just need a quotient of pi 1 of dn, which is a free group, and we just send every generator to 1. Okay, so this is geometrically, this is counting the total winding number of the unique point in the configuration around all the punctures. And if k is And if k is at least 2, then there are two kinds of winding numbers you can record. One is the total winding number of all of the configuration points around all of the punctures, and the other one is the self-winding number, or the writhe. So you count how many times, how many half twists there are if you ignore the punctures and just look at the configuration points moving. Okay, and then it's a not very difficult lemma to check that this quotient is indeed invariant under the Indeed, invariant under the action of the braid group, and so this gives you. So, this the construction I just described on the previous slide is well defined, and this is the Lorentz representation. And then it's not too hard to compute explicit matrices for at least when k is one. And then you can see that the first Lorentz representation exactly recovers the Bohr representation. Okay, and the The big theorem of Bigelow and Crammer independently is that the second Lorentz representation is injective. Again, then because, so the ground ring is the group ring of Q, which is just Z plus Z. So it's just a Laurent polynomial ring and two variables. You can send those variables to algebraically independent real numbers. So this embeds into some general linear group over the reals. So this This implies that the braid groups are linear. Okay, so that's the Lorentz representations, and what we want to construct is some kind of analogue of these for the mapping class groups of higher genus. Motivated by this question, whether the mapping class group is linear, whether it embeds into GLN or some field. What's known about this is, of course, the mapping class group for the torus is just Class code for the torus is just SL2 of Z, so it embeds into GL2 of the reals or of the rationals. It's also known for the closed orientable surface of genus 2 that it embeds into GL64 of C. This is a result of Bigelow and Budney, proven as a corollary of Bigelow's proof, Bigelow and Kramer's proof of the linearity of the braid groups. And more generally, they showed that the And more generally, they showed that the hyperelliptic mapping flask group is linear using the same kind of techniques. But in general, for any genus higher than two, it's wide open. And then what I know about the general status of this conjecture is all from a survey paper by Dan Margalit, who explained that there was a proposal by Komsevich in 2006. Proposal by Komsevich in 2006 in a problem set of a sketch of a construction of a potentially faithful finite dimensional representation. But apparently, there is also computational evidence suggesting that it will not be faithful. So it seems that this could go either way, and it's not, yeah, the question is, is still wide open. So now I'll not talk about the closed surface, but I'll focus. Not to talk about the closed surface, but I'll focus on the compact orientable surface with one boundary component and just call it sigma for short. And then the main result will be stated very roughly that we construct a new family of representations, which are in some sense a genuine analogue of the Lorentz representations. Okay, this is a slightly subjective way of stating a theorem for the moment, but the more precise statement will, I'll state, I'll give more precise statements as I go. I'll give more precise statements as I go through the construction. Okay, so what is the simplest thing that one could try? The simplest thing that one could try is just to go back to using untwisted coefficients. So we can just consider the action of the mapping class group on the Borelmo homology of with untwisted coefficients of the configuration space. And just for this slide, I'm briefly going to switch to the ordered. I'm briefly going to switch to the ordered configuration space, which I'll denote by fk. This is just a finite covering of the unordered configuration space. And sigma prime denotes sigma minus an interval in the boundary, or equivalently minus a point in the boundary. Okay, this doesn't make a difference if we take ordinary homology, but it does make a difference if we take Borelmo homology, because they're not, these two things are not properly, proper homotopy equivalent. Proper homotopy equivalent. And as I said, we take untwisted Z coefficients. And just as an abelian group, this is free of finite rank. And these were studied by Moriyama in 2007, who precisely identified their kernel. So he proved that the kernel of the kth representation, where you take configurations of k points, is precisely the kth term of the Johnson filtration of the mapping class group. Johnson filtration is a mapping class group, okay, which I'll describe on the next slide. But the point here is that this is, in particular, this is not faithful. This Johnson filtration, every term of it is non-trivial. Okay, so let's see more precisely what the Johnson filtration is. So every group has a lower central series defined inductively like this. Like this. So the ith, oops, that's not what I was trying to do. Or the highlighter. Okay, so defined inductively like this. So the first term is just the whole group, which in this case is pi one of the surface. And then in general, the ith term is all commutators between an element of the group and an element of the previous term. Okay, so this means that the ith term consists of commutators, iterated commutators. Of commutators, iterated commutators of length i. And then the Johnson filtration, the kth term of the Johnson filtration is the subgroup of the mapping class group that acts trivially on the surface modulo gamma k plus one. So modulo the k plus one, k plus first term in this descending series. So this gives the filtration of the mapping class group. Of the mapping class group. The first term is just the Torelli group because acting trivially on pi1 mod the commutative subgroup is the same as acting trivially on the first homology, which is exactly the definition of the Torelli group. And among other things, Johnson proved that the intersection of this filtration of the mapping class group is trivial. Every element of every non-trivial element of the mapping class group. Of every non-trivial element of the mapping class group is detected by its action on one of these milpotent quotients of pi one of the surface for sufficiently large k. Okay, and then as a corollary of this, Moriyama deduced that if you take the direct sum of all of his representations, then this is faithful, because every element, every non-trivial element fails to be in some term of the Johnson filtration, so it fails. Johnson filtrations, so it fails to be in the kernel of one of them, so it acts non-trivially on one of them. But this doesn't help us very much because this is an infinite rank representation, so this doesn't help with the question of linearity. Okay, so this is a story when you take just trivial coefficients. So the next thing that one can try to do is to, well, as before, enrich the representation by taking homology with some. Taking homology with some kind of local coefficient system. This time it'll be a quotient of the pi1 of the configuration space on the surface sigma. So it's a quotient of the surface braid group, BK of sigma. And well, the first thing one can try to do is the same as before. So find some abelian quotient. This is just a side remark that the quotient onto the symmetric group, which just records the induced permutation of the base. The induced permutation of the base configuration, this corresponds to the Moriyama representations essentially by Shapiro's lemma, because taking these coefficients corresponds to passing to the covering given by ordered configurations. Okay, that's just a side note. But let's try taking abelian quotients. So the most, somehow the largest thing you can do is you can quotient to the abelianization. And this is always of this form. And this is always of this form. So if you have at least two strands, the abelianization of the braid group on the surface is just pi one of the surface abelianized, or H1 of the surface, plus an extra cyclic sum and this extra cyclic sum and here records the so-called writhe of Called writhe of so the relative winding of points in the configuration around each other. But it's so it's infinite cyclic if the surface is planar, and it's Z mod 2 in every other case, except the sphere, which is a slightly special situation. And anyway, we don't care about the sphere. So in our situation, we're going from the punctured disk, which was planar, where we could record the writhe as an integer to As an integer to a higher gene in the surface where we can only record it in mod 2. So we can only count the rhythm of braids on the surface S, modulo 2. And this means that the representation will then be defined over the group ring of this abelianization, which is some kind of polynomial ring, but the corresponding variable will have order 2. And in some sense, we get a much weaker representation. In some sense, we get a much weaker representation in this way. The coefficients are not able to faithfully record the writhe of a loop in the configuration space. And this is a significant issue if one cares about proving linearity or faithfulness. Because in Bigelow's proof of faithfulness of the braid groups, it's essential that one has It's essential that one has one can record the rhythm faithfully, so not mods two in the coefficients. Okay, so this is in this sense, this is not a genuine analog of the Lorentz representations. Okay, so instead we'll try taking certain non-abelian coefficients, non-abelian quotients. So the easiest way to do this is to use a presentation of the surface braid group. So we use one. We used one given by Bellingeri in 2004, which has the generators that I've written there. So it has the usual sigma i's of two consecutive points doing a half twist, and then additional 2G generators, which correspond to one of the points, let's say the first point in the base configuration going around a free basis for the fundamental group. And there are some relations which I won't write. And there are some relations which I won't write here. And then, if you just add exactly those relations that force sigma one to be a central element, then this presentation simplifies very significantly. And it's generated by two g plus one elements, so the ai's and b i's as before, and together with a single element sigma, which is the image of sigma one, so it's central. And all pairs of generated. And all pairs of generators commute, except that the commutator of Ai and Bi is sigma squared. So this is some right, this is some group presentation, and this is one of the definitions of the genus G discrete Heisenberg group. And while the name comes from the fact that if you take genus 1, then H1 is exactly, can be realized as strictly upper triangular 3x3 matrices of this form. Of this form. The fact that this is a Z12 is to do with the fact that the commutator of AI and BI is sigma squared and not sigma. Okay, so the Heisenberg group is a quotient of the surface braid group. And in order to do the construction in the case of braid groups, the key fact we needed was that the quotient. fact we needed was that the quotient is invariant under the action of the braid group. So in this case it's the corresponding factor is not true. So this quotient is not invariant under the action of the mapping class group but something slightly weaker is true which is that there is at least an induced a well-defined induced action on the quotient. So in other words this is equivalent to saying that the kernel of the projection is preserved as a subgroup by the mapping class group action. By the mapping class group action. Okay, and well, this is actually quite easy to prove because the kernel is by construction the normal subgroup generated by all of these commutators. So sigma one with any other element. And so it's enough to show that this element sigma one is fixed by the mapping class group action. And this is also easy to show because we can always assume that an element of the mapping class group is represented by a diffimorphism that's the identity in some colour neighborhood. That's the identity in some colour neighborhood of the boundary. And we can ensure that sigma one is supported in that colour neighborhood because it just consists of two point swapping, it doesn't involve the topology of the surface. And so if you take these representatives, then it's obvious that it acts trivially. Okay, so this gives us a well-defined action on the quotient hg, the Heisenberg quotient of the surface braid group. And this is related to the And this is related to the usual action on the first homology of the surface in the sense that the Heisenberg group is a central extension of the first homology of the surface, and the action on the Heisenberg group is a lift of the natural action on H1 of the surface. Okay, just to put it into context. Okay. So, an immediate corollary of this is that we are. Corollary of this is that we obtain a twisted representation over the group ring of the Heisenberg group. So, in the case of the braid groups, the quotient was really invariant under the action of the braid group, and this is what meant that we got a well-defined representation, a genuine representation. In this case, the fact that we have a weaker fact that it's not invariant, but there's still a well-defined induced action on the quotient. This is enough to tell us we have a twisted representation. Representation, where I should say what I mean by that. So a twisted representation is not really a representation on a single module, it means we have a collection of modules, v subscript tau, indexed by elements of the automorphism group of the Heisenberg group. Okay, that aut plus, you can ignore the plus for now, it just means that we restrict to a certain index to subgroup of the automorphism group, but this is. Group of the automorphism group, but this is that's not important. So we have a collection of modules indexed by this automorphism group of the Heisenberg group. And then every element of the mapping class group induces isomorphisms between possibly different modules in this collection. And then it has some kind of functoriality property which can be. Which can be phrased as saying that it's a, it defines a functor from a certain groupoid to the category of modules over this over the group ring of the Heisenberg group. Okay, and then just as a note, which is actually quite important, is that instead of just taking Instead of just taking the group ring of the Heisenberg group, which is what you get if you just take the local system corresponding to the quotient, you can replace it with any representation of the Heisenberg group over some other ring. And then this, by the same construction, gives you a twisted representation of the mapping class group over that ring. Okay. Can I just check that I'm still... Can I just check that I'm still connected because I just didn't see any evidence of being connected. Okay, good, good. Right, so yes, so now we have a, for any integer k, positive integer k, and for any representation w of the Heisenberg group, we have a representation, a twisted representation. Have a representation, a twisted representation of the mapping class group. So, the question is now: how can we untwist this to get genuine representations of the mapping class group or possibly of subgroups? So, I'll talk about three methods that we have for doing this. One is on a subgroup, so on the Torelli group. And this will work for any if we input any Heisenberg representation, this trick will work and we'll get a genuine representation on the Torelli group. Representation on the Turelli group. There's another trick that works not on a subgroup but on an extension, so on the universal central extension of the mapping class group. And well, I wrote stably in brackets because for small genus, there is no universal central extension. So we have to do something slightly different. But if we just assume the genus is big enough, it's the universal central extension. And this works just for the specific representation. Representation of the Heisenberg group given by the Schrodinger representation, which I'll describe when we get to it. And finally, there's another trick that works to untwist it simply on the full mapping class group without passing to a subgroup or extension. And this works for a different specific representation of the Heisenberg group. Well, which I'll describe when we get to it. It has some name, but I'll just describe it when I get to that one. Okay, so this is the aim to explain how to understand. To explain how to untwist it in these three different settings. So, on the Torrelli group, the key proposition is the following. So, we have this, the lemma that I was on the slides a couple of slides ago said that we have a well-defined induced action of the mapping class group on the Heisenberg group. So we have this action. We have this action morphism from the Mappentlass group to auto the Heisenberg group. And one can wonder: well, firstly, one could wonder what is the kernel of this, right? Because if you restrict to the kernel of this, then it will obviously be untwisted. So the kernel of this is a certain subgroup called the Chillingworth subgroup, which is smaller than the Torelli group. And well, and if you restrict to that subgroup, then you automatically get an untwisted representation. Untwisted representation. But we can actually do slightly better, so I won't talk about that. I'll talk about the full Torelli group. And the key property that allows us to do this is the fact that the Torelli group is exactly the subgroup of the mapping class group that acts by inner automorphisms on the Heisenberg group. Okay, so this is a proposition. We need to do some work to prove this. We need to do some work to prove this. It uses something about the structure of the automorphism group of the Heisenberg group. But what this means is that we can restrict the action map to a map from the Torelli group to the inner automorphism group of the Heisenberg group. That's its inner central extension. For any group, you have a central extension. It is a central extension of its inner automorphisms by its center. By its center, which in the case of the Heisenberg group is just Z. And then we can pull this back to get a central extension of the Torelli group. Again, in particular, in this pullback square, we get a lifted action map alpha tilde that associates an element of the Heisenberg group to every element of this central extension of the Torelli group. And then this is what allows. Is what allows us to do the untwisting. So the twisted representation that I already described, how to construct, gives us isomorphisms like this, not automorphisms, but isomorphisms between different modules. And then the point is that if your element of the Torelli group actually came from an element up here, then you can apply alpha tilde to it to get an element of the Heisenberg group. And from that, you can The Heisen-Boe group, and from that, you can cook up an isomorphism in the opposite direction. And then putting these together, you get an automorphism, and this gives you an untwisted representation. Okay, there are obviously some details you have to check, but this is the idea of the proof. So this means that on the central extension of the Sorreli group, you can untwist the representation. And then it turns out. And then it turns out, it's a lemma, that this central extension turns out to be trivial. So in fact, it has a section, and therefore we actually get a representation, an untwisted representation of the Torelli group itself. Okay, so this is the trick in the case of the Torelli group. And yeah, as I said, this works for this had nothing to do with the Heisenberg representation that we started. It's a Heisenberg representation that we started with, so it works for any of them. Okay, so the second untwisting trick works for users of Schrodinger representation, so I should recall what this is. So first, this depends on, or one way of describing it uses a different way of describing the Heisenberg group. So just described before. So it was described before by a certain presentation and it was described as a central extension. It also can be described as a semi-direct product of Z to the G plus one by Z to the G with these generators. And the only non-trivial action is that BI sends AI to AI plus 2 sigma. Okay, this should look quite a lot like the presentation that I put on the slides earlier. And then And then, analogously to this, there is a continuous version of the Heisenberg group, which is the same but using the reals instead of the integers. So, this is the semi-direct product of r to the g plus one by r to the g with the same action. So, first we restrict to this subgroup of the Heisenberg group. The Heisenberg group. So just the left-hand side, which is just R to the 2G, sorry, R to the G plus 1. We project this onto the one-dimensional subspace generated by sigma, and then just choose some one-dimensional unitary representation of this, which is just a map homomorphism to S1 given by e to the sum power, which is determined. Which depends on some fixed constant. In physics terminology, this h-bar is Planck's constant, but this has no meaning for the current talk. So yes, you can ignore that. So it's some one-dimensional unitary representation of R, which we then precompose by this suggestion. By this sujection. And then, just by induction, we get a unitary representation of the whole group. Just extend it by induction from the subgroup given by the left-hand factor of the semi-direct product. So this is the Schrodinger representation, which is a unitary representation on L2 of R to the G, where this R to the G should be thought of as the same as this R. Should be thought of as the same as this R. It's the other part of the group that you have to extend it to by induction. Okay, and then the key property that we need to use of this special representation is the Stone-von-Neumann theorem, or precisely a corollary of the Stone-Von-Neumann theorem, which says the following. So, for any automorphism of the continuous Heisenberg group, Continuous Heisenberg group. There's a unique inner automorphism of the unitary group of the Schrodinger of the Hilbert space underlying the Schrödinger representation, such that the following square commutes, where both the horizontal maps are the Schrödinger representation. Okay, so the Stonefun-Meumann theorem actually says something a bit different. It says that the Schrodinger representation is Schrodinger representation is irreducible, and that it's the unique irreducible representation that acts in a certain way when you restrict it to the center. But this, it's not too hard to then deduce this corollary from that statement, because if you pre-compose it by some automorphism of the continuous Heisenberg group, then that's a different representation, but it acts in the same way on the In the same way on the it's still irreducible, it acts the same way on the center, and so the uniqueness will provide you with this automorphism. Okay, and then so this is just I've just copied the same statement, and then using this we can do the following construction. So, what I the Stonefern-Neumann theorem is is what gives us this. Theorem is what gives us this. So it gives us a projective representation of the automorphism group of the continuous Heisenberg group called T. Well, this contains as a subgroup the automorphism group of the discrete Heisenberg group. We can precompose this by the action of the mapping class group. So overall, we have a projective representation of the mapping class group. Then the unitary group is a central extension of the projective unitary group by the circle. So let's fill that in. So this is a central extension by the circle. And then we can pull this back to get, sorry, no, we don't put it back, but we then consider the universal central extension of the mapping class group. And by universality, there's a unique covering morphism of central extension. Morphism of central extensions that covers this. Okay, and this gives us this alpha tilde. And this is exactly what, using exactly the same trick as in the previous, a couple of pages ago for the Torelli group, this is what allows us to untwist the representation if we define it on this universal central extension of the mapping class group. Okay, so this gives us then a us then a unitary infinite dimensional representation of the of this central extension of the mapping class group on uh on the borela homology of the surface with coefficients in this radio representation okay um and then finally there's um a much more recent trick that uh we discovered which uh turns out to just untwist the representation directly on a mapping class group with no need to restrict to a subgroup No need to restrict to a subgroup or pass to a central extension. So this uses the so-called tautological representation of the Heisenberg group. So this is now, this is actually now again much more elementary than the Schrodinger representation. So we just take the Heisenberg group and we recall that its underlying set can be thought of as z to the 2g plus 1, but with a twisted multiplication. But with a twisted multiplication given by this formula. But as a set, we'll identify it with z to the 2g plus 1. And then we give the same set the usual affine structure. So we consider it as a torsa over itself. And then the key observation is that left multiplication of the Heisenberg group on itself preserves the affine structure. Okay, if you If you endow it also with the affine structure, and so it means that we have this tautological representation, which just is defined by taking element of the Heisenberg group. It acts on itself by left multiplication, and then you just interpret that as an affine automorphism of the same set, but with the affine structure. And then any affine automorphism can be extended to a linear automorphism. Extended to a linear automorphism by adding one more direct sum Z. So this gives us a linear representation of the Heisenberg group on Z to the 2G plus 2. Okay, so this is the linearized tautological representation. And then a second observation is that any, so again, we put two different structures on the same set. So we consider the Heisenberg. Structures on the same set. So we consider the Heisenberg group, which as a set is Z to the 2G plus 1. We can also consider it in the obvious way as a free Z module. And then every orientation preserving automorphism of the Heisenberg group, if you consider the same self-bijection as a self-bijection of this as a free module, it preserves this structure. So it is an automorphism of this as a free module. So we get. So we get this homomorphism, which is really given literally by the identity, because you take an automorphism of the Heisenberg group and then consider the same, which is a bijection of its underlying set, and you consider the same bijection of this set as an automorphism of Z to the 2G plus 1. And then we can precompose it by the action of the mapping class group. So homomorphism from the mapping class group to aught of the isolation. To aught of the Eisenberg group, and then just include it by adding one more direct sum of Z. And this gives a homomorphism like this, which I should also call this alpha tilde, because it plays the same role as the alpha tildes that I had on the previous slides, in that this is what allows us to untwist the action. So it's just an easy comp. And it's just an easy computation, but this untwists the representation given by coefficients in this representation of the Heisenberg group, in the sense that it gives you canonical isomorphisms between this representation of the Heisenberg group and all of its twists by elements of the aught of the Heisenberg group. Okay, so this gives us. Okay, so this gives us an untwisted representation on the mapping class group itself over Z. This is all defined over Z. Okay, so in summary, what we constructed was for every integer, there's at least two, and for any given representation of the Heisenberg group, we obtain a representation of the Torelli group. Representation of the Turelli group. If W is a Schrodinger representation, then we also obtain a unitary representation of the universal central extension of the mapping class group. And then if it's this other representation, then we instead also get an untwisted representation of the full mapping class group. Okay, so this is now the precise, in a sense, this is the precise statement of the main. In a sense, this is the precise statement of the main theorem that earlier I just said we construct a new family of representations. This is the family of representations that we construct. Just a brief word about the module structure of these representations. It's very simple. In every case, it's just the representation v of w is just, as a module over r, it's just a finite direct sum of copies of w, which was the representation that we input, which isn't. Representation that we input, which is in particular an R module. Okay, so in particular, this one that's obtained from the linearized tautological representation is just a free Z module of this rank. Okay, so the next question, of course, is what is the kernel of this? The hope, of course, is that by carefully choosing W and K, we can find one that's faithful. One that's faithful. So, a first easier question is: is it at least smaller than the kernel of Moriyama's representations, which were those that you get if you just take trivial coefficients? So let's see. Let's now focus on the case k equals 2. So we just have configurations of two points. So the first observation is that there's a quotient of Is that there's a quotient of mapping class group representations going from this one where we take coefficients in the grouping of the Heisenberg group to this one where we take coefficients in the grouping of sigma 2, which is just induced by the there's a canonical projection of the Heisenberg group onto sigma 2, which is well one way of describing it is as written here. So your abelian eyes, that has a Z mod 2 factor and you That has a Z mod2 factor, and you project onto that Z mod2 factor. Equivalently, you just kill every generator except for sigma, which counts the writhe, and give that, make that have order two. And then the right-hand side by Shapiro's lemma is the same as the Moriyama representation for k equals two. And by Moriyama's theorem, this has kernel precisely J2, the second term of the Johnson filtration. And because we have, because And because we have, because this is a subjection, if something acts trivially upstairs, it has to act trivially downstairs. And so the kernel of our representation, well, our representation, the representation using the grouping of the Heisenberg group as coefficients must have, well, possibly smaller, possibly the same kernel as that of Moriyama. So it's contained in the second term of the Johnson filtration. And in fact, we can do slightly better. So we can prove that it's. Can do slightly better so we can prove that it's strictly smaller. So we can find an element of J2 where Moriyama's representation acts trivially because it's contained in J2 and where ours doesn't just by explicit computation. So specifically, we take a genus one subsurface of our surface and take its boundary. So that's a simple closed surface. So it's a simple closed surface, sorry, a simple closed curve that separates off a genus 1 subsurface. So Dane twists around any such curves always lie in J2. And then, well, we did some explicit calculations, which I'll show on the next slide, that shows that it acts non-trivially in our representation. Whereas, of course, it acts trivially in Moriam's representation. So the kernel is strictly smaller than JT. The kernel is strictly smaller than J2. So, this is at least a first step. Well, this means we can hope that it's much smaller and perhaps even trivial if we're optimistic. So finally, I just want to give the calculation. So, here I've just said it acts non-trivially, but I want to somehow convince you that it acts very non-trivially. So, I'll give the explicit calculation. So, let's now Now go to an even simpler case, so k is 2 and just look at the genus 1 surface with one boundary component, so the one-hold torus. So in this case, the representation that we're looking at is, as a module, it's free of rank 3 over the ground ring, which is a certain non-commutative polynomial ring in these three generators. Okay, so. Okay, so the answer will be some 3x3 matrix over this ground ring. And then take gamma to be a curve, well, to be the boundary, but pushed into the interior slightly. So this is a genus 1 separating twist. And then the Dane twist around this curve acts via this matrix. And you probably have to just believe me that these polynomials that are in the entries in the matrix are simplified as much as possible. This is the reduced form. possible. This is the reduced form of all of these polynomials. And a fun exercise to do is that if you set a equal to b equal to sigma squared equal to one, which is what corresponds to projecting onto Moriyama's representation, then this becomes the identity matrix, as we knew because we knew that his representation, that it acts trivially on his representation. But well, the fact that it acts in a very complicated way, there's hope. Very complicated way, there's hopefully evidence that the kernel is much smaller than the Johnson filtration. Okay, so well, this is just a summary of everything I've said so far, plus the outlook. So, well, the future questions that we're interested in are, of course, there's a linearity question which motivated this whole project. And well, this, in a sense, boils down. In a sense, boils down to studying these representations v of w that we construct for some well-chosen representation w of the Heisenberg group. And well-chosen perhaps is quite tricky to work out what the correct representation to choose is, but yeah, there are many possibilities. And the second question is whether these are representations of mapping class groups, so these are automorphisms in. So these are automorphisms in three-dimensional cobblestone categories. So one can ask whether these extend to TQFTs, as I mentioned at the beginning of the talk, to justify having cobordisms in the title. Okay, so well, that's it. So thank you for your attention. Great, thank you. Are there any questions for Martin? Yeah. Is it when K is bigger than two, is it possible to do any kind of computations of the kernel? Like in your W equals, do you join the Heisenberg group case? It's in principle, yes, it's in principle possible, but it takes a lot of work. I mean, there's a chapter. Of work. I mean, there's a chapter in our paper which is maybe at least 20 pages or so that just does this calculation that I showed for k equals 2. So for k equals 3, it just becomes very intricate. There's no, I think, in principle reason why one can't do it. But it becomes more and more difficult to do explicit computations. Also, possibly one could automate it, but yeah, this isn't something that we have looked into. This isn't something that we have looked into so much. Cool. Thank you. Any other question? If there's any question from the Zoom audience, just unmute yourself and ask. I would like to ask a question. Have you thought, Martin, of an ordered analogue of this Heisenberg group? So if you take the pure group, The the the pure group of of the surface and you force the the subgroup which is the pure group of of disk to be central you do you get you thought of something on this as because I asked because I mean as in Moriana's example taking order configuration Taking ordered configurations makes kernels smaller with respect to unordered, right? So if you take the unordered version of Moriano, for example, then J2x trivially no matter how many points you take. And so I wanted to yes, I don't know. I haven't thought about that. I don't know what the The what that quotient group would look like. Yes, I think I can't say something. Okay, I'll have to think about it more and then maybe we can talk more. I can't, yeah, I don't have something intelligent to say right now, but it sounds like an interesting idea. I have a question. I mean, you raise this interesting question, you're This is an interesting question. Can one possibly extend it to Tistre? But that would probably somehow mean you would have to do all your computations or your construction for sigma-g with many boundaries. Yes, so with many boundary components is not a problem. That would work the same. What is a problem is not quite so clear how to do it. It would be for closed surfaces. Be for closed surfaces because here we very much use the fact that we're fixing the boundary in order to even have the quotient onto the Heisenberg group. Well, I mean, that would be still quite interesting. I mean, some people call it sort of an open TQFT, I guess. If you could do it with a closed and some other Some other, yes. Um, Garam Siegel called it the um a non-compact version of the TQFT, but um, right, um, but it still would mean that you have to have the right gluing, yes, yes. So, uh, yes, this is sort of uh quite open at the moment, I think, how one could do this. One possibly similar result that I know of is for the Bavar representations. So those have been extended to a kind of TQFT in the sense that one has the tangle category where objects are finite oriented sets and morphisms are tangles between them in a cylinder. And so the automorphisms of that category are the braid groups, and there's a result of Chimersoni and Tokhaev, who extended the Bucha or presentations to this tangle category. So this is something slightly similar, but their construction depends very much on the fact that it's just the Bouhard representation that one is looking at. And there's no obvious way that their construction would work for configurations of more. Would work for configurations of more than one point. I mean, okay, not quite sure whether, yeah, see necessarily the analog, but I mean, this, well, sorry, I do see an analog, but I'm not quite sure whether it helps me thinking about this particular problem. I mean, in your construction, you also use the automorphism of free groups. Is that right? I mean, if one was going to take the automorphism groups, for example, Natalie's. Groups that, for example, naturally studied, where you sort of have loops that have to be fixed homotopically so that you can allow gluing. Is that something that might work? I mean, one would have to extend to a higher number of boundaries, right? Yes, so I don't know. But I mean, okay, so yeah, but I was maybe we're talking about different different slightly different things. I was talking about a two plus one dimensional TQFT. And is that what you're talking about? I was talking of what were I talking about? One plus one. So if yeah, if you have a one plus one TQFT, then you just have to glue surfaces together. just have to glue surfaces together. That probably is more reachable, I think. Yes, I was very optimistically saying something about a two plus one dimensional TQSD, but this is something that's probably more distant. Right. Yeah, that's for easy notes. I want to point out that there is a comment in the chat. Arthur Soulier says that, comment on Andre's suggestion, the problem is that you would kill the writhe, the generator sigma, if you take an analog using pure braid groups. And that's an important generator in this construction. That's comment. All right. Are there any other questions for Martin? Either on Zoom or here? Ah. Andrea is answering. Arthur? He says that, yes, you would only have the square of sigma. Yes, you would only have the square of sigma. Okay, so I guess Andrea's point is that the square of sigma still has infinite order, so this would still be not so bad. Right. Okay. Well, if there are no further questions, let's thank Martin. Martin again. Thank you very much.
