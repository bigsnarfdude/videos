Perfect. Okay. So let us resume, well, resume the workshop and let me introduce the first speaker of the first session of this workshop. And let me say this is an honor and a pleasure for me to introduce. And a pleasure for me to introduce Alexio Figali that needs certainly no introduction and will talk to us about the singular set in the Stefan problem. Just let me, before Alexi begins, let me tell you that since the conference are short, we would prefer to have the questions at the end, but it depends on the will of the speaker, of course. And you can either You can either unmute yourself at the end of the chat, or at the end of the talk, or write in the chat and raise the hand and we will allow you to speak. So please, Alessio. Okay, so thank you so much, Mateo. Thanks to organizers for inviting me to this workshop. I guess all of us would have been super happy to be now in Mexico to enjoy the workshop in presence, but unfortunately, that's not possible. Unfortunately, that's not possible. Still, it's great to see so many friends all together here. And thanks a lot also for giving me the opportunity to open this workshop. So as Mateo said, probably, if there is something maybe specific, so if during my talk you see that something is not clear, then please feel free either to interrupt or maybe the easiest is that you write in the chat, I will check it. I will check it. Otherwise, probably, yeah, as you say, for the sake of time, it's better if technical questions are left to the end. But please interrupt me if I say something wrong or unclear. So what I would like to do is very briefly to show you a recent result that we obtained with Chaviro Soton and Joquin Serra about the Stefan problem. So let me just explain what this is. So this is a very old problem that actually was A very old problem that actually was described first by Damien Claperon well before Stefan, and which is about understanding essentially a very natural problem in phase transition where you just have ice melt into water. And essentially, you want to understand the evolution of this as time goes by. So let me just put myself in the easiest possible setting. So I have a nice domain, let's say a very small domain here in, well, this is like a fixed time. Fixed time. My container here is a cylinder, whatever, a smooth domain. Cylinder probably is not very smooth. But let's say a nice domain, it doesn't matter. You have water and ice inside this domain. You prescribe some boundary condition for the temperature. So on the boundary of your cylinder, you prescribe the value of the temperature of the water on the boundary. So by definition of water, water is non-negative temperature. Water, water has no negative temperature, and you want to understand the evolution of this melting of ice in water as time goes by. So, this is actually what's called the one-phase Stefan problem. So, it's the simplest possible problem you can think of, where essentially you only have one phase because you assume in a simplified model that ice has constant temperature equal to zero. Equal to zero. Okay, so there is no negative temperature here. So ice is the region where temperature is identically zero. Water is the region where the temperature is positive. And you have the temperature of the water evolving in time. And the way it evolves is through this very standard heat equation. Easy. But there is a very interesting boundary condition. So at the Condition. So at the free boundary here, so let's say in the region on the interface, let's say here, when you are at the interface between ice and water, what happens is that you take a point here on the free boundary, you call it x, and this free boundary point will move at a velocity which is given by the negative gradient of theta at the same point. So just to explain, you have to think in this way, right? have to think in this way right so uh theta so here theta is zero here theta is positive okay so in the left here it's ice here is the water you come you look at the temperature in the in the positive region you compute here the gradient of theta and then you just flip it negative you take the opposite of it and that's your velocity so you see that the velocity is gonna is always gonna be Is gonna be inward, so it's always gonna point inside the region t equals zero. So the ice is melting, which of course is what you expect if the temperature is non-negative. The only thing that can happen is that melting phenomenon. So there is no freezing phenomenon in this model, except because of theta being at most zero. There is no negative temperature. So, how this is connected to the Stefan problem? Sorry, this is actually how this is connected to the obstacle problem. Is actually how this is connected to the obstacle problem. So, um, there is a very classical trick to go from this kind of complicated formulation because model is a sort of system, right? Because you have the heat equation plus the boundary condition with this ODE to a single PD. So, this is what is called Bayocchi or Duveaux transformation. My experience is that the French call it Biocchi and the Italian call it Duveaux, which is a kind of unusual, let's say, Let's say, situation where they always each of them gives credit to the other. At least this was my experience when I spoke with some people. But so there's a nice, let's say, joint Italian-French work where you take theta and you integrate theta in time. So you just take the integral from zero to t of theta. You call u the new variable. And then you see, of course, so theta is non-negative. So u will be non-negative. negative and actually by this relation dtu is simply theta itself so dtu is non-negative so u is a non-negative function which is also increasing in time and then you have to work a bit to show that everything all the pd can be written as a single so the system that we saw below which was hit the question plus the ode on the free boundary can be written in a single piece Can be written in a single PD, which is that dtu minus Laplacian of U in the sense of distribution is minus the characteristic of u positive. What does this mean? So you see the characteristic of u positive, what is this? This is the function, sorry, this is the function which is one if u is positive and zero if u is zero. Okay, so where u is positive, like here in the water. Right here in the water, you will have dtu minus Laplacian U equals minus one. Right, this is in the region u post. Where u is zero, well, of course, the equation would be dtu minus Laplace U equals zero, but okay, u is zero is more than saying that the eat operator is zero, is a stronger condition. So when you is zero, u is zero. But there is a hidden condition on the free boundary, which is greater than to u is zero. Which is greater than to view zero. To understand this, you should look at this P D in the sense of distribution, and you are telling here that dtu minus Laplacian of U is L infinity. So in particular, this P D implies this regularity, right? Because the characteristic function is a bounded function. And maybe I should use a smaller one. And this implies that u, I hope you read it well, is by Is by parabolic regularity, this implies that u is c1 in space. So eat the operator bounded implies u is c1. Okay, but then you see that tru is a non-negative function, which vanishes on the on the ice. But then if you have a c1 function which is non-negative, the gradient is going to be zero where u is zero. Just gradient zero at the minimum point. So in particular, on the free boundary, So in particular on the free boundary, you will have this grain U condition. So you see before for theta, there was an angle created here because theta was not C1 in space. But now U is C1 in space, so the gradient, U has to go with zero gradient. And now you see that this is an overdetermined problem because on the free boundary here, what I'm saying is that U is zero, but also the Neumann derivative is zero. Neumann derivative is zero. So, this is a I'm having both Dirichlet boundary conditions on the free boundary. And the fact that it's overdetermined is what is implicitly, let's say, forcing the free boundary to evolve in some suitable way. So when you look at this PD, you may wonder, okay, but where is the evolution of the free boundary? I don't see it in the PD. Well, it's hidden. So what it's telling us is that the free boundary should evolve in such a way. Free boundary should evolve in such a way that at every time u satisfies both norm and individual boundary conditions on the free boundary. So it's an implicit evolution. Okay, now existence uniqueness is not complicated because this is like a nice actually monotone operator. So there are like abstract theorems to prove existence. There is nothing super complicated. The real question is regularity. So the real question, first of all, is the regularity of you. Question: First of all, is the regularity of u and then the regularity of the free boundary. So, regularity of u is known. This is the optimal regularity. Okay, so this is the answer to question one. So, u is c1 in time and c11 in space. Okay, so you see, so u t is continuous, while the action of you in space is bounded, but bounded but let's say but not continuous and this is really the best you can have right because notice that you have the equation ut minus Laplacian of U which is not continuous because it's the characteristic of a function which jumps so this ut minus Laplacian u we saw it here is minus the characteristic so it jumps between zero and one so because the it operator is not continuous Operator is not continuous, but ut is continuous, the Laplacian has to be discontinuous, and so the S has to be discontinuous. But to the free boundary, there are actually two fundamental results. The first one is Kindle and Nirenberg. They proved that essentially this is what I'm saying, there are intersection between different papers because some papers are, I mean, there have been a lot of work on obstacle problems, sometimes they're parabolic, sometimes they're elliptic. They're parabolic, sometimes they're elliptic, but they're really well dealing with both of them. So, one theorem of Kinder and Nirenberg essentially shows that if you are C1, you are C infinity. So, it's like a Schauder type regularity. Once you have a bit of regularity, then you get super smooth. But then, of course, when are you C1? And we'll see in a second what I mean by C1. So, Caffarelli in a fundamental paper in 77. Caffarelli in a fundamental paper in 77 understood the free boundary and showed that the free boundary C1 up to singular points to be defined. So let me explain. So what Caffarelli did was the following. Let's say that, so I am in space-time, this is a parabolic problem, right? So this is in Rn cross R. So you take a free boundary point and then you rescale your solution. Sorry, it should have been in the other way. So it's more R. Other way, so it's more r cross rn with my notation. You take your solution, you rescale it in the following way. So you rescale parabolically here. You see time and space with an R, but then you divide by R square. And this is actually the scaling that makes the PD invariant. So if U is a solution, U solution of our problem, then also U R is a solution. UR is a solution. You can check that the PB is invariant under the scaling. So you have a family of solutions to the same problem. You rescale and you look at what they do under the scaling. And then you look at what are called blobs. Blobs are all the possible limits of these functions as r goes to zero. And the goal is classifying these blobs. So the difficulty is very easy to prove that blobs exist. The question is how they look like. So we say that. So we say that a free boundary point is a regular point if, when you rescale your solution under this scaling, in the limit, you get a very simple solution. It's a 1D solution, so it depends only on one variable, and it behaves like this. So it's a half-pay solution. So it's zero on a half-space, and then it's a half parabola on the remaining half space. So this is really what you expect to see. This is really what you expect to see. So, if you imagine that your free boundary was a super nice upper surface, so let's say this is your free boundary in space-time. This is time and this is space. And you have an upper surface like this. So, this is the free boundary. So, it means that here on this side, you were zero, and on the other side, you was positive, and you do. Was positive, and you do you perform this parabolic rescaling that I wrote. Then, in the limit, you expect to see this. So, because you see here I'm scaling with R squared and here I'm scaling with R, what happens when you rescale in the limit, oops, in the limit, you will get a vertical hyperplane, and you will be zero here, and you will be positive here. So, this is what you expect to see when. So, this is what you expect to see when you do that rescaling around a very smooth upper surface. The upper surface tilts and becomes vertical in space-time because of this different scaling, R square versus R. So the upper surface tilts. Then in the limit, you get this. So regular points are the points where when I blow up, I will see what I expect to see if I'm smooth. In some sense, that's the way you can think of it. But there are also other points which are. But there are also other points, which are called singular points, which is the following. So your free boundary gets smaller and smaller. So this would be like imagine of a block of ice. So a certain time t, this is u equals zero. And then time passes and the ice keeps becoming thinner and thinner. And then in the limit, perhaps the two fronts merge. So the ice gets thinner and thinner. So the ice was gets tiny and at some moment they merge. So they could merge all together, or maybe they merge where they first touch at one point, and here there is still a bit of ice. And this is what you call a singular point. And essentially, if you look what the blow-up should look like in this case, the blow-up will be like a polynomial, an elliptic polynomial, so no time dependence again. So it will be static in time. So it will be static in time, again, because of the scaling space-time. And it will satisfy a non-negative here. This is because u is non-negative. This is just a reflection that u is non-negative. And then this trace of A equal one comes from the fact that the dt UR minus Laplacian of UR was the characteristic of minus characteristic of UR positive. If you pass to the limit here, this will disappear. There is no time. Uh, this will disappear, there is no time in the limit, and from this condition, you get so ur will converge to p2. And then, if you impose that p2 satisfies this, you discover trace equal one. So, the pd tells you that the trace is one. So, this is another possible solution. So, just to give you an example, you could have in 3D, you could have pictures of this kind. So, you see here, this picture is like two fronts of our. This picture is like two fronts of ice, so like a very, so use the two fronts, like two slabs, two upper planes that get closer and closer as ice melts and then they touch. And they touch perhaps along a line. So it's really like a thick block of ice into the. Or perhaps the block of ice looked, maybe the block of ice looks something like this, like cylindrical. And then as it shrinks and shrinks in the limit, you get Shrinks and shrinks in the limit, you get something like this. Okay, so the ice could be a cylinder, or the ice could be, let's say, a slab. And in this, you have two different pictures. Of course, in higher dimension, it's more complicated, but let's say at least in 3D, this is what you expect to see. And what did Caffarelli prove in 77? So, Caffarelli proved a fantastic result, which tells that one of these two alternatives is old. Either you have a regular point, You have a regular point, in which case the free boundary is actually analytic in a neighborhood. And so that's option one. So it's something like this in the picture. So it's like a nice situation where you have on the left, you have ice, on the right, you have water, and then everything is super nice and smooth. So that's what you expect to, that's what you have. So if you have a regular point, which just means that one blow up was a half-space solution, as I told you. Half space solution, as I told you before, then you are analytic in a neighborhood. Or you have a singular point, in which case the free boundary in a parabolic cylinder, QR as the parabolic cylinder, it's very close to hyperplane. Okay, so there is, so if you think in a parabolic scaling, let's say again, this is X and this is T, this is our square, this is of size R. And what I'm saying. And what I'm saying is that let's say if this is 0, 0, the free boundary will all live here in something which is little over, very thin. So, this is one of the two alternatives. And that was the result of Carfarel in 77 with an improvement in 98. So, I will not enter too much in what it will do with exactly, but that's the statement you get by putting the two theorems together. Now, what I want to understand are singular points. So regular points are fine, they're analytic, they're beautiful. What about singular points? Okay, these points where the ice is melting. So, these are the points where there is a change in topology. You see, it's the points where maybe your ice was looking like a cylinder, it melts, then you see there is this. Melts, then you see there is this shrinking point, and then perhaps if the ice was like this, then immediately after it will look like this. So, from something connected, like a cylinder, there is this point, and then there is a separation, just to give you a sense. So, let's call sigma the singular points, and sigma t the singular points at time t. The singular points at time t. Okay, so the set of singular points is simply the union over t of all these singular sets for every time. So what can you say about these singular points? So in 98, Caffarelli in the parabol in the elliptic case, then Blanché in the parabolic case, and then also Lingren and Mono in the parabolic case studied the bit these points. And let's say what everything is what's What everything is what's contained in this paper is that for every t, sigma t is contained in an n minus one dimensional manifold. Okay, so let's just do some numerology. So you fix time, okay? So t is fixed. Then you are in a run. So you are there, you are, you live in a run. Let's say that this is my u equals zero. Okay? So u. Okay, so u equals zero is n-dimensional. N-dimensional. So the boundary of u equals zero, even for a smooth set, will be n minus one dimensional. Okay. And then what I'm telling you is that sigma t is n minus one dimensional. Okay. So at t fixed, the set of singular points can be as large as the set of regular points. As the set of regular points. Okay? So the dimension is exactly the same as the wall-free boundary. The wall-free boundary is n minus one-dimensional. And I can just draw a picture to show you. Again, it could be this. Imagine that u equals zero is this. So u equals zero, here u equals zero on this line, and then u equals zero. Then you see that sorry, then these points are regular. Sorry, then these points are regular. This part is all regular. This part is all regular, but then this part is singular. Okay, so I have a line of regular points, and then a line of singular points, a line of regular points. So the dimension is exactly the same. Okay, and this is so this is optimal, this n minus one, and then. And then what also they proved is that if you look it as a manifold, so sigma t is a subset of Rn plus one, space-time. If you look this set as a subset of Rn plus one, there is some regularity in space-time. It is C1 in space and older in time. Okay, so the regularity, if you look at it kind of as a graph in space-time, you have this kind of regularity. I will not enter now in the exact definition. Will not enter now in the exact definition, but the intuition is that if you think there's a graph in space-time, you have a nice C1 regulating space, but then only all the regularity in time. Okay, so now the question we ask is, okay, but so for T fixed, the set of singular points is as large as the set of regular points. There is no improvement. What about if I look at it in the world space-time variable, right? So, because what I'm drawing here is a fixed time, okay? Sorry. Okay, so this is for time fixed. But after, for instance, if you start to keep, if you let the ice melt, it's not clear that you will still see singular points. So you see the singular points, the fact that they exist is a dynamic process. They exist, then they disappear because the ice has melted and so on. So it's not clear how often you can see such a picture. So the question that Newman asks is: okay, but if Question that Newman asks is: okay, but if I look at the world set of singular points, how large is it? This was, if you look at, if you apply this theorem and you, of course, you define Ausdoff dimension using the parabolic distance, because that's the right distance to measure dimensional sets. When you are in parabolic scaling, you should use the parabolic outdoor dimension. So it's just you have to use this distance, the parabolic distance. Have to use this distance, the parabolic distance in your space. So, under this distance, the bolts are the parabolic cylinders. Then, the parabolic dimension of sigma will be bounded by n plus one half. So it's a rather large set, actually. In particular, well, it could be larger than the set of all regular points. And what we proved instead with Chaviro, Souton, and Joaquin Sera is that the parabolic dimension of sigma reality is M and Parabolic dimension of sigma reality is m minus one. So this is optimal because I told you that for a fixed time you can have m minus one. So it's enough to take one slice for a fixed time. You already get this bound. And what I'm telling you is that even if you put together all the possible sigma t, you cannot increase the dimension. It remains n minus one, which means in reality that this n minus one dimensional set cannot appear. Set cannot appear very often. If you see n minus one, you can do it only for very few times. For most of the times, the singular set has to be much smaller, because otherwise, if you take an n minus one dimensional set and you stack it up for many times, you will get a much larger set. So actually, for most times, you expect to see something smaller. So this is the first thing. What else? So we studied the structure of SIMA. So here I will state two bit technical things. Will state two bit technical theorems just to explain you what happens. So, okay, now it enters a super, let's say, technical stratification, but I will just mention you two parts which I think are interesting, more the more interesting ones, at least from a geometric perspective. So the first thing you see you can prove is that if you take the wall-free boundary and you remove a set of dimension n minus two. Set of dimension n minus two, then you have a synthetic expansion for your solution around a free boundary point. So what I'm telling you is that around most points, you have a synthetic expansion. What does this mean? This means the following. So I will draw the 2D picture. I'm trying to draw a 2D picture. So what this expansion tells you is the following. So V plus and V minus are two positive. plus and b minus are two positive numbers that tell you that let's so if let's say i'm in i draw um let's say 2d and then i i you have to think of time so this will be u equals zero and here i have this is a block of ice in two dimensions so the right part the right part here will move inside with the velocity p plus and the left part here will move inside with velocity p minus. Move inside this velocity P minus. So my three boundaries will keep shrinking and then eventually it will actually reach here. Actually, I should have, yeah, this my last picture is not correct. It should really be, you should think of it as super, super flat. So really like this. So when the two fronts meet, so they have these two velocities, V plus and V minus, V plus from the right and V minus. Minus, B plus from the right and B minus from the left. They meet at some moment. And then what I'm telling you is that on these two sides, here and here, I have a symphony expansion from U here on the right and a symphony expansion of U from the left. One, this is the symphony, well, it's a CK expansion for every K. So this is the expansion of U from the right, and this is the Taylor expansion of U from the left. Taylor expansion view from the left. So, if you look at it in space-time, you should think of this like this. So, this is the time, this is the space. Let's say this is my 0, 0. This is the ice. So, this is in the past. Now, I'm drawing one dimension less. So, for each time, this is the slice. So, there is ice, less ice, less ice, they merge. And then I'm telling you that I have in reality a sinfinite expansion. I have in reality a sinfinite expansion here. So u is infinity here in space-time. And same thing here, to the left and to the right. So it's like you have these two fronts meeting. To the left, you is infinity, to the right, you see infinity, which is not so. So in 1D, this is obvious. In 1D, this is obvious because in 1D, you see, if I was exactly in 1D, like in this last picture, the right and the left don't see each other. Don't see each other. I have a PD on the right, I have a PD on the left, and until the two transmit, they just solve independently a PD. So you cannot see what happens on the other side if you are in one dimension, because a segment is going to disconnect, right? So what happens here doesn't see what happens here in one dimension, just because there is the ice in between. It's an interval. In higher dimension, like here, okay, in my picture, I draw a picture like... Okay, in my picture, I draw a picture like the right and the left don't see each other, but in reality, you see, I mean, the eyes and the two fronts can see each other because it's not that, so this is closed up. I mean, somewhere it will be like this in reality. So what happens here, let's say here, is not independent of what happens here, because still is a PD that can go around, okay, the ice. Okay, the eyes still in a posteriority behaves as if the two fronts don't see each other. That's the beauty. So you really have a symphony expansion around most three boundary points. Not all of them, most of them, up to a codimension two sets. Instead, there could also be other points, just to show you that the picture is kind of delicate. There are points in the complement of this sigma infinity, I will call this set sigma prime, where u prime where u so here i'm telling that u is c2 in space and here i'm telling that u is not c21 plus epsilon in space nor in time so there are points so there are points where u is infinity but there are points where u is situ and not better what are these points these points are the points where the free boundary looks like a cylinder so now i am in 3d So now I am in 3D, n equals 3. So here you have to think. So before the picture I drew was two-dimensional. I was in the plane. Here I am in 3D. So the free boundary is like a cylinder in 3D. So here, because a cylinder doesn't disconnect at all in three-dimensional, I can circle it around. So what happens here and what happens around a cylinder, it's very much influenced. So while in a slab, So while in a slab what happens to the left and the right are very weakly influenced from each other, because you know a slab separates very well, right and left, a very thin cylinder in three dimension doesn't separate anything. It's all connected. And so this fact that I can see all around actually creates very bad singularities in the solution. And this is what happens at a lot of points also. Still n minus two dimension. So you need to play with all of them. I will skip. So, you need to play with all of them. I will skip the next slide because it will take too much. But let's say you have a very precise understanding, and the moment you have understanding, you can say something about the free boundary. That's the philosophy. If you have a very precise understanding of the solution, you can get a very precise understanding of how the free boundary is behaving. And then, this is what we can prove. First of all, sigma infinity, which is this big set where you have a dispansion, is covered by synfinity manifolds. Symphony manifolds. So it's a synfinity manifold in space-time. Okay, remember the manifold of Caffarelli, Blanchet, and then also Monot and Niger was C1 in space, C01 alpha in time. What we're telling you is that in reality, C infinity up to a very small set. In addition, if you see, if you look at the projection in time, so if you take, let's say, this is again X. Let's say this is again X and this is T, and you look at the set of singular points sigma in space-time, and you look how often. So, okay, this is probably too large. You look for maybe sigma is actually a very, okay, maybe this is too much. I should have said, I take the free boundary. So, first I draw the free boundary here. So, this is boundary view positive. And then inside the free boundary, I ask myself, okay, where are the singular points? Okay, where are the singular points? And then I look at the projection of them in time. So, for which t I see singular points, what this theorem is telling us is that, okay, sigma infinity project in time to a set of dimension zero, which means essentially it's very, very difficult for you to see points in sigma infinity. For most times, you will never see them. Instead, Instead, for sigma prime, sigma prime is the set of points where I didn't have this C21 plus epsilon expansion. Even if sigma prime is much smaller than sigma infinity, so sigma infinity is n minus one dimension, sigma prime is n minus two dimensional. So it's a two-dimensional two set. Still, in time, I see it more often. So I will see more often in time points belonging to sigma prime. belonging to sigma prime. And finally, for almost every t, if you look at the dimension of sigma t, in reality will be n minus 4. So this is really, I think, the result you wanted to see in some sense, because what I told you is that if you fix the time, the set of singular points can be as large as the work-free boundary. What I'm telling you is that in reality, for almost every time, the set of singular points has co-dimension three inside the set of the full-free boundary. So in very Inside the set of the full-free boundary. So, in reality, the singular points are very rare. It's just that for some t's you can see them, but they will appear very, not very often. In particular, if you are in dimension 2 and 3, which are kind of the two physical dimensions, then we get this bound on the singular types. So this is 0 for n equal 2 and 1 half for n equal 3. So, this tells you, in particular, that for most times there are no. You know, most times there are no singular points, which means that when you look at the Stefan problem in dimension two or three, for almost every time, you have an analytic free boundary. So you will have an analytic evolution, then perhaps some singular times, analytic evolution, singular times, and the set of singular time is very small. Okay, I think actually I passed my time, so I will stop here. And I thank you for your attention. I think that you covered the question time. So I think that there is room for one quick question and then maybe there is discussion time after this session, during the coffee break. I don't see any hand. Any other okay, so if there is no questions, I think we should thank Alessio again for his amazing talk.
